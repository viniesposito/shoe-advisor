Awards yeah big Awards best in gear get it yeah all right and before we get going let's give a little shout out to our sponsor element yeah so we love element we use it all through the summer it's great for getting an extra electrolytes and that sodium that you need and now in the winter they have a hot version a chocolate medley if you will there's chocolate raspberry chocolate mint and chocolate chai and I have to say I was a little skeptical but last night right before went to bed I wanted something sweet and stuff and I was like oh you know I'll give it a try so I did the chocolate chai with 14 o of water and 2 oz of milk and I have to say it was a nice little tddy before hitting the pillows there yeah and they actually have all sorts of recipes you can make with these you can put them in your coffee your hot cocoa whatever kind of Beverage you want and if if you want to try some go to drink element.com thedrop and you can get a free sample [Music] pack all right so we're going to start with the best of the best race day shoes we're going to start with our runner up and then go to our number one pick runner up this year was the A6 meta speed Sky Sledge Paris yes and I have to say I ran in both of them and I like them both for different reasons but this was a phenomenal race stue I don't know I might have actually like this one more than our top pick yeah so I feel like the updates from the previous version were really great in this shoe they kept it so light they softened up this foam a little bit and I just feel like the updates were really really nice yeah I had some good es in these shoes so let's move on to the top pick me for those of you who know me won't be much of a surprise the Nike alphafly 3 what brought this shoe back for you B so I was in love with the original alphafly one version two was pretty much a big flop for me it just they took the fun the bounce out of it and then this version came back and it felt like they mesh together the vaporfly and the original alphafly one and it's just a really fun light shoe the fun is what I really get out of the shoe when I had workouts or was doing faster Pace stuff throwing on the shoe gave you that little bit of extra confidence when you got out there you felt that pop some people still miss that like decoupled feeling but I think this is a pretty good evolution of the shoe I'm excited to see how this line continues in the future hopefully we won't do any back steps like we did with the alphafly 2 yeah I'm hoping it's all positive from here but again this shoe it's just it's comfortable it's light it's bouncy you've got an air pood in the forefoot to give you some extra pop and it just feels really good especially in those later miles of a marathon when you need that little extra oomph yeah the big surprise for me was this was actually lighter than the original and gets down for my size 10 and a half under 8 O so it in the sevens for a size 10 and 1 12 which is pretty incredible with all this Tech the plate the air bubbles everything going into this shoe they really kept it light yeah so for every race in 2024 that I had the any option of Sho I wanted to wear this one was on my feet all right all right M so there's kind of a new category that's like I don't want to call it the slower marathoners Marathon sh but it's certainly tamed like down a little bit from those tip of the spear Elite running racing shoes and we're calling them beginner Racing shoes yeah I think these are shoes that for someone who is new to running or new to carbon plated shoes these feel very friendly to your foot I would agree with that they don't feel as foreign as maybe the race shoes are a little more accessible so let's start with the runner up what do we got here that is the Solomon slab Spectre yeah we all love this shoe and as a matter of fact for us this was something that we liked using for like daily miles just cuz it has that nice Snappy feel with the premium foam carbon fiber plate it just felt great has a very stable heel and that's one of the things that they talk about about for somebody who's going to be out there for longer than 3 hours and 30 minutes or 4 hours this is one of those shoes that's going to have a little more structure so that while you're out there for a long time it helps keep your form together yeah and Solomon even said in designing the shoe it was exactly for that it was for the person who's going to be out there longer than 3 hours and 30 minutes and so you just get a comfortable shoe but you also get those properties of a race St shoe so you do get that nice bounce but in a more structure supportive build so what's the shoe that we always recommend to people right now for a race day if they're like you know I'm not sure what I want I need something that kind of is familiar and kind of like not so aggressive maybe a little more stable yeah always the New Balance SC Elite V4 this shoe I ran the New York City marathon in this year actually this exact pair it seems pretty clean for that maybe it wasn't this exact pair okay um and it's just it's so nice because you do get that carbon fiber plate and you do get that really nice bounce but the foam this fuel cell foam that they're using is soft and and responsive but it gives and so you feel like in those later miles you still have a really comfortable shoe on yeah and this shoe having a wider platform kind of made it feel a little bit more forgiving especially when your form was breaking down towards the end of that Marathon or or something like that it just felt a little more I don't know just forgiving is the word I would use forgiving is a good word and then also this upper while it does feel race like it also provides some decent structure and support so you feel like you get a nice lock down and just more of the daily trainer Vibes that I think someone going out for their first marathon will feel very comfortable with all right the next one is one of my favorites it's kind of newish as of last year these are the top Super trainers all right our first pick might be a little controversial our runner up and that's why it's our runner up and not in first first place cuz it's really intended to be a race day shoe we all loved it for a super trainer and what we mean by super trainer is a shoe that you can use for daily training miles but has all the components that you love in the new shoes like plates Foams all the top like technology but in a shoe you can wear every day all right so the shoe you're talking about is the Hoka coo X1 yeah we were kind of like kind of weirded out by this shoe when we first got it cuz they were like this is our premium race day shoe and we tried it and we're like no it was a little heavy the upper was a little bizarre and the lacing on it was nuts yeah so all of those things kind of took it out of the race day category for us and put it into that daily trainer super trainer just because while it does have these amazing qualities and feels really fun out on the roads it's a little heavy it just it it's a little um not racy and so we just found it was more fun just to go out and do daily training in it as a matter of fact it's probably my favorite shoe to get miles in this past year I just used it for just about everything for a while I I spent so much time in this shoe around what was that February or when we got it trials yeah it was hard to get this off my feet to go on to review the next shoe it just felt great my legs felt great afterwards it's fun when you did want to pick it up it could pick it up it did not feel that bad when you were doing easy slower miles so it I just loved this shoe and the rocker in it was I just thought great yeah so for us really great super trainer one of the drawbacks to it being considered a super trainer is the price tag it was 275 which it's pretty high up there but I felt like I ran a lot of miles in this shoe and it held up really well yeah I think unlike a lot of race day shoes this is very durable you get tons of rubber on the outsole so you probably can get hundreds and hundreds of miles out of it yeah we're looking forward to the next version of this which drops some weight and might move it up into the race day category all right our top super trainer Cay in hot real late the Nike zoomfly 6 what was really surprising about this one is I've hated every other version of the zoom uh Zoom fly yeah but they made a bunch of updates to this one you have some zoomx underfoot you've got a carbon fiber plate and it's just a really nice update yeah it fits nice and the immediate thing I noticed this feels like like a training companion to the alphafly so it was like really familiar on your foot if you've run in the alphafly 3 you put this on and I was running it I was like oh this is what you should be using on the daily basis so that when you go to race in the alpal fly you have that familiar feel now the other thing I liked about this shoe with the carbon plate and a little bit of zoomx in here was that you probably could use this for a race day shoe as well and a lot of the shoes that are super trainers you can yeah and so while it does have those daily trainer quality so the upper is nice and structured you have a lot of padding around the collar it does have some of those race day feels underfoot um it is a little heavier and it's definitely very durable so I I do think it sticks into that super trainer category but again if you did want to take it on race day you probably could all right M so we're moving into daily trainers and our first runner up is the New Balance Rebel V4 this is a little controversial too because really this is sort of an uptempo trainer they would call but for us we use it more like a daily trainer and one of the reasons we love it is you can pick up the pace in it yeah so it is really nice and light you have this version of fuel cell that's bouncy um but it also feels great for easy miles so while yes you can use this for workouts because it is so light and Nimble I found it was really nice for just getting out on the road and doing some easy miles I love the look of it as well I I think it was one of the best looking shoes of this year the other thing that I'm really excited about is we've seen the V5 coming out next year and some of the things that we critiqued about the shoe being a little bit thin on the forefoot is going to be remedied I think it's going to even move more into that daily training space but still be fun and quick under the feet our top pick of daily trainers of 2024 is the Puma DV8 Nitro 3 all right May what do we love about this shoe so I think what I loved about this shoe was it's great for everything so yes great for daily mileage just going out and having a nice but also there's a plate in here you can pick it up the foam is nice and responsive it just it's a comfortable shoe uh and can do pretty much everything what I love about it it's sort of that traditional trainer like a it doesn't feel far out there or like wild like new but all the components and the ingredients in the shoe make it super fun so you have this uh Nitro foam that they've got on the bottom that's bouncy and responsive and really holds up really well you were talking about the power plate gives it that Snappy feeling it's not so aggressive that you can't use it every day so it still has some Flex in it and then you've got that Puma grip that we've love for keeping great traction out on the street and this upper I thought it looked nice it fit well it we were running in this in the summer it breathed well it's just a well executed shoe and I felt like when someone came to me and they're like hey I want to try something a little spicier than like your average daily trainer this was the one I was like you said get the one with Nitro written on the side get this one spicy and it is spicy it's a little spicier than say like your standard daily trainer with just an EVA foam or something like that yeah and I love a daily trainer that if you're having a good day and you're feeling good and you want to pick it up this the shoe works so I think that's a that's a top pick that's the spice Puma got the top pick for daily trainer we're into the max this is really your specialty I don't know anybody who loves Max cushioning more than you so these are your picks yeah so runner up is the Puma mag Max this is Puma's latest Max cushion shoe we didn't even know it was coming out when it was coming out this year so it surprise showed up in our front door and it was a very exciting one it's got tons of Stack but it's this nice Nitro foam so not only do you get this giant slab of foam underfoot but it's actually quite responsive and really fun to run in what I really like about the Puma shoes this year they really nailed the uppers it's a big improvement over the past years they've got much better fitting ERS the knit tongue the knit Tong stret but over this much stack I felt your foot was really locked in nicely it's actually the sidewalls actually come up over the side so you're actually in kind of a Groove so even though you're higher and it's really cushioned it's not unstable the shoe felt really nice well on top of that you have this very very wide base of the shoe so you get plenty of stability just from all the ground contact um so while you are sitting on a on a giant slab of foam it does feel very stable and again this goes back to just being really fun to run in we have this amazing Puma grip so that all of our miles are very tractiony and fun again we got this shoe in some warmer weather yeah how how the upper breathe the upper was fine it was you know it it is pretty substantial and that you have a lot of support but it it breathed just fine plus you got to love the hidden details bouncy AF a lot of controversy about what the AF what AF stands for okay all right moving on to our top pick of Max cushion shoes this one shocked me shocked me to the core give me that side Brooks Glycerin Max okay this foam was the trick yeah it has a dual density super critical foam all blown up at once we got to see it in like Puck form before they explode it yeah and it turns into this and it's really neat there's no glue there's no adhesive it's all all chemically bonded together and the feeling was different yeah it's a very soft comfortable yet bouncy ride and it just feels great and they've paired it with this this pretty simple mesh upper but there's lots of padding around the tongue and collar so it's very comfortable on steep in and it's just a lovely Max cushion shoe and I can't believe I'm saying this like Brooks typically their designs aren't my favorite it's a good looking shoe this is a great looking shoe and I've seen some of the stuff that's coming out for 2025 they're continuing that look I feeling it could be brookser next year not 100% certain yet but the look they're going up with some new Foams it's going to be a good one but about this shoe what I really loved about this Max cushion was that dual density foam I kind of felt like when you land you get that squish down that you're looking for in a Max cush shoe but then the rebound the bounce and the stability of this uh core foam really did a great job the rubber on the bottom provided tons of traction and it's another one where you sit down in the foam a little bit and the stability was fine yeah and again you have that very wide platform that you're landing on so it's just even with all that stack underfoot very stable very fun to run in and yeah this is the top pick of Max Kush and I'd say even though it's not the lightest turnover was easy and you could kind of pick up the Pac and I'm not saying you're going to go run your best 5K in it but it's it can it can move yeah again it's like if you're going out on a easy run and you're feeling good one day you could definitely pick up the pace in this it's the bounce all right we're bringing Robbie in for this next category for the next like six categories okay cool till the end of the I think well I'm saying I got you it's not Megan anymore and it's a new category and this category is uh fit and function what yeah so this kind of combines I don't know it's it's a category that combines in a way overall but especially the fit of the upper that that really supplements the mile and the ride so uh runner up first in this category is the Mount Coast R1 this was a surprising shoe a cuz Mount the coast is a brand new company uh and B we just weren't sure what it was all about yeah what I like about this shoe is a smooth transition you talk about some of the things here so it has this technology that they're calling golow yeah so it's kind of like a little bit of a frame to harness the foot give you that a little bit of stability over longer miles it I don't know how much it matters but what I love about this shoe especially is the fit of the upper has this interesting uh zonal lacing system where you have a toggle in the front part of the foot regular lacing at the top so the idea here being if you're on longer distance runs you can open up the forefoot to give you some more room to accommodate a swelling in your feet or whatever yeah mount Coast is kind of positioning themselves as the road Ultra Shoe here and we get it with zero sag meaning the foot won't like collapse under the foref foot as you put in those extra miles as your foot expands Robbie is talking about that zonal lacing that you can loosen up and keep it tighter on the top Robbie I never got past maybe 10 miles in this shoe you did a long run with that's one of the times we did like a 20 M run where you were this year I did a couple in this year it was great I love this it was a really surprise hit for me uh I'm excited to see what they have coming in 2025 a couple Trail models so let's see what happens yeah it's light it rolls through your foot stride really nice I think it's a good one so what beat it out all right number one in that category is the hyperium Brooks Hyperion Max 2 this is just one of those shoes that again we liked the first version of it but I felt like it really came together for the second version this upper and pretty much all the uppers in the Hyperion lineup this time just bangers yeah I think it's probably the best upper of the year of any shoe that we tried It just fits the foot so perfectly and has these Sawtooth laces that you find a lot of race shoes Robbie do you like Sawtooth laces I always will give them my appreciation so heartfelt thanks to every shoe brand that uses them and I feel like the fit of this especially is important to harnessing the ride in this shoe which isn't great at slower Paces but when you pick it up and that Tempo range it's really just nice yeah that's where this shoe kind of missed the mark for me a little bit was that for like a daily Trainer allpurpose shoe like a super trainer the ride of it when you just didn't feel like pushing the pace was a little bit harsh and a little bit firm for my taste Robie you seem to love it yeah I guess that's the part that I liked about it is that it just feels it's not super super soft it just feels like you can harness that ground feel and energy especially with the nylon plate in the middle of the midsole there and I think it's just the best version of DNA flash foam that Brooks has used to dat I like that you said harnessing mhm gy up all right Robbie everybody needs some stability in their life yeah especially us we're not stability reviewers nor do we have stability in our lives absolute train wreck over here but we do have a stability review team and they pick their favorite shoes of the year so we'll give them to you runner up is the Mount the coast P1 the P1 is interesting it uses kind of what a lot of shoe brands are used in these days which is light stability or certain pieces so they have this 3D AR Trail in here for a little bit of extra stability they have a molded insole two piece insole that gives you support in certain areas uh and then they have this pea blend midsole that provides a nice bounce and response to uh to your run and they do it all in a pretty nice looking package yeah I think their shoes came out really clean this year and even though I'm not a stability guy I mean if I was going to wear stability yeah this is the one I get stability reviewers put a ton of miles on the shoe really enjoyed it so good job all right Robbie and so the top spot goes to drum roll the A6 Joe Kyo 31 probably no surprise there it seems that's stability that's the definition of stability shoe it seems to be at the top of the list for many years in a row or somewhere in the mix all right so what makes the Kayo 31 so great and you'll even see some of the pro athletes running in it when they're doing training runs is the wide platform and now they kind of have done geometry to kind of give you that stability so done away with that hard posting on the medial side and kind of just use the shape of the shoe and the width of the shoe to give you that nice stable ride and glide through your run and they did a great job updating the shoe it looks fantastic and uh pretty lightweight yeah for for stability shoe and really has become the industry standard for stability trainers yeah all right you know what it's like when people don't give you your du um yeah every day every dang day yep it's the most underrated category or overrated really depending on the Outlook um no this is the most underrated shoes though and I'm going to start we're going to go with the honorable mention the runner up with the Muno Neo Vista and I don't know maybe this should be a different category but it should cuz this shoe was great I do feel like there wasn't enough talk about it among people do you think it's because it just didn't get out there enough maybe um I think the people who loved it really loved it though I really loved it I thought it was a great shoe it was a surprise we were a little nervous about the knit upper knit upper worked great the bottom side the cush MH the little bit of a pla down here it all worked yeah it's a little soft on underfoot but I'm not usually not a huge huge fan ofof soft shoes I don't know it just felt good to me especially with the plate it rolls along really nicely I think that fit of the upper really changed it for me it just locks in really well like you said knit uppers are super hit or miss this one was a hit hit um and I felt like it's the the also the not the return of mauno but it's like mauno like doing something new and interesting yeah refh the refresh of mauno exactly and the great thing about this was there wasn't one person on our team who didn't love running in the shoe you me Megan everyone even Aubrey who ran the Amsterdam Marathon or half marathon in the shoe uh we even had Ryan Haynes our assistant editor he was a fan of this shoe yeah there's nobody that tried this shoe who didn't like it exactly so good job all right so the next one is and the winner of our most unrated shoe is the toppo athletic Spectre 2 which this is not the Spectre 2 it's a cyclone 2 but it looks very similar and the image you're seeing right now probably is spect we it's at home so we do have Cy 2 in the office it looks very similar in fact at first glance you might even get the two shoes confused but the difference is that the Spectre 2 has a higher stack height 37 mm in the heel so it offers this really nice comfortable ride from a 100% paback msle which is you know as you know paback is the good stuff and not this is like the paback the real packs not just the generic peba and the Spectre is a very simple shoe and that the upper just kind of nice gives you that that wider toe box it kind of wraps around the foot well like all too shoes do and then it's just a slab of paback Under Foot that gives you a really bouncy fun ride comfortable can kind of do everything and 5mm drop so it's not zero drop but has that natural toe box that I think a lot of ultra fans are coming over to toppo for that reason and uh it's a pretty good deal [Music] boo hey was that the biggest surprise oh I mean I knew you were there so not quite all right so what was the biggest surprise to us this year after I did that Dad joke runner up would be the Hoka Skyward X this was crazy I think this was a surprise because we didn't even know this was coming no so and then all of a sudden was like oh this is for sale well what was interesting about this one too is I had just been like hey the C X1 is a great daily trainer you get that nice cush the plated Rock everything it's like a daily trainer and this came out and I'm like well yeah this is pretty similar to the C X1 at a much better price yeah so you do get that huge stack of foam underfoot you get a pretty comfortable upper and you get a wild kind of carbon fiber not plate but design it's crazy you've got like a double like H plate with independent suspension on each side wings here on the back the upper fits great so the CLX one we were CRA weren't crazy about the upper or the laces this one fits more like a traditional shoe it's got a really nice heel counter just really is one of those shoes that rolls through your stride and gives you all that cushion when you're done running your legs feel fresh all right let's go to the winner all right cow Chow this one boom dude I love the shoe the diodora gar carbon this is this was a surprise because because deodor has done okay with there's some really nice models some really okay models in the racing Department didn't really have anything great and then they came out with a gar carbon which is $300 caveat but there's a lot of real premium elements in this shoe we've said before the price though is different like they're not making the amount of shoes as like a Nike or something like that so you're buying a more limited edition shoe and Rob you mentioned some of the features like this Matrix upper yeah the Matrix upper real premium durable great fitting upper you got the PBX midsole with the Ana PBX you have a carbon fiber plate fairly lightweight package I just ran in this shoe again this morning I'm actually surprised how much I love this shoe and keep coming back to it I think it's a great shoe it wasn't the same for you but well no I do think it's a great shoe I just think for me there's a couple things I'd tweak to make it a perfect raser needs to drop a little bit of weight and I would have liked a little more aggressive toes spring that's fair that's fair but the reason it was such a surprise for me is when the fit was really dialed in the style is beautiful which I expect from deodor so that wasn't a surprise but the phones and diodore are kind of like they're still playing with them and tweaking them and they're getting better and better but there isn't anything that I felt like was like banging and this one they really nailed it this pea midsole really feels bouncy and energetic underfoot and it it just it it's right in there with all the other Super Shoes if they could drop a ounce to a half ounce off of this then you're really getting into the rocket science yeah but pretty pretty great overall sometimes you know we're not running all the time you would be surprised you know well I also think we're kind of a professionals here yeah we are actually I would say if you check our stravis you'll find out don't check my stra you can check mine anyway a lot of times when you're buying a running shoe it's not all about running you want something that can transition into just a lifestyle shoe you want something that you could run in and maybe wear with your casual clothes and so the line is getting a little hazier in some of these shoes on what you can do with them and our first runner up in this category for lifestyle shoes shoes that we'd say okay this is a cool shoe to run in maybe not do you know your 20 mile ear but maybe do you know if you're going to do 20 miles a week or five mile runs or you go to the gym and you want to do a run or even a travel shoe that you want to get three miles in while you're while you're you know having a run through the city or whatever uh the first up for me runner up was the VHA Condor 3 VHA makes some really great uh I would say they're the only company that's actually making sustainable shoes from top to bottom like it's you got to kind of I know we always try to explain it but it's different because it's not like hey our materials are recycled or this and that and yeah they Source all their materials from the same country that they're made in I think it's in Brazil they pay their workers a fair wage even have housing and transportation everything else it's pretty pretty great company overall and the Condor 3 which the first two versions were honestly horrible really rebounded a nice ride it's not the best ride of any running shoe it's not the lightest it's not the best bounce in the foam but it is i' would say good enough yeah and I as a lifestyle shoe I wore that shoe probably more than any other shoe this year just destroyed the white version of it but I think it's a great shoe they're coming out with a new version in 2025 so should be even better okay now the winner yeah is one that I actually feel like you can do a lot of running in and looks great this could almost be the most surprising shoe of 2025 as well it could so this is the Adidas Ultra boost 5x not the five which has the cage on it uh man the ultra boost maybe thought it was dead in the water kind of uh or Dua Dead on arrival this is a real running shoe like a legit running shoe it's a real running shoe and I got to test even the next version of it which even better okay and what I love about this shoe is the foam got a little bit lighter so it's still not the lightest shoe but it is it's actually lighter than the Joe Nimbus which is a pretty standard Dilly trainer so it is crazy and the upper I do like their knit uppers again we talked about whether or not knit uppers work this one works for me yeah I look not maybe not you you don't want to wear it on a 95 degree day in Florida but especially for this time of year when we're recording this in December really nice shoe like you said the upper fit's great solid ride kind of for any distance um Al together great shoe yeah the only thing I kind of wish that this had was a little bit of more flexibility in the midsole like a little decoupling a little bit because it can feel a little blocky Under Foot true but overall for a shoe that looks good is easy to run in I would definitely like if I was only concerned with like going to the gym and putting a couple miles on the treadmill or doing that this year would be more than enough for you all right Robbie we have some friends that have brick-like feet yeah you might know of them Jarrett the wide foot the wide foot guy yeah I was it's the nicest way I can put it um no great friend great our best friend Jared and he has his best wi foot running shoes posted on the website there's even some videos on our YouTube but since he can't be here today we're going to stand in for him as best as we can hopefully my feet take up we'll have to put both our feet together to be equal to his foot but we're here and the honorable mention for his best wife a shoe of the Year surprisingly the on cloud Runner 2 and you know what we actually ran in this shoe too and I thought it was probably one of the best on trainers right now it's a really simple daily trainer and I think it it did do its job as far as fit feel it's a nice shoe yeah personally I thought there's is a little bit of room in the shoe of course that's going to do well for the wide foot Runners and so he really liked that uh it's a really nice luxurious kind of feeling upper the you can the cloudtech in the midsole has sort of seen a little less cloudy as time goes on but overall pretty nice ride and fit overall so Megan's kind of in between wide foot and regular foot and this was also a shoe that she used a lot and it kind of went into our last category that lifestyle crossover shoe yeah she I see her wearing this all the time and the winner for best wide foot running shoe 2024 is the New Balance SC Elite V4 this is New Balance has kind of been known to cater to wide foot Runners but you can see like look at the lacing here this is my pair yeah and you can see that I've laced it up pretty tight there so there's a lot of room to like open up that throat and I guess enough for for Jarrett but one of the areas that he has a lot of difficulty is in that part of the foot right here where it comes in so a lot of shoes will have a toes shaped or open wide box for the toes but then come back in narrow and it pinches his foot so I think one of the things that he liked about this shoe is it while it had enough room for his foref foot it also didn't like cut into his midfoot yeah and this is also one of the shoes that is kind of good for obviously the marathon or just even a training like a faster training run so yeah all right this for you wifey all right Thomas so we're going to cover also our favorite shoes from our big guy reviewers here at believe in the run so funny that we're doing the big guys but we got the little shoes yeah right we got the the smallest versions of the big guy shoes but this is for runners who obviously are a lot heavier than us so it's there's a big difference between somebody who's me 5' 6 140 lb and then someone who's taller and heavier he's over 6 feet he's over 200 something pounds yeah so he's putting a lot of work on the cushioning yeah so his two favorite shoes for the for 2025 Runner they're basically tied so we'll just put them as both in the same bucket is the let's go for S endorphin speed 4 uh I mean the S endorphin speed always a great shoe I feel he feels like we feel like as you'll see further in this video that the four is kind of a combination of the three and the two gives you that nice balce A little bit of aggressiveness but also just works great as a daily trainer um the power on PB foam mix with the uh nylon plate in the middle is just a really nice combination that I it's just gives you comfort but perform performance in the same bucket got a quick question PR we were just at the running event we saw that they're going back to the mutant colorway for the fifth year anniversary I did what do you think of that uh I mean I feel it's a little too early to go to go Heritage five years five years is not a long time I know that's a fan favorite colorway but do you like it I'm not I'm not even sure I liked it I do I love that I did love that color way I was a sucker for it I think we still have all I I know back at the house I have all three of The Originals yeah there you go there's that's the Endorphin speed speed speed W OG beautiful shoe one of the really one of the best shoes in the last I don't know 5 10 years but the uh the four is kind of a combination of all those and it's a great shoe all right what I don't even need to introduce you to this if you watch this Channel or if you're looking at shoes at all super Blast 2 is almost big big guy everybody everybody right so it's a flight fil turbo plus midsole just gives it that super bouncy ride uh but just just I don't know it's hard to explain everything in this shoe works together the upper the midsole it's this works it's as good as the first version of the shoe um and it's versatile for pretty much any distance any Pace I this this is my Island shoe if I could take one shoe and it was only going to have one shoe there this is probably the shoe I'd take yeah and for big guy Runners like you said offers that nice better of cushion really comfortable but even if you're smashing it down you know responds well bounces back to life smashing it down we're going into another category this time we've been giving you two a runner up and a top pick why are we doing three in this one I mean it's so hard to I don't know pick your favorit in this category this is the best Do-it all shoe which honestly is almost the best overall shoe as far as like just our favorite shoe yep cuz we have still in the video coming out our best overall shoe which is almost like best value shoe it get the lines get blurred yeah we'll explain that when we get there but this is doit all so you can use it for some people call it does it all does it all yeah that's the thing so you could use this for fast days for Recovery days for long runs for everyday daily training all your running needs all of them are there let's start off with the should we just covered with the big eye Runners the soc endorphin speed 4 we already just C we already just talked about this shoe it's a great shoe it's combination of the three and the two and you're going to love it all right next up is the Hoka MOX 6 so this is the Hoka the mack has always been a lightweight daily trainer really I mean really lightweight honestly I've always loved it I thought it was that combination of kind of like the perfect amount of cushioning lightweight package the upper always fits well it's just one of those shoes that I feel like you can do at all yeah and it's a relatively nice price point and pretty simple shoe overall but that's sometimes all you want is Simplicity yeah it seems like it's sometimes hard to make a simple shoe yeah right as shocking as that sounds you would think it would be a lot easier for some reason we know some brands that can most brands just cannot do it uh but this is that one of those shoes so again mock great shoe great pick let's move on yeah all right top do it all of 2024 this should be no surprise to Anyone who reads our reviews or has run in it yeah it's just such a banger it's the it's a great shoe and what shoe is this I forget I think it's the A6 super blast yeah the A6 super Blast 2 uh Paris colorway the they've come out with a few colorways since then there's a black on black they always seem to be in very difficult their the inventory for some reason seems to be non-existent most of the time you know I've talked to as and they get all these complaints and people think they're doing it on purpose to drive demand believe me they're not doing it on purpose they would love to sell you as many pairs of these shoes as they possibly can their financial backers and investors would also like them to sell as many of these shoes as they possibly can so they are not holding back inventory they're trying to get them out to you uh they ordered I was talking to them they ordered so many more pairs of these in the first version knowing that people like the first version still the demand was crazy yeah and I think there's more drops coming in December so keep an eye out for that uh but again this is just a great shoe front to back top to bottom you can really use it for anything didn't win the shoe of the Year this year cuz that would have been kind of boring I mean we've been talking about super blast for years now yeah two years ago won their shoe of the Year award last year we weren't didn't do a best overall but anyways so it's a great shoe that's all to say you should buy it it's 200 bucks it's worth every mile you'll get out of it it is cuz it lasts a long time and like we said it can do it all yeah sometimes everything isn't perfect but it's really close yeah and this is our almost best shoe of the year it's a real award category trust me yeah the Hoka Mach X2 this was one of my favorite shoes to run in it worked for me it hurt a lot of other people yeah so I actually did not run in this shoe but every one of our reviewers absolutely love this shoe to death except for one thing and that's the heel collar yeah I don't see any blood on this one but other shoes did have the blood yeah we did see a lot of photos of it the upper is actually really nice it's like a race style upper so they tried to keep it minimal and they may have gone too minimal on the heel counter it kind of has a little bit of a rough Edge there you can feel it Robbie if you just push down on it oh yeah it's a little scary razor raon Razor's Edge right there but man you had this really great foam really soft foam on right underneath your foot that had a lot of Bounce and rebound you had a nylon plate underneath of it and then some of their standard phone that gave the shoe stability it's light it felt fast it bounced like this could almost be a raoe it was really a phenomenal fun shoe to run in again it hurt people but it fixed it for 2025 and kept everything else the same so hopefully maybe this will be at the top of the list next year I'm hoping it will be the upper looks more like a daily trainer it's probably going to add some weight to it but Man the ride of the shoe it might be worth a little extra weight to fix this for people I love this shoe it could have been my top shoe of the year we had a discussion we said we can't hurt people so hurt people hurt people man yeah all right Robbie ain't nothing to it but to do it y who got our top pick this year all right so this is the this this is controversial pick within the office mainly because me hasn't run the shoe uh but which is fair I use the heavy-handed uh weight of my influence to to convince you guys no but you you love this shoe too I do love this shoe my problem with this shoe being pick number one is there's another Adidas shoe that I like even better than this that I would pick over this but we were determining whether it got released this year or it's getting released next year it's having trickle out this year I'm going to have to put like a big stamp to remember it next year CU it's really hard when a shoe comes out like we've been running in it since November and the general public hasn't been able to get a hold of it I'm talking about the evos which would be my favorite shoe of the year but for this shoe we're talking about the Adidas AI zero SL2 and we both love this shoe we got it there's a couple reasons why we really like this shoe yeah I mean this for one thing it's $130 you I promise you you won't find a better value at that price point than this shoe and actually at a lot of higher price points but this shoe kind of harnesses like the SL in the past was okay but they really knocked out of the park with this I mean you have a full bed of Light Strike Pro full length kind of wrapped in this Light Strike 2.0 midsole which is much improved over what whatever they were doing Light Strike since its beginning it's one of those like I said it's a simple shoe in some ways it's great and others like the Light Strike Pro that's what's used in the racay shoes and you have a pretty good piece before it used to just be a puck in the for fooot remember and I like the previous version but I I think what you're getting at is the ride feels a lot more premium with that full bed of it and you really get that nice rebound feel for a shoe that I wasn't expecting it from like you're not looking at a ton of Stack here yeah and you get the the upper fits really nice one of the things we talked about was when you look at this shoe you look down when you're wearing it it looks like a fun shoe a fast shoe it looks like something you feel proud wearing I know that sounds weird but I feel like that's that matters when I'm wearing a running shoe so for me it's the shape of the shoe I like something that looks fast and this definitely has that fast look it is sometimes the reason I get you know a little bit hung up on foot-shaped shoes cuz I'm like it just doesn't look like fast and energetic to me where these Adidas addz shoes always look like they're ready to go fast yeah and it and that's the thing you can pick it up in this shoe it's light enough that you can pretty much do again mostly everything in this shoe and I think what I loved so much about this is that it feels just like a running shoe like sometimes I feel like yeah it's cool all these super trainers everything else but it gets just a little bit too compli licated sometimes and this feels like a pure running shoe but in 2024 terms yeah the only area where I felt like they had to bring it down to that 130 price point and where you might skimp on that a little bit was the outsole it's not the kti outsole the Continental Rubber outsole and you can tell the difference yeah there's a little bit of a difference there I think you'll get more durability out of this maybe not as good of grip though and then the upper it's can if you don't not a hugee fan of narrow toe boxes it might be a little bit constrictive I didn't particularly have a problem with it but it's a low volume toe box it's going to be a little bit shallow over the toes and it does come in on the sides so if you do have a wide foot or something like that you're probably not going to enjoy the way that this shoe Cuts in but if you like what Robbie was talking about that traditional racing running feel yeah this shoe has it so there it is I feel like if you also light it is light so I feel like you you're looking for that value where you know maybe you don't want to spend the $200 on the Superglass 2 which we would probably pick over any other shoe in this entire list to wear or buy maybe you just want to spend 130 bucks on a shoe that's in your budget I feel like you really can't go wrong with this you can honestly only go right yeah I would even recommend this to like your high school Runner your college Runner someone who's on a budget or you know isn't sure about how committed they are to running this shoe will get get them excited about it yeah all right Thomas

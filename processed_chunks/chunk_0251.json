  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers and now I've done the requisite test miles in the Adidas Supernova rise 2 it's a daily trainer that Adidas says would make a great work course it's built to eat a wide range of your regular daily runs I'm here to give you the verdict on this second gen shoe how does this stack up against the rest of the day trainers out there let's get into it quick details then the ads Supernova rise sticks with the same relatively conservative stack at least by today's standards the snack comes in at 36 Ms in the hill 26 and the 4T for a 10 mil drop it weighs in at 9.6 o or 272 g in my men's UK and a half Adidas said it has shave 4% off the weight versus the first gen but those come in at 9.7 or 275 G in the teso so I'm not quite seeing that but coming in under 10 ounces I would say sort of keeps Supernova rise fairly competitive on weight price-wise things stay the same with the Adidas Supernova rise too coming at \u00a3130 or $140 that's now towards the cheaper end of the daily trainer shelves let's give you a quick shoe whip round and Adidas pites the Supernova as a neutral everyday shoe a starting point daily training that could be good as an option for beginners the updates to the Adidas Supernova rise 2 are minimal and largely restricted to the uppers where Adidas has tried to boost comfort and save weight that includes new mesh uppers less padding in the heel though that's quite hard to see versus The Originals thinner tongues and some softer eye stays here the midsole unit stays the same it sticks with PE based dream strike plus midso foam that's made from a small percentage of recycled materials that dream strike plus has some of the bounce of a performance foam but not the full energy of a super foam there's also a highly rocked for foot and what Adidas calls it support Rod system a set of visible rods that follow the metat tassels and add some stiffness and spring up top the Supernova rise has a new mesh upper that's marginally thinner and a little less structured across the toe box for an upper that's not unlike a nimbus 26 the heel colors are still really well padded particularly at the back there are quite stiff heel counters to enhance the support and heel hold you've also still got pretty well padded traditional tongues with no gusting if you flip them over there's a generous covering of durable adwar Rubber and overall this is a shoe that screams long mile durability when it comes to fit and testing I ran in my regular Adidas running shoe size which is a UK and a half and I found these fit well true to size they're not the Rous shoes there's some of that Adidas narrowness that you get but overall they're roomy enough just about enough we them in the toe box for good Comfort it was easy to get them laced up and locked in and comfortably kind of held across the foot midfoot lockdown was generally good no problems with the heel slipping they got pretty generous padded heel CS that hold the heel nicely in place I felt well held generally overall and ran in good comfort with no trouble at all so based on that I would recommend going true to size onto the run test then in testing I've covered a good 50 km in the Supernova rise 2 across a range of Paces with a majority of those miles on the road now unsurprisingly because the midsole unit is largely identical to the rise one not much has changed Under Foot that's good news if you like the original shoe the big changes here have come in the uppers with tweaks to the heel package and the tongues in a bit to make the shoe more comfortable but lighter as well that didn't really register me in terms of weight on the scales and I didn't really notice a big shift in terms of how they felt on the foot with the weight though overall I didn't find these a particularly heavy shoe in the first generation myself but when it comes to the ride the rice 2 serves up a more traditional feel Under Foot with a dream strike plus Stack The Bu comparison now is looking quite low particularly when you're looking into 2025 shoes it's getting higher the result is just enough softness to take the edge off the road but you will feel more ground coming up than with a lot of the bigger stack dieses that we're seeing there is also a bit of stiffness and snap to the shoe I quite like that personally they also feel a little bit more Compact and a bit less on the foot some of the other bigger shoes that we're seeing there's a kind of Puma velocity or Brooks ghost glycerin agility to these shoes part that comes from the narrower platform that feels more precise than the likes of the Nova blast or a nimus or a Triumph across the miles I ran in testing though the most important sensation was that immediacy from the midsole the phone compresses a little it's quite a firm feeling underfoot and then it returns back quite quickly it's a more Snappy and responsive ride than a soft and bouncy energy again that you might get from other daily trainers so the shoe runs best I think when you're running with a quick foot turnover Landing mid to 4 foot rather than further back on your heels and heavy and when you're moving at a slightly faster Pace with lighter feet lighter quicker feet that's when it performs best verdict then and I think the Adidas Supernova rise to is one of those shoes it's a competent fairly versatile shoe that will happily eat miles at a range of Paces though I think it's best at cruising pace for me now Adidas has pegged this as a shoe that's good for beginner Runners who are looking for a Workhorse daily trainer that can cover a lot of runs and sort of definitely soak up that 80% of your easy runs but in a world where shoes now pack much more softness and cushion More Bounce and energy from higher stacks and sort of comfort overall for easy runs I'm just not sure everyone is going to like the way this is a bit more traditional now when you put it up against some other daily trainers like the Nova blast 5 or you start looking at the really versatile super trainers that we're getting now though they're much more expensive this shoe does feel a little bit tame now in some ways I personally really like that for me it's got SOC ride 17 Vibes there's a sort of Safety and Security to it if you like a shoe with less cushion more ground feel that's a bit snappier then I think this could be a good option it offers a much more connected ride that brings with it a good stability a good reliability to The Landings and it's consistent even if it comes up a little bit more direct and it isn't the most exciting now \u00a330 the rise to I think also is quite competitively priced shoes are increasing unfortunately but overall I personally think the Adidas Supernova Prima it's a bit smoother it's somewhat more lively it probably has a bit more versatility and for the extra 20 that you'd pay I think it's probably worth looking at the Prima over this shoe but again if you like a traditional ride then this one might fit the bill for you so there you have it that's been my review of the that's Supernova rise to I hope you found it useful let me know if you've run in the one or the two and what you made of them tell us in the comments below what's your go-to work course daily shoe if you're after a good allrounder I'm going to pop a video up on the channel now

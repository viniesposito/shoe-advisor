  "text": "running a half marathon is an amazing achievement for any Runner and what's even better well running a half marathon faster than you have ever done before well stay tuned because by the end of this video you'll know exactly what to do to get you that PB we'll go through everything what time you should be aiming for all the sessions that help me run a 67 minute half marathon and how to Pace the race itself and what I'd also recommend for fueling and hydration along the way but first let's get stuck into the training so how long should you give yourself to train well it's one of the big reasons why I personally love the Half Marathon distance it doesn't quite take over your life the way that marathon training does ideally you want to allow yourself 12 weeks of training that's how long all of our training plans are and you can check those out on the website all our beginner plans for the half marathon are completely free to download we'll link to all of those down below I'll also put some good fun and fast half marathon races up on the screen now that I've done before and always let us know down in the comments some great half marathon races that you've run to help out the running community so people know where those fast courses are so what's a realistic time to be aiming for well this obviously varies wildly from person to person and your running experience as well for newer Runners out there you're likely going to be able to achieve some really big improvements in those early stages 5 10 even 20 minute PBS are possible but for more experience Runners people running a little bit longer those progressions do obviously cut a little bit shorter as you get a little bit closer to your limit so it might be a minute or even just a few seconds but they all count we want to get that little bit faster if you've never run a half marathon before then how do we know what we're capable of well this is a Rough Guide if you want to run sub 2 hours you're going to want to be around about sub 60 for your 10K a sub 145 half sub 50 for a 10K a sub 1302 sub 43 for a 10K once you hit those 10K times you're ready to begin that training Journey to hit those half marathon goals and what would our weekly mileage look like for similar goals well someone that's trying to break 2 hours we're looking around 3 to four runs a week up to around 32 miles or 50k of training per week sub 145 four to five runs a week now up to around about 40 Mi or 64k of training per week and sub 130 5 to six runs per week up to around about 54 miles of training 87K per week now I should say with those distance figures they all up two the figures I've given there going to going to be in the peak week of training with around about 2 weeks to go for the half marathon we're going to build up have some recovery weeks build up have recovery build up and those Peak weeks are going to be around about those sort of distances see how that feels with you and all that will give you a bit of an idea of what you are going to be capable of in a half marathon one of the biggest keys to get faster over the Half Marathon distance and let's face it all running distances are doing speed sessions during the week in order to run that fastest half we need to get the body used to training faster than the gold pace and we do this with speed workouts and interval sessions more experienced Runners will probably want to be setting aside two runs a week for doing these speed sessions we'll touch on that a little bit later on now I've got some really good example sessions that you can try here the first one is a progression run something like 10K in total distance 3K easy 3K at your half marathon pace 2K at your 10K pace and then 2K cool down afterwards really good to get the legs strong for when we're pushing at the end of a half marathon or how about a mixed Paces Run after round about 10 to 15 minutes of warming up 4X 1K at your 10K Pace your so current 10K Pace going straight into 4X 400 m at your 5K Pace taking 2 minutes little recovery walking between each of those reps then a 5 to 10 minute cool down and then thirdly one of my favorite sessions is gold Pace reps this is 3x 8 at your half marathon goal Pace with a 2minute walking recovery between each one with all of these sessions make sure you do a good warm up and warm down afterwards ideally trying to get a few little drills in there some proper Dynamic stretching before you get into those really fast sections now if you're a little bit unsure with these type of sessions maybe get in touch with your local running club quite often they will be putting on these type of sessions at least once a week and also you don't have to be running these at a track at all just find somewhere flat fast and traffic free and that will be perfect conditions to get your runs done now as I touched on at the start of this section if you are a fairly experienced Runner you may want to add a second speed session during your week traditionally the Tuesday is session will be when you're running reps a lot faster than your goal pace so something like 400s 800s something like that then the second session of the week is going to be around about that goal Pace there something like a tempo run or a progression one where you're building into that goal Pace it will just push that Fitness up even more another big part of your training that you want to be getting into your week is running strides now these are bursts of around about 20 seconds of fast running around about 90% effort so not quite all out running for the bus territory but just a little bit slower than that and I really recommend putting these at the end of one of your easy runs during the week if you're new to strides do something like three to four reps of this more experienced Runners up to around about six reps just with a super relaxed easy jog or just walking between each reps take about 20 to 30 seconds just get your heart rate back down and why we want to be doing things like this it's helping recruit some of those fast twitch muscle fibers to help put in that strong Sprint at the end of the race it also helps really improve our running economy and our running form as well it's quite hard to run with poor running form when we're running that fast so moving on long runs and easy runs the rest of your week should ideally include a good solid long run and also some easy mileage in there as well now a lot of people come to me and say well why can't I just do speed sessions and run super fast every day well these sessions put a lot of stress on our body and that's why easy running comes in if we did speed session every day we would just overload ourselves and pick up some injuries so that's why we do easy runs to recover from those sessions and it still helps build that cardiovascular fitness running nice and easy to help build up that volume safely and build that endurance in the heart the body and the lungs that we're going to need over the Half Half Marathon distance so how long should our long runs be well for a sub 2hour training we're talking around about anywhere between 6 and 13 miles for the long run this will again progress as the training goes on so early weeks about 6 miles later on around about 13 mil sub 145 we're talking around about between 8 and 14 miles sub 130 we're talk anywhere from 10 to 16 miles as the plan progresses then for the more advanced Runners you're going to want to add some gold paace blocks into these long runs as well we want to be putting some blocks in here every other week all of our training plans are set out exactly like this so of course check out VP parks.com if you're a little bit unsure you just want to download a guide and follow it along thousands of five star reviews going check them out we're really proud of these plans we produce so we going to be adding some segments at that goal Pace during our long run about 2 to 3K at our go Pace then back to easy then back to go Pace then back to easy again we're just getting our body used to working hard towards the end of those long runs really really important I'd also recommend if you can do some of your long runs at the the same time of day as your goal race starts so if it's 8:00 in the morning 8:30 9:00 in the morning have a look when your goal race is and do some of your long runs at the same time this gets the body used to working at this time of day and you can also practice your pre-race routine with your breakfast for me as long the CH viewers of the channel know that's going to be a couple of bagels some peanut butter and jam or jelly for our American friends over the other side of the pond and I'm going to have this around about 2 hours to 990 minutes before the run so my body is nicely fueled ready to go and when I'm out on the run I'm going to be practicing my fueling strategy as well with my gels taking some liquid out there to say nice and hydrated these long runs are a fantastic opportunity the real dress rehearsal for the big day you turn up on the big day there's going to be no big surprises in a similar vein we want to be practicing our shoe choices as well on our long runs what's going to be the most comfortable shoe for the duration of the race that we're going for are those super lightweight carbon Racing shoes going to be the best option will they lead potentially lead to some blisters and things like that for me Comfort always wins in these things if you want to get some really good comfortable shoe Choice ideas check out this video up here and we'll link to it down below another crucial part of any half marathon training plan is getting our strength working at least once a week it's especially important for training at these longer distances where we really need that strength at the back end of a race if you're someone that might have blown up in a race this could be the key to get you that nice solid finish and run strong towards the end as a minimum I'd add some strength training at the end of one of your easy runs during the week we've got a strength training add-on that you can add to the half marathon training plans on the website give you three different routines that you can do at home without any equipment at all they all include those basic exercises things like squats lunges Bridges and planks as well we'll put some other ideas up on the screen now and really try to keep those rest days as fully rest days because that's when our body is recovering and making those adaptations to become that faster stronger Runner that we want so keep your rest as relaxed as you possibly can but add some strength work after an easy Runner a little bit later on in the day now you've done all your training race day is here and you don't want to go out and blow it all within the first 2K as unfortunately I've seen so many people doing but not people that subscribe to the Ben Park YouTube channel so whack that subscribe button down below and follow along for lots of great training tips for me there's two different ways that you can Pace a half marathon either start a little bit slower than your goal pace and then speed up as the Run goes on now this does require a lot of patience and control to go out nice and relaxed and just roll into it some of our older Runners and I'm getting nearly at that sort of stage of my career now really sort of favor this option because it does take a little bit longer to get warmed up than it did when you were younger so really good one for some of our older Runners out there alternatively and what what I usually try and do here is set off simply at my go pace and stick to it with nice even splits throughout the race and then for that last K give it a good kick down at the end now getting this even pacing is quite easyish to do if the course is nice and flat and level and there's no Hills in it so do some research on the course that you're doing how many sharp turns are there how many Hills are there things like that there's some nasty little Hills towards the end of the race that you might need to hold some energy back before it's another crucial way of running that fast off to do that course preparation ask some friends about it maybe potentially go and cycle the course before if it's a local one could you go and run it over a couple of your long runs and just see what it's like get a feel for what that course is going to be like for me when I'm doing my race I simply use lap Pace on my watch and my watch ticks over with every kilometer and I'm just looking at that lap pace for just that particular kilometer that I'm running in at that moment so if I'm trying to run say uh5 half marathon I'm just trying to make sure that's set nicely at 330 a k pace as I go on just a little bit under that sort of gold Pace CU some races and GP ches are never that accurate so always try and run just a little bit ahead of my goal pace for what my watch is saying potentially a lot of races there will be Paces as well so you can get stuck in to a pacing group if you're not sure reach out to the race and see if they've got a pacing group this takes away a lot of that extra mental work that you're having to go through to keep nicely on Pace now let's have a chat about Fuel and hydration during the race now for me I always recommend taking a gel around about every 30 to 40 minutes during pretty much any running I'm doing really and every half marathon I've done I've normally taken two to three gels with me and I take one on the start line and I've got two for the race obviously depends how long you going be running for with how many gels you need for some people it be three some people it might be four gels over the course of the race now in terms of hydration it's highly likely they're going to have some stuff out on the course that you can get as you go round but of course check how many water stations or maybe energy drink stations they're going to have out there don't try anything new on race day is the old average so if you haven't had the energy drink they're giving out if you haven't had the energy gels they're giving out it's probably not a good time to test what they're going to be like have a look what gels they're giving out if you want to use them get some ordered in and test them in your training and then you can use them on the race day absolutely fine I always say to Simply drink to thirst I'm thirsty I get some water down as I go around for me I just like to have a little little and often for a lot of races that I do there only one every other water station I'm just going to go in get some down if it's hot one over the head something like that just to keep myself nice and cool don't feel you need to like chug a load of bottles and again like a lot of things do what you would normally do in your training perfect that routine if it is a little bit hotter out there potentially get some electrolytes in before you go around as well running a half marathon flast out is really really difficult but believe me it feels amazing when you can jump and across the line with that big smile on the face knowing you've given it your all and you've achieved your K if you need some more training on the Half Marathon distance then check out the plans on benp parks.com if you're interested in running a 130 half then check out this video up here next if you want to see my pre pre-race routine then check out this video down here keep on working hard guys keep on done we see you very soon in the next one",

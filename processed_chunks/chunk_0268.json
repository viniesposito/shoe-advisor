  "text": "hey this is mar run testers and it is my turn to pick my top five favorite new running shoe launches of 2024 now we have recently just done our run testers Awards which is very much our Collective take on our favorite running shoes I'll put a link to the winners up here now this is very much the shoes that have really impressed me these are the shoes that I've Loved when we reviewed them or had them in for review these are the shoes that I've Loved training in for races these are the shoes I racing in these are the shoes that I've been desperate to get back out in when I've had some spare time when we've not been testing other shoes now it has been a very busy year of shoe launches there have definitely been some shoes that I've kind of considered for this video that have just narly missed out but I have now got down to my top five and these are across a range of kind of uses and shoes that you know I think they really impressed me over the past 12 months so without further ado these are my top five favorite new running shoe launches of 2024 so in at number five is this the New Balance Rebel V4 now this is a shoe that I would describe as one that when I reviewed it you know I absolutely loved it and you know months later you know the end of the year I'm still loving this shoe and wanting to trade in it now this launched in January I think in the US first went Global a month later I think it landed for me probably a few months out from doing London Marathon which I was going to or use the new B SE Elite V4 and there's definitely more Hallmarks of the SE Elite V4 in the new B Rebel V4 which I really like I think makes it a good kind of training companion with that shoe and I think a good training companion nonplaced training companion for other carbon Racing shoes as well what I liked about it first and foremost is the weight I love a lightweight kind of daily Trainer shoe and that's absolutely what you get here with the rebel V4 it's got that kind of phantom fit upper that we get on the SE Elite V for as well which I really liked I think makes it a very easy shoe to get on as well and I think you know having that kind of very you know thin kind of lightweight upper makes a huge difference for me in terms of wanting to be out in this shoe now you've also got that kind of fuel cell midsole here as I said you're not getting a carbon plate you're not getting a plate at all but I still do think you get a shoe that very much wants you to run a little bit more Up Tempo and that's been my experience of running in these shoes a shoe that I would use if I wanted to do a kind of faster kind of training run and this is a shoe that absolutely would do it now what I would say is it probably isn't a shoe that I would want to do massively long mileage in but I think for kind of you know mid distance runs and mid distance training sessions it's been an ideal shoe to get I think pricing wise it's pretty good as well too it's kind of1 13040 and I think that's a very good price foro that I think you could race in I think you could do a lot of your faster sessions in and I think you know from a durability point of view it's going to be able to handle a lot of mileage so in at number five is the new BS Rebel V4 so in number four is a shoe a little bit on the new bounce Rebel V4 it's one that I really loved when we first reviewed it and it's a shoe that continued to use throughout the year this is a shoe that we described as being very comfortable very protective and I think very fun to run and I think that's a key thing for me because you know running should be fun and you should want to enjoy that time you're out there running whether it's shorter or longer runs now that shoe is this one the Hawker skywood X now the the other shoe that was in contention for this spot was the saky hurricane 24 but this just edged it out for me I think this has been a shoe that as I said as one I've you know I've enjoyed running out throughout the year and we talked a little bit about it in our kind of run testers Awards I think hawker's had a very good strong year and I think cruci is because and I talked about it is that you know you know having shoes that are just fun to run in and I think that definitely applies to my time in the Skyward X now this is a Max stack kind of cushion shoe and that has definitely been a trend from all running Brands this year I do think this is a standout one in that category now is a heavy shoe but I've never felt it's been a cumbersome shoe to run in it's a more accommodating roomy shoe than most other hacker shoes I think you know if you've always found hacker shoes to be a bit on the narrow side this is one that really is a departure from that kind of more narrow fit I think you know it's just as I said it's a fun shoe to run in what Hawker has done in this mid there is a c plate in here I think you know I have found it's being a good shoe I can go out and run on really tired legs you know I can do long runs I have done long runs and marathon training runs where if I've wanted to go run a little bit quicker maybe more moderate Paces this is a shoe that I found comfortable to do that and again overall I think it's been a fun shoe to run in it is a for me a standout Max stack cushion shoe that I think has a little bit more versatility than most other shoes maybe not super blast versatility but I do think there is for easy recovery runs and moderate runs it's been a shoe that I've enjoyed running in so definitely one that I've enjoyed running throughout the year in that is the Hawker Skyward X so into my top three shoes of 2024 we're getting into some Racing shoes I think for me are the most exciting shoes to test and there's been a lot of good ones throughout the year that have launched now it was a tossup between two shoes for me for this top three spot and I think the one that's just missed out for me has been the diara gar carbon I think for a couple of reasons it's more expensive as a kind of top tier carbon racing shoe I've really enjoyed running that shoe but I've done a little bit more racing in the other shoe that I'm going to pick I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what diodora does next year and I think the gar carbon has been a really strong launch for diodora this year but the one I've gone for my pick and in the third spot is this the Puma db8 Nitro Elite 3 now as I said this is a shoe that I've done a lot more racing I've done shorter distances I've done a half marathon race and myself and Tom did the Manchester half in this shoe now this is a very good shoe I think the previous dvh shoes I think were good carbon Racing shoes but I don't think they really kind of sat with those top tier ones that is definitely a different story with the Puma DV8 Nitro Elite 2 what I also like is that it is cheaper than those top tier carbon RAC shoes or most of them it is below \u00a3200 and if you were looking to spend on a high quality kind of you know Carbon racing shoe and you didn't want to spend over2 200 this is the shoe that I would be going for what I like about it you know first you know ticks those key boxes for me in terms of a carbon racing shoot it is super light it's super easy to kind of get on no issues in terms of comfort no issues in terms of heel rub you know this you know just enough kind of padding in that Hill collar and just enough in terms of that wrap of that upper which you know still gives you that kind of racing style fit but just feels like a traditional kind of running shoot as well from that point of view the change in the midsole really just elevates what you get from the P d89 TR compared to its previous versions and it just feels like a lively propulsive aggressive shoe to run in but also a pretty stable controlled shoe to run in I think you know particularly compared to some other carbon Racing shoes I think basicly when I did the kind of shorter distance races it felt very good at the shorter distances at the half marathon kind of distance as well it felt fantastic and I think if I had a marathon coming up this would definitely be a shoe that I would consider because I think right now pummer has got a racing shoe here that really kind of competes with the best there and as I said it comes in less than the competition and I think if you were looking for a carbon racing shoe that I think you know is light is propulsive and aggressive has a good outsole and just fits very well and you know is cheaper than the Alternatives P DV8 Nitro Elite 3 had really impressed me this year com in later launch later this year but I think you know it's been well worth the waight and I think it's a massive Improvement for the DV8 Nitro Elite 2 and now finally Puma has a racing shoe to compete with the very best so in it number two is my favorite do it all shoe that is the dream I think ultimately if you can find a shoe that can cover all of your runs that's you know I think what everyone wants not everyone has the ability or the money to spend on a rotation and this is a shoe I think for me that you know since I've reviewed it since I've had it into test it's shoe that probably I've used the most and it is a shoe that I think can handle easy recovery runs can handle kind of faster runs I've used for track I think this is a shoe I feel comfortable racing in I think would work for a marathon as well and half marathons and that shoe and it's probably going to be no massive surprise for a lot of people is this shoe the ax super Blast 2 which I know is very difficult to get a hold of and is very expensive particularly compared to other kind of daily trainer style shoes but I do think it's worth the money if you can get a hold of it now this is my second vers version of the shoe I had the allwhite version which unfortunately got stolen so I do have an additional pair and I've managed to very quickly kind of rack up the miles in the ax super my my second version of it and it as I said it has just been a shoe which I think know ticks a lot of the key boxes what I like about it is that for a shoe that is a pretty you know kind of well stacked shoe it is nice and light and it's kind of daily trainer style light in terms of that weight I think in terms of that experience of being out on it what aex has done with the midsole with what you're getting from the out soole as well in terms that control in terms that versatility in the shoe and terms of being a shoe I think and I've kind of mentioned this in other videos though the key for me with a a shoe like this which says that it can work for everything is that how for me it transitions between different Paces I think you know if I was out doing an easy Pace run I'm want to run more Tempo i' you know I feel most comfortable doing it in this shoe I have done in this shoe as I said I've done some racing this shoe this is a shoe if I was going away and I didn't really know what I was kind of running I was going to be doing this is a shoe that I know I can do it you know I've done want have gone away and wanted to do a quick park run I know I could be wearing this shoe you know traveling I know this is could be a shoe that I can race in or if I wanted to go and do a long Sunday run if I'm away from a weekend this is a shoe that I know is going to deliver a very good experience now as I said I know this is a hard to get a hold of shoe I know it's expensive particularly compared to other daily trainer shoes but I do think for me the as an all-in-one shoe a do it all shoe the best shoe that I've you know in that category that I've used this year has been this the Asic super Blast 2 it's absolutely a standout shoe and one I've absolutely loved running in as I said it's the one that probably spent most time running in post when we first reviewed it so we get to my number one pick for top running shoe launch of 20124 and again it was a tossup between two shoes for that top spot and the shoe that has missed out for me is the aex Met speed Sky Paris which I think we can all agree in a team is a fantastic racing shoe and what it is in premium carbon racing shoe it is a fantastic one and it really represents the progress that aex has made with the Met Speed Line and it's a shoe that absolutely I've enjoyed running in now the shoe that I've opted for over the Met speed Sky Paris is a shoe that launched early in the year again a little bit like the super Blast 2 it's probably the shoe that I've reached for I've look forward to reaching for the most it a shoe that I think represents Innovation for this brand I think this is a shoe that represents a you know just being a fun shoe to run in as well and I think that's been really important for me just find really enjoyable fun shoes to run in and the shoe that I have picked for my top spot is this and that is the haa cell X1 and this was the one of the first kind of carbon Racing shoes that launched this year very fortunate to have them in two versions and I'm glad that I do have two versions two vers of this shoe because this is a shoe I think for me that you know as I said I think Haw has had a really strong year and I think it's had a strong year because it's really tried to do something different with it shoes I think it's recognized it's had to do things differently I think it showed good progress in terms of the you know the midsole technology that it's using in its shoes I think for me the cell X1 really represents that I think you know it isn't the perfect shoe you know there's definitely some things to work on and we know there is a an upgraded version coming with the yellow the laces aren't perfect but I think everything else about it makes it a fantastic enjoyable shoe to run and when this landed I was you know getting to my kind of long training runs for London marathon and I did some of my favorite you know long kind of 20 mile runs in this shoe it is bouncy it's Lively you just roll through really nicely and I think you know the Hallmark of really good carbon you know shoe is that you know your legs don't feel beaten up that's really what it's about you roll through really nicely and that's what I've liked about the cell X1 you know I love it for long kind of you know more uptempo faster runs I've used them for track sessions I think you can RAC in this shoe if I had a marathon I think this would be the shoe that I would be looking to use I think it would be a close one between the metas speed Sky Paris and the pummer deviate Nitro Le 3 which I think for me are the standout kind of marathon shoes that I've used but there's just something about the cx1 that I just every time I put it on I just know I'm going to have a good time in this shoe and I talked about that fun element and that is definitely what I would associate with the c X1 and my time in C X1 so yeah it is an expensive shoe a lot of the you know Carbon ring shoes are but I think for me the one that stood out for me from the first run that I've done to all the runs I've done in it since and as I said being you Innovative being fun being a great long run shoe that is the shoe that I've enjoyed running in the most this year so that is the Haw yell X1 a fantastic shoe I think again really marks the strongly year that hawy has had this year with its shoes and the cell X1 I think really represents that for me and for me is my top running shoe pick of 2024 okay so they have it those are my top five favorite new running shoot launches of 2024 and as I said at the

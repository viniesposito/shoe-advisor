  "text": "whether you're gearing up for your first marathon or you've run loads before there are some classic mistakes that can turn your dream race day into a complete nightmare today I'm breaking down the biggest Marathon blunders that could sabotage your race day but most importantly I've got loads of solutions to those so you can run at your absolute best and secure an amazing run over the marathon from Pacing too fast to disastrous fueling choices and even that last minute temptation to try out new gear we've seen it all I've done most of these before I've leared the hard way over the years but I've got some really good news for you because if you stick around to the end I'll teach you all about how to ster clear of these pitfalls race smarter and have more fun out there and of course finish the Run strong right let's get stuck into probably the most common mistake of them all and that is going out too fast easily the most common mistake we see is people charging off far too fast at the start of the marathon they're feeling good they've got all that nervous to get rid of and they look down at their watch and it says they're going to do 715 a mile when they really want to be running along at 8 to do their 330 and then before they know it they've blown up at halfway and they're running and walking and the race is a complete nightmare when you go off at the start of the marathan of course you're going to feel good you're going to be out there for 3 four or 5 hours if your training's going okay the pace is going to feel very easy at the start of the marathon and this is really not the time to be thinking you can suddenly go and run a 310 marathon with when you've been training for a 330 so what are we going to do about this well no doubt you'll have a goal time in mind set off at that pace everyone's running with these fancy GPS watches these days they tell you how fast you're going look down at your watch if you want to be running 8 Minute miles or 5 minutes okay make sure that's what it says on your watch don't suddenly go off a lot faster than that ideally for the first few miles go off a little bit slower than that and ease up to your goal Pace as the race goes on so make sure you have a plan for your race know the paces that you want to be running at and be patient by the time that mile 20 rolls around you'll be overtaking a lot of people around you and be finishing strong believe me no one has ever gone out and magically run 20 30 minutes faster than they intended to over the marathon in as so many sports you can have really good lucky days where everything comes together with running it's not like that you're going to get out what you've put in in training so be realistic stick to your paces and run to the the ability that you've been training for some other top tips for not going out too fast monitor the lap Pace on your watch which will reset every kilometer or every mile if you've got laps turned on just focus on that ticking off every K as they go sticking at your pace potentially run with some other pacing groups that are going to be out there so if you want to run a three-hour Marathon stick with the three-hour pacing group they will make sure that you run the race nice and evenly all the way through and not burn out by going out too fast no doubt a lot of you out there will have been following our training plans which you can pick up at benp parks.com we'll link that down below loads of five-star rated training plans from thousands of Runners that have run some incredible times using our plans and one of the big features of our plans is practicing at your goal Pace during your long runs we like to put in blocks of goal Pace running there so you know what that feels like to be running at your go pace so practice at your go Pace know what that feels like look at your watch don't go off too fast use a pacing group if you want to something that isn't absolute classic over Race Day weekend is if you're going to a new city exploring somewhere that's exciting people spend far too much time on their feet The Day Before the Race I've done this mistake myself before I did 35,000 steps the day before I ran Amsterdam Marathon doing a bit of sightseeing I got to race day and felt obviously quite fatigued by doing that just because you might not be running that day it also means you want to be spending some time off your feet and relaxing go to the Expo means and then get back back to your hotel get back to your Airbnb and just relax if you particularly want to get out and do some sing maybe look up some segue tours out there a bus tour a boat tour something else to take you around the city other than your legs you want to be saving them but ideally plan to explore after your race walking is a fantastic way to recover after your Marathon one of the best things we can be doing so plan some sightseeing maybe for Monday and Tuesday when you can walk around and get that recovery process going that's definitely the best time to be sight seeing this is way more common than you think it would be but so many people use the OnCourse nutrition when they haven't practiced with it in their training this is especially a problem on trail races when there's a lot more selection to choose from than in Road marathons but it still happens in Road marathons as well and not only is this a problem for people trying the encourse nutrition it's also potentially problem from taking things from people in the crowd that are handing out jelly babies or some other gels out there they do mean really well and it's fantastic people come out and support runners in this way but if you haven't tried this stuff in your training then how do you know it's going to work and be okay with your stomach during race day your body and your guts are under a lot of stress when you're running and throwing something new in that could result in a few unwanted trips to the portaloo or pter poty for me I took some Lucas a sport during a race once like as one of the Lucas a drinks and I thought I've had this all the time when I've not been running I've never used it when I'm running what's the harm that can do well I found out was some disastrous consequences pretty soon after that with a pants round the ankle type situation your body works a lot differently when you are running the solution to something like this only put things in your mouth that you've used during your training try out lots of different products figure out what works with you in your training research what the race is giving out and potentially practice with that in your training as well if you do want to use the OnCourse nutrition fuel often fuel early fuel every about 30 to 45 minutes during the marath as well don't wait till you feel feel tired cuz that will be too late in the day practice carrying your gels in training for me I like to use a waistband a waist belt I can tuck all of my gels in there that I'm going to be using for the race practice what it feels like and you'll be absolutely fine getting it done on race [Music] day moving on to have a chat about weather and tough weather conditions and people not adapting to that now I get this 100% you put your heart and soul into your training get to race day feeling really good only to find out sudden it's going to be 25\u00b0 855 F or humid and bad weather conditions for running or potentially our worst nightmare windy conditions who remembers running the London marathon in 2017 or that year that the big half had these howling stormy winds your body's going to be working a lot harder to keep cool out there or battling through those winds burning through your energy stores a little bit quicker than you will be used to and if you push through this then you're going to be hitting the wall Very quickly you can put some things in place to delay this happening but it really will result in having to slow down and adjust your expectations for the race the solutions for something like this check the OnCourse weather during the buildup for the race now it's not really worthwhile to be panicking about this all week and the week before but just have some things in place that if it is going to be a hot day when you check a day or a couple of days before that you can then adapt if it's going to be warm then I say you need to adapt your pacing wear some sun cream take on some electrolytes in the buildups of the race and ideally as you're going around as well we a hat of course getting a hat from benp parks.com we sell the best running hats anywhere in the world thousands of festar reviews used by people in all sorts of different racing Trails roads and everything like that go and check them out and help support the channel here now the wind is a really really tricky one because there really isn't much you can do practice running in a group in some of your training and then you can share the lead if you're one of the faster Runners out there with not too many people around you and you can practice sort of drafting and then sharing the lead or if you are more of a mid pack Runner the roads are going to be a little bit busy then winds don't affect us as much as we might think they do in our training when we're just out there by ourselves suddenly you're in a big group and they don't affect us too much so don't panic too much about the wind we can usually get through that one okay something again that happens way more than you think it would be people that arrive late to the start line and then have to start at the back of the field add so much unnecessary stress and all that wasted energy weaving trying to overtake people to get up to Pace what I really always like to do with the races I do is practice that Journey from where you're staying to the start line the day beforehand or a couple of days beforehand if you have time have a backup plan if that goes wrong as well staying close to the start line is really important to me if I can afford it with the price of hotels and things in the running boom it's becoming harder and harder to do that but I always prioritize staying in maybe like a worst part of the city or a worse accommodation so long as it's near the start line and I can walk to the start line for a completely stressfree start to the day so pre-race fueling in the lead up to the race and the morning of again it's a really tricky thing especially when we are traveling to races if you're going abroad staying in a hotel then plan your dinner and breakfast during your training that you know you're going to be able to replicate in the day before and the morning of the race don't walk into the hotel breakfast thinking oh what do I fancy today I'm going to have this massive mound of porridge and honey and oats and stuff like this if you never had it that could be an absolute disaster keep it super simple Rice is available pretty much everywhere in the world as a night before car blad an absolute classic for race day morning is my Bagels but maybe there's not a toaster available I don't particularly like eating bagels without that so maybe Quant is a really good backup you can have them cold warm whatever you want Chuck some jam on them Quant are a really good thing you can buy again pretty much anywhere take them to the race and get those down potentially just having a peanut butter and jelly or Jam sandwich you can just practice that in your training and again you can use that on race day morning think of these things that you can just make up cereal with some milks make up these meals you can definitely replicate on your race day morning and you know they're going to work now I wasn't sure whether to put this one in because it's something that happens to me all the time I've never really seen it on any lists or anything I've ever seen over the years but I think it's such an important thing so let me know in the comments if you agree with this one and let us know what are your best race day tips to help out the running Community as well well now this is not ignoring nagging things as they happen during the race shoe issues clothing issues toilet issues things like that these will normally only get worse if you ignore them the classic one here is like something like a stone in your shoe it's just as simple get your shoe off get that stone out get it tied back up and in and get back on your run if you got a stone in your shoe your foot will probably be under tension trying to stop the pain and then you could develop quite a nasty little injury from just running in a different unnatural way get that stone out your shoe as quickly as you can with some clothing you might be getting chafing hopefully not because it's a clothing you've practiced in all the time but it can still happen on a particularly hot and sweaty day something like that grab a medical person grab some anti-chafe get it on there stop that chafing as soon as you can maybe you tied your shoes up too tight or too loose at the start again just stop adjust them don't let these issues become other issues you're going to be getting some blisses if they're too loose stopping off some circulation if they're too tight stop adjust them carry on I know this goes against a lot of a natural instinct you don't want to waste any time but when I've had these issues in the past myself I've always felt like I've made up more time in the long run by just addressing them really quickly using the L is another absolute classic I ran a 238 in Valencia last year including a l stop in a porta potty that was just for a number one but then I ran about 240 mid 240s or something at the uh in Denver at a marathon before with a full sit down loose stop during the race so don't worry you will feel so much better afterwards for just getting that out of your system as well and yes these things are annoying when they happen during the race but deal with them quickly and I guarantee you're going to make up that time now the final one here is an absolute classic wearing new shoes and new kit on race day again people do this all the time I've done it myself I've learned the hard way and now I'm making these videos to make sure you don't do it as well but again so many people go into this panic mode in the night before the race or the day before and just thinking I'm just going to suddenly use this brand new shoe because I've seen this influence us it or this professional athlete use it just being super boring is the best thing we can do in this situation no new shoes no new clothing no new gels no new breakfast if you are in any doubt at all about what sort of shoes and what gear to go go with the most comfortable ones running for three four or 5 hours is a hell of a long time you don't want to go with something that is potentially going to give you some issues and be uncomfortable even if you feel like it's going to be faster you're going to get some issues and you will run slower go with the most comfortable option out there but overall my message for this whole video is I don't want to panic everyone it's awesome that you're watching a video like this learning improving yourself I'm still learning I've run nearly a 100 marathons here in my lifetime and maybe about 10 of them have gone what I would call absolutely perfectly stuff always does crop up but we can really control is everything that's happening before our race and getting that right to really minimize the chance of things happening during the race so have a great time out there guys let me know how you get on if you want some specific advice on how to not hit the wall in the marathon and check out this video up here that video is coming up next that's it guys keep on working hard keep on getting done we'll see you very soon in the next one",

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Doug the country manager for Mount Coast uh and he has two new trail shoes for us from Mount to Coast um Mount to Coast if you don't know is an ultra Centric brand and their shoes can be used for more than just Ultra of course but from a trail running perspective I always think of Trail Ultra and why didn't we have trail shoes from the start but we do now um do you want to walk us through both new shoes and what we can expect let's start with this one this is uh the T1 this is our Trail shoe um we have a Kevlar uh knit woven into the upper so it's super durable it's uh uh water phobic it dries really fast uh similar to the R1 we have our dual lacing system so you get a comfort fit both in the 4 foot and in the in the ankle midfoot uh on the midsole and out sole we have vbr light bit um and mega grip so it's super light uh super grip uh to to attack Any Trail yeah uh and then we have uh Gator hooks so you can hook a gator onto the shoe so this would be the trail shoe that it's quite versatile and I've actually run in some prototypes of this shoe and yeah it's meant to be quite versatile right whether it's technical terrain you can run on some smooth stuff too a little lower to the ground it's a moderate stack height right yeah this is a a for millimeter drop yep yeah it's a really moderate you still get some of that ground feel that trail Runners most Trail Runners want but it seems like a good Do-it all kind of fits that speed goat category uh can kind of attack a lot of different trrain yeah yep definitely the the most technical trails in the US down to you know gravel and and rock great for all of that and what was the price point on this do you remember this is $180 launching June 1st great and how does that compar to the like the R1 or the M1 in terms of price or even in terms of fit for those who would be coming from that side into trail running with mountain similar fit as the R1 so it has the wider uh toe box um with the ability to cinch it up as needed similar to the R1 y exact let's talk about this one and this is one I have not been in but tell us more about this shoe yeah so this is the H1 meant for hybrid uh the the lugs are much less aggressive we have 2 mm lugs on the bottom and it's meant specifically to go to to run on road and to Trail so if you have a trail couple miles from your house it'll feel great on the roads and then it'll also grip the trails I I I'll definitely use this uh for the for the urban trails around my house I don't have technical stuff but it's perfect for like the dirt and gravel yeah and I mean it seems like just from the spec standpoint like it seems is it a little higher than the T1 so you're going to get a little more cushion a little more cushion yeah exactly and then this also has a new foam oh great uh so this has the same foam as all as the R1 and all our other shoes this is going to be a new foam called Circle cell uh uh the circle is because of the recy the the uh the green story in it this is the most durable and most green uh midsole it uses Pat pbat Uh as as the uh component so there's no petroleum products in it in the mid so like a um we always see Brands trying to bridge that gap between sustainability and have it in a practical Good Feeling shoe and this seems like that's the that's a true possibility yes th this is actually going to be more durable and better performance more energy return than our our original pH awesome awesome I mean seems like the best of all worlds um anything more you want to say about this it also has the Dual Lac grip the exact same one as uh as the R1 and it also has the Kevlar woven into the upper so very very similar upper between these two yeah awesome looks like two great offerings to jump us into the trail for Mount to Coast y we really excited thanks appreciate it",

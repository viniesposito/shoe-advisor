  "text": "if there is a preseason in the running shoe world it's the running event it's a running brand convention that showcases what's coming up in the next year and everyone looks like they've got a shot at winning it's also a pretty great time to catch up with some friends and colleagues so let's hop on a plane and head to Austin this is a runner's weekend at the running event 2024 [Music] yo what's going on just made it to the Airbnb in Austin this is the same place that I stayed last year a kafui run Club member owns this Airbnb so I love to be able to throw some business her and her family's way it's going to be a busy work week so even though it's been a really long travel day and I'm exhausted I just want to go get some dinner but first we got to go meet up with Tommy and Caitlyn who is the head organizer of this entire running event [Music] show Tommy was staying at the main TR Hotel the Hilton and I didn't film any of the two main meetings we had one was with the TR organizers as Tommy and I were going to be doing a social media takeover of the TR IG account the next day and then Tommy and I met separately because we were doing a seminar on social media for running stores also the following day afterwards Tommy and I got tacos at the hotel restaurant a productive efficient and quiet way to start TR [Music] 2024 good morning it's a little bit before 6:00 a.m. here is in Austin on a Tuesday my watch tells me I got 4 hours of sleep last night although it feels like I got a lot less a lot of tossing and turning last night bed was perfectly fine I just think I had a little bit too much coffee too late in the day yesterday and I just couldn't fall asleep got another busy day today first thing I got to do is I'm going to try to get in a little bit of extra mileage in before I meet Tommy for a run [Music] it was definitely a bit discouraging when I woke up and it was so dark to get going for this run but now that I'm on ladyb bird there are so many other Runners out here it's really quite nice to see [Music] all right got in a little bit more than 5 miles let's go find Tommy on the run this is Tommy's first run since finishing six marathons in one year [Music] that is the trail cleanup that I really wanted to do today because last year they had an option for you could pick up trash while you're jogging but there was also a kaying option and I was too afraid I'd fall in the water last year to do it this year I brought special clothes to do it so I was going to get him the kayak but I forgot that we had to film all this stuff now so I'm going to have to skip out on this year maybe another time [Music] Tommy runs Tommy kzi say your own name first hold on I want to get this actually y ready hold on oh God that's all in the mic I'm going to need a new microphone now I didn't realize it was going to be that aggressive all right ready I think I don't have Burgers I got Burgers you're dad you're good yo what's going on it is a kofuzi Tommy runs takeover of the TR social media account yep yep yo what's going on it is a kofuzi Tommy runs take over the TR social today is the first so it took us a few takes but Tommy and I got

mission was to find people to interview about why they were excited to be at TR all right we're here at TR what is your name my name is Amanda and who are you with Melora and what is your most what are you looking forward to the most here I'm looking yeah I'm looking forward to having genuine real authentic conversations with uh like-minded people but really focusing on having authentic conversations surrounding like diversity sustainability amplifying marginalized voices and giving them the platform that they deserve to have year round I'm excited about all those things I love that let's go let's do it what's up guys um first off let me know what who what your names are who you're here with and what you're excited about here at TR sweet uh I'm Joe H I'm Kevin ginan we're here we have an agency called footstep creative and we're just here we've been building in kind of stealth mode the last like two years so we're just trying to get in front of brands people in the industry and yeah what's your name Carlos who are you with we are media from Spain we're Road running review all right and what are you excited about for TR this week we're waiting for a lot of shoes lot good stuff new carbon plates new people of Pham so [Music] excited we had some time before our seminar so Tommy and I got some coffee then we went to the keynote session which featured lunch and then it was time for us to give our talk on social media for running retail now even though Tommy and I did this talk last year I was still pretty nervous the session was was really well attended the last time and we had a lot of return attendees as well as a number of media colleagues and friends so I felt like expectations were high but overall I think it went well Tommy did great we had a lot of good questions from the audience and I got a chance to really emphasize one of my core philosophies of the past couple years which is that running Brands running retail and running media can work together in alignment in win winwin scenarios and in the past those groups weren't always exactly on the same team I just don't think it has to be that way and I'm trying to change [Music] that all right just finished the session I think it went well I feel like I talked too much but uh we had some good questions at the end so that was good uh now I'm going to meet up with running Warehouse we're going to film something fun for YouTube I was going to walk over there by myself but the guys are all here checking in so I'm just going to hop in an Uber with them and we'll head over do something fun earlier in the year in Boston Connor from running Warehouse took the believe in the Run crew up to the Charles to check out what real Runners were actually wearing for their daily runs and now it was my turn to do some shoe spotting along ladyb bird Lake in Austin the whole thing was a bit overproduced with three cameramen and four cameras but it was a nice way to actually spend some time chatting about shoes with a friend and I think the video we made is going to be pretty good head on over to the running Warehouse YouTube channel And subscribe to see when that video drops finished shooting sneaker spotting with running Warehouse that was a lot of fun we saw a lot of shoes a really wide variety and ran into a bunch of friends so a really fun time to G out over shoes and reconnect with some people now I'm going to head back over to the convention center the hotel across the street is where the Hoka reception is so let's go check that [Music] out this was a lively and Loud affair with drinks food and a lot of people we got to see some displays of some upcoming shoes I caught up with some friends and then it was time for me to head to my next spot for the evening TR is a lot like graduation weekend everyone has a lunch in or a gathering that you're invited to so you got to keep moving in order to see everybody and my next stop was the as6 event I had a workout scheduled for the next morning so it was a bunch of hinin 0.0 for me but it was nevertheless really good to connect with everyone [Music] good morning it is a little bit before 7:00 a.m. on a Wednesday here in Austin didn't have too late a night last night I got home uh about 9:30 and then I was asleep by about 11: I think so I'm feeling pretty good about that had a much better night's sleep and that's a good thing cuz today I've got a big session on Deck but I have a little bit of surprise help for this workout one of the things that can kind of happen at the running event is you might have a chance encounter get a chance to run in an upcoming development or secret shoe so I ran into someone last night and that person asked if I was going to go for a run today I said I have some intervals on deck and they said that would be perfect for a upcoming prototype shoe that they'd love to get some early non-elite Runner feedback on they have some pros who have run in it and they want to know what non- Elites might think about it so I said I have some 800 m on deck and they gave me a pair of shoes to run in now I can't show you the shoes I can't photograph the shoes can't really tell you much about the shoes either but I'm really looking forward to it it should be fun so apologize that uh I can't show them to you but uh I'm pretty excited about it [Music] finished the workout that was hard but this shoe is amazing I still do have a lot of notes can't wait to tell you about it don't know when that would be for now I'm going to finish this cool down and then get ready to head with the exhibit hall [Music] Flor all showered up let's get ready to head over to the running event I got a day jam-packed full of appointments with all of the running shoe brands my plan of attack for today is to do all the shoe brands on Wednesday and then the apparel and Nutri brands on Thursday first thing before I do any of that though is I got to get some coffee and some [Music] snacks yo if you could bring back one shoe what would it be oh I'm so excited about the new stuff and need something old give me something old uh I'm going to go with the original Nike epic react uh or no the lunar lunar the lunar epic is my favorite the high top with the stretchy knit upper and then uh I would go for a run with kzi energy levels are already high everyone's here everyone's excited things are shiny and new can't wait first appointment is with diodora diodora is an Italian running shoe brand that has recently rededicated itself to Performance running and they've only recently started reaching out to me to review their shoes so for our meeting I was happy to be able to speak with the product people to get an introduction to the entire lineup diodora also has a 100 steps philosophy to their shoe design their design prototyping and run testing departments all sit within 100 steps from each other in their headquarters in Northern Italy allowing for quick feedback with little Lost in [Music] Translation that's going to be it from deodora it's good to get a complete rundown of the lineup from them well not a complete but uh everything except the stability shoes and now let's go see k run I've never talked to them before so that should be interesting let's see what they got kiun is a te cathlon brand and if you don't know what T cathlon is it's kind of like a Trader Joe's but for sports equipment they sell a bit of everything but all the brands are inhouse and they're pretty good but value oriented so Ki and trying to stand out sep separately as a performance running brand it's kind of like if that Trader Joe's frozen pizza you like we're trying to compete in an actual pizza making competition but also in a lot of ways Ki Run's challenges are kind of the same as the challenges that Sketcher performance faces in relations to its parent Sketchers we spent some time talking about the shoes at kiun and about how they could try and make their debut into the US market given the challenges that they might be facing and it'll be interesting to see what they get up to in the next few years 11:00 I'm supposed to be somewhere I don't know where okay so my next appointment was at Brooks and they always show up big for TR for 2025 they're tweaking their Foams again DNA tune is going to be an update to their super critical Foams where they're using dual density Source compounds that when placed under pressure and heat and then injected with nitrogen gas in other words super critical IED it results in Foams that have firm sidewalls and squish G centers it's a format that we've seen Puma use to great success with their forever run and I look forward to seeing it in the glycerin I'm also really excited for DNA gold which is Brooks's long awaited entry into the Pea midsole Market the Hyperion Max will hopefully be getting the true max treatment with the use of partial DNA gold next year and we will also see an all DNA gold shoe from Brooks later in 2025 and finally I'm particularly intrigued by this update to the the ghost Max it looks like it's getting treatment similar to what we've seen in the glycerin Max and I hope this shoe is as fun to run in as it looks that's it from the Brooks Booth a lot of exciting changes coming very happy with what I'm seeing there all the things that I wanted to happen to Two Shoes specifically Hyperion Max and Hyperion Elite 5 are happening I don't think I could tell you very much more about hyper5 but we did hear a lot about it and it's you're going to be surprised going be surprised uh now I have a little bit of time before our next appointment so let's get something to eat my plan originally was to try and avoid eating food at Teri because the concessions are always pretty disappointing for vegetarians I did have an empanada and a bean taco in my bag that I had picked up in the morning from the convenience store but since I did have some bonus time in my schedule I thought I'd give concessions another try I got some kind of chicken noodle dish minus chicken and while I appreciate everyone who worked very hard to make this dish tasty I did not enjoy it finished with lunch actually had to eat lunch today that was nice now let's check out what these guys are to for those who can't make it in person to tr there is a live stream of the show hosted by my friends at PR project this is the second year that Aaron Tommy and Gary were hosts for this two-day live show and this year this set was a much more chill living room Vibe with video production and streaming hosted by flow track Tommy hello how's it how's PR project going PR project is going really well TR live is is uh is is popping we had a lot of great guests and we covered some really cool things and talked about a lot of the Innovation that's happening in the industry as a whole uh Gary crushed it Aaron crushed it and and big shout out to the guests all right two questions two what are those these are the on cloud monster I mean Cloud Surfer 2 nice I like the color blocking on that yeah all right second question yeah if you could bring back any one running shoe what would it be oh man oh oh oh um that's a really good question oh I I bring back the first uh Nike Infinity all right react I like that a lot I like that a lot thanks my next appointment was with Adidas now a few years ago there was an issue with me filming some shoes that they had put on display in their booth and on their mannequins and since then Adidas has switched up how they present at TR now they have a facade to their Booth but all discussions happened behind closed doors and to make my life easier I pretty much consider everything we talked about back there to be under embargo and besides anything that is really interesting will end up on my desk later when the time comes and I can actually run in it so I'm not in a hurry to post about stuff that's coming later although because I am a reference size I did get to try on a lot of stuff and I will say that 2025 is going to be a good year for Adidas just got done with a lengthy meeting with Adidas it was really good very excited for what's to come can't tell you about any of that quite yet next let's go visit some friends at Muno I think they've been up to some stuff [Music] mauno is a Japanese brand that has been struggling with how to modernize without alienating their legacy fan base there is a very clear road map on exactly how to do this laid out by some of their compatriot competition and this year mauno seems to finally be taking that to heart with their mystery shoe lineup for TR mauno unveiled a series of four mystery shoes that are intended to both move the company forward while also re-energizing the base mystery shoe 01 however pequs my interest the most as it doesn't have a wave plate plus it's got a knitted upper and a super squishy foam it's all the things I like so I'm really looking forward to testing this [Music] one just finished at luno I like it when Brands modernize and I feel like that's what's happening with the zuno very interested to see what's going on with the secret shoe 0102 03 and 04 getting very tired but still have to continue to more appointments next let's go to under arour I don't recall if under arour has been to tr before but it's the first time that I can remember visiting them I've reviewed a couple of their shoes recently but it was good to get a walk through on the rest of their running shoe lineup they also showed me this double boa speed Len collab the velocity Elite 3 Proto that Sharon ly wore in New York and I got to meet Sharon L and wey kotti I had seen Sharon speak at an Under Armour event in New York earlier in the month but it was good to actually get a chance to introduce myself and I've also seen Wy win the usatf 5K championships a couple of times in New York so it was great to finally meet her too so I introduce myself as a Mike and then as I'm leaving Sharon goes to way and goes this is kofuzi he has a really good makes really good running content and then waynie was like oh I've seen that before so that was really flattering and maybe she has maybe she hasn't but I'm going to take it as a win and look at this guy good to see you man how are you up I'm doing great Hoka had a lot to discuss at TR the Clifton and the Bondi will be getting updates this year and the impression that I got is that these models will more Target the RunWalk consumer and this seems to be an industry wide Trend where the Legacy franchises are designed to be intra points for those who are curious about the brand or for those Runners who don't like their running shoes changing all that much these core franchise models will become Dependable year-over-year experiences for the shoe NS who want something a bit more modern Hoka has updates for you too the clo X1 2.0 not the clo X2 but the clo X1 2.0 gets a major redesign the cutout will flip from the lateral to the medial side for smoother superation I'm told the shoe will lighten up quite a bit and Hoka was also proud to announce that the laces will be changing on this shoe which I've gone on record multiple times saying that the laces on the original C X1 were just fine the Mach X will also get an update but it's just an upper update this year with an aes's flare which makes it less distinguished visually from the regular Mack but it should resolve the issue that many of you had where the back of the shoe bit into your Achilles hey it's m what's up everyone if you could bring back one shoe from history what would it be that's a great question okay if I could bring back one shoe from history I think it's going to be the Reebok float ride energy 3 it's only a couple years old but I I really thought that was a solid daily trainer it was Priced Right and it was just a it was a good shoe a few years ago Sketcher performance kicked me out of their booth at TR and I haven't been back since but this year they actually requested a meeting now they didn't want me filming anything unless they could approve it prior to publication so I ended up just not filming anything but they did let me try on a shoe and run on it in a treadmill and it was pretty fun on was very selective in what they showed me which I appreciated I prefer the new cloudtech phase shoes and that's pretty much all they showed me for next year there will be three major updates the cloud Surfer will get a bit less mushy in the midsole but a bit more puffy in the upper the cloud Surfer next will be a speedier cloud Surfer experience and the cloud Eclipse will cease to exist and will instead become the cloud Surfer Max it will lose a torsion plate that I thought was pretty useless anyway the arrangement of the cloudtech phase changes significantly and I think most importantly for many of you they are putting tiny little ridges in the clouds so that it shouldn't squeak they also showed me the cloud boom Max which is another one of those attempts at a carbon plated shoe for the masses a race day shoe for middle and back of the pack personally I think every other Brand's attempt at this kind of shoe has been either patronizing and overpriced or underwhelming and dull and while this one is going to be expensive although not that expensive for an on shoe the way that they explained the design and construction of the shoe didn't feel like it was gatekeeping to me so I'm not mad at this one at least not for now Stephen you know what question I'm going to ask I do if you're going to bring back one shoe from any time in history what would it be oh anytime in history oh does have to be like the last year like do you have a favorite old shoe oh yeah from any time that you can think of and you wish you could bring it back shoe that instantly popped into my mind was the Hoka Nepali okay I loved the Nepali so lightweight it was like a cheap shoe I could throw on my feet and go run tons of miles in I Lov that ship [Music] for the past couple of years A6 has focused on one main shoe only at TR and this year it was the Nimbus 27 it gets a pretty mild update and will remain a pretty comfy shoe I did get a chance to run in the shoe the following morning and I can say that it feels a bit smoother than the Nimbus 26 which felt a bit clunky to me so I appreciate the small [Music] change next up is my faite Underdog toppo I reviewed the Cyclone 2 a while back so I'm excited to try the upper update for the Cyclone 3 and I'm also excited to delve further into the Topo lineup with a shoe I haven't tried before the Phantom 4 and it's updated zip [Music] foam okay that is the last meeting I have for today now it's happy hour time pretty much like every other booth has a little bit of a spread and a little bit of like viations to celebrate the end of day one I am going to try and find the TAA happy hour cuz I told them I'll stop up back in college I used to live in the tea mush flipflops I bought pair after pair after pair and after college it always felt like a real Miss to me that tea didn't quite catch the recovery slide wave so this year I accepted the request to stop by forh hour with the hopes that I would find a way to fall in love with tea again and while the hiking water sports and running sandals don't really resonate with me I am quite liking some of the winter and casual wear boots that tea is [Music] making Megan if you could bring back one shoe from history what would it be oh man I loved the Hoka elvon it was the best shoe sort of responsive little bit clunky sometimes but it was just a consistent good shoe and then it just disappeared if you could bring back one shoe which would it be okay I'm going to go to the 808s 1981 air Mariah my Marathon PR shoe if you could bring back one shoe what would it be the mauno Elixir I think I know what the answer is but if you could bring back one shoe into production what would it be it would be the Nike alphafly one mow here if you could bring back one shoe what would it be tart Edge as T Edge Hoka please if there are any size 10 and a half samples still in the back room I will pay for them Evo Speedo it is in my opinion not just the greatest Trail shoe of all time but I'll run on the road or the treadmill whatever in that shoe so send it my way the Nike Lunar Glide I wore that thing all the time every single day I don't know if it's the best running shoe but it just meant so much to me in like high school or middle schore or whatever it was please bring it back Sketchers Go Run speed Trail hyper sorry you brought back a Sketchers yeah I know I love the throwback waffle Racers the ogs I think there's something about that is just like very pure honest and um just kind of like very much of the time so I would bring those back [Music] the next morning started early at 7:00 a.m.",

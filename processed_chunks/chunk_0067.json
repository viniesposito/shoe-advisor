you know there's somebody right next to you pushing you kind of thing it's it's amazing it was hard the last half mile but I was I was moving fast but it was quite painful I'm not trying to trying to

one oh this I like a good let's go yum yum yum [Music] oh my my we survived another Peak yes we did everybody little feton don't mind if I do to celebrate this fine fine day oh nothing like a good steak if you know what I mean and why celebrate you know when you know no no FK no PR no W today um but I am celebrating because I'm healthy after a big summer huh a big summer of training and more importantly I was able to share this entire summer with Joseph all right fkt is in Colorado racing in Italy now Pike PE and and and I'm 100% you probably picked up on it on straa or wherever else I'm out of Crossroads everybody I'm not going to be racing much in the future without the family in fact at all that's the goal is it's all about the family it's always been about the family but as the kids get older you learn you well you learn but you know like okay these are the moments these are the like to you know to to win races I love it it I will continue to strive just I'm not I'm not giving up on racing or chasing down PRS personally or chasing down course records depending on where I'm racing I'm not giving up on that but at the end of the day it's the hugs at the finish line that's what matters you guys know that and so that is why I'm eating the filet monion is that I was able to celebrate on top of the mountain down in Manu here and give hugs and high fives and fist bumps to everybody up on the mountain you're amazing for waking up early and driving up the mountain but then everybody at the award ceremony shout out to Shan uh for just Dawn oh my goodness Dawn getting the footage up on top of the mountain like that's what racing is all about that's what is sharing the experience with other people cuz if you're sharing it alone that's sad like that's no fun so it's all about ex meeting all of you giving you hugs high fives and so yes I'm going to finish this steak enjoy it while while it's hot and I love you onward and upward and um we'll keep we're going keep fighting we're going to keep working hard and now I got a team of team of videographers the boys shout out to the boys for filming all day long getting the shots thank you boys you're the best so onward and upward we'll toss it to the Pikes Peak playlist right there and um oh man I'll break down the race what happened on the mountain sooner rather than later I don't know when but sooner rather than later all right see beauty work hard and love each other",

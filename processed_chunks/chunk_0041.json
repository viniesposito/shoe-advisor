  "text": "to be very honest I will admit that every time I hear about a new Under arour Elite athlete signing I really wonder what the heck are they going to do all their daily training miles in but now there seems to be a bit of an answer this is the under arour infinite Elite and it's time to take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kzi and I'm a non- elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the new Under arour infinite Elite but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that underarm are sent to me for the purpose of review so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the Under Armour infinite Elite and let's start with the specs this is a at least on paper a 36 mm stack heite shoe with an 8 mm drop giving us 28 mm of stack heite in the forefoot now this is a very big shoe and I I get that like sometimes shoes want to make the shoe appear even bigger and taller than it actually is or sometimes they just want to create sidew walls for your foot to kind of sit inside and so the foam comes up higher than what your heel or the bottom of your foot actually sits on but I think with 36 mm as the stated stack height for this sh I think they may be just giving us the number of the foam that's in this shoe and then the actual measure sack I think is easily going to be way over 40 mm cuz this shoe is very big now the main thing that's in this shoe or the only thing that's in this midsole is under armour's new hover plus midsole foam material now Under Armour isn't disclosing exactly what the formulation of hover Plus is or at least I don't have that information available to me at this time but it is one of those beaded Foams that to me looks and feels a lot like the power run plus that we used to see in the older versions of the S Triumph series and very similar at least in appearance uh to what we used to see in Adidas back when they had just regular boost now to protect all this midsole foam Under Armor is applying what they're calling thin web Rubber outo and there are some exposed areas of foam in the shoe to help keep some weight down but even though it's called thin web there is a very generous and thick application of that outsole material on the shoe especially in some of the higher wear areas there is a lot of rubber on the bottom of this shoe moving to the upper we have what Under Armor is calling their intella knit it looks like a knit material and it has the word knit in it but it doesn't exactly feel like a knit material it's not as stretchy soft or as comfortable as I would normally think of when I'm thinking about a knit material now there is also a lot of padding and foam on the tongue and around the heel cup and onto this Achilles flare to help try and make sure that the fit is accommodating to a wide variety of heel shapes and also to make it feel a little bit more luxurious and there is a big TPU heel clip to help make the shoe stay stable all these things add up to quite a bit of weight Under Armour lists this shoe coming in at a a chart topping 11.8 o for a usmen size 9 I actually weighed mine and mine came in substantially lighter still heavy but it came in half an ounce later at 11.3 Oz and 320 G now that we've talked about what the shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on foot and despite the heavy weight of this shoe this under arour infinite Elite is a very promising shoe and it gives me some excitement for what Under Armour may be able to release in the future now it was a bit firm for a daily training shoe for my preferences as someone that loves super squishy shoe and I didn't exactly love it when I used it for cool down miles after a workout so it's not exactly a Max cushion shoe for me either although for my bigger taller friends this may be just right but for me this shoe became most interesting when I was picking up the pace just a little bit every everything in that kind of easy to moderate range that's where this foam really started to get exciting so if you've got a run with some light past changes in there this shoe is a really fun Cruiser now I mentioned earlier that it visually reminds me of sakon's power run plus and it definitely on foot feels a lot like some of those older versions of power run plus and it even kind of reminds me of power run PB or at least some of the really early versions of power run PB when it was a little bit firmer of a formulation overall it kind of reminds me a lot of Styrofoam but in a good way even when I pick it up and touch it it kind of has that styrofoam kind of feel to it and while that might not sound the most kind of exciting when you are putting just a little bit more into the shoe when you're picking up the pace a little bit I feel like then the compression and decompression works just right for me and it gives me a nice sense of Rhythm and bounciness that I'm really enjoying for some of those daily training runs that might have a little bit of spice spilt in to them it's unfortunate for me though that the shoe is quite heavy cuz otherwise I think that this shoe really could give the super blast or the Invincible a run for their money now the other area where I feel like this shoe comes uh quite a bit short is in the upper now I love a good knit material and I feel like I'm the last Advocate left out there for bringing knit materials back into running shoes I think they're super comfortable I love to wear them I feel like they're great for a running performance product but it's a material that seems to be going away I appreciate that Under Armour is trying to bring it back here but this execution just isn't it it's not stretchy like it should be it's not comfortable like a knit material should be or at least when I hear the word knit or if you're going to put the word knit into a trademarked product name and I feel like especially visually speaking there's just a a lot left to be desired with the way that this shoe is executed there's just something about it that's really frumpy that I'm just not enjoying in terms of the visual aesthetic of the upper it it fits reasonably well it's overly padded and it's a little bit of a sweat sponge from a visual perspective and from a performance perspective there's a lot more that could have been done to really elevate a shoe that's going to be called infinite Elite but if you're old school and are the kind of person that says we don't choose a running shoe by color or it doesn't matter what a running shoe looks like then I feel like the Under Armour infinite Elite is something you should definitely consider because although it is a little bit heavy it's a pretty fun shoe to run [Music] in now this is normally the part of the video where I like to take a moment to step back and see where the shoe I'm reviewing might fit within a broader lineup of shoes within a running shoe brand the only difficulty here is that Under Armour hasn't always been the most consistent when it comes to their dedication to the performance running space now I've been running in Under Armour shoes for years uh remember one of my favorite Under Armour shoes that they've ever made was the CGR hover mid it was a midrise winter shoe that had a knit material that I actually really enjoyed it had like the Bluetooth chip inside the heel and it connected to map my run so I was an early adopter of Under Armour performance running and I really like those shoes but I just feel like over the years they didn't really change those shoes very much UnderArmour running shoes kind of always look the same like UnderArmour running shoes so I've kind of lost interest in what they had to offer although this under arour infinite Elite definitely is a big step in the right direction and I feel like if I were to kind of build an UnderArmour running shoe rotation with the product that they have now at least the product that I'm aware of that I've tested it would kind of basically be built around the Under Armor infinite I would use it for my easy runs my recovery runs even my long runs with some Pace changes in it uh this is the shoe that I would use for the most of my training even more so than in another Brand's running shoe lineup for their daily trainer just because there just aren't as many other Under Armour models that I'm as excited about right now and then the only other shoe in the rotation that I would probably put in would be uh The Rao if you wanted to stay within under arour for your race product as well and this is the under armor flow velocity Elite version 2 it has a great track record Sharon Leti has won the New York Marathon in it came in fourth in the Paris Olympics in it came second in the Boston Marathon in it so the shoe has quite a pedigree uh but it's a shoe that I haven't exactly loved it has biopbs in it which is a little bit firmer than regular packs but I do appreciate the attempt at some eco-friendliness there and it does have a carbon fiber plate but it also has this bottom layer of super critical foam and in the heel there's quite a a bit of it and so I feel like this is a fast shoe that some people like Sharon loes of the world can run fasten but for me it's not really a shoe that I love for marathons it's something that I would take for like 5K 10K racing maybe up to the half marathon but as far as like what's in the Under Armour lineup now these are kind of the two shoes and you can certainly have a really great time running with a two shoe rotation and for Under Armour this is what it would look look like now let's wrap up the video by going over the buy and guide and we'll also talk about some Alternatives that you may want to also consider the Under Armour infinite Elite is a pretty good option for long runs and for daily training for my high mileage Runners and for my bigger taller friends this might be the perfect level of cushion for you for your daily training needs and I think if you're an athlete coming over from a different sport or a team sport or a ball sport like a lot of under arour customers are I feel like this is going to be a really good option for you to get into the running community and at $160 I think that the price is very fair but let's take a look at some of the competition to see what that $160 will get you now already in this video we've talked quite a bit about the sakon power R plus Foams so let's talk about one of my favorite Power R plus shoes from sakon and that's the Triumph and I'm looking specifically at versions 20 and 21 which were I think pretty much the same shoe maybe just a different upper or a slightly changed upper version 22 got substantially different it got a different foam so that's going to be a little bit different of an experience and I think less similar to what you're getting in the infinite Elite now the power on plus is also a beaded foam and it looks and feels very similar to what we're getting out of the Under Armour infinite elit hover plus mids foam and I feel like those two shoes can be used very similarly both of these shoes are a little bit firm for my daily training preferences and they're kind of built like Max cushion shoes but I feel like once you start moving in them just a little bit quicker than easy that's when the shoes start to really come to life and that's why I feel like the cushioning for me feels at its best the Triumph 20 and 21 used to retail at the same price as the Under Armour infinite Elite at $160 but since the Triumph 21 has been around for a while you can find it still some places for around $120 and I feel like that's something you should definitely consider and then the other shoe that I think we should take a look at is the shoe that I always compare the Triumph against because it's another shoe that has beaded Foams as one of the first shoes to use beaded Foams that's from Adidas and that's the ultra boost this is the ultra boost 5x and it's got a different formulation of boost this time it's got light boost in it which is a lighter formulation of the regular boost material that initially made the ultra boost line so popular now the light boost material as the name implies makes the foam a little bit lighter but I also feel like it's got a little bit less rebound to it it's a little softer and a little bit mushier which for a shoe that's called Ultra boost and is kind of in that Max cushion category I feel like that's the right move and progress for that shoe so if you want something that's a little bit more comfortable looks a lot better and a little bit more cushioned then I would say go with the ultra boost it is going to be at a premium though cuz it comes in at $180 so those are my thoughts on the Under Armour infinite Elite let me know in the comments if you have any other questions or better yet stop by the live stream that I do over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel Mondays and Thursdays I'd love to see you guys over there in the chat that's all I for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music]

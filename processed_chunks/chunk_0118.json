  "text": "Max cushion shoes have become a really popular segment in the running shoe market recently with loads of options now available and more and more Runners choosing to go for these massive Foams these Max stack shoes are often marketed as the shoe that's going to provide that ultimate Comfort to protect your legs from the impact of the roads with all that foam underneath us I've personally been enjoying getting a lot of my runs done in this style of shoe recently so today I thought I'd break down my six fa shoes in this section letting you know what's different about them all my likes and dislikes to help you with your buying decisions when you're looking for this type of shoe and as always with everything here on the channel I bought all of these shoes 100% with my own money to give you my completely honest unbiased thoughts thanks to everyone that supports this channel by liking the videos sharing them with their friends and commenting down below with your thoughts on the best Mac stack shoes out there and also everyone that checks out my website benp parks.com we've got amazing running hat training plans and Technical gear to help you with your running and feel free to use code YouTube 10 for 10% off your next order right let's get stuck into all the shoes now we've got six to go through starting at the cheapest finishing with the most expensive starting out with a new balance more version 5 I've been enjoying this shoe for a few months now using it for a lot of my recovery runs which is where this shoe is best price-wise this sent me back \u00a340 stack kite 44 mil at the back of the shoe 4 mm drop overall and coming at 374 G for me in my UK size 12 a little bit on the heavy side as a lot of these shoes are on this list today we've got new balances Fresh Foam X midsole extra soft extra squishy very very plush here this really does feel like you've got some marshmallows under your feet and finally it was true to size for me well let's start out chatting about the lights with the shoe it was supremely comfortable and very very soft this is going to be really good if you like that very plush sinking into the foam type feeling with a shoe like this there is a good width to the base of their shoe a lot of surface area on the bottom here so you do feel surprisingly stable in them given how soft it is as well it's also got a really nice rocker here at the front of the shoe really helps you get a nice leg turnover going there and the upper with the shoe provides a really accommodating area at the front of the shoe so if you've got wide feet you're going to be good here but there is an extra wide option so if you have got particularly wide feet then go and check that one out and this is a great option also not just for runners but everybody wanting some all day Comfort whether you're walking working whatever you're doing if you want a shoe for traveling something like that this is going to provide you that all day comfort with running and everything you choose to do in it dislikes with the shoe the upper is quite thick potentially some breathability issues there if you are running in the shoe in a particularly hot climate and really with the shoe this is just easy and Recovery runs over this foam is so so soft so you really aren't going to be picking up the pace too much in this shoe but it's going to look off your legs supremely well out there so in summary with the New Balance Mo version 5 this is the cheapest shoe here by Longway some pretty good value at 140 perfect for someone that's going to love that super soft super squidgy super plus type ride right moving on let's have a chat about a puma shoe coming up next so this is a puma magmax Nitro a very new shoe here from Puma their first real contender in this Max stack height type of area this is for your easy runs your recovery runs but also your long runs you can go for a long way in this and pick up the pace a little bit better than you could in the New Balance treee there price-wise quite a lot for a puma shoe here \u00a3170 stack kite 46 mil absolutely crazy at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and 366 G for me in my UK size 12 we've got Pumas Nitro foam midsole and the sizing was pretty good here it was true to size for me well let's have a chat out some of my likes with the shoe firstly the outsole with the shoe is very very grippy the pumer grip outsole is absolutely fantastic a great winter option here many people say pummer outso are some of the very best out there and this one delivers fantastically well it's also a good stable option here again surprisingly stable here in the corners you're not going to have to worry about rolling and ankling this one the ility is coming from this foam it is definitely on the stiff side on the dense side so you're definitely not going to be wallowing it doesn't have that soft marshmallowy feeling that the New Balance had this one's a lot firmer your feet sit slightly below that top level of the midsole so you're getting a really good lock down there with this really nice upper as well you're also getting a surprising amount of energy return a lot of Popp and springiness and responsiveness from this foam here which is Puma's highest end foam so you can definitely pick up the pace a lot more than you expect with a shoe that is quite this size you don't notice the all that weight and that bulkiness with the shoe as much as you doing some of the ones that are coming on a little bit later in this video and also the upper with the shoe is really quite nice and very breathable as well if you are running some hotter climates get some good air flow coming through here dislikes with the Puma sadly although it's the second cheapest shoe here is definitely on the expensive side for a puma shoe which is really because the amount of pummer highest end foam that's in this shoe it just warrants putting the price up to what it is but it's still cheaper than most of the ones out there so maybe it's a positive at \u00a3170 shoes are going absolutely crazy these days and then the final dislike it is a little bit on the narrow side a lot of Puma shoes are on the narrow side so if you're someone that has narrow or sort of Fairly sanded feet you're going to be okay but a wider footed person is probably going to want to look elsewhere so in summary with the shoe this is a really great option for someone looking for a very stable firmer and more versatile ride than something like the new balance is offering and it's really going to be suitable for the your easy Pace your steady Pace your marathon pace and your longer runs and you've got the best grip out of all of these options as well so if you're looking for a good winter shoe option this is definitely the one to be going for right going up a little bit in price now is the aex GEL Nimbus 26 a shoe I had earlier on this year I used it and then it was time for it to be retired and I don't have it here anymore but really enjoyed putting a lot of a Cas through that shoe the purpose of something like the S6 Joe number 26 this is definitely very similar to the New Balance here your easy and Recovery runs price-wise it sent me back \u00a380 stack height at the back 42 millim and then an 8 mm drop overall weightwise 373 G for me in my UK size 12 the midso we're getting a lovely Big Slab of the FF blast Eco plus to really help absorb all that impact from the roads and sizing wise it was true to size for me starting out with the lights with the ax it comes in three different widths which is really fantastic standard wide and extra wide so if you're someone that has a slightly wider foot this is definitely going to be one of the ones to have a look at the upper is super soft and super stretchy this gives a fantastic lock down Ultra breathable and Ultra comfortable as well it's actually Market as the most comfortable running shoe and it's really hard to disagree with that it came top of the list when I did my most comfortable shoe video at the start of this year and I'll link to that up here and down in the description as well and I had absolutely no overheating no hot spots no blisters or anything like that but as I say it's not all smiles we've got some dislikes to go through quickly as well like the more version 5 at the start of the video the shoe is best at those easy and Recovery run Paces the foam isn't quite as soft as the New Balance but it's still very much on the soft side New Balance very very soft this is just very soft so don't expect to be picking up the pace in this one too much for me I use this just as much second run of the day type shoe when I just wanted to look after my legs so in some if Comfort is your main priority then this is definitely a good one to be looking at as I say this is my recovery on shoe that I used for the first half of this year and it looked after my legs fantastically well plus there's some really good discounts on the 26 now because the 27 isn't far away apparently right let's move on to the next one we're talking about Brooks right this is a new shoe from Brooks The Brooks Glycerin Max and I think it's a really nice looking shoe as well let me know what you think down in the comments this is I think one of the best best looking shoes that Brooks have produced the purpose of the glycerin Max this is an easy and Recovery run shoe as well but it's going to be really good at the long runs it's a little bit firmer a little bit more responsive you're getting a little bit more propulsion to look after yourself deep into those long runs price-wise 1880 stack height at the back of the shoe 45 mm and a 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise 375 gram midsole with a shoe we've got Brooks's DNA tuned cushioning here basically we've got two different types of density Foams we've got some larger cells at the back for some nice Airy soft Landings and some smaller density Foams at the front just to help with that Poppy toe off and you can kind of feel that working in there I'm not going to lie sizing wise this was true to size for me right let's start out with the likes now this is the closest feeling shoe I've ever found to the best shoe in class here really which is the aex super blast version 2 just very very similar mid sole feeling that you get with the shoe the midsole is definitely a lot firmer than You' expect for a 45 mil stack shoe but it's bouncy and has really fantastic energy return as well the rocker at the front of the shoe is really quite pronounced and it gives you a lovely transition through the foot strike encourages a really good turnover so it really helps disguise the weight and the bulkiness of this shoe because it is a very big shoe here but also with so much cushioning and a lot of padding around the heel there and this engineered mesh upper getting a good amount of air flow coming through there it's a really comfortable ride and as everything with Brooks everything I've ever tested really great build quality with this shoe really feels like a very good quality product and durability is going to be high on a shoe like this we've got a fantastic rubber outso here providing some really good winter grip as well right let's move on to chat about a few of the dislikes and what really sets this shoe apart from the super blast is you just really can't get away from the weight and the bulkiness in the shoe the superl is nearly 100 G lighter which is just of course you're going to notice something like that and you can just pick up the pace far better in the super blast but yeah marathon pace and slower it's just going to look after your legs really well if you do want to do some speed and some workouts in it you're going to get a good extra workout with the extra sort of bulkiness and the weight in this shoe so maybe it's not all bad but yeah just weight and bulk unfortunately do let this shoe down right let's have a chat about the summary with this one this is just a really great shoe for someone is looking for a larger size shoe this goes all the way up to a uk14 Brooks offers some really great versatility across a lot of their line unfortunately they're not offering this in wide at the moment hopefully that will come soon but the width in the shoe is surprisingly generous as well so another good wide option there if you have a slightly wider foot and if you like a kind of a little bit more of a firmer feel Under Foot then as I say this is going to be a really good option right moving on to the hoker Skyward X the biggest shoe here the biggest shoe I've ever reviewed 48 mm stack heite at the back of this shoe absolutely crazy this is for your easy runs recovery runs and longer runs as well this sent me back \u00a385 here in the UK stack C just said 448 mm stack height 5 mm drop overall this is absolutely crazy you're going to feel so tall in this shoe you sit right on top of that 48 mm stack kite you currently can't feel any of the ground weightwise 370 8 G for me in my UK size 12 midso we've got two different layers of foam in this shoe one layer of super soft premium peber foam from Hoka and then one layer of that super critical Eva for addit durability and you're also getting a carbon plate in this shoe as well which is added in there to add a lot more extra stability with this amount of Stack height and this amount of softness that you get in the shoe you really going to need that plate in the shoe to hold it all together sizing wise this was true to size for me starting out with my likes with the shoe this is just really good fun to run in the softness the stability that the shoe provides and that plate when you pick up the pace it's just an all around fun package it puts a smile on your face it feels really quite smooth through the foot strike despite a lot of bulk in the shoe and a lot of weight in the shoe as well it feels really good quality it's a very good build quality here from hoker and really great for that long time on feet those long runs or maybe even long distance walk as well it is also very very soft and very Squishy in this shoe very similar feeling to the gel ners 26 and the more version 5 but that plate in the shoe means it's a lot stiffer than those shoes a lot more stability with the shoe so it's just going to excel a lot more as you pick up the past to Marathon past and half marathon past something like that this is now a shoe that some heavier people could definitely want to consider doing some racing in as well they're worried about some of the Foams bottoming out definitely not going to be the case here in terms of dislikes with the shoe I kind of feel like I'm repeating myself quite a bit today but it's just obviously a bit heavy a little bit bulky it's the heaviest shoe here today the heaviest shoe that I've ever tested here on the channel but with all that foam and those plates they really do look after your legs very very well so in summary there's a little bit more Tech going on in this shoe with that plate here as to say it's the only one here on this list it's also a lot of fun to run in it's quite extreme on the stack height front so if you want a really lightweight shoe this is definitely going to be one to avoid but I've got a lightweight shoe coming up now so let's have a chat about the super blast version 2 as soon as you pick this up you know you're picking up something very very special it's so much lighter this was 288 G for me in my UK size 12 at least 100 G lighter than a lot of those options this is my second pair which is why I've actually had to write number two on the back here wore my first pair out but anyway let's move on to sh all of the facts and figures the purpose of the shoe like this this is a classic daily shoe you can definely do your long runs you can do your races you can do your easy runs you can kind of do recovery runs it's certainly not the best option out there for your recovery runs but it's a shoe that can do everything pretty damn well price-wise talking around about \u00a3200 the prices do change a little bit on the aex website around about2 200 though stack kite 45 mm stack kite still a lot of foam you're getting with this shoe here as with all the ones in this video today 88 mm drop overall Weight Wise is coming in at 288 G so around about 90 to 100 G lighter than all the other ones but I did get this in half a size down so that's just what you need to do in something like the super blast so this wasn't true to size I got half size down so 11 and a half for me midso wise we've got mostly asx's FF turbo plus foam asx's most premium foam that they offer in all their high-end ratio that's what the bulk of this shoe is here and then underneath that we've got a layer of FF blast foam which is a lot more durable then as usual we've got the rubber out soole here these yellow bets you can see on the bottom of the shoe just to add that extra grip a big improvement from Super Blast 2 versus one was a lot better grip but it's still nowhere near as good as something like the pummer grip as I say sizing wise I went half a size down likes with the shoe it's just so so versatile if you're traveling moving around you can only take one shoe with you this is really for me this year and a lot of last year as well this is the shoe I'm always want to be taking a shoe that can really do it all Races I've raced in this shoe you can do speed sessions in this shoe easy runs long runs it's super comfortable as well a shoe that I reach for about 90% of the time when I'm not testing other shoes it's also supremely lightweight as we've chatted about and also surprisingly durable I got around about 1,000 very happy ks in my first pair of super blast now I'm on to my second pair I've got another pair ready to go dislikes with this shoe unfortunately still very hard to get hold of but as soon as this comes into stock it always sells out within 24 hours so yes it's very much on the expensive side but the versatility makes up for that and the demand clearly makes up for that they could certainly put the price up with the shoe and people would still be paying for it it's that much in demand so summary with the super Blast 2 yes definitely the lightest shoe here the most versatile but definitely the firmest ride this is a shoe that is going to give you a pretty firm ride out there but it's responsive and I say you can pick up the pace really quite nice with the shoe now some people might be asking why you not reviewing the Invincible well I haven't got it yet version 4 is due out supposedly this year here we'll be bringing that full Nike Invincible version 4 as soon as it drops so get subscribed for that so let's go through my final Thoughts with these shoes here starting out with the New Balance definitely the softest squishiest shoe here but also the cheapest one as well perfect for someone looking for those super squishy soft recovery runs to look after your legs pummer the outstanding feature with the pummer it's got the best grip the best winter running option here and definitely something you can do some long runs in a little bit more responsive the Joe Nimbus 26 the most comfortable shoe here in the lineup the Brooks best for people with particularly big feet with the sizing options that are on offer and again you can go long in this shoe really nice and responsive as well hokus skywood X the most extreme the biggest stack kite a big fan favorite on the channel this year a lot of you guys absolutely loving the skywood X as we've got a dedicated review all about this one so go and check that one out and then yeah probably going to be my favorite show of the year the best allrounder most versatile lightweight but sadly the most expensive option as well but the one I would definitely recommend wholeheartedly above all the others on the list but they're all really good options let me know what you would choose on the list here next video coming up is our best daily shoe options you can see that up here if you want to see that dedicated hocus skyex video I'll link to that one down here keep on working hard keep on done we'll see you very soon in the next one",

  "text": "we are now in the thick of it for my preparation for the half marathon at Houston and after a week six some people were a little bit concerned that this run up plan just might break me but now that two more weeks have passed let's see how I'm holding up this is a runup update at week 8 [Music] yo what's going on kzi coming to you on location from my backyard last time it was cold and snowing and today it is cold and snowing but in the interim a lot has happened weatherwise you're going to see that weather is a main character for this 8 week update now even though the six week update was just last week and one week later you're watching this through the magic of editing I'm able to fit in 2 weeks of training with the Runa app let's see how it's been going starting with week s day one Monday a session Monday week s was a Tempo a workout The Plan called for 2K over unders 2K at 720 per mile then 2K at 625 per mile and then repeat that for a total of three continuous sets the tempts were really cold for this one 22\u00b0 f with an icy wind and I had a hard time staying in range for the faster portion of the first two sets I was in the adios Pro 4 which is one of my favorite shoes right now that I'm currently testing and they were great for this range of paces and for the last rep I was able to run even faster than what was prescribed and typically I try not to overdo it when it comes to Paces on a training plan you run the pace that prescribed so you get the workout and strain that is intended but since I didn't quite hit the mark for the first two reps I felt like it was okay to try and make it up a bit on the last one and then for apparel I ran in the two times U full tights which aren't the warmest full tights that I have but I have been loving them for hard sessions they are very expensive and I haven't had them for very long but they are so worth it and have instantly become one of my fa favorite full [Music] tights Tuesday was a little bit warmer but still pretty cold for my easy 9 1 12 mile run I was wor testing another pair of shoes that I can't show you and I'm sorry about that but I promise that there aren't too many more days like this I ran one of my more usual Loops in the area I start out by the police station and then run over to the river and the temps have gotten cold enough that the water is starting to freeze [Music] over Wednesday was another session day this workout was called a drop set two reps each starting at 1K intervals then 800 M then 600 M then 400 and then 200 M and as the Reps get shorter the paces get faster I reached for the Evo one for this workout as they are one of the lightest and fastest shoes that I have right now and they were at about 55 Mi of total mileage before this workout and you could see that there is some damage on the left shoe I think that an energy Rod is causing a bit of a cavity on the bottom of the shoe and that's what's creating this dimple but as far as I can tell I don't have a broken rod [Music] now I don't have a ton of experience running very fast intervals so my pacing was a bit all over the place for this one but on average I think I was right where I was supposed to be except on the 200s I was way fast on the 200s it was a tough workout but it didn't feel like it was an exceedingly hard workout it felt rigorous but [Music] manageable Thursday was a recovery run 5.5 m easy and it was cold 19\u00b0 fhe and windy made it feel downright Arctic by this point in any training block my body is starting to hurt kind of all over and this Runa training plan is no different I've been pretty not good about keeping up with my usual pre-run Mobility routine and I have been skipping pretty much all of my strength and conditioning and Mobility work that Runa has been assigning so even though this run was supposed to be a recovery run it basically just felt a little bit uncomfortable back in week one when I set up my training plan Runa gave me the option to add in strengthened conditioning and Mobility work and of course I said yes to each of those things even though I don't have the best track record of keeping up with either one of those and that's because for some reason I thought this Runa training plan would be a little on the easy side so I thought I'd have plenty of time and plenty of energy to get all this essenc and Mobility work done that hasn't exactly been the case for me fortunately run it has a feature where if it notices you skipped or missed a couple of strength and conditioning sessions it lets you go through and Autos skip all the things that you missed so that way you don't have to go through and individually click that you're skipping those sections and that's convenient Friday was a long run 16 Mi conversational Pace temps again were pretty cold but I definitely overdressed for this one I had a long sleeve a jacket a neck gator and a winter cap on and after a while I could feel my back getting soaked from sweat so I took off the jacket and put it into my pack I had about a liter of scratch in there but I didn't bring any food for some reason I guess I figured it was an easy 16 so I shouldn't have to need to eat as long as I had enough fluids but I got pretty hungry at about the halfway point when I turned around I was testing the New Balance 1080 version 14 for this run I didn't feel like I needed to worry about taking this shoe out for 16 miles on my first run in them is I have loved every 1080 that I've ever run [Music] [Applause] in but I didn't love version 14 it's not bad it's just not an improvement over version 13 in my opinion I think new balance is taking the 1080 in a different way at one point during this run I just felt really tired so I stopped and put my jacket back on and I just stood there to catch my breath for a moment it was weird 16 Mi easy takes a long time but they don't usually feel all that hard but this felt like a lot for some reason I guess this is what happens when you train specifically for a half marathon the weather got suddenly super warm the next day like 25\u00b0 warmer over a 24-hour period I think that's maybe a 13\u00b0 CSUS swing and I ran in a long sleeve and a thin vest just in case there was an icy wind but I was definitely overdressed I probably could have run in just a t-shirt maybe some gloves but overall it was a nice easy six on a ball me [Music] day Sunday was an 11m easy run it was 51\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 C and compared to what things have been like earlier in the week this pretty much felt like summer for this run I decided to drive over to Al gin which is the next town over and then I ran on the Prairie Trail pretty much all the way back home now I could have run this the other way around and saved myself a bunch of driving but by doing it this way it's uphill on the way out and downhill on the way back and I always will prefer to save the downhill for the [Music] end now week 8 was a D Lo week and it was my second D Lo week so far in this program and the idea with these is that it's kind of like a taper where you reduce your mileage but maintain intensity and that gives your body a chance to absorb all the work that you've been doing before you get back at it the following week now at this point in the program by week s going into week eight my body is feeling pretty creaky which is pretty normal for me and anytime I enter into a training program once I get to kind of like the higher mileage and higher intensity weeks my body really starts to feel it and so getting up out of a chair takes a little bit of extra groaning and moaning as things are a bit stiff and every time I wake up in the morning my feet always really hurt for those first few steps of the day so I thought for this D Lo week I was going to make extra sure that I was going to do all of the strength and conditioning and more importantly the mobility work for week [Music] week eight Monday is another session day and this was short and fast 10 * 400 at 550 pace and then 10 * 200 at 530 I reached for the Puma Nitro Elite 3 for this workout the angle of attack on that shoe works really well for when you want to turn over quickly and I felt strong on this one again it wasn't easy rather it was pretty rigorous but it felt like something I could handle temps were quite warm again so I ran with the door long sleeve which is one of the airiest thinnest long sleeves I have and I felt like this was a good pick for the day I was even warm enough to take off my gloves for a few of the 200 met reps and I was glad that it was mild for this session trying to do this last week when it was colder would have been much more difficult the day after a session like that would normally be an easy run or a complete rest day for most plans especially on a d week which week eight was supposed to be but instead I had sessions 2 days in a row which made not all that much sense to me now I've run double threshold days before so I'm used to working on tired legs but there's something about big workouts on consecutive days that still feels kind of wrong well unless your body has the resilience of a High School cross country Runner I do not so this workout was a fem time trial so after a short 1K warm-up Runner had me trying to run 5 miles at 620 Pace the day after I had run I bunch of 400s and a bunch of 200s now I feel like this would be a big session even on fresher legs so at the outset I decided that if I could just average 635 or 15 seconds slower than goal Pace Runner would still consider that within range but even that was hard on my tired legs so early on in this workout I tried not to worry about the pace so much but instead I focused on the things that I've been trying to remind myself this entire block first is that I can trust myself to keep pushing and know that there will still be something left to finish out the rep so I don't have to back off and the other thing that I've been trying to do is relish the painful parts and of course I don't mean that I've been running through pain like injury pain but I mean that I've been running through pain in the sense that my muscles are yearning for more oxygen and my blood is thirsty for sugar that kind of pain being able to persist in that moment means that I've been working hard and that the plan has been working and that a lot has gone right in order for me to reach that point in the work out where I am faced with the decision of can I keep pushing I want to relish that moment I want to relish that decision and that entire feeling and then also be able to say yes I do want to keep going this pain point is where all the good stuff happens and I'm trying to relish staying in these moments overall though the average for the 5 miles was 643 which was slower than what Runa wanted even slower than I thought I would be able to hit on the day but overall I was happy I was able to survive these last two days which were a gigantic stimulus that I know is going to pay dividends [Music] later Wednesday I finally got my day day off and for the first time in a long time I enjoyed a planned rest day but Thursday was an easy 8.5 mile run and a legs and core super set it was super cold that day 12\u00b0 f or11 c and I put on my warmest running jacket which is actually from a snowboarding apparel company the Fox River which is that body of water that I run by frequently is starting to freeze over pretty hard now and that's weird because it doesn't feel like it was all that long ago that this spot was full of jet skis and pontoon [Music] boats that evening I took my daughter to rock climbing practice and used that time to get in my strength work first there were these squats that you do on your toes then there were these toe touches that look easy but quickly reminded me how much I've been neglecting core work over the past several years then there were these fire hydrants which felt pretty nice for my hip followed by Hew walks that I think I must be doing wrong because they don't feel like they're doing anything for me and then I went through all these exercises a second time now at this point the workout shifted over to the hip thrust machine the workout called for two sets of the following single leg hip thrust which I definitely felt in my glutes and then after that were these lunge presses there was a lot of reps in each set so I picked up the lightest kettle bell I could find but even that started to feel pretty heavy by the end of the set and then after that were some planks which again I never do any core work and so these were ridiculously [Music] hard it was about 14\u00b0 Fahrenheit on that Friday or about -10\u00b0 C and as cold as that is I've definitely been overdressing for my run so far the past couple weeks so today I had a very thick long sleeve and a vest the long sleeve has a built-in Bala clava in it and while it makes me look pretty goofy it is definitely warm for my head and face but it took a while for my upper body to warm up though and that's the tricky part about winter running you're either comfortable at the beginning and Soggy and Cold by the end from sweating too much or you're cold at the beginning and then just a bit less soggy at the end of the run there never seems to be a perfect level of layering for winter running now Marine Hills is one of my favorite places to run in the area I run here A bunch of times but the only downsides are that there's a couple of very hilly parts and at times it can get pretty windy and also there are Gates that keep the part locked up until 8:00 a.m. so it's hard to get an early start for your long runs here but otherwise it's pretty much a perfect 8 and a half mile [Music] Loop Saturday was another rest day and schedule wise this worked out one of my daughters had a cheerleading competition that day so we spent most of the day sitting in bleachers and by the end of it I was really in Need for some Mobility work and Runa had a yoga session planned for me now I was initially a bit reluctant to film this because we're still working on building out a little home gym in the basement but it's not done yet and the basement itself is unfinished and so I was worried that it might look a little bit unimpressive but then I noticed that the yoga session that had been scheduled for me that day was filmed in what appeared to be a basement or I guess since Runa is a British app this would be called a dungeon so if a dungeon was good enough for a runner my unfinished basement is good enough for this video now I love the idea of yoga but I don't love actual yoga it did get me loosened up pretty nicely though and I felt good overall afterwards and then Sunday was supposed to be an easy 7.5m run but I had to do this after driving for a few hours in some difficult conditions we were actually supposed to drive to Grandma's house in Iowa after the cheerleading competition the day prior but ice storms kept us at home overnight temps had risen quite a bit though so roads were clear but now things were very foggy Sunday was supposed to be a Christmas cookie baking day at Grandma's house with all the cousins so while the children baked with Grandma I went out for my run the paved roads were all very clear but portions of the dirt road were a bit crunchy and some of the less travel Bridges were completely covered in ice the cows all seem to be enjoying the foggy morning though and the quick rise in temps this week must have made conditions favorable for spreading fertilizer and I will admit that seeing the farmers spreading literal poop into the air made me feel a bit less bad about the emergency pit stop I had to make earlier in the Run can I stay for a while cuz I don't know any better I should say something clever but can't think [Music] whatsoever I was also supposed to do a strength session that day but we had to drive back home that same day from Grandma's house so the kids could go to school one last week before the holiday break so while I wanted to do every single session this week weather conditions left me with about 7 hours of Total driving on Sunday and little time left for [Music] strength and I don't care about the consequences I think you know that too so that's it for week eight of my training plan for the half marathon at Houston I'm feeling good feeling confident most of the time time and I'm really thankful that there's been a reduction in my work travel so that I have the time and energy to get in some of these accessory sessions that I've normally been either just too tired or too busy to do stay tuned now for week 10 update that'll come in the beginning of 2025 that gets us really close to taper time for Houston so at that point in the week 10 update we'll talk about what Runner thinks that I'm going to be able to run for Houston what I think I'm going to able to run for Houston and what the race PL going to be if you want to try run out for yourself use code kofuzi for two free weeks I don't get paid any extra whether you use the code or not but it's there if you want it slow it down take it easy I just keep staring at my phone",

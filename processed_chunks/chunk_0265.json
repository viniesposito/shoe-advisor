  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name's Nick and in this video I'm going to be comparing the sakon Endorphin speed 4 and the Nike zoomly [Music] 6 so the zoomfly 6 and the Endorphin speed 4 are both plated super trainers that are designed to be fast training shoes or all-rounders or can even stand in for race day shoes they are both really good shoes two shoes I've Loved running in this year the Endor speed 4 more or less continues the fine Heritage of the line which I think has been the probably the best super trainer on the market since it launched the original version of it the zoom fly was almost the original kind of plated or training partner shoe but went off the boil quite significantly the last few versions but it's very much back on form now with the zoomfly 6 so yeah both cracking shoes the Endorphin speed 4 cost \u00a3180 or $170 whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 a bit cheaper in the UK it's \u00a3155 same price in the US though $170 the Endorphin speed is the slightly lighter shoe at 255 G or 9 oz in a uk9 whereas the zoomfly 6 is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 the zoomfly has an 8 mm drop with the stack he of 42 mm at the heel 34 mm at the 4 foot the speed also has an 8 mm drop but it's a lower stack shoe across the board it's 36 mm at the heel and 28 mm at the for foot so looking at the design with an Nike you've got a two- layer woven mesh upper a pretty comfortable upper that doesn't really you know sacrifice too much in the way of comfort to try and keep the weight down you got a fair amount of structure at the back and a bit of padding there as well you have a dual density mid so with a top layer of Nike's zoomx foam the bouncy peber foam that's been the best foam in its range since it launched with the vaporfly underneath that there's a layer of Sr O2 carrier foam which is there to add a bit more durability and stability then you have a carbon plate running through the mids soole but it's a little bit more flexible than the ones you'll see on Nike's Racing shoes but still provides that stiffness and pop you expect from a plate you got a waffle out sole with good coverage on the forefoot and the heel cut out in the middle there to reduce some weight a pretty standard setup on the bottom of the shoe there for a super trainer then the Endorphin speed 4 you've got an engineered mesh upper it's a little bit more kind of thin and breathable at the front than the Nike similar kind of levels of padding at the back of the shoe there small internal heel counter as well you got s power run PB foam in the midsole which is a p based foam as well and you've got the speed roll rocker geometry that's been very much a signature feature of the Endorphin line across the board in that midle you have a nylon plate so again a little bit more flexible than a full carbon plate on a racing shoe with wings to add a bit more stability and you have a latice rubber outsole on the shoe very similar to the Nike in terms of the coverage there at the front and back with that cutout in the [Music] middle it comes to fit of the two shoes I've got a uk9 in both which is a us10 with both of these brands that is the size I generally use with sakon and Nike I did try a uk8.5 A us99.5 in the Endorphin speed 4 which also fitted me pretty well I am kind of on the fence between those two sizes I would say in general they both have a good fit and I would stick to your normal running shoe size I wouldn't go up or down in either of them the Nike maybe a little bit more kind of dialed in around the toes than Nike's full cushion shoes but still has enough room in my normal size no concerns with the fit at all really like I had a good lock down around the heel and midfoot they're both pretty comfortable shoes especially the Nike which has you know an exceptionally comfortable upper I would say for a super [Music] trainer onto the run test then and as I said right at the start of the video these are two really good shoes shoes that I love running in both very versatile both have lots of speed both pretty comfortable for easy runs they really fit the mold of a modern super trainer for sure but they do have quite different feels and approaches I would say the speed 4 is the shoe I tested first of the pair and it's still got that light Nimble fast feeling that we've had with the Endorphin speed since the original version I think this latest version is a little bit cushier at the heel than past models but I still find this a shoe that's very fast I can go out and do very hard workouts in the shoe and it's got that slightly more direct ride than most shoes these days because you have got a slightly lower stack heite especially under the 4 foot and compared to the zoomfly it does give you a slightly firmer feel a slightly more rocket feel and yeah a very fast and Nimble feel but maybe isn't quite necessarily as bouncy and cushy as the Nike as mentioned it's really cushioned at the heel and that does give it a nice comfortable feel for easy runs like as a heel Striker I do feel like you're getting a soft ride there if you are moving at slower speeds and then you do get that nice snap through from The Rocker when you do start to up the pace the slight downside of that is that because it isn't so crazily cushioned under the forefoot if you are snapping through like I do as a heel Striker can get a little bit of for foot discomfort I think from this shoe when pushing hard over longer distances like it's not something that's really bad I still think it's got the chops to do those long distance runs and races even but yeah it's a little bit less comfortable under that 4ot compared to lots of shoes these days that have a lot more foam under that area including the zoom fly so with the Nike if I go and do those longer hard runs you just don't get that all like I did a 90-minute steady run in the shoe and you could really feel the difference between what I'd get from the speed four on that kind of run because it's really comfortable cruisy controlled speed 4 has that almost more aggressive feel and more direct feel and you know doing that kind of steady run the speed after about 60 Minutes I get a little bit of four foot discomfort cruising through 90 minutes in the Nike I just didn't have that problem at all so that's really what you get here you get a slightly bouncy ride a cushier ride a you know ride that almost feels like you're more in kind of cruise control even when you're running fast whereas the speed you feel a bit more of that pace when you are pushing hard in the shoe but then when you move on to really fast Paces I think that's where the speed for does have a little bit of an edge so if the Nike has that bit more Comfort on longer sessions and that kind of thing the speed has a bit more nimbleness and speed when it comes to you know all out sessions so when I push to kind of my faster race Paces in the Nike it just feels a little bit big on the foot it's not heavy and you can do those runs in it it is a fast shoe but the speed feels more natural to run really fast in I find like I can use the speed 4 as a stand in for a full carbon shoe and I'm eyeing up a really nasty session on my training plan I'm starting thinking oh might just use a full carbon shoe the speed 4 is one of the super trains like I could do that shoe I feel like I can perform just as well in it pretty much as a carbon shoe like I remember doing a really nasty session I did I think 24 times 1 minute on 30 seconds uh float and then into a 6K at 330 perk kind of around marathon pace and just felt amazing in the shoe ran the you know that long section at the start really well hitting Pace as I was you know expect to hit in a carbon shoe and then cruise through that know marathon pace bit at the end so I do think when you're looking at you a really nasty session a really tasty session the speed forward have the edge over the zoom fly but if you're eyeing up something like a long progression run or you know really long hard tempo run the zoom fly will be the one that comes to mind for me and that extends then to other kinds of runs so these aren't just fast training shoes like I said they are very bur start they can do a bit of everything but when it comes to your easy Runs Nike has a more relaxed feel the upper is really comfortable the under field is very comfortable even at slow Paces whereas speed for is all those things but maybe not quite so much did a short run wearing boies at the same time like at a mix of paces certain to say is the Nike is louder I think that's something should mentioned with most of the zoomfly content you know to get that slight Slappy sound that you get from some Nike shoes you do get it with the zoomfly even though it doesn't have that big airod that I thought was causing it in the Ally you at slower Paces they both are really soft and cushy like I do think that wedge of the foam at the back of the Endorphin speed you does give it a comfortable ride at easy paces and as you start to move through the gears maybe I start Landing a bit more midfoot and you get a slightly firmer feeling from the speed that really fast rocker transition Zoom fly feels more similar at all Paces you know soft bouncy but you know it's fast you kind of you're moving fast you don't necessarily feel like you can tell you're moving as fast in this shoe you haven't got so much feel for the ground but it's really protective you are moving quick in it speed has that more kind of aggressive rocker feel to it a bit more of that ground feeli if that's something you're [Music] after these are two really good shoes both shoes i' be very happy to have in my rotation as a fast trainer or an allrounder Nike is a fair bit cheaper in the UK which is something I would certainly consider as a factor given the way the speed is priced to be the same in the US but you know Fair bit pricier in the UK but they do kind of have slightly different strengths as well the Nike I think is a great daily trainer that also has a lot of speed whereas the Endorphin speed 4 is a very good fast trainer that can also do those daily runs so it's almost what you would prioritize when you were buying the shoe that might help you make the decision when you're picking between them it's a bit similar to what I was talking about the hak X2 and the Nike uh and when I was comparing those two shoes these are both cracking shoes but if you're particularly looking for a shoe to do a lot of long miles lot of marathon training runs lots of long sessions do you think the zoomly 6 has a bit of the edge on those runs Dophin speed just doesn't have quite as much comfort Under Foot but if you are looking for a fast trainer to potentially go and do races in especially shorter races and to hit the track for short reps that kind of thing the speed for does have a bit more Pace in it I would say for sure and then there's also a different ride field to consider as well if you do like the big cushy rides you want more foam Under Foot you want a slightly bouncy ride in general that is what the zoomly provides if you do like that little bit more feel for the ground that fast turnover from The Rocker on the speed and the shoot it just feels faster in general then the Endorphin speed 4 provides that like I said they're both have a very broad range of strengths and I really don't think I'd discount either as an allrounder just might come down a bit more to ride field Maybe the price and maybe yeah like I say what you're predominantly looking for from a shoe when you're adding it to your rotation definitely a very hard call around for me I think given the training I do I would probably lean towards getting the Nike in fly myself usually marathon training lots of long runs that don't necessarily go flat out Paces but I want a shoe that can bounce through the merrily and protect the legs well and I think the Nike does that a little bit better so it's so I think it's a training style that probably plays for it strength though when it comes to those really allout sessions I probably then have to reach maybe for a carbon shoe whereas the speed 4 You does do those ones really well that's our comparison of the Nike Zoom fly 6 and the S endorphin speed 4 let us

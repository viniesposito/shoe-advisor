  "text": "an ultramarathon is any run or any race longer than a marathon so anything longer than 26.2 mil and today we're going to be covering everything ultramarathon how to get into it what type of ultramarathon you might like to do what kit you might need some good firsttime events plus we'll also have a look at what the training looks like and I promise you it's probably not as hard as you might think it will be so stay tuned for that now over the last few years I've run some 50ks some 50 MERS and a handful of 100 MERS as well and today I want to show you that ultr running really can be for everyone now you might well think that running an ultramarathon is surely one of the hardest things that you can do in running and while yes there are lots of really tough races out there but there's also a general Vibe around Ultras that they're a lot more relaxed than running a road Marathon for example and some Ultras can take you some incredible beautiful parts of the world and that's one of the reasons why ultr running is in such a big boom in recent years there are so many different distances surfaces formats there's so much variety so I guarantee there'll be something in here for you now the standard distances in Ultras tend to be 50k 5050 MERS 100K 100 m 200 MERS and anything up to around about 250 mil for the most part we'll come on to some longer races a little bit later on the video and I should say if these are on Trails they'll be a roundabout this sort of figure nobody's measuring these courses out on Trails so starting out with 50k this will obviously take you a little bit longer than a marathon moving up to 50 m mil and 100ks you're talking around about sort of 10 to 15 hours to complete something like this you're not going to be running consistently through this whole distance for a lot of people there might well be some walking brakes some walking up some of the hills moving on to 100 mile distance for most people you're talking around about 20 to 30 hours to finish 100 mile probably no sleep you'll be running through a whole night and then moving up to the 200 250 M distance this really is not for beginners but I thought you might like to know a little bit about it here with talking for three plus days sleep becomes a big factor in these sort of races getting that sleep and then getting back up and running as well now one of the very biggest road Ultras in the world is a race called comrades where myself and my partner Sarah who's filming this will be traveling to very shortly it's around about 90 km every year the distances do change slightly comr is quite a hilly run you either go up or down and lots of undulations along the way but for a lot of people they might like to start out with something flatter now in the UK we have a lot of canal races Gran Union Canal R 135 Mi running from Birmingham all the way down to London races along the temp's path you can then be influenced with temperature as well some very hot races something like spartathlon 153 Mi through the heat of Greece in the summer or something like bad water 135 Mi through California's death valley or maybe someone that prefers running in the cold something like Ark of attrition here in the UK in the depths of Winter the spine race they got lots of different distances but tapping out around about 20 60 Mi and then winter Downs 200 M here in the UK as well and then moving on to some slightly different races track races the 400 met Athletics track a fantastic mental challenge now these going to be the time 6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours even longer up to about 6 days we hear some of these events are going on for now and it's simply how far you can run in that time or they might Simply Be distance-based things so again your 50ks your 100 miles going around the track as well really races here in the UK something like Crawley 24 the self Transcendence 24hour in battery moving on to a new type of running which we've seen in the last few years called the backyard Ultra started by Lazarus Lake Gary Cantrell the guy that started uh Barkley name that and this is simply running a 4167 mile loop on the hour every hour and it's the last man standing now we don't know how long this race could last the record at the moment is 450 miles or 4 and a half days you can then do Ultras in the mountains some big races things like UTMB Hard Rock T western states or maybe you want to look at something like doing an fkt a fastest known time not an organized race check out the fkt website maybe a big challenge in your local area where you want to be the local Legend as stra would say but you could be the fkt holder for something like that and then you might like to look at something like stage races the big ones here Marathon desabla MDS dragons back K wrath Ultra there's a set amount of distance you cover each day and then the clock stops at the end of each day and it's your cumulative time over a period so a lot of these may be around about a week of running and the winner will be the person with the least amount of time running and then finally the longest certified foot race in the world 3,100 miles the self Transcendence in Queens New York at the moment the male record of 40 days of running to cover that 3,100 Mi the female record 45 days there were just six finishes last it when the race happened just an iconic race go and read all about it some fantastic documentaries we'll link to those down below most of these races will have Aid stations where you have a chance to refuel with nutrition and liquids that the race is giving out some of the races will also allow outside assistance from your crew these are people that you'll know and they'll follow you around and can stop off at designated checkpoints for them and be able to give you assistance so again hot food change of clothes some drinks as well and the sun races will also allow what's known as Paces particularly popular in the United States and you can have a buddy that will run with you help keep your pace make sure your spirits are high motivation high and just for some instances in some more remote locations it's a good safety thing to have out there as well one of the biggest things with running Ultras is you've got to find your why people really need to find out why they want to be doing this it's not a natural thing for the brain to be out there running these tremendous distances simply challenging yourself pushing yourself mentally and physically further than you ever thought you could do they really are good fun as well and that can be a why a lot of people might be escaping something escaping a dull job a bad relationship we've all been there over the years and it can simply bring a lot of joy to your life a lot of purpose alternatively just want to go out and explore see some new parts of the world simply escaping for me I just love the Solitude of being out there for hours on end running through some beautiful scenery just a sense of Peace and Freedom phones and stuff are away you're just out there you and the trails with a single thing to do it's a really amazing experience when you're out there some people do get a little bit disillusioned with Road running all the paces the splits setting PBS the speed sessions and things you've got to do and a lot of that does go out the window with ultra so some people can find a really new love of running by running long and giving themselves slightly different challenges and also some older Runners do turn to Ultras maybe they can't be hitting those PBS they want anymore so if you've decided when I get out there and run an ultra what are some good races to have a look at we're starting out in the south of the UK here one of mine my girlfriend's favorite Centurion running offer anything from 50k the 50k 100 Hills where we volunteered at last year it's a really good very beginner focused Ultra event so we'll link to Centurian running down below threshold races like race of the king race of the stones race of the tower I've done two of them myself but they really are very welcoming they offer very generous cut offs you can walk a lot of these races as well so you don't need to worry about being timed out and things like that and they all offer some of those amazing a stations out there are very proud of their 9 % finisher rate so really most people will get round some other organizers to have a look at things like serpent Trail SVP which I think stands for Star Valley parth I'm not sure 50k and 100K GB Ultras and also Ultra X if you want to go a little bit longer if you want to travel a little bit further field from the UK have a look at the list of UTMB races that they now have all over the world they normally pretty much always offer races anything from about 20K normally up to 100 bars plus and if you want to look at some slightly longer races as well then have a look at the world Trail majors and new setup they offering some really amazing experiences all around the world we'll link to all of these down below please let us know down in the comments what are your favorite beginner friendly races maybe in your country you've got some fantastic things help out the community and let everybody know now of course when you start training and racing a lot of these Ultras you're going to need some basic kit to get you going so starting out with the fundamentals you're going to need to get yourself a running pack because you're going to be running a lot longer than you would be during a marathon you need to have a way of carrying some supplies with you some nutrition some water some extra clothing and some safety kit as well so you have to be a little bit more self-sufficient you're also going to want to get yourself a really good quality waterproof jacket something that has tape seams just because when we out there for a long period of time the weather can turn especially if we're out in the mountains you're also going to want to get yourself a head torch most races that are over 50 Mi are likely to involve running during some periods of Darkness especially if they're going to be winter races you're also going to want to find yourself some trail shoes something that's going to be a little bit more grippy a lot of Ultras will be on Trails or off-road and you're really going to benefit more from having that extra grip but also a more sturdy and harder wearing shoe they going able to withstand a lot more abuse then also some basic safety kit out there so a first day kit a foil blanket a means of navigating around for most people that's simply on their watch and of course a fully charged mobile phone now of course all of this kit doesn't come cheap there's an organization here in the UK put them up on the screen now link to them down below that help some individuals that are less able to afford a lot of this kit to be able to get into the sport so if that applies to you then as I say We'll link to them down below go and check them out so in very simple terms what does the training look like for an ultra well for a standard 50 to 100K race the type of thing you would find here in the UK you're talking around about 15 to 16 weeks of training the same length as a standard marathon training block basically if you want to check out our training plans for these we'll link to them down below the main difference between marathon training and training for Ultras like this you want to really try and get in something called backto back long runs so lot of people this might be on the weekend of a long run Saturday and then a long run Sunday getting used to running on tired legs fatiguing them on Saturday and then getting out and running them again on Sunday to give them even more of a punishment strength work is so important here you might be able to get by with just doing some basic stuff at home but ideally want to be getting into the gym and lifting some weights and building that strength that you're going to need to power yourself up the mountains down the mountains and really run strong at the back end of a race another top tip is really try and train on as similar terrain to your goal race as possible if you're going to be doing Arc attrition on the coast path try and get down and run on the coast paath if you're doing some canal running run on the canals if you're going to be racing in the mountains try and spend some time in the mountains getting used to What It's Like on the exact terrain of your goal race and also with the training a lot of very easy low heart rate relax zone two conversational Pace running building a really big base strong cardio system that is going to allow you to run a very long way without burning out nutrition is so important with ultr running we need to be fueling our body throughout the race to be able to run strong all the way through it so we also need to be training our gut trying new things experimenting with all the weird and wonderful types of race nutrition you can get out there and that has to form a big part of the training so when you get to race day you've got your nutrition plan sorted and you know your body's going to respond and be well to it and not give you any gut issues so moving on to our livite nutrition section here as I've just said ultra running is not so much about running it's all about eating and consuming calories as we go along now you may think that sounds like a perfect wonderful day out there but so many people become unstuck in this area getting GI issues being sick because they haven't consumed enough calories or the right calories that their body wants if you can't keep your food down you can't fuel yourself and you can't continue and you'll be tapping that dnf button unfortunately it's as simple as that now there are lots of different ways you can fuel your runs and keep your energy levels topped up some Runners like to stick to your standard Sports Nutrition so your gels your carbs things like Tailwind or like Morton other people like to have sort of like real foods things like sandwiches crisps nuts fruit things like that that some a stations might be giving out as they go round but as I've said it's for you to find the right strategy for you a lot of Runners will come into an a station get as much stuff as they can and then leave that a station while walking maybe up a hill or something like that and then keep on consuming calories and getting that down as they parir on through the race if you can keep the sickness and the digestive issues at Bay and able to keep yourself fueling you have a much better chance of getting to the finish so if you got your training done your nutrition done the final big crucial thing with Ultras is all about what's between the ears the mindset ultr running is around about in my opinion around about 90% in the head and about 10% in the body the physical aspect of it dnfs us usually occur because the head has given up far far earlier than the body has things do get tough weather can get bad aches pains blisters sickness the distance remaining and you look down watch and it still says 140k to go it can be very overwhelming and you start questioning your why so make sure you work out your why before you even get out there one of the very toughest races that I've ever done when I had to push my body and mind further than it had ever gone before Was a Race I did in Cape Town 100 km and if you want to watch that that video is coming up here keep on working hard guys keep done let let us know how you get on in your Ultra training and racing that's it we see you in the next one",

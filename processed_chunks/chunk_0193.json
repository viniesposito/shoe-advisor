  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Robbie with believe in the r i don't think you're supposed to introduce yourself for this oh really we I like this is perfect this is exactly on par go ahead who are you uh Megan with believe in the run and this is a special episode a Monday episode the origin story episodes of Robbie Robert what's your middle name Lee and no it's not that's right it's not after the Confederacy yeah Robert Lee readinger Robert Lee readinger they have statues of his uh Uncle all over West Virginia my grandpa's first name was Lee my dad's first name was Robert a lot of creativity went into that and no Force why he put is that why you put an e at the end of your name so it's robbery yeah E le yeah it's just to throw people off Roberty Lee oh man hopefully it's just people from Australia listening to this they have no idea what we're talking about oh I think it's made it that far oh you think so do you know any Australian history though that's a good first question for you like I couldn't name a single politician in the history of Australians can you name a city yes Melbourne or is that how they s say it Melbourne do you know Clive didy do syy what Clive digy do is that a real person yeah no it's not did he is that where's it from name one person who had a crocodile farm down there besides crocodile dundy I was going to say easy no Steve Berwin oh yeah but I don't do he have a farm or was he just he has like a zo Sanctuary okay yeah well his son's doing stuff now too yeah I saw that yeah recently anyway this is supposed to be about you I mean all that is about me in a way Australia um okay let's so let's go to the way back do we start from the beginning beginning where did Robbie grow up and what was childhood like wow really going deep um let's see I was born in Lebon Pennsylvania which is small town near kind of outside Hershey I guess if it was South Central PA is it Lebanon or leanon they say Lebanon Lebanon Lebanon or Le they honestly just take out the a too it's like the easiest thing ever Le Lebon yeah um there's a lot of stuff like that that doesn't make sense Lancaster instead of Lancaster that no sense it's oh I've been pronouncing it the other way yeah they just they just people make stuff up anyways so I was born there uh lived in pomara Pennsylvania which we talked about cuz that's where Nick bear is from till I was five and then I moved like how do you not know him that's like it's not like it's huge like you had to have Shar he's he's younger than me he's like eight years younger than me oh I thought maybe you'd have to be sharing some DNA living in that small town yeah it's pretty small so and then we moved uh near out more towards the mountains near Hershey and that's where I lived pretty much all my life before bouncing around places um as an adult but so I grew up there and let's see do you want like the for real like the whole history yeah all right might as well people I have three brothers I have brother I'm the oldest of four siblings uh my youngest brother's my brother is 10 years younger than me and that's like the age range that's big yeah um four is a lot 10 yeah what four and we lived in this years four kids it was crazy claustrophobic we lived in this tiny brick ranch house and there's just one floor until I was 15 or 16 and I got they we readed the basement did you share a bedroom yeah with my brother um who was 10 years younger than you yeah so when I was like 12 or 133 until yeah so like 11 until I was 15 or something like that that's crazy yeah that's you were basically raising an infant I guess I don't crazy I don't remember much of it like in that way no baby waking you up in the middle of the night but I I guess I don't really remember that it probably happened but and then my sister Mrs her [ __ ] room but it was like real tight real small but we grew up in the country so lots of fields and like riding my bike to my friend's house my only friend who lived a mile away um and then swimming in cricks yeah kind of just fishing bare feet all summer starting fires you know stuff like that like was an exciting trip to you like going to like one of the like gas station stores kind of yeah so we we were I grew up I don't know poor but my dad worked for Hershey Chocolate Factory so he worked there for 40 years and so he he had a it was a pretty stable job like it was a union job and see as soon as you say that I think of wily Wonka like your dad has a purple crushed velvet suit that he wore to work did you guys get to go to Hershey yeah sometimes but not not too much in the factory like there's like one day of year where you could go inside the actual fact okay Thomas asked me this earlier today he said do you think if you worked at Starbucks you wouldd start to hate coffee so question yeah did your dad hate chocolate Andor the rest of your family pretty much no one in my family ate chocolate that worked at Hershey yeah wow so because of exactly because of that reason it's weird people who work in Gold minees still like gold yeah I mean as a kid I loved it so we weren't I don't know I feel like Health was weird back then like we did eat stuff from so my family uh my grandma grandpa and uncles they still had a farm a mile away from our house which is where my parents live now and so they still raised cattle and pigs and chickens and whatnot and so we still got a lot of our food from there and corn and so in that way that was healthy but we also had like our pantry with all the sugary cereals all tasty cakes kind no no that's still Robbie today like I'll see Robbie and you'll talk to him and it'll be like just getting back from Chick-fil-A yeah and but I know that for the most part you guys are healthy like I say even your kids will eat like they're not too picky right I'd say it's balanced out like I don't I definitely will eat terribly from time to time SL half the week um like did you like pork rinds growing up no but my family they made scrapple which I never really liked I still don't even like a lot of people don't know what scrapple is if you're not from the delm Marva area I don't think it's that big like I grew up in California and I only learned about it when I moved here I think it's mostly like New Jersey PA what is it it's basically after you butcher a pig which I've that was had to do sometimes with my family which is a crazy experience when you're 8 years old and you're you butchered it well helped clean it yeah like my uncle like they would he would kill it and then you like strip the you know cut it like oh jeez so this is my Orin story yours but I'm going to throw in here our school bus literally like one time we we saw saw a cow get slaughtered oh like a Napoleon Dynamite Happ it was very similar that like I was when I saw that I was like oh my God yeah they they hang him upside down it's like yeah and all the things where they're like oh chicken with a Teta cut offs bleeds like a stuck pig there's a reason those things are actual euphemisms cuz they're all true life yeah like as a kid so it's very I'm like Dwight tro but like a more normal version without as much anger yeah yeah they same anger there sometimes yeah yeah for sure um there's some vindictiveness but he um sorry so they I I kind of grew up that way so we ate like somewhat healthy but I was pretty active like I was um sorry somewhat healthy in some ways terribly in other ways um but I was really active as a kid like loved to play baseball that was my favorite sport for sure played soccer um kind of like rode my like I said rode my bike did a lot of stuff like that and then and but we we grew up kind of the middle of nowhere so I didn't have too many friends and I grew up kind of it was kind of weird situation where my parents were super conservative Christians so it was like there was a lot especially being the oldest there was like a lot of rules and a lot of can't do things so are they still uh conservative yeah but like not as I would say like in some ways but generally not as much like for sure by the time my brother came along was like much different but I wasn't allowed to watch a lot of movies or music listen to music or things that were like like it's CRA honestly it's actually crazy if you think about what's weird is we have this in common for a little while stepmom that we weren't allowed to watch TV or anything both of us have discussed it might be where our our hunger for pop culture oh 100% yeah so like when you were growing up would kids be talking about movies and stuff and you just couldn't even relate I feel viscerally like even talking about it because you would they talk about Nickelodeon or Ninja Turtles and Power R you know whatever and you don't you like kind of pretend like you know what's going on is it like in that scene from 40-year-old version where he's like yeah it's like a bag of sand yeah pretty much yeah um and that was so that was definitely tough um but for sure that's where my love of every like because once I got older it was music movies uh like anything pop culture isn't it funny that's exactly what your parents wanted to keep you from yeah and it drove you to it yeah isn't that how it always works pretty much yeah so and like there was no drinking uh young parents inake nothing like that like was very like very strict and conservative and this is the 80s cuz I do you remember the ' 8S like there's the weird the conservative right was like satanic panic and all this other stuff so it was people were spinning records backwards yeah it was a wild time and so that like even then we watch these movies there's these movies that existed you can still find them on YouTube that are basically the dangers of rock and roll and it's like and watching those I'm like this is like this looks awesome yeah you kind of like there's that a good advertisement for rock and roll yeah and um so I grew up like that and um didn't have too manys friends and didn't know too many people growing up so be before we leave the satanic Rock and Roll Part cuz I remember that time period that you're talking about yeah and when you heard music almost some of that music was a little bit scary like CU you knew that it was like quote unquote evil music like Black Sabbath and you know you heard he bit heads off of you know bats at thing and Guns and Roses ACDC well yeah that's even later but the were you when you listen to that music did it seem scary or did it seem like dangerous yeah in a way well I didn't really listen to it when I was a kid because I had no way of getting a hold of it you know uh I didn't really have friends who like I said I didn't have too many friends so I knew of it and things but I wasn't really able to get my hands on it I always felt bad there's this one kid that would would come of my house to play baseball sometimes he lived down the road and he like for some reason he only had bant t-shirts he didn't have any other clothing and would you make him put it inside out yeah my my dad make him turn inside out cuz it was the Guns and Roses album covers with like skeletons and yeah and chicks on them and stuff like so he wasn't allowed to wear him to my house which H maybe a little bit I get but yeah I always in hindsight I'm like man I always feel bathroom but um yeah and then so that was so this is all through high school well that was pretty much Elementary School and Middle School in middle school I started um me and my friends got really into skateboarding that was kind of there's like this kid that just we saw with a skateboard and we asked them about it and then for some reason we all got into it the little circle of friends that I did have and that your mom and dad were fine with that yeah yeah they were pretty much fine with that cuz it was just skateboarding it was like a sport and in Middle School like we like they weren't bad yet like my friend weren't that bad yet there's still we were still kind of kids it was 12 13 and then so we skated a lot my mom would just card us around to skate parks or just whatever we just be we just find a parking lot it was awesome we just we lived in the middle of nowhere so we just find a old railroad tie wax it up and just put in the middle of a parking lot you could spend four hours there doing that in 90\u00b0 heat and um so that's what I did most Summers in middle school and stuff and that's honestly I think skateboarding helped a lot with probably we talked about this any on the podcast before I think I've never had really injuries as far as bone stuff or anything like that I think it really helped strengthen that from all the repeated you know tricks and stuff on skateboards that's funny cuz I basically hadn't had no nobody in my family really broke any bones M and like skating you take some hard slams I always joke about it now like if I did like just a small fall I would be right yeah yeah there's surprisingly I've never broken a bone that's kind of shocking um yeah and so I did that for a while in middle school and that was fun but those friends then high school was weird because those friends started to like go off and kind of get into some a lot of partying and drugs and stuff and I was still like a good Christian kid or whatever so I didn't really do too much of that um oh and I also forgot to mention yeah like I grew up camping a lot too going outdoors and my family went like we didn't go on vacations we just went uh we had a pop-up camper but we would just go to like a state park or whatever so I never I didn't fly till I was like a senior in high school or something or junior in high school and then so we never and we didn't like go out to eat or anything like that so it was a very weird that's it what do your parents think like now with your job now you fly all over the world yeah do they what's our take on it I mean they think it's cool for sure um but it is weird because a lot of my family hasn't really been outside of pa pa yeah I mean I think they've been a couple other places but nothing like they never been to Europe or California or anything like that or Texas mostly just some place the East Coast um do you think well we'll get into your band stuff later but yeah oh yeah so then I so then and then High School I um I still play baseball but most of the other and I still skateboard it but a lot of my friends were like I said they were going the other direction and honestly like it's kind of sad cuz at least two of them two of my best friends they've died of heroin overdoses um since then and and like it's like you just see like that whatever started in high school at that time just kept going like never stopped and then we so when then when I was in high school I started going to this youth group um that was actually pretty awesome like I just I didn't have that many friends I didn't know too many people I was like pretty like I was friends with everyone at school but I never had any friends friends and then that when I started going there I met like there's people who are literally my best friends still today who I still met there in e or 10th grade or whatever nth or 10th grade and so so like I just met some really cool people who made me gain a lot of confidence and it's really weird I I always think about this with my kids or even your kids like when you think when you talk about Theo I think about this like you're just like where did that come from and I think about myself where when I was younger I had no confidence didn't know anyone like whatever and then I just met these people who were just like cool or I thought they were cool and then I was like oh I guess I'm cool and then I just embraced that and kind of just became myself and then became friends with like a ton of people and then I love meeting people and then like so before this would you say you were a shy kid oh yeah for sure like absolutely and and then I just liked meeting people and meeting new friends and stuff and have in high school and into college and that was an awesome time for sure like that changed my life pretty much my senior year of high school I guess or Junior to senior year of high school um and then yeah so I went to college after that in uh oh and I played tennis my senior year high school so that was like another thing I just tried new things was just like I should just try out for the tennis team and I was actually really good and I wish I would have done that earlier because I was actually one of my it's probably one of my favorite sports um and then we got to college so I went to a college called Geneva College Geneva College it's out near like Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and um it's like a liberal art school but I really liked it it's small school actually I didn't I was like okay with it at the time freshman year kind of was rough and I almost transferred to Penn State um but I just decided last second not to and then I yeah and I met some really good friends there and I thought I had a pretty good education I went for English education which was I was planning on being an English teacher probably because I watched Dead Poet Society way too many times um because I loved writing and reading when I was a kid oh that was the other thing I was like obsessed with reading as a kid I read like an insane amount of books um all the time and I love reading newspaper like I would read the newspaper with my morning bowl of cereal and as a kid yeah like you're like in Middle School and High School were you wearing a tie no I just like read that like I loved reading everything pretty much um well because you that was probably like your outlet you didn't have access to movies and yeah pretty much yeah that is true and so like in when I was in high school some friends like some of my new friends I met introduced me some cool writers too like on the road by Jack kowak that was like a book that changed my life um like I I love CER in the Ry I loved um Kurt Von give books and stuff like that so I just kind of got into all this reading and writing and then went to college for English um and it was a good it was a great education in hindsight I didn't think it was at the time you're like a sucks I go to school it's like 2,000 people um how big were your classes I mean lectures there were some lectures that were like you know 100 kids or something 150 kids but but like my individual classes were like 20 kids so they're like maybe even less than that some like 10 so pretty small classes yeah so that was nice CU you could really get like just dropped in their professor's offices at any time and and being a liberal art a liberal art school I felt like it gave me a really good education just like to think about things in a different way and you know you got to take art classes and all kinds of other stuff so that was cool um but then when once I graduated from there I um like I I did my student teaching my last semester of school and it was at a poor steel industry Town um like the whole steel industry left Wester PA so all those towns out there were just like ghost towns and to some extent still are but I student taught there and it was like no AP classes no college prep classes it was just like everyone's in the same class so it was for student teaching it was pretty rough cuz you had to deal with like so many behavioral problems and just I don't know I just didn't like it and I just it's crazy because I went to school to be an English teacher and I did my student teaching and I was like dude I don't know this is what I want to do and it's funny because I remember the there's like this class I had in my senior year of college where the professor asked us if it was like the three if you could have three dream jobs or something like what would they be I think I said I think the number one was journalist for Rolling Stone or something and then two was a a rock star or being a rock band and three was um be a teacher so my third one was teacher did that didn't like it so then after I graduated college I worked for a Small Town Newspaper close to home in humblest Pennsylvania and so that was just like a weekly newspaper where I would write news story local news story Sports whatever and a friend of mine this was a full-time job yeah it was a full-time job but it paid like $10 an hour or something was terrible and I did that for six months or so and then a through a friend of a friend someone said oh my my friend is looking for a bass player cuz they have this band and they want to go on tour I was like dude I'm 22 I I've always wanted to do that I'm like yeah I'm just GNA I'm just going to do it did you know how to play yeah I play oh oh yeah so I played B since I started mention I started playing bass guitar when I was 15 or 16 you play in the church right yeah so there friends that I met at youth group they bought me a bass guitar for my birthday uh the one year I think when I turned 16 or maybe 15 so I learned it and yeah played for church why bass guitar over regular guitar um I I had a regular guitar but I think it was one of those I don't know it was just one of those things that seemed interesting maybe I there was a time where I felt like the base was like especially with flea from Hot Chili Peppers yeah he kind of made it cool and then there's other bands that like were bass driven and you're like it's also easier to learn like sure it's only one note at a time boom yeah one finger one nose still got to have to have rhythm yeah which I'm struggling with at the gym yeah yeah um and so yeah I did play start playing in high school and play throughout college and then I was like yeah let's do let's join a band tour because why not and so I remember there was a it was crazy too cuz I had this fork in the road where there was a newspaper that asked called me to they went to hire me to be a daily sports writer which I probably would have is another path that I wouldn't have mind taking cuz I love sports um I could have really done well in that I liked lot of the Sports Illustrated writers like Rick Riley um he would always have the last page in Sports Illustrated he's kind of he was always one of my favorite writers and honestly who I kind of uh formulate the drop email that's kind of the basis of that his writing and Mitch album and other people like that were awesome Sports Raiders and so I so I had that job offer or was joined a band and I was like I'm I'm just going to do the band thing which is crazy were you nervous at all about that decision I don't think so I think I am a risk taker in that way where if it just feels right I just do it so for better for worse and I don't know my parents probably thought it was insane but they they I was still living at home at the time cuz I just graduated college and so they were like go get out go on the road yeah I guess but they let me stay so when I came home from the road they would I'd still stay at home home and just work whatever job I could get so for the for drop listeners if you ever hear me talk about some job I had in the past it's usually in the band days because we were super broke like so basically what we did was we just had a 15 passenger van and a trailer and okay wait back up for a second okay I'm sorry they someone says you we want we need a bass player and you're like oh cool that's me I'll do it do you know anyone in this band uh I did I did vaguely know let's see H I kind of knew one of the guys and then but I wasn't friends with him did you have to like play for them and they're like oh yeah you're good enough or yeah I think I just played and then drank some beers we also have to throw out the name of the band yeah so it was called farewell flight we weren't that big if you look at it's still on Spotify though um but we and was based out of Harrisburg PA and we were all DIY so this is a weird time for bands because it was 2005 six and it was right after um like CDs were dying off but the internet was still kind of lagging lime wire napck so yeah what we were doing I mean there was did you have sharing Services Myspace page yeah so was like height of Myspace all right but the problem is that Myspace didn't didn't have great promotional tools it wasn't like today where everything's integrated and Instagram and Facebook and whatever um so it was in it was so difficult to find I mean I would literally just do zip code searches and like spam people to come out to shows like it was crazy it was like DIY to the extreme and uh or if we were trying to find bands to play with in other towns we just Hammer different places on MySpace because there's really no other way to find venues bands anything and so our drummer booked all the tours and we would do three weeks usually three weeks on the road 3 weeks home or 3 weeks on the road four weeks home just for years and so mostly this half the us and we did one six week tour that was like the whole way out to California up to Seattle and back um but I mean we played 750 shows in span of six years so I mean 25 130 shows a year at least okay how does a band member get paid so yeah they don't um so when we were first starting it was so we were so broke that everything we made just went back in the van so was like into the band so it was Van repairs merch buying merch um just general expenses and stuff like that because you only make you know on a good show you might make a hundred bucks for the whole group yeah so like not a good show but just a normal show okay that and sometimes if you get really lucky if you have a HomeTown show you might make 500 or something like that so you were just using that money to survive and travel yeah so it's like when we came home I was dude I remember coming home from tour R end me my change J just put gas in my car to get to work like I'm not kidding you I had no money and we were like hungry a lot because we only our first priority was cigarettes and beer and then food so in that order and didn't you have a a hack at Wendy's or some place with a receipt that you could get oh we had a ton of hacks I could go on for another hour about all the food hacks cuz there is uh some of the back the receipts would have oh if you fill out the survey you get a free whopper or with a purchase of a fries but they didn't say you couldn't buy value fries which are only a dollar and then you buy you know it was like a drink in a but if you buy the value on it was two bucks and basically you get a whole meal so that was like a hack then Arby's had this weird promo was back when they were doing like texting stuff where they're like oh text this text this number and you'll get a code well they didn't limit how many codes you could get so we would just uh be texting us Su they had this promo going on for like two months where we just hammered these new Arby sandwiches that they had coming out it was insane and then another time talk Taco Bell had this competition for bands on the road and we got $500 in Taco Bell bucks which were $5 checks and they were actually like checks legal tender so if you brought them about a 49 cent Taco yeah buy 49 cent Taco they have to give you $4.50 back in cash which we then just SP spend on beer and all it all worked together like that so it was like trying to find out crazy hacks to just survive basically of course we're just drinking Keystone Light the whole time there's no like no other options the fact that you're still alive is impressive it actually no it's actually incredible I mean sometimes I'm like did I burn the candle too much at that end and it's all going to come crashing down in like two years which it may but the and then we had a van that ran on vegetable oil that was the craziest thing cuz it ran on because we were trying to save money so we got this whole system installed where this huge tank of vegetable oil sat in the back of the van like 120 gallon tank this this real yeah I know somebody else who did this and it the car smells weird yeah you just like we would go so what the idea is you have this tank in the back has two two split with two different sides and two different filters and it has a hose so you have to go to restaurant dumpsters and pump the grease out of the dumpster into your van but the problem is it can't just be you can't just roll up to McDonald's and just pump it out because their grease is so bad because they just fry things endlessly and so you actually have to find decent quality grease so like Taco Bell actually has very good grease uh Chick-fil-A actually has great grease cuz they change it regularly but then any other fast food restaurant was horrible so we just had like we had a whole book with like the best restaurants in like the East Coast with like the best grease and we' have to do rounds every three days like we'd split up into two teams of two and find like find the grease or whatever but the pro problem with these vehicles they also run really dirty like it's hard to keep those how many of you are there and how many are you sleeping in this van four four of us but we'd always have a friend or two who would just jump on we had this one friend who is he's now a doctor making like half million doll a year a cancer doctor but he had he was in med school at the time and or prior to med school and so whenever he had a break he would just like fly out and meet us or jump in a bus and meet us on tour and just tour with us for the next two weeks and he would he would rack up these crazy bar tabs CU he just put it on his med student loans which was awesome and and we had other friends who would just jump in the van for a week and just hang out and then go back to where they were whatever so it was kind of a rolling circus and uh but it was awesome it was it was the best definitely the few first few years were the best times just I mean it and and honestly it taught at the time I was especially as it went on I was think it started to feel more like failure than success because we were we did have some interest in labels in the beginning and we had played with some cool bands and met a lot of cool friends and recorded a couple albums in Nashville with some good producers and stuff like that and um and now it's but then it started to die off and this is like year two three um three or four okay and then by that time the grind of touring and playing to 10 people at a show like some dive bar and what I always thought is like you're playing the same songs over and over and over again doesn't that start to yeah that's why band that's why radio Hood doesn't play Creep you know stuff like that it's like fans love that but I get I understand now why bands don't play certain songs or even go back to certain albums so yeah that got old but just the lifestyle it started to get more depressing where we were just drinking not to have fun but just to drink just to stay level just to sandwich yeah just to stay warm in the van like when you're in an ice storm in Iowa and you're 28 or you know 27 years old and all your friends have now are starting families or doing have real jobs with 401ks and you're drinking Evan Williams whiskey like and sleeping in a van with three dudes when it's 30 degrees out kind of it's like a little depressing and then you had to go home and wait tables at the holiday in and like hey Robbie how's it going yeah that's what you were doing yeah so when I mostly my job was waiting tables at a restaurant at the Holiday near where I lived and then but I also like I said I just pick up crazy random jobs if I ever needed extra money and you're still living at home at this point I lived at home I think until I was 25 like the first couple years and then I moved out um and lived with a a friend who just gave me super cheap rent like 150 bucks a month for a room um and so that was in Harrisburg so then yeah that was a kind of a grind and then towards the end it got like I said it got pretty depressing but yeah when I came home from tour and people ask you that was the worst because in the beginning you're like oh yeah we went we played went the whole way down to you know Tallahassee over to Austin up through Kansas City to Michigan and played like you know it was a lot of fun it's like a good time and people thought it was cool and then once you're doing that for so long it's like damn like I don't know it's just I didn't want to talk about it and then so I finally uh I Recon so my wife now we had dated my senior year of college and we dated for a year and then broke up for four years and so we kind of reconnected when I was 28 or something 27 and then I was like okay I need to move on need to go do something I don't know just need to move on and I moved to Baltimore dude and it was just like on a whim not cuz of Kimmy kind of but her so her brother had a boat cleaning business and I had just gotten off tour and they the I was this is so sounds so insane so I I was working for a I was working for a water meter company installing water meters throughout like they were upgrading all the water meters this requires no skills I learned them on the Fly okay Robie you haven't heard these stories it sounded like torture you'd be out in the freezing weather trying to like use tools dude that that job was it was so hard but it really taught me a lot uh about independence and kind of because you'd be out in the field and things would go wrong and you couldn't call anyone cuz when I was younger I used to I wasn't very independent my mom did do a lot of stuff for me and for us kids you know she's just trying to help us but I never was taught resilience or anything like that and so then that job honestly that was another thing that changed my life was being stuck in the middle of nowhere if the water meter breaks or something and you just got to figure it out and it's like at the time the job sucked I thought it was such a shitty job but you don't realize like some things just are good in in the long run or in hindsight and that was a super like it was hard it was manual labor in a way or just being out in really bad conditions and that a winter in Pennsylvania and uh but that that really helped a lot so anyways I came I came home from that from a tour and they were like yeah we don't have any more work for you like all the our contracts are dried up so I didn't have like any money to my name and I needed a job and my so Kimmy who I was dating she lived in Annapolis and I knew her brother had this boat cleaning business I was like can I just work for you for summer and I like like I'll figure the rest out I just need as long as I have a job will figure it out and so I found a place on Craigslist within a couple days and thank God it was in Canton cuz I had no idea like where anything was in Baltimore oh W I was just lucky it's like a block from my kids school and he had a room that didn't even have a full wall it was like it was like you know the middle rooms and row homes the tiny little ones it was one of those where just basically the bed fit in and the wall didn't even go the whole way up to the ceiling it was like it was crazy but he only charged me like 400 bucks a month or 450 for everything which in Canon is insane yeah and so so lucky luckily I moved there work did the boat detailing stuff for a year uh then I did it myself like I ran the business for Year and that was the hardest job I ever had like no question about it it was like it was so hard cuz you imagine just a 50ft yacht and you have to wax the whole thing just imagine the whole thing like yourself yeah you had no one else like I had it my friend my one friend uh from home actually like that he came down and did it with me but you have like a power tools like a power buffer and you're waxing the whole thing like underneath my dad used to do that I would do like one section for four minutes and be done yeah it's like dude it sucks thanks for the help and is in July your heat is like radiating off the boat trying not to get sweat on it CU then messes everything up it's like I mean I was in good shape but that was brutal and that's another job where I'm like dude I hope it doesn't come back on me because there's a lot of chemicals and stuff like yeah I don't even know we hardly ever wore masks you were outside and don't forget did medical testing too oh [ __ ] I didn't I didn't talk about the medical testing I did oh yeah so the whole time we were in the band real brief we like me and the other guys in the band we were all broke so there's the Hershey Medical Center would do these medical tests of all kinds of crazy stuff and I mean I did drug testing in college that was a whole another thing that was that was crazy super crazy but cuz that was clinical drug trials that you would have to stay at the place for a whole weekend and then but I I did these at the Hershey Medical Center they did these all kinds of tests where they would they would inject your arm with vitamin C which makes it feel like it's breaking somehow I don't even know how it would hurt so bad and then they would measure the nerve activity in your leg which I still feel like I can feel how many times I got stuck with that and uh the one time they put these like thin like acupuncture needles the whole way straight through your like four of them like one end of the other are you sure you weren't in the movie Saw I don't know it was a crazy time but and then then you get like 50 bucks in a lunch voucher and you and everyone in the band would do these yeah like we were their main clients we get the first people to call they just where they be like hey farewell flight is here yeah honestly they would we they'd be like yeah we just saw Timmy he's got his crackers and lunch vouchers did I meet Timmy you might have met it once who's the one who has the Keen Ted too that's Mark Mark okay yeah you I think you might you might have met him he does live he actually lives in Baltimore now but yeah I thought it was weird that I was I used to listen to the song on Spotify that was one of your bandmates songs I still think it's a great song oh yeah that's right I forget the name of the song though um I'm trying to remember which one you listen to It's one wor like pretend that you just pretend that you love me yeah um um what's the name of it though anyways his name's luer r l l u KR check out his music it's great yeah I his voice is really good yeah no and I I was listening to him and Robbie goes what are you listening to yeah and I said that he go I used to be in a band with that guy I like that was my lead singer um yeah and then so boats was last so did the boats yeah so the uh the other kids or sorry the other guys in my band so they when I left the band they moved to Nashville and you left you broke up the band uh a drummer once I announced my departure our drummer was also Mark was like the I think it was the writing was on the wall I don't think it's that crazy then the other guys moved to Nashville and they they wrote songs with a lot of other people and played country with country music artists like I would think that such a hard road unless you have that success yeah and even if you have the success then you got to try to repeat it but it's just everybody wants it everybody is trying to do it and if you're out there in a van and you're freezing in the middle of Kentucky or wherever you were yeah eating you know AR sandwiches because that's what you can get yeah the will to continue going on and to continue pushing in that direction has to hit a limit at some point yeah yeah no exactly which it did I mean yeah it's it's hard it was hard and so I think I was definitely it it was a weird leaving that was tough and then moving to Baltimore because I didn't know anyone in Baltimore besides my wife and then but she didn't she lived in Annapolis at the time and time she wasn't your wife right and so and so I didn't really have any friends and it's a huge you don't understand how much of it how much of a lifestyle change that is because when I was in the band if you think about 3 weeks I've never been as close to people anyone in my whole life most people aren't we would be with each other literally 24 hours a day where you're playing together drinking together sharing the van traveling together sleeping on the same floors next to each other it's I I it it's almost like being in war not in that way but I understand I never understood why people want to go back to war mean like camaraderie yeah and I never understood why why would you want to go back to war you're at home why would you sign up again but I totally get it because that's it feels like a whole piece of VI is missing when you have that it's not the war aspect it's not the danger it's not the depression it's like that part of being close to people like that and then having being completely out of that it's like really hard to deal with so that was actually pretty difficult for me at the time um because we just stay up till 4:00 a.m.",

  "text": "a lot of us were never taught how to run we just run and that's fine but sometimes as we start to increase our mileage we can start to pick up little aches and pains and injuries due to bad habits in our running form well the good news is a few simple tweaks can make a huge difference if we learn to run more efficiently it will ultimately make us a faster runner and who wouldn't want that but also less prone to injuries as well there's no one size that fits all with running form everyone is unique different body types different strengths and weaknesses that will affect how we run my running form itself isn't perfect but it's something I've worked on so much over the years to now I'm quite proud of it but I'm still making improvements So today we're going through the technique Basics and some things that you can do on your next run to help improve your running form the first thing we're talking about is Cadence Cadence quite simply is the number of steps you take per minute most experienced run outs will have a Cadence some where between 170 and 190 now newer Runners will often have a Cadence much lower than this around about 150 to 160 so if that's you you'll most likely benefit by trying to increase it by raising our Cadence our feet will be in contact with the ground for less of a Time there'll be less impact coming back through our body causing those injuries now most modern watches most garments most choruses most polar whatever you're using you will be able to record and see this data in your app of choice and you definitely can in straa depending on which one you're using so if you're unsure then check that out in the app and just go on a nice steady run and see what kind of figure you are running at so how are we going to go about trying to improve it and raise it up the first thing is using a metronome app back in the day I had to clip one onto my shoulder and listen to it as it Beed away it was kind of I think it was a musician's metronome you can still get those if you want to but most modern ways of doing this you're going to get a metronome app on your phone and you can set that at the beats a minute and run along in time with the beat as it's clicking away like that you can also set a metronome on most modern Garmin watches as well and just run along to the beat that your watch is making and on top of that you can also add a data field to your watch as well and see in live real time the Cadence that you're running at and then again you can try and focus on that with your metronome app and just make sure you're running at the Target Cadence that you're going for a couple of other options here the first one if you are a Spotify customer then spottify I have some dedicated playlist at different beats a minute 165 170 180 Etc just put that in the search bar up at the top and then listen to some music as you run along that has been set to that exact metronomic beat the last thing I want to chat about here is strides now strides is quite simply 20 second burst of speed it's really hard to run these with bad running form but it also gets us to increase our Cadence up to a high level as well this just gets your body used to moving more efficiently over the ground and turning your legs over a little bit quicker which you then can translate into your regular speed running as well and they also help to get us a little bit stronger so there's so many bonuses by putting some strides in I'd recommend putting these after your easy run during the week at some point just once a week it will really help improve your running form and your strength as well then a final little tip here if you are running around about 150 beats a minute say you're more of a beginner Runner don't try and jump all the way up to 180 it will be too much on your body just try and Chip Away with this over time I say recommend about five beats a minute chunks at any one time right let's move on to chat about posture now as we run as our foot hits the ground we want to make sure our head shoulders hips and feet are all stacked up in a nice straight line with a forward lean that's coming from the ankles and not from the waist this allows us to benefit from Gravity that will help to propel us forward as we run we want to be running with nice relaxed shoulders not not all hunched over like that I really also like this analogy which I learned from my running form coach Shane benzy we'll link to his details down below which is imagine you're running with some crisps or some potato chips if you're a different part of the world in the UK in your hands and you don't want to crush them you want nice relaxed hands we don't want to run with loads of tension in your hands there you just want to be protecting those crisps we also want to make sure our arms are not crossing the center line as we run so imagine running say towards the camera almost like I am here with with a nice line drawn through the body we want to make sure our arms are not crossing over like this which we do see quite a lot of people doing we just don't want to be losing loads of excess energy wasting loads of energy moving our trunk and our torso around like this save energy and use that to propel yourself forwards instead so how are we going to go about improving our posture well the first thing I'd recommend and I did this so much when I started running is to make sure you stand up tall and fall forwards into your run and don't worry it is going to make sense start standing up straight and then stop and start a few times start your run just by falling into your run just lean from the ankles into your run and start running this gets the body used to being in that nice forward lean position no need to do this on absolutely every run you're going on but maybe just when you're trying to improve your running form once or twice a week will be really good just stop start maybe four or five times just as you get going now another way to visualize this I see a lot of these onewheel scooters around London and again they Lean Forward forward to go forwards as they're slowing down they lean back that's the same sort of visualization that we want when we're starting running leaning from the ankles lean forwards into it and then you can start running we also want to be checking in with our running form cues as well things we want to think about as we're running have we got a nice high head position our eyes looking forward to the Horizon nice relaxed shoulders running tall and again just think about these things eyes up relax shoulders Amma running tall again most modern garments allow you to set different alerts for this customer alerts that come up on your watch just to check in eyes up relax shoulders running tool just think about that as you're running along and then finally we want to work improving our core strength like I said earlier we don't want to be wasting loads of energy here how can we improve our core just very basic things dead bugs Bridges planks side planks stronger core means we'll hold that upright position for longer so many people's form collapses towards the end of races the end of half marathons and marathons especially everything is getting very tired and fatigue the stronger our core the better running form we're going to be having towards the end of our race the better we're going to be running overall right next up we're talking foot placement and Landing so with our foot placement where do we want to be landing well ideally underneath our Center of mass as we've just talked about in our posture there we're going to make sure everything is nicely in a line and we don't want to be over striding out in front of us as this will be creating that breaking force which is what we really don't want to be doing there's been so much debate about heel striking specifically over the years if it's something we want to be avoiding where should our foot be landing should I 4ot strike midfoot strike or heel strike myself I'm a midfoot striker I believe that's the best way to move but it really doesn't matter as much as we used to think it did as long as we're Landing nicely underneath our Center of mass some Elite Runners Charlotte pgy one of the UK's best ever marathon runners runs with a heel strike but what brings all Elite Runners together is I say they're Landing nicely underneath that Center of mass now I would say if you want to change the way you move if you are a hill Striker you want to become a bit more of a midfoot striker then it's something I really would urge people not to concentrate on too much because a lot of the time it can cause people to overcompensate and end up running on your tiptoes which really isn't a good way to be landing so there's lots of things we can do to help this transition naturally if you do want to be running with more of that midfoot Landing first thing I'd say here is to shorten your stride a little bit and increase our Cadence this will naturally lead to our foot Landing nicely underneath our Center of mass again something I used to do loads when I started running is to practice some barefoot running on a grass on a grass on the grass or potentially if you live in a more Coastal area on the beach a nice Sandy area now why I find this really fascinating is because a lot of people will run along with a heel strike take the shoes off run on a nice soft surface they will then naturally be running with more of a midfoot strike because they don't have that huge lump of foam and shoe underneath them to protect them from Landing in this really sort of very natural way if you're not used to this this can put quite a bit of strain on those lower leg muscles so only do this for some short bursts just running at your natural easy running pace maybe something like 4 by 30 seconds just to practice this again we can do this at the beginning of a run at the end of a run finish in a nice grassy area this also helps to increase our propri reception the amount of feedback we're getting from the ground up into the body into the brain as well again modern running shoes running in these massive foam things on our feet we just don't really know what's going on out that there and our brain doesn't really like it two other little things that we can add in here as well Hill reps now believe me Hill reps are such a good thing to be putting into our R not only does it build a lot of strength it promotes a faster Cadence but it also really helps encourage Landing underneath that Center of mass as well it's quite hard to run up a hill over striding so again put these in your routine maybe once every couple of weeks do some Hill reps doesn't have to be much just something four five 6 by 60 seconds up the hill and a nice slow jog back down and then finally drills practicing these movement patterns of running and correct Landing some high knees some butt kicks simple stuff that we can put into our weekly routine potentially do these before one of your speed sessions now we've talked quite a lot in this video All About Cadence if you want to learn a little bit more detail about Cadence I'll link to my dedicated video All About Cadence up there so go and check that video out next that's it guys keep on working hard keep on down and I'm sure you become a bch better faster stronger happier Runner overall with all of these tips that's it guys we'll see you in the next one h",

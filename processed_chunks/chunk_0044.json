  "text": "I've been flying all over the world to enjoy racing and the running community and now it's my turn to play host and welcome everyone to my home turf so it's time to hop on the L and head to the loop this is a runner's weekend at the Chicago marathon [Music] yo what's going on it is about 2 o'clock in the afternoon on a Thursday race weekend here in Chicago I'm currently at the Expo which doesn't make sense because I'm not running for the first time in a long time but I'm here because I'm doing something I've never done at Chicago and that's talk on a panel in the expo hall I'm going to be doing that with Lindsey hind in just a little bit I'm early though so let's take a look inside and see what the marathon XO has to offer this year [Music] the packet pickup area looked pretty empty very organized Chicago is always very efficient let's see if I can find any friends look at look at this guy [Music] W just stopped by the rabbit Booth they're doing some Screen Printing and basically the main thing I want to do is say hi to everybody make sure we're all set for the event tomorrow and then also take a quick photo so I can put out a reminder that the event is tomorrow for everyone and let's see what else is [Music] around yes of course my new [Music] fian it's starting to get a little bit busy in here most of the booths are are kind of small looks like an has a pretty big [Music] Booth got a little bit of time very thirsty let's find something to drink [Music] guys it's almost time for me to get up on stage I don't see around anywhere I'm sure Lindsay will be here somewhere he's got a little bit of time I feel like Lindsay's been on stage all day today most people watching this already know who Lindsay Hine is but for those who don't Lindsay has her own successful running podcast and she and I are part of a larger group of personalities who are on a different podcast called relay this session was supposed to feature a couple additional relay members and we were going to talk about our favorite Marathon memories but flights got impacted coming into Chicago so it's just Lindsay and me yo what's going on Lindsay had never actually interviewed me before so we dug deep down into the kofuzi origin story now panels at Expose are always hard because the Acoustics are terrible and people are constantly coming in and out but Lindsay is a great interviewer and a good number of people stuck around afterwards there was some selfie time and Lindsay and the sound guy from the Expo could have just been being nice but they did say that gayen Ruff was also on a panel earlier in the day and more people got in line for selfies with me than they did for him it's not a contest but that did put a little feather in my [Music] cap that is all the Selfies Lindsay left she's going to go to her hotel she said but I think there is a industry like Social Hour happy hour so everyone that's at like the Expo exhibiting is going to be doing like there's a party I guess so I've never heard of that that before so let's check that [Music] out the Expo is shedding down the bar is getting set [Music] up started here in 5 minutes the bar is now open though if you would like to grab a drink before we get started apparently at the end of the first day of the Expo there's a little party for all the exhibitors the race director for the Chicago marathon says a few words about how many people came through the expo hall that day and he thanks everyone for helping make the Chicago Marathon Expo a success the charity groups are invited to and it was a nice surprise to see some friends there and the baa guy who I see everywhere but I've never met was it's also there that's it from the XEL and the industry Social Hour the happy hour now we're going to get some dinner [Music] Lindsay had made dinner reservations for a bunch of us and we went to Robert's Pizza which I had never been to before it's in streeterville locals don't ever really eat in streeterville but the food was good and Peter finally made it into town the Ambiance was delightful and it was good to have a quiet dinner with friends before things got really hectic good morning it is currently a little bit after 9:00 a.m. on a Friday here in Chicago this year my Chicago Marathon coverage is going to be different than what I normally do because normally I run the race this year I'm going to try and cover it more like a journalist let's go pick up my media [Music] credentials months ago I had applied for media credentials I was hoping for a starting Corral and finish line access is part of my coverage of the American Pro women specifically at first Chicago marathon was all confused and kept asking what Outlet am I from and I told them I'm just a YouTuber but I cover races and sent them links to some of my previous [Music] work eventually they came back and said I could have some access although not behind the finish line and I felt like that was good enough at least they didn't say no but when I kept getting emails about scheduling for the press conference and which athletes would be in attendance there I thought that my level of access included being able to go to the press conference but apparently that was not the case they were really nice about it but they weren't allowing me in all right thank you very much all right guys so I was not allowed into the press conference I have some credentials but my credentials Aren't Enough credential to get into the press conference on the plus side I found Peter hey also rejected from the press conference yeah so I feel a little bit less Bad Peter didn't get in also P Alvarez who shoots really great stuff and is here to shoot for A6 also couldn't get to the press conference so I feel like I'm in good company is but now we've got some extra time on the calendar so we're going to go check out tracki the tracksmith pop pu has been in the same space for several years now and while part of me wishes they would try something different the fact that they are choosing tradition over novelty is just about the most East Coast thing that this New England brand could do it's still one of the best opportunities you'll have to touch and feel so much of the tracksmith catalog in one place at one time and their Marathon Majors merch is always topnotch plus they had tracksmith bananas [Music] all right that's it from the tracksmith popup it's always so dark in there it's hard to really photograph but they always do such a nice job now let's head over to [Music] bandit in contrast to the tradition of tracksmith bandit has reinvented itself every year in Chicago this year's theme was Architects Studio which works well for a city that has had to rebuild itself from literal ashes and whose Architects were charged with the Mantra make no small plans it took us over an hour to get into the space but the time passed quickly I was in line with friends and I kept bumping into other people I knew this line for Bandit is super long never seen anything like [Music] this hey how's it going camera good to see you again man how are you yeah I'm doing good good to see you [Music] yeah once inside the space delivered on the architect's theme race product was flying off the shelves and there was coffee and going back to that architect's Mantra the full quote from Daniel Burnham goes like this make no small plans for they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably the eles will not be realized I've always thought that this was a good quote for both Architects and Runners left the Bandit popup it was a really long wait but very well done in there they always have such a great takes on what modern retail should look like it's amazing uh Peter's going to head back to the Expo I don't know what he's doing there but he's got to go back suggested he take a divy bike uh and now I think I have enough time to go for a run so I'm going to stop on my car change real quick and then hit the L from cuz I haven't done that in a long time before we moved out to the far suburbs a couple years ago I used to run these routes every day and I've been back since but for some reason on this particular run I was feeling nostalgic the old shoes that I really love testing here the frustrations of low heart rate training and the Relentless windiness of Winter the memories all came flooding back today and for a moment I wondered if maybe perhaps the pavement remembered me too it didn't feel like it did and while I was feeling suddenly very lonely it was overall good to turn the legs over and enjoy the Run halfway into the run about 3 and 1 half miles from downtown sure do [Music] miss now I've been thinking about the press conference thing all morning and I was kind of sour about it but before any anyone gets all mad at Chicago marathon um I do want to say that they did turn a lot of people away from the press conference like hoe uh kzy couldn't get in there um I think they ultimately let him in but he forgot his like credentials up in his hotel room and when he didn't have them they wouldn't let him in so I mean they were pretty strict about who they were letting into the press conference um but I'm not sure but I think that when I requested media credentials I only requested like start line and finish line access I don't know if I had to specifically state that I wanted access to the press conference or not if that's the case and I didn't then that's on me but I'm not sure I don't remember anyway I thought that the uh ShakeOut run was like kind of far and I thought I might have to move my car but it's actually just up the street so I'm going to leave my car here and head over [Music] the first ShakeOut run that I would be hosting for Chicago marathon weekend was at industry ALS it's a pretty new spot in Chicago and it was gorgeous on the inside rabbit was there to support the kafui Run club by letting us demo their new Dreamchaser shoe and most importantly they provided a space for us all to [Music] meet oh on I love it I love it awesome after we put on some new shoes and chatted for a bit rabbit Sam welcomed everyone and explained the route and then we were off for a sunset run yo all right thank you guys thank you the route took us over to the lakefront and over to the Planetarium at the turnaround point we waited for the entire group to assemble and then of course we took a selfie we are a mile and a half into the Run got beautiful sunset Chicago is really treating us today fun fact this is where my wife and I took our wedding photos about 17 years prior we then took the same route back to Industry ALS and headed to the upstairs bar for some rehydration with a special rabbit 26.2 Brew there was food rabbit raffled off a bunch of prizes and the atmosphere was perfect for a Friday [Music] [Music] night good morning everybody it is 8:15 in the morning in Chicago on a Saturday the day before the marathon So today we're going on a ShakeOut run let's go meet in Lincoln Park find everyone at as6 and [Music] Fleet for coming pretty much from the moment I got to the a6m Fleet Feet event on Saturday morning I was sworn for selfies this was incredibly flattering and I'm always honored to do it it means so much to me that on the day before your marathons you all would wait in line just to spend a moment with with me I love hearing about how far you've come to get where you are what your goals are for the race and I'm always happy to give tips for Chicago marathon or for your cheer squad to get around the city but at a certain point after all the A6 demo shoes were handed out Fleet feed made sure that I got everyone together for our group photo before we headed out for the run all right welcome [Music] [Applause] everybody there's a lot of people here if it's your first Mar thought tomorrow raise your hand awesome a lot of you guys have been asking me for one piece of advice and the one thing that I'll tell you is everything you need to do tomorrow you already have within you to do tomorrow you're going to be able to do it you've already put in the work you guys are ready go out there and enjoy those [Applause] 26.2 you guys ready yeah yo and then we were off Fleet Fe provided the Pacers to lead out multiple groups and we went North along the lakefront what's going on man good to see you how are you thanks for coming it was a bit windy which made the waters choppy and it was like Chicago was saying yesterday was about the skyline and to today is about the Great Lake guys we've hit the turnaround point we got 1.7 miles we're going to head back let have T-shirts pancakes and celf when we got back to Lincoln Park as6 and Fleet Feet provided pre-race pancakes and syrup my apologies to all the Canadians who attended for the caliber of our maple syrup we do the best we can on this side of the border and the shirts that as6 made for the kafui Run Club this year were incredible as6 has been making kafui run Club shirts for the Chicago ShakeOut every year and every year it's one of my favorite things that I get to be a part of a couple notes about the t-shirts though I know some of you didn't get a shirt even though you had a confirmed RSVP and that the distribution setup benefits the fastest Runners I'm aware of the issue and I will try to figure out something different for next year also I don't know know why the shirts say 2025 I did approve the final graphics and I don't recall there being any year on the shirt at all but it's almost 100% certain that I didn't catch the error so that one's on me last thing I want to say about the event is thank you to chase Fleming my videographer for the weekend he not only helped me provide footage from this event but he also helped film The Rabbit event the night before and also some key moments from the marathon itself this entire video just wouldn't be the same without his contribution and I'll be working with him again in New York so if you see him make sure to say hi all right guys ran all the miles took all the Selfies I did not eat any of the pancakes though I didn't have time for that but hopefully you guys enjoyed the breakfast now Chase and I we're going to go check out the on [Music] store an did team up with a local Brewery and run club for a Chicago presence this year but I had scheduling conflicts for a lot of those events so instead Chase and I went to check out their new permanent location near Rush and Division which is the exact right location for an on store if you know Chicago the store was pristine and I love the slide out shoe shelves there were a lot of shoes that I had not ever seen before and while some were pretty exciting that excitement is tempered by the fact that I often can't tell if if an on shoe is a running shoe or just run inspired the apparel though was crisp and neat on has always excelled in the apparel and accessories Department everything they make is just so [Music] good finished checking out the on store has a nice new permanent space there I love the way that they do retail I then dropped off chase at his hotel think we might be meeting up for dinner later we'll see what his schedule ends up being like but I've got a little bit of extra time today I wasn't sure if I was going to make it but now I'm glad that I am going to be able to make it to the Pioneers [Music] P Pioneers is a blackowned running apparel brand that Tommy runs first put me on to a couple years ago since then I've had a chance to meet the founder Sid Baptista and see the company grow with popups in Boston and New York and now I was excited to see what Sid and team had brought to [Music] Chicago the space looked amazing Pioneers has recently announced a formal partnership with Brooks so there was glycerin Max and water bottles decorating the space and the pioneer and GRC run Club collab merch looked incredible the whole thing was in the drip Collective space I did get a coffee while I was there I drank it at the counter and it was a welcome moment of calm and an otherwise frenetic weekend [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right I had a delicious coffee in there and just sat for a minute kind of zoned out on my phone for a little while and had a chance to kind of recover which was much needed the space in there is awesome hopefully you had a chance to check it out you're in Chicago um man I'm I'm just so happy for Sid and for years uh to making such great progress now I just heard from Ali Feller she told me she can get me on the list for her live show today which I wasn't sure if I'd be able to go or not cuz I can never RSVP fast enough to get a ticket for any of her live shows so I'm happy to get on the list it's not till 4: so I've got a little bit of time I think I might be able to squeeze in a little bit of an extra run anybody who I'm anybody anybody who I'm anybody who I'm anybody all right guys just hit the three mile Mark going to turn it around head back get ready for the live show after changing quickly at my car I got to the alley on the Run live show about 30 minutes early and even then the line to get in was around the block since I didn't exactly have a ticket to this show though I kind of hid towards the back of the space once I got in and watched as everyone eagerly rushed in to get a seat near the stage fun fact after I had gotten denied at the press conference the day prior I had bumped into alley on my way out of the athlete Hotel I was feeling pretty bummed about the situation and Ally was nice enough to buy me a coffee to cheer me up and while we were talking I had mentioned that at least I had got a chance to see Emily sis that morning walking back to the hotel after an early run and although I've seen her race many times I'd never actually had the chance to say hello but Emily appeared to be on the phone at the time so I didn't bother her for a photo that's when Ally said that I should just come to the live show since Emily Sison was going to be the guest so this was a real treat for me thanks Ally for the invite [Music] that was a lot of fun in there I hate to leave early I wanted to save for the whole time thanks Ellie for making sure that I could attend today uh it was super fun but I have dinner plans as well so we going to hop back in the car and pick up Tommy we're going to get some pizza and poly cheese Tommy had asked me a while ago if we could go to dinner the Night Before the Race he knows that I know he's vegan and as a local I'd know a good spot I picked paully G's cuz I like the pizza there they have a vast menu of vegan and vegetarian offerings and because it was in Wicker Park and not in the loop or streeterville it wouldn't be slammed with other marathoners looking to carb up we went there with Tommy's friend Dante who was running her first Chicago on a Nike bib like Tommy was and I'd like to think it was a nice low-key dinner for the night before a race [Music] [Music] all right the athletes are off it's time to get into position [Music] all right guys they are off they're moving quickly going try to catch up one or two more times before they leave theop the world the world [Music] world can't you hear the world is calling the world is calling the world is calling for [Music] you all right gam Rooker went out

see him he's been having a good day he he particularly enjoyed Central pacing he didn't know Central was going to be out here so he's a big fan that was fun that was fun this this is why I love Chicago you see everybody here want to be a woman and so I spent the rest of my day working backwards along the course trying to find my friends I've been enjoying the Chicago marathon as a racer for the past six Runnings and while I've enjoyed each one of those experiences nothing was like seeing my home City again from this side of the barricades sometimes it's hard to tell when you're burnt out and I'm starting to realize that I overdid it with everything this year but this Chicago the year that I didn't run I'll always remember it as the year that recharged me the most glamour [Music]",

  "text": "[Music] [Music] there he is made it [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] jum jum jump [Music] [Music] warm up up is in the books we made it to Italy everybody uh quite the journey we're in Casto Italy Northern Italy this is like the kind of the foothills of the dolomites the plane was great uh you know the first night didn't really sleep a ton but the second night last night uh so Joseph and I arrived Thursday yesterday was Friday they've been taking incredible care of us feeding us well oh the pasta the pasta it's so good but now it is Saturday so I'm racing today and tomorrow today is the VK actually the mountain is right behind me all right so we're going up that it's beautiful it's epic um and the ladies actually already started so the men go second so what is a VK so it's 2.6 miles I think this is the shortest race since high school I'm not even I really I think it's last time I Ran 2 miles was in high school on the track so this is 2.6 Mi to the top and uh just over 3,000 ft all right there it is on your screen that's the that's so we're talking 24% average grade but you start in town so that eats up maybe a/4 mile of the course and then you just start climbing but what's kind of cool it's not just pure nature it's also you're running through people's backyards and little farms and gardens and you're weaving in and out of these houses so it's going to be epic um it's the first so what are the goals for today a have fun with Joseph in the Italian mountains B uh figure out what is it what does it feel like to race a vertical kilometer this is the first VK of my entire life it's only it only took me 39 years but we're here we're doing it and then see is I want to stick my nose in it um I I know I just know it's going to go out like a like a high school or or college cross country race so but I want to stick my nose in it and just see see how we do this is definitely out a little out outside my wheelhouse but um I I feel good we've been getting some good fkt training as you all know in the Colorado Rockies and so the elevation so obviously Joseph and I when we start our fktsgi lower than what we're used to in Colorado so hopefully hopefully that helps us a little bit here in Casto again shout out to Alex the race director thanks for hosting us and uh giving us delicious food here in Italy and uh having the welcoming ceremony last night it was so fun to see all the athletes and let's rock and roll all right and to all the locals who traveled up from uh southern Italy to say Hello thank you thank you have

camera here making sure it doesn't fall oh M all right I think it's good we survived we survived we survived we didn't fall off the mountain that's a good thing that's a good start to the uh trip in Italy here's the deal everybody um give yourself a little Grace when you're trying striving to find your Niche your niche in the running world and specifically in the racing World okay just give yourself a little Grace all right give me Grace this is my first VK and it's not going to be my last will say that much but it didn't go well today uh I I mean I stuck my nose in it for maybe a half mile you know granted the entire race is 2.6 miles so I was in it for maybe like a half mile 3/4 of a mile and then they started to pull away and I'm going to break down the entire race here in a couple days but at least at the moment it just it didn't work out is the bottom I haven't even seen the official results when I get the official results I'll let you know how how I did but it it was not good uh I don't even think I was top 25 yeah it was rough any oh Mama Mia the heat the heat in Italy is no joke I don't know why anyway tomorrow's race I'm racing in like 12 hours so I actually got to go to dinner and then hit the sack but in 12 hours uh we start two hours earlier I'm I'm hoping that that's going to make all the difference in the world for tomorrow's 21k not a VK but a 21k so I'm excited about that but didn't didn't go off has planned but in the joy department and the fun Department I mean come on sharing the starting line with Joseph epic but running through the village and just seeing all the youngsters out there cheering and the elderly halfway up the mountain shout out to the Italians you guys came out in full force to cheer us on so thank you question of the day what's your top one two or three niches in the racing world in the Running World all right what do you love to do as far as racing is concern concerned I will say the VK is probably not going to be in my top three anytime soon uh but we're going to keep striving all right onward Upward at least we got to seek some beauty along the way out there oh my my oh my my all right onward we go see beauty work hard and love each other",

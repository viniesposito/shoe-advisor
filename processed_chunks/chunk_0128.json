  "text": "this is the hoker skywood X and at the time of recording this is the best rated shoe on hooker's website Runners are absolutely raving about the shoe saying things like this is the most comfortable shoe ever and it was so good I bought two pairs but as always it's not all smarts with a few onear reviewers in the mix saying I feel no stability in this shoe and they feel and look cheap so I wanted to get this shoe in and see for myself what it's like put it through its paces and see if it delivers on the Promises as a top choice for long runs that is how hoker art billing this shoe it has this absolutely crazy 48 mm stack height at the back we've got that and a load more to chat out this so let's get stuck into the hoker skywood X review as always I bought the shoe 100% with my own money so I could give you those completely honest unbiased thoughts and thank you to everyone that supports the channel by liking these videos subscribing commenting down below with your thoughts as well and of course checking out my website benp parks.com where we've got amazing running gear technical teas hats to help you out on your run feel free to use code YouTube 10 for 10% off your next order right let's get stuck into the differences between this and the outgo model so technically the Skyward X is a brand new shoe for hoker but really it does replace what was known as the Bondi X which was a carbon plated version of the Hoka Bondi Hokah have just basically renamed that to be the Skyward X I guess because the Bondi X just didn't really sell very well it was one of the worst shoes I actually ever reviewed and Runners just found it so confusing and so here we are we are with a brand new name and a much better shoe thankfully the Bondo X had really old EVA foam the skyex has this dual layer peber and super critical EVA foam midsole it's much more responsive much softer and a lot easier on the legs as well the rocket is just a lot more pronounced at the front of the shoe as well and it just rolls through the footstrike a lot lot smoother than the outgoing Bondi X right let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so the purpose of the Skyward X is for your long runs your easy runs recovery runs something that is very happy around about marathon pace or slower that long run Cruiser to look after your legs as you're panning the pavement to get those miles in price-wise this set me back \u00a385 here in the UK R about 225 $225 $360 Australian and $280 Canadian really quite expensive in the EU and the USA normally we're the ones in the UK that have to pay the high prices but for some reason it's pretty pricey in the states I don't know why maybe you do let me know down in the comments stack height at the back as I mentioned 48 mm stack height you will notice this you will be walking around while trying this shoe on feeling like you're absolutely a giant basically it's just crazy I it's only a tiny bit more than something like the uh super blast but I don't notice it in that shoe you really notice it walking around in the shoe that stack height 5 mm drop overall weightwise this is coming in at 378 G 13.3 o for me in my UK size 12 which was true to size it's very much on at the heavy side I think this might even be the heaviest shoe I've ever tested the upper of the shoe is a flat knit upper just has this sort of sock like fit to it really quite nice midsole we've got this dual density foam the top half under the foot being this really lightweight racing peber that hok like to use and then below that we've got that super critical EVA foam for that added durability yes there is a carbon plate in the shoe it's really for more stability than that all out speed it's sort of this H shaped carbon plate well bit more like the X I suppose an x-shaped carbon plate that the shoe has on the outs soole we've got this High abrasion rubber outsole there are no different widths available for this shoe which is just really quite annoying to see cuz H are normally good with that but I just don't think they're doing wider wits in the carbon plated shoes at the moment I'm not sure why but hopefully we'll see them developing that a little bit further into the future wider footed Runners you're probably going to avoid this one narrow footed regular footed wi width people will be fine there are different men's and women's versions available and as I said it was true to size for me right let's get St into all of the likes my first like with the shoe is it's just so much fun to run in it's just a real laugh of a shoe something that doesn't take itself too seriously there's so much Bounce from this energy saving foam it also does become even more lively after the first couple of runs this shoe it just sort of comes to life after around about 20K or so of training the the heel slip issues from that Old Bondi are completely gone I just couldn't run in that last shoe at all for heel slip issues this one that's all gone really nice heel counter at the back of the shoe here no heel lock lacing needed for me no slip at all so yeah a really nice much more fun shoe to run in than the outgoing model my second like with the shoe is it's just now really really smooth The Rocker at the front of the shoe just enables a really silky transition through that foot strip you just cover the ground with minimal fuss here it's really happy just cruising along a round about marathon pace or slower and doing all of that hard work for you the foot as I said felt really secure really good lock down there's this strap that sort of runs to keep the midfoot really locked down as well and that just works really well lovely padding here in the tongue at the front of the shoe really you can wear the shoe for a very long time super comfortable no hot spots no blisses no issues with anything like that my third like with the shoe and I have to disagree with that one star review from the start of the video I think the shoe is really well put together really good build quality and it feels like a quality product personally I don't really like this aqua fresh type colorway let me know your thoughts down in the comments the upper is just really comfortable as well and surprisingly good breathability in the shoe didn't have any overheating issues and getting a good airf flow through to look at it you wouldn't think that would be the case but had absolutely no issues and I particularly like the extra strength thing they've got at the front of the shoe here this is going to really help with that durability I think this this what shoe will last a very long time at the key wear points at the front of the shoe and around the heel area here it's just going to hold out really well it feels like a really good quality well put together product and my fourth like here with the shoe is yes of course this shoe is primarily designed for running with a plate and these high-end racing Foams here but we always get a lot of people that watch our Hoka reviews that aren't Runners and they just want a nice comfy casual shoe and this has been really comfortable for me for wearing casually out and about here in London it's been good for wearing for long period of time traveling around when you just want that ultimate pillow like Comfort the high stack of the shoe does take a little bit of getting used to because as I said you just feel so much taller and the plate in the shoe does help with that stability as well if you're just static or maybe standing around all day you're in a type of work environment where you do need to be standing for long periods of time and although yes it is very expensive it does work really well for a casual shoe as well well let's get stuck in to my dislikes my first dislike with this shoe is just that all out bulky and heavyweight nature of it coming in for me at nearly 400 G per shoe it really is quite crazy and yes you really do notice that out on the run it's looking after your legs quite nicely and it has got a lot of positives but the negative side of that is it's just in this massive package my second dislike with the shoe is it just has that limited type of use it really excels at marathon pace easy pace and Recovery drug Pace it likes to go out for those relaxed runs to look after your legs but it's really hard work if you want to pick up the pace anything faster than marathon pace in the shoe due to its weight and the plate really doesn't add an awful lot speed wise in the shoe it's really primarily there for that stability so if you want to be thinking that can I do it everything in the shoe 5Ks 10ks half marathon speed workor thresholds you really do not want to be doing that in a shoe like this this is something that is just happy plotting along ticking off those CS munching those Mars just don't ask it to go very fast and then my third dislike with this shoe it's just as I say in the US and EU quite a high price for a very specialist type shoe so who should be looking at the hoker skywood X but it's a really good option for any heavier Runners out there who can appreciate that extra stack height with a shoe and that plate underneath as well this foam here is never going to bottom out or just that really good solid marathon training shoe for people that maybe doing some easy Pace marathon pace easy Pace on their long runs it's really going to acceler at things like that or simply for some that just wants a nice comfy shoe for their running isn't worried always about how fast they're running just wants to put something on that's dependable happy joyful bouncy exciting just when I go out there and enjoy their runs and it's a really good option to look out for because I'm all for that coming up next we've got our best long run compilation video that will be up here that'll actually in a few days so it might not be live there yet but it will be in a few days so check out that there and this shoe will definitely feature in my best long run shoe option that's it guys keep on working hard let me know your thoughts all about the sky X keep on getting done and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

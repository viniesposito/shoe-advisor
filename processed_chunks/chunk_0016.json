  "text": "it's time to take a look back at the best running shoes of the Year these are the top five daily trainers of [Music] 2024 yo what's going on my name is kzi and I'm a non- elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys about the best daily trainers of 2024 but before I give you this list I do want to go over some disclosures nobody is paying me to make this video nobody's paying me to be included on this list and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the best daily trainers of 2024 and let's start with number five in the Five Spot this year is a Adas it is the Ido SL2 I'm really liking the updates to this shoe it is a kind of two foam Construction in here there's a light strike po core which is their rasing foam and then there's a light strike a regular Eva carrier on the outside the upper fits really great there's not too much padding on it and the whole package stays really light this shoe has a little bit more ground feel than I typically like in my daily trainers but because of both the price point of this shoe and the way that this shoe feels for runs that for me are about an hour or less I feel like this is a really great shoe for those who aren't necessarily training for a marathon so high school and college cross country runners or anyone training for 5K 10ks up to the half marathon feel like this is going to be an excellent daily trainer it also looks fantastic so it can also serve double purpose for casual wear as well coming in at number four is a shoe that I think is a little bit underrated and that is the Hoka Max 6 cuz it is just so lightweight Nimble and fun to run in now the the big change for the Mach 6 is Hoka left the kind of two foam proly construction that they had been using and went with a single type of foam in the shoe and it's a very fun foam it compresses really nicely when you're put it to the ground but it also snaps back and decompresses in a really quick and pleasant way for both easy running and for picking up the pace as well also the upper fits on me really great and there is minimal padding in this shoe it even has a little bit of an Achilles flare to avoid biting at the back of your foot so it's a very comfortable but also Fun Shoot to run it now for the number three spot I guess it's a return of this shoe to the market it is the Pegasus plus now it does say that it's a turbo but Nike is doing their whole kind of renaming of all the existing franchises in their lineup so the Pegasus turbo is now going to be called the Pegasus plus and naming conventions aside and how much I dislike what they're doing with the names aside I feel like the Pegasus plus is a very successful daily trainer they're using a modified version of zumex in here I don't think it's exactly what you're getting in say the alphafly or in the vaporfly but it is a really nice pea based foam that's in the midsole that gives you a lot of great comfort for daily training but is lightweight and can definitely pick up the pace the upper also feels really nice and it reminds me a lot of the Mach 6 but it is a Nike shoe so the fit is a little bit more snug now moving into the number two spot is a shoe that is parentally near the top of my top five daily trainer list and that's from as6 that is the Nova blast 5 this shoe only came out in the last month or so but already I've been loving the miles I've been able to put in this shoe in 2024 the Nova blast 5 got an update to its phone from FF blast Eco to FF blast Max it's even lighter even spongier even more energy return in the foam and it's just a very fun ride the new jard mesh upper also just feels really great and I think it gives a little bit more room in the forefoot than we saw in previous iteration so the Nova blast 5 takes the number two spot and that means coming in at the number one spot is a shoe from New Balance and that is the rebel version 4 this is a shoe that came out all the way in the beginning months of the year and it's a shoe that I absolutely fell in love with pretty much right away it's really lightweight and can do just about everything from a workout all the way down to an easy long run and a lot of that's because of the fuel cell that they put in here now this isn't the same fuel cell that they put in their Racing shoes instead it is a peba and Eva blend but whatever they've done to make that blend I feel like it's absolutely perfect for a daily training application because it squishes the right amount but it also can stay resilient and comfortable throughout even a very long run and because of that wide versatility the rebel version 4 takes my number one spot as best daily trainer of 2024 but I do have one honorable mention that I got to talk about and that's another shoe from Adidas that's the Evo SL and the reason why it gets honorable mention and doesn't take a spot in the regular top five lineup is because technically this shoe doesn't come out until 2025 now a lot of people have run in it already and there have been trickle drops across the internet here and there but I think unless something's changed the actual Global release date for the shoe doesn't happen until well into 2025 so so stay tuned for next year's best of daily trainers to see where that shoe ranks so those are my picks for best shoes of the years I would love to know what you've been running in most as far as daily trainers go let me know in the comments down below or better yet stop by the live stream than I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel love to talk to you guys over there

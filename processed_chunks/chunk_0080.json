  "text": "[Music] this one's going to be a little little on the Wild Side some off Trail going to pick up Joseph it's 3:48 a.m. let's go come on sometimes that b you know what I don't think I slept well but it was not hard to get out of that bed I just was like all right today's the day sees the day sees the moment let's turn that dut let's make it happen I don't know just I just popped out of that bed I did not sleep well um got home late last night but it doesn't matter we're going to make this happen we're going to go get some vert a good amount of Earth today all right somewhere around somewhere around 8,000 feet and again it's just going to be a little adventurous up uh one of the iconic Front Range 14ers so again going to pick up Joseph right now we're going to uh let the legs let the legs have a little bit of fun up in the High Country you get it now come on come on don't uh don't lay back leing come on all right well let's do it here we go [Music] [Music] than [Music] [Music] [Music] h all right where we at top of Mount merer 13,000 911 sweet 12955 yeah nice co woo now going over there [Music] yeah look uh look behind us yeah that's pretty sweet [Music] where are we at long speak yes sir 14,265 and 20925 might just have a little uh a little snack two two down three to go yes sir that was good moving well yeah [Music] gnarly yeah we did it top of pagod what is this one pagod pagod that's right new new Summit for both of us pagod third Summit of the day third Summit 13437 3 hours flat s all right look at the where we just came from holy smokes [Music] if you lost an iPhone I found it ah what's this one storm Peak storm Peak 18,38 ft in 353 here's our last one last one that mount lady Washington I don't know how I think this is it yeah basically is it highest oh man look at the diamond yeah dang what is that like 2,000 ft or pretty amazing man all right lady Washington yeah mount lady Washington Mount lady Washington 13,277 in four minutes or 4 hours and 21 minutes yeah oh man that's it five done [Music] cool camera died when you get back to the car and you don't know if you got it it it might be very close I thought we did I'm not sure my watch said exactly 14 miles on the button and I don't know what the vert I I'm guessing about 8,000 ft of vert and you might be wondering where is Joseph he's getting more mileage he needs to he needs a little more little more volume today for his weekly volume so he's to go pick him up down the road but it was close I think our total time was about 511 we don't have cell service here so we can't tell recovery is in full swing you better believe it got to take a load off after that let me turn the music down Henry and I hanging out out here question of the day when did scouting a race course or an fkt course really make a difference for you all right that's the question of the day when it's scouting a race course or an fkt course really make a difference for you out there it's incredible how knowledge of a course really really makes a difference so that was the long Peaks Grand Slam we had never done it before and sure enough crazy crazy 2 minutes we missed it by about 2 minutes unbelievable it's an it's it's probably my guess is uh 60% off Trail so you're really negotiating everything the Rocks little bit of snow little bit of water it's just it's gnarly there's no other way to put it but scouting ahead of time it just makes such a difference for decision-making speed and sure enough I mean two minutes for a 5H hour fkt attempt like that's that's pretty that's pretty close like we were very very close and at the very end like actually my one of my cameras died so I was filming with Joseph's phone there at the end but it was epic Mount Meer Longs Peak uh pagot storm and then our lady I can never get this right lady Mount Washington there we go that's so five Peaks seven 7500 vertical feet uh 14 mil was what my watch said but it was just it was gnarly and Li man I am a feeling it right now that's why I got the cat like I'm going to be a hurting unit but we did it no Falls that's always good and uh don't go do that course just so you know especially if you are not confident with steeper situations we'll just put it that way all right but it was good and of course sharing it with with your brother is the best uh Joseph was C he I'll be honest he probably would have gotten it without me but you know we stuck together and uh he's he's if you think I'm a mountain goat or a billy goat or whatever you want to call me Old Man Billy Goat he is the real billy goat of the family so it was epic but we did miss it we I think we I mean I'll just say we might have like a mount Meer that was the first Mountain so it tops out at 13,900 ft which is a Centennial mountain in Colorado so everyone goes and Hikes all the 14ers in Colorado right there's 58 14ers so 14 Summits in the state of Colorado rise above 14,000 ft well there's another challenge that people like to go after and that's getting to the top of the centennials the centennials is you can guess are the 100 highest Summits in Colorado of course my brother has done that and um so Mount merer is part of the centennials 13,9 Ft so I think we got the uh Ascent fkt for that anyway it was epic good times man but now it's time to recover hi Michael we're just grilling out here Henry keep it in the pond all right we love you guys I'm going to toss it to of course as you know the mountain running playlist all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other and love each other",

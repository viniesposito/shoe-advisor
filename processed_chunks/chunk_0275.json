  "text": "hey this is Mark from the ressers I'm here with Nick and kieren and in this video we're going to be talking about great smart watches for runners now this year for our top running watch picks we've decided to do things slightly differently so we've broken things out into individual categories to make things a little bit more digestible so if you are a beginner Runner and you're looking for a great affordable running watch we've got a video for that if you are looking for a great value running watch whether that's a cheap end or the kind of more premium end we've got a video for that as well too got a video dedicated to mid-range watches high-end watches and this Smartwatch video as well okay so let's get straight into it and we're going to go straight into our favorite Smartwatch I think we've been unanimous in terms of our pick here and that is the Apple watch Ultra 2 now the Apple watch Ultra 2 launched last year this year we got a bit more of a lowkey update we got a new color version now the Apple watch Ultra 2 is the biggest apple watch that you can get in terms of Apple watch's Apple's collection this is the watch that's got dual band GPS this is the watch that's got comparison to the Apple watch Ultra a much brighter display it's got Apple's latest chip in here as well too and that's really about kind of enhancing the performance the processing enabling kind of better integration with Siri uh and just generally giving you a better experience you're getting the same battery life as the Apple watch Ultra 2 now I think as I said we've been unanimous in terms of this being our pick of the top Smartwatch for runners now Nick maybe I'll start with you first why have you picked this why was this our pick as our top Smartwatch for run is uh so I've run with an Apple Watch for many years even when it was the series version the Apple watch Ultra brought some things that people I think have been asking for a long time in terms of having an extra button to take Laps on that kind of thing but actually I think the biggest work I mean the hardware on this watch is great the Dual bound GPS is very accurate you got a pretty good heart rate M monitor it's comparable to most watches which is up and down at times got the action button and then the software that Apple just keeps working on and I think that's what really makes it stand out in the Smartwatch world like I just don't think I've come across other Smartwatch companies making as good adjustments to their native workouts app in terms of approving the stats available the data screens going on and then the Apple watch Ultra like all Apple watches opens you up to the App Store and this is where a game where Apple has such a big lead on other SmartWatches because the App Store is just Laden with amazing running apps that are designed specifically for the Apple watch so you basically end up with a very capable tracker as a native tracker but everything that you kind of might be missing out on compared to sports watches aside from battery life which is still not great obviously as it's a smartwatch you can find in the App Store for apps like work outdoor and Ur and many other apps I've talked about many times and things so I think that's what you get with the Apple watch you get a very good tracker with very good app store and just the hardware on the ultra too does make it a big step up on the series 10 because you've got that dual band GPS and the lp button which is you know some people never use LP buttons I guess if you're not you know and if you're just using apps that have guided workouts in like Runner you might not worry about it too much but for someone like myself going down the track a lot it's very nice to have a lap button it's just something that I think is a bit of an essential all around so yeah I just I think as smart watches go it TI Pi all the boxes in terms of a Run Tracker as well and it is a very serious sports watch that also happens to be a very very good Smartwatch yeah and just to add that obviously with the Apple watch you are getting something that runs on watch OS and with watch OS we are seeing Apple I've seen Apple kind of delve a little bit more into the kind of training analysis side things so we're seeing training load added as a metric we're seeing effort added as a metric as well so apple is kind of moving in that direction now Karen how have you found your experience with the Apple watch Ultra 2 and in terms of your testing over the year yeah I mean next covered off a lot of those sort of highlights I think bigger battery life more rugged build uh the action button I find when you don't have it on the Apple Watch series 10 you kind of miss it it's one of those things that when it first came out I was like what's the big deal but if you do use it you do miss it when you go back battery lives are key for me I I tested this actually back I did three days around Lake Garder with the Apple watch ultra um up against I think a 4Runner 965 so it was running like 7 hours a day and I wanted to really test whether or not the Ultra battery life would work for going sort a longer distance and it does you know it will cover that so now you you finally kind of got an Apple Watch where if you're thinking about going to you know going to 50ks and Beyond you've got something that can kind of cope you know an average 1 hour max accuracy run Burns around sort of between sort of five and 9% for me depending on what I'm using during and then you just got all of the other tools that if you're going to go on an adventure one thing I real life it's got you covered for and if you're doing something like a solo late Garder run you could pop in you could use all the contactless payments you've got your calls you've got all the stuff that you really need to be free and and and and run without sort of having to carry loads of other stuff as well which I I really like um the other thing I do I do really like the way that they've done the training load and the RP basically I think having the ability to tweak the how you felt that run went with your um perceived exertion and put context to that data is something that a lot of other watches they might give you the smiley faces but I think Apple's done it really well and they used it to change the readings in a in quite a good structured way I really like that yeah and I think my experience and I think the reason that I've picked it as well is that my experience has just been solid I mean I wish there was another Smartwatch out there that I felt that could really rival what I seen with the Apple watch Ultra and the ultra 2 but I haven't seen anything yet in terms of my testing and when I've kind of picked this watch back up and I've been out running with it again it just feels in terms of that experience the blend of Smartwatch and those kind of running watch features whether it's kind of the Native tracking or whether that's you know getting tracking support for one of you know the extensive App Store that you have and in that App Store there is high quality apps that really do enhance the run tracking experience on the Apple watch Ultra 2 I think it just makes it a complete package and you know the battery life isn't you know what I ultimately would want it to be but I think in terms of pushing things forward and it is the best battery life that you're going to get on an Apple watch right now then I think you know it's a compromise that I think I'm willing to make knowing the experience I'm going to get from that kind of Smartwatch and run tracking side of things now this year we did get a new Apple watch now obviously the Apple watch Ultra 2 just got a new color we did get a new Apple watch Ser was a bit more of a radical design we've got a much bigger case you know probably influenced by the fact that the you know you're probably seeing more Ultra watches out in the world we now got a bigger version of the series 10 that doesn't have the kind of dual band GPS that the ultra has but it has got a very good kind of Performing GPS mode in there it's got all the kind of qualities that you see from a software point of view that you get on the Apple watch Ultra 2 now we've all tested the Apple Watch series 10 and you know what have your experiences been with it and Karen I'll go back to you first in terms of your experience the series 10 yeah I mean the one thing that I think stands out for me is that even though you haven't got that um dual frequency or you know duel band GPS the performance was actually really good I did it of and up against the Apple watch Ultra 2 and I couldn't really find too much to choose between the heart rate performance is really good as well in this you know that that idea it's kind of it's thinner and lighter and more comfortable to wear and you're not having to sacrifice screen real estate for it is a plus and I think it's like a nice Counterpoint now to the Apple watch Ultra if you do want to have something that's going to be a bit lighter and a bit simpler it's also significantly cheaper which I think is another standout you're going to sacrifice battery life for that I think a 1 hour run for me was 7 to 8% it does burn much quicker the the rapid charge though is another thing that if you're thinking about that all sort of day use you're probably going to have to charge but if you put it on for 5 10 minutes here and there that does actually offset quite a lot of the battery life problems that you might have from the Apple watch Ultra with a bit of targeted charging so you can alleviate some of that which is a big plus we would like to see more obviously but I think this this now with the the kind of performance in the App Store backed onto it if you're looking for something that's a bit more lightweight bit easier to wear not quite got that kind of rugged build then this actually is a really good performer cool Nick now you've used all of the series watches now do you do you feel like the series 10 is a watch you could turn to and say you know this is a watch I would happily rely on to track my runs yeah I mean I would I do think it has it's like problems compared to the Apple watch Ultra 2 I love the I like prefer the design to the Apple watch Ultra 2 because it is smaller and thinner and I like the look of it a bit more as well obious it's not as rugged but that's not something I'm too worried about like you do lose some stuff that the lap button is a big loss you can get around it with apps that use both buttons at the same time and tapping the screen but I would wish I do wish they'd add that I wish they'd add Precision start to the native work app as well that just you know you could actually say when you want to start a workout you know when GPS is locked on stuff like that but I do I do notice a little bit of a drop off in in GPS accuracy like not you know General run so much but if I'm going to go and do a series of intervals especially running around like a loop and a park or something like that I do notice the series 10 would just shave off a few Corners more and just affect the pacing and sometimes a little bit like that but it's not a big loss like if it was just the only watch I was wearing I'd probably be fairly happy wearing it for everything but it's a watch I think you have to make you have to fake a few more compromises on compared to the Apple watch Ultra 2 so you really want this amazing Smartwatch experience which you do get with it it's got all the great smarts and everything like that it's got all the great apps but you got to work out a way to take a lap and you've got to do things like that which you don't have to do so much with the ultra 2 and the battery life like for most of the time it's absolutely fine like most days I've got no concern at all about finding a quick period here and there to charge but if you go and do tra if you go traveling or just go away for a weekend it's a bit of a more of a complicated issue compared to the Apple Ultra 2 so I do think it's an amazing watch I think it's a very good Run Tracker I do think the ultra does offer a level up for runners but at twice the prices you know that's a little tricky maybe to make a call or whether it's worth that extra step up yeah I agree I think it's a very good experience overall the test that I've done has been BR and a little bit like Kier and I've been testing or using it alongside the Apple watch Ultra too there definitely are some differences but they weren't for me the kind of really kind of huge differences I would think for a lot of people the Run experience would be very good I think the main thing I would take away is I feel that if you wanted a bigger Apple watch you you kind of looked at the Apple watch ra Ultra 2 and felt like it was a big watch to live with I feel like the the size difference on the Apple Watch series 10 the largest version I think will probably work a lot more for a lot more people so I think that's that's something to factor in as well but the app watch Ultra 2 is the Watch Ultimate that we have picked as our top pick now before we are accused of going all in apple we are going to talk about Androids um and I think mainly I think it's me who's been kind of testing a lot of the Android stuff there's been a lot there's always a lot of Android SmartWatches that launch you know we've had stuff from you know Samsung had new watches xiaomi we've had stuff from OnePlus we've had stuff from Google we haven't tested the Google pixel watch so we haven't had that in test so we can't really going of talk about that watch but there has been some good watch and we've you know me personally I've got through a lot of them I think you know in terms of having there being standout ones that offer a good balance of Smartwatch and running watch featur I still think we are looking for that really kind of ultimate kind of option that really kind of seeks parity with the Apple watch Ultra 2 we are going to talk about one watch that has was probably probably the most notable kind of Android launch this year and that was the Samsung Galaxy watch Ultra which effectively was Samsung's answer or you know it was meant to be Samsung's answer to the Apple watch Ultra now it had that kind of rugged design the kind of big case it's got dual frequency GPS had kind of root import and navigation didn't have the kind of full native offline mapping support that you now do get um you know whether it's through apps or kind of uh natively on the Apple watch and you know the battery life as well a little bit like the Apple watch Ultra wasn't you know that kind of Mammoth battery numbers that maybe were expecting see in Samsung Galaxy watch Ultra now kieren you tested this uh as well what was your experience of using Samsung Galaxy watch Ultra what did you make of it do you think Samsung is on to something in terms of having an equivalent to the Apple watch Ultra yeah I mean I have to kind of confess this is the first time I've really used a an Android watch in a long time and I'm obviously in the Apple universe so it's a bit of a jarring experience when you first go across to it I think there's a you know BR agreement that this is the best uh were s watch for running there's some really nice things that are robust build you've got that you know that titanium chassis You've Got A nice bright screen you've got a wide selection of apps you've got the Apple esque Action button all those things are there and those are nice things I think you're going to have to like a big Hulk and great watch though to wear this I I found it uh too big a little bit cumbersome bit too chunky I thought the strap was thick and not very malleable and there's just little touches which I didn't quite get along with and my biggest problem with it really I found in my experience was you had this kind of weird sort of um hit and miss battery life where sometimes it performed well so whilst I was running for up against the Apple watch Ultra 2 it actually performed better for over an hour run but then it would just wipe out in half a day on me and some days it would some days it wouldn't and that was a bit of a worry don't know I watched it wasn't working but it just wasn't quite there even with the Apple watch Ultra 2 though I do think there's you know there's good experience here I it wasn't enough you know if I I was looked at this from a point of view would I switch over if I was in the Apple Universe would it convince me to go and get an Android phone and go for the for this watch the answers no I can see that it's probably the most capable running watch though on the kind of within the Android kind of world yeah I think this is probably the kind of best performing Samsung Smartwatch I've used for running but saying that it hasn't been perfect I think the test I did I think I did a race test with the Apple watch Ultra and from a GPS point of view it just didn't kind of you know kind of sit up with the Apple watch Ultra too and I think from you know from that point of view that core run tracking experience and you know obviously looking at the kind of mapping and navigation support which isn't really there which I you know expect to see on that this watch wasn't there and you know my experience of the battery life performance was very similar as well it was very indifferent very inconsistent Samsung do a good job of kind of rectifying these issues but I think you know in terms of being uh an alternative to the Apple watch Ultra 2 it's not quite there yet I'd be interested to see how some with how Samsung kind of develops it and whether it's going to continue because they kind of chop and change in terms of the types of watches and ranges they do but I think it yeah it didn't quite I think work for us I think we could we can comfortably say I think for myself and Kieran so if you are looking for an Android equivalent in terms of the watches that we've tested one we're going to say that is a good one to look at is the amazed fit T-Rex 3 now the T-Rex range is effectively amaz fits kind of outdoor range and it's really trying to undercut what you would get from outdoor watches like the Garman Phoenix which obviously is very expensive you know things like the polar grit 2x Pro and this is kind of sitting below \u00a3300 now for below 300b you getting dual frequency GPS you are getting offline maps you are getting something that works with Android and iOS now from a smartwatch point of view it definitely is a work in progress but it is learning very quickly and while it doesn't have this app ecosystem around it and all these kind of big high-profile third party apps it's trying to find solutions to make you know the experience of using those kind of bigger kind of software and apps more usable so you know you're getting apps for things like Spotify you're getting things for son us which will you know help improve that experience the notification support is very good as well too you're getting a music player in there but you're not getting that kind of offline music playback that you would get from some other watches but cruly the for me the tracking experience has been very good the Dual frequency support is very good it's not spotless it isn't the best used but in terms of the Android Smartwatch I've used it's definitely felt the most reliable and you're getting very good strong battery life performance here this is a thing that amaz has really tried to do with the T-Rex range it's really tried to push towards those kind of numbers we've seen from other outdoor watches that you do have to spend a lot more money and you can get strong GPS battery life from the T-Rex 3 you can get good day-to-day battery life the good is definitely you know outweighing the bad in terms of what you're getting here and I think yeah crucially the experience for me of all the Android SmartWatches that I've tested the T-Rex 3 is being the one that's really stood out of me now there are other watches out there that are kind of Android and iOS friendly we should also talk about things from Garin range things like the venue range which and Tim that's not going to give you all those things like kind of dual frequency multiband mode all of the kind of Rich training analysis that you would get from some of the watches we've talked in these other videos but in terms of a smart watch and running watch experience you're getting a good balance there so you know you can look at what is like the venue as another alternative okay so they have it that is our video on the top smart watches for runners now if you got any questions about this video or any other watches that we've spoken about do let us know in the comments as a reminder as we said at the beginning of this video we do have dedicated videos to other

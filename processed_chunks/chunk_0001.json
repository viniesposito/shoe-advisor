  "text": "yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm a non- elite Runner who viws running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys about how much ad R A 200,000 subscriber YouTube channel makes in a year now these videos always get away from me and get way longer than I intend so let's jump right into it let's take a look at my YouTube Studio this is the channel dashboard this is an interface that I look at pretty much on a daily basis if not multiple times per day to kind of keep track of how things are going on the channel and to get to the numbers that we want to look at let's go to the analytics section and change my view to 2024 now I am filming this on December 29th to get this video ready for release at the end of the year at the end of 2024 so there's a couple of days worth of AD rev that aren't going to be accounted for in here and a lot of this stuff for December is an estimate but so far for 2024 YouTube studio is telling me that this channel has had an estimated revenue of $ 59,000 8651 and that's over the course of 11.4 million views $824,000 watch time in hours and an increase of 35.9 th000 subscribers now there are Peaks and valleys based on this in terms of how much money I'm making in a single day I think the biggest day that I had moneymaking wise was on April 23rd where I made $476 in one day in terms of Revenue coming in in that 24-hour period and that was a day where I had just posted my video from the London Marathon which is a race that I've been training for uh it wasn't a great race for me that day uh so there was a little bit of drama in that video and the week prior was the Boston Marathon and that video I think was already up as well so I kind of had two big videos that were both out at the same time which contributed to that and a lot of these other spikes are generally around either big SHO releases or other big racing events that I intended throughout the year uh if we scroll down through here we could see which were the top videos in the period the number one viewed video that I had in 2024 was for the novast 4 after 100 miles which that is a long-term update video I already made a novablast 4 video prior to that um and at the beginning of the year the long-term update came out and that came out with a 196,000 views over the course of the Year second place also another as6 shoe the A6 Nimbus 26 and in third place another update video the new balance Rebel version 4 with 162,000 views and so the number one and three spots are really surprising to me because I always feel like that there isn't as lot of momentum around the 100 mile update review video for those of you that are unfamiliar with the channel when I review a shoe I'll run in it a few times get to about 20 to 30 miles in a shoe before I do a video uh sometimes more sometimes less uh and that's kind of like the main hit that I get from reviewing a new shoe that's when people are excited about it it's when the shoe is newer I'll keep running in the shoe to see if things change and how things develop over time and get to about 100 miles and that's usually when I kind of end my testing period with the shoe uh and I'll post an update video I try to do those a little bit more succinctly because it's a follow-up I've already done a primary review on it uh and there isn't as much interest or at least feels like it but to see that two of my top performing videos or update videos is a real surprise and then another surprise that I see here is that my number sixth most viewed video is a watch video and now this is a big comparison video Coral Space 3 versus a Garmin an Apple Watch a polar Pace Pro so this was another like a big wide multiat review that took kind of a lot of time but I generally haven't been focusing it on a lot of watch or device reviews because it feels like those are a lot of work and don't get a lot of views back from it but this one did bring in 144,000 views and that's a pretty Successful video for me so maybe I need to rethink that strategy I do have a bunch of watches that I've been testing lately and I haven't reviewed yet so I think that means that I should probably do another kind of multiat big comparison review video I just got to sit down and actually film it after going through all of my testing so let's dig deeper into some of these other sub uh menus in this analytics section to give a little bit more context in terms of what this running Channel gives so now in terms of published content I have been doing both shorts and YouTube videos my shorts strategy is really just take the reals that I'm making on Instagram and then post the same one on uh YouTube shorts I've never been a huge fan of making YouTube shorts and I don't really love making short form videos I'm more of a long form guy um but I felt like I have to have some sort of present in YouTube shorts so I'm trying I'm seeing a little bit of traction and growth from it uh but it still feels like it's more trouble than it's worth uh this year I uploaded 143 shorts and I did 101 videos and those are long form videos whether it's a shoe review an update shoe review video or uh I also do Run Travel Vlogs where I'm going to a race or going to running event uh and so that's where those 101 videos are coming from um in terms of how viewers are finding me this is a product review channel so like search and optimization is pretty important but it's not the most important way that viewers are finding me at this point in my YouTube career uh the browse features on YouTube are the main way I think that's scrolling through kind of like your homepage is how people are finding me or other browsing mechanisms whether it's like you shown a kind of like a panel of videos at the end of watching a different video and you can select which one you want to watch next I think that also counts as browse uh 32.6% of My Views are coming in from browse and 31.6 are coming in from YouTube search and those are the two main ways that people find me let's compare that to 2023 where um much more of it came from browse and even less of it came from YouTube search which is interesting because this year I've spent even less time worrying about tags to put into descriptions or uh making sure that there's hashtags or accounts that are tagged or anything like that but I have been trying to spend less time worrying about like making sure that everything is optimized and just kind of naming things the way that I would name them if I were to do a search for these things let's go to audience which uh always surprises me every year um gain 35.9 th000 subscribers this year which is actually a a big decrease from last year it's a 27% decrease compared to the amount of subscribers I gained last year I think big part of that is that uh I think reviewed fewer shoes this year I did a lot of work travel traveling to events uh traveling to cover races uh and those always just take up a lot of my time and make it harder for me to review more shoes so I think that if I had reviewed more shoes uh I probably would have gained more subscribers at this point and it's been this way for a couple of years now I'm not too concerned about getting new subscribers I kind of like the number of people that are here the community feels manageable to me the community feels uh intimate and welcoming and supportive but it has been down quite a bit and I do think it's because there has been less uh shoe review videos and I do feel like I need to review a lot more shoes uh in 2025 so that's something that I want to be focusing on not just because of the fact that it affects subscriber growth that's actually one of the last reasons why I'd be increasing the number of shoe reviews uh it's just that this is a running shoe review Channel and you kind of have to remember uh what people are coming here for and then the last thing from this submenu that I want to go over is the age and gender and I always find this very surprising uh I don't really feel like I'm making a very male oriented Channel yet uh this number has been going up every single year this year I'm at 91.4% male viewership uh with 8.6% female viewership uh at least based on the ways that are identifiable from the way that you are or aren't logged in on YouTube uh it's very different than what I experience on Instagram and also even more so different than what I experience in in-person events in terms of people that are coming to meetups group runs that I do uh there it does not feel like it's 91% male to 9% female at all so that number is always a big surprise for me I've had various theories as to why this is over the years but ultimately the figure is what the figure is it's 91% male on the channel as far as YouTube and Google are concerned uh with the the vast majority of those people being in either the 25 to 34 year old category or the 35 to 44y Old category all right uh last submenu that we'll go over is the revenue section and I think there's a couple of interesting things going on in here we saw what were my top performing videos earlier in terms of views now let's talk about what the top performing videos were in terms of Revenue or ad rev that comes in um and the number one was the Sak endorphin speed 4 which was one of my favorite shoes of the year uh it didn't end up being my shoe of the year but I thought it had shoe of the Year potential that ended up being my highest revenue generating video of the year that video alone generating $1,248 which is quite a bit of a surprise it's a great shoe uh but the views weren't really there they didn't jump out at me as being like an exceptionally High performing video so the fact that the revenue is high on that is a little bit of a surprise and then the other surprise for me is that the there's three videos in the top five ad rev generating videos that are not shoe review videos so uh I mentioned that I do Run Travel uh or run Vlog type of videos I call them Runners weekend that's the name of that series the second highest revenue generating video that I have was from my visit to the Boston Marathon I didn't run it uh in 20124 uh but I went to go and put on some Live inperson Events uh and I went to go watch watch the race itself and just kind of show what it's like to go as a super fan uh to attend a big world major Marathon that ended up bringing in $1,000 in Revenue in the net net I think that in terms of the adrev versus what the expenses were on that trip uh the expenses were way more than $1,000 but that is something where I am doing in-person events where I do charge appearance fees and so there's different math that makes that work out I'm pretty sure I'd have to talk to my agent about that but I'm pretty sure that I ended up positive on the Boston trip and then number four was the marathon trials so the there was a marathon that was run in Orlando for the top American men and women to see who would go to the Olympics I went to go and spectate that race chase the athletes around the course and try and film them doing their things and being excellent uh and that brought in $940 and then the fifth highest performing was the London Marathon video coming in at $928 now there was two London Marathon videos that I made one was from the race itself and we kind of talked about that earlier on that high Revenue day that I had this runnner weekend video is a video that I make later on talking about all the things that I did while I was traveling the places I stayed the people I saw the things that I ate all that's kind of in that travel and running video together and that Runners weekend video from London rounds out the top five Revenue performances for 2024 now there's a button down here there you could see more and one of the things things that I was trying to do is figure out what was my worst performing video of 2024 but it only goes up to 50 videos now I only made 100 in one video so uh I was hoping that maybe there's like an arrow to click to next and maybe I could sort by lowest amount of Revenue that wasn't available but uh you can export your top 500 videos throughout the entire channel for the period of 2024 and when I did that uh I it gives you a separate spreadsheet I open it up in a Google sheet and it looks like to me my worst performing video of 2024 was from about a year ago January 12th it was my review of the insta 360 Ace Pro uh that video brought in $557 which puts me way upside down on the cost of that camera cuz I think it was a $250 maybe a $300 camera something in that territory so uh that one definitely is a flop which makes sense I didn't love the camera and so uh I'm not a person that likes to go negative on the internet uh and I think that my viewers don't like it when I go negative on the internet so that's a video that I think just didn't do well so uh that's pretty much it from what I had planned to go over from uh all of my statistics on this 200,000 YouTube subscriber channel uh let me know in the comments if you have any other questions that you want me to follow up on in terms of how things work or any other metrics that are going on in the YouTube channel I'm happy to share them with you you guys uh this is a video that I've been making for 7 years now I'll post links to all the other ones that you could see uh down in the description uh below so you could check those out uh if you are near one of those Milestone numbers uh to see where your channel Stacks up thanks everybody for making it all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs or whatever it is that you're doing and I will see you in 2025",

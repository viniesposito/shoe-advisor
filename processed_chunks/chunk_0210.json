  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and Megan we got something new from uh Nike we do I'm pretty excited about this because we've got the whole lineup here just like we're going to see in the vomero line the Pegasus Line is now segmented into three levels of what are they doing with the Pegasus line why are why are we using like this line what should it be intended for so this line is now the responsive cushioning line whereas the vomero we talked about was the max cushioning line and then they have the structure which is for stability all right so we've already reviewed the Pegasus 41 it got a medium review from us we felt it was a little thin under the 4 foot the react foam was okay and then you move up to the Pegasus plus and again we had a little bit of an issue with it being thin under the for foot the foam just didn't react a lot of people thought why isn't this the Pegasus Turbo now we know because of the way that they're organizing things this is the plus and now finally we're really excited about the Pegasus premium and of the three Pegasus spoiler alert this is definitely my favorite Pegasus yeah I would have to agree so do you just want to get into it let's get into it let's start like we always do from the top all right so this upper they're calling it a knit woven circular upper or something like that circular knit woven upper yeah it's got a bunch of stuff happening up here so you've got a little bit of mesh on the side you've got a knit upper towards the forefoot here you've got some overlays it's it feels like a lot happening I mean what how did you describe it earlier uh well the tongue it's a weird tongue with a lot of weird holes in it that's not what you said earlier all right anyway I really love this upper I thought it does it's like a performance upper it's got just the kitchen sink in it it's got a little bit of everything you've got plenty of padding around the heel counter and collar to give you comfort the tongue is really puffy and and like cloudlike it's like lots of holes lot there are a lot of holes that's hey it's got to cut weight somewhere we'll talk about the weight in a little bit didn't work but um I I just really love the detailing on this shoe they call it a premium I feel like it is a premium upper it's I I love this upper it fits really well yeah I do think the fit is really nice when you look down it appears to be very narrow but it actually it fit my foot fine but it does look very narrow yeah for my foot which is narrow I found it fit well I didn't get any puckering I again I really like this upper I thought it was great yeah all right so moving on to the good stuff what do we got beneath the foot all right you start off with what we really like to land on zoomx and there's plenty of it you can see there's a very thick section of zoomx foam down here for those of you who don't know what zoomx is you should but it's like a pea foam that it might actually be real packs but it is real packs and um it just feels great bouncy Airy typically it's very light so if you just had a midsole like on the race St shoes made of zoomx it lightens up the shoe quite a bit then getting down to the middle me you've got a fulllength Air Zoom unit which is crazy um now this is where a lot of people are going nuts because they're like this is Tech from the 9s what are they doing like it can't be a real running shoe with all that we've heard a lot of your comments on Instagram about the shoe but I got to tell you one the new way that they're doing these air units with the tensils inside that kind of like make sure that it's a little more stable and distributes that cushioning from the air works really well to I got to tell you this little Cloud here is a joy to run on it's also sculpted around the shoe so it kind of like hugs where the foot is whereas of those like lifestyle shoes it's more like bulky and outward so this definitely feels more like a performance feature versus some lifestyle thing although it does look good so I'd cross over and use it for lifestyle anyway we pop down to the final layer which is the react X foam and that has I mean it's basically a pretty minimal layer of it just to kind of hold the bottom maybe provide some durability for that and the way that they tie off that air bubble on the bottom it almost gives you almost like a little bit of a plate I wouldn't call it a plate necessarily but it is a a going to provide a little bit of structure and uh just keep it kind of stable and similarly to the plate it's going to give you that propulsive feeling so on toe off you really get that pop from the air unit um when you're running you can even see in the front it just goes down to uh outsole material here so you're not even having uh foam under the for foot which typically you would say uhoh but you can see how much zoomx dips down here so you're really in good shape moving down to the out soole me tons of grip tons of coverage almost full coverage rubber on the bottom and you've got that waffle pattern that Nike loves so much and yeah I I did do a couple runs in the rain or wet conditions and the traction was fine for me so I mean all this rubber guess it's working now before we weighed the shoe I went out out of the box took it out for 12 miles and I was just like this shoe feels great through the stride I was like bouncing I felt like the energy return was insane like I just it felt great on the run I didn't feel my leg is getting fatigued at the end of the 12 miles I felt great later on in the day my leg still felt fresh like the cushioning is insane in this I really loved it and we posted a I posted a quick video of it on Instagram people like it's heavy as a Breck and I was like I don't think so so I put it on the scale turns out they're correct I think for my size 10 and 1/2 it's 12 2 2 oz or 345 G which is maybe one of the heaviest shoes I've run in this year but to prove a point to be like okay it felt light on my foot now that I know how much it weighs let me go out and I had a hill repeat session and I took it out and I was like no this shoe feels good good this shoe works and even trying to do quick turnover in it I didn't feel like I had bricks on my foot yeah so my women 7 and a half came in at 9.3 o or 265 G so again this is a very heavy shoe one of the heavier shoes I've reviewed probably this year ever maybe ever um but I didn't like Thomas it didn't bother me out on the roads and I think part of that is because of this use case this is just that shoe that's super fun to go run in like if you are not motivated to get out the door you lace this up and you have a fun bouncy ride underfoot I will say it's a lot underfoot so you've got 45 mm in the heel 35 in the in the um 4 foot and so and because of this like narrow build I would say it's not the most stable shoe that I've ever run in for me that's not really an issue so it it didn't bother me but it is something to note if you are someone who needs that like very stable ride yeah the air bubble does a good job of being somewhat stable especially when you're running but it's not going to it's not providing stability this isn't a stability shoe I feel like when we talk about the propulsion and stuff like that you do get the weight bounces out with that feeling of like just popping off your foot yeah I just think the fun Factor overrides the weight for me and I think that's been true for several shoes this year which are we've talked about it before like the shoes feel like they're getting heavier but we're kind of accepting it because a the tech is great and they're fun to run in and then B it kind of makes for great race day experience cuz then you take this off and you lace up that super light shoe and it feels great the shoe that this is most similar to for me was the glycerin Max from Brooks which I was surprised another one that was heavier but the bounce in the foam and the rebound of that foam kind of kept you like moving through your stride I felt like this reminded me of that a lot I would agree I think those are two very similar shoes in their use cases where I think they differ quite a bit is in the stability and the fact that that glycerin Max had such a wide base that you could just I mean you could run Forever fast slow whatever this one it feels like it's a little unstable someone who wants that wider platform would definitely want to go with the glycerin okay you do land a little further back than I do I wouldn't call you a heel Striker but just maybe a little further back and so I didn't have any issues with the stability and that so that might be something to look out for if you're a heel Striker or something like that you'll have to let us know what you think of the ride of this now the shoes price dropped originally it was going to be 225 they've already changed that before release to 210 so it's right close to the price of some of these Max cushion shoes some of these super trainers and I definitely put this in the super trainer category even though it's called a pegasus this thing packs a lot of tech yeah I would have to agree all right so let's get into our form fit function uh out of five what do you give the form I got to dock it a little bit for the weight so other than the weight this sho's so much fun and stuff I'm I'm going to go with a four okay I'm docking it quite a bit cuz I'm going to give it a two it's very heavy and also looking down at this shoe I I'm sorry I hated it I hated it when I was running it looks too narrow and it looks super weird and I didn't like it I think it looks great like from the side but looking down is awful okay I didn't have any problem I think it looks great toe down fit all right out of five I love the fit of the shoe I thought the upper was really dialed in I didn't have any problems looking down at it like Megan but it it just I thought it was a really well executed upper it feels premium I'm going to I'm going to give it a five that makes sense with your narrow foot um I'm going to dock it a little and give it a four again it does have that like narrow build it's not perfect I felt like maybe there was too much happening in the upper but otherwise it was pretty good all right all right function for what it's supposed to be doing I think it's fantastic we talked about some other shoes on whether or not I would use it for everything I actually think that this is more versatile than you would think at its weight like I said I took it out for a long run and it felt fantastic went out and did hill repeats where I was trying to you know pick up the pace and it felt really good I think it's more versatile than the weight would let you think so again I'm going to go 4.5 all right I think I'm also going to go 4.5 well I did mention a few times the stability was a little you know maybe an issue for some people I feel like it's just so fun and I do think you'll get tons of mileage out of it and you can use it for a lot of stuff so four and a half for me as well all right so what's that total Meg you're at 13.5 I'm at 10.5 despite the lower rating for me I do really love this shoe you definitely would give this a green light yes for sure it's just and again it goes back to that fun fact and wanting to lace up this shoe and wanting to go for a run yeah this was I got to say a treat for me I love running in this shoe so I highly recommend it if you want something bouncy fun uh that looks kind of crazy yeah I think this shoe is does the job we did notice that there's a limited edition number on both of ours you have 15 of 500 or 70 what is that is 15 wow she has 15 of 500 and I'm down to 261 of 500 so you got here a lot sooner we're not exactly sure what that is I guess that's just for this colorway like maybe there's a limited edition colorway coming out there's certainly going to be more colors more availability it's not just going to be 500 shoes it'll be widely available in the spring of 2025 I don't think we have an exact date yet and again it'll be $210 you might have seen it was going to go for $225 but they have reduced that to$ 210 all right so that pretty much wraps it up may what do we want people to do if you haven't definitely go like

  "text": "if you are a heavier Runner with a larger build you're going to need something on your feet that has the right balance of cushioning something soft enough to be comfortable but firm enough to support your body through each foot strike with hundreds of running shoes on the market it can be really tough to know what's going to work for you but we've sifted through all the options here to help steer you in the right direction going back a number of years I used to be quite a heavy guy so I know how frustrating it is to have shoes that wear out really quickly and not feel well supported in your running so some of this has come from my own personal experience as well as extensive research and also speaking to a few of my friends that work in running retail speaking with Runners just like you every day to see what they're recommending heavy Runners should be putting on their feet I just want to say nothing in this video at all is sponsored in any way and also I've bought and tested and run in all of these shoes and bought them 100% with my money to give you that completely impartial honest review right let's get stuck into the best daily shoe options that's coming up now if you are looking for one shoe to do it all something to do your easy runs in your long runs your speed sessions and a few races as well then we've got a few options here we're looking for a foam in these shoes that's just a little bit more on the firmer side something that's not going to compress and bottom out too much and also a little bit of extra rubber on the outo to protect that foam and also increase the durability with just some more forces going through the shoe with every foot strike so my first shoe I'd recommend having a look at here is the socony Triumph version 21 a really fantastic all round super versatile shoe a really nice wide toe box as well then you've got a thick slab of durable and comfortable midsole foam in the shoe in terms of some negatives it might not be suitable if you do have some narrow feet and there is only one width available on the slightly cheaper side we've got the hoker Clifton 9 a fantastic daily durable shoe it does come in two widths available super comfortable and really a very dependable daily shoe the regular version is a little bit on the narrow side so if you do have wider feet make sure you go for that extra width option and my last shoe in the daily section is the aex super blast a little bit more expensive but you're getting a fantastic running shoe for your money here super versatile really maintains its structure through that heavy load and it's just got a nice big surface area on the bottom the shoe which will keep it nice and stable yes very big stack height in this shoe but you can pick up the page with ease that turn of speed is really fantastic and super comfortable over those long distances as well suitable for everyone doing some long marathon training runs and you could definitely race in the shoe as well in terms of the downside yes it's a little bit more on the expensive side and also the shoe only comes in one width but there is a good amount of wiggle room at the front of the shoe a good wide toe box there as well right moving on we've got a couple more daily options to chat about and these are really good supportive or stability Run shoes if you can get into a running store definitely try and do that there'll be more than likely some really good people that can give you some good advice on shoes but me take this list in say what have you got here I've heard these shoes are good if you can get into a running store running these on a treadmill and then they're going to be able to tell you if you do need a neutral shoe or you do need a stability sh in general about 80% of the population has a neutral shoe 20% need a stability shoe I will link to a little guide down below if you can't make it into a running store just to see whether you might need a stability shoe but anyway let's have a chat about my best options here the first one is the aex gel Cayo one of the most classic supportive shoes of all time we're here at version 30 they had a good time to get it right what I really like about this shoe that ax guidance system that 4D guidance system really impressive stability really going to help keep that foot supported through the whole footstrike also comes in three different widths your regular wide and extra wide as well super breathable upper in the shoe very thick and durable outsold as well moving on to the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 23 four different widths available in the shoe here a slightly more firmer ride it does soften up a little bit over time you got Brooks's guide rail stability system in this shoe it's not too intrusive they a really good option A little top tip here if you do run more than about three times a week then really try to rotate between more than one pair of different shoes the foam in our shoes needs a little bit of extra time to decompress especially for heavier Runners they going be putting a bit more Force through that foam so if you can allow at least sort of 20 24 to 48 hours between runs to let that foam just breathe and return back to normal that is really good cycling between two different pairs of shoes will last a lot longer than buying one shoe and then another shoe after that moving on we're going to have a chat about the best easy recovery Max comfort shoes the TP of shoes to really look after your legs look after your body making sure they're absorbing that impact to try and keep you as injury free for as long as possible being a heavier Runner you might assume that the more foam you have under your feet the better however a lot of these Mac stack shoes that you can see on the market these days have very soft Foams and the problem with that is they can be quite unstable for people with a higher body weight and those Foams can sort of collapse and lead to a lot of instability as well that can lead to some higher chances of getting injured so coming up I've got some really good options that have a really good balance of everything that is going to be really suited for heavier Runners starting out we've got the Brooks Glycerin currently on version 21 it's soft but it's not too soft again you've got two different widths available here and also a stability option as well if you do want a little bit of extra stability in your shoe it's got a very very tacky but highly durable outso and so so comfortable to run in the only downside of the shoe is not great at picking up the pace this is very much an easy recovery run shoe option here probably one of my favorite shoes of this year and last year as well the aex Joe Nimbus currently on 26 the pros of this shoe it comes in three different widths standard wide and extra wide it's so so comfortable it just one in my recent video all about the most comfortable shoes we'll link to that one up there it's also got a super durable outsole to the shoe very breathable and super soft upper to keep that Comfort maximized a really large surface area underneath the shoe as well so very very stable the foam in the shoe again it is quite soft but not too soft you're not going to bottom out that foam as you run along and also a good amount of Stack height in this shoe in terms of the negatives it is a little bit on the expensive side version 25 go and find that one the updates are very very minimal and there's also not much energy return again the shoes in this section are just those recovery Run shoes so you're going to need something for your faster runs and your races to put it into your rotation as well and then finally in the recovery easy Run shoes section we've got the Hoka Bondi version 8 this comes in three different widths standard wide and extra wide what I really like about the shoe super breathable super comfortable you can wear it for a long amount of time on your feet you can run Ultras in a shoe so many Ultra runners use this type of shoe and it's also good for people that do a lot of walking as well people that spending a lot of time on their feet maybe you're working in retail in health care something like that we up on your feet a long time this is a really good option to look at in terms of what's not so good it is a little bit on the narrower side as these shoes go and it has also got quite a small toe box as well so make sure you do Speck it in that wide or extra wide if you have some wider feet and also the outso isn't going to be the best if you're a super heavy Runner there's a little bit of exposed foam on the bottom but for a lot of people it's going to be absolutely fine right the final section here let's have a chat about the best plated shoes that could be used for a lot of your faster running and your racing they just shoes with plates and to help us run a little bit faster the main thing to consider here when we're talking about shoes for heavier Runners is that Super Shoes have one problem is they're generally not the most stable shoes out there the super Foams tend to be very soft and they don't last very long even for slightly lighter people as well and they often are quite narrow fitted so all the shoes I've here should cover those bases and be the best for the heavier Runner out there starting out we're going to have a chat about the Nike zoomfly version five it's not a super shoe per se but a really good option for your long runs and your long distance races and you can pick up the pace in the shoe really well cuz it has got that carbon plate in it it's got a super thick durable outsole and you'll be Runing on a massive trunk of Nikes well it's a bit of Zex in the middle there Flagship foam with a carrier foam around it but a really nice responsive ride as well and I'd say on the whole list of shoes here this is definitely going to be the one that's going to last the longest the most durable and in terms of the negatives with this shoe it is a little bit on the heavy so a little bit of a chunky ride with this shoe and there's also only one width available next on the list is a shoe I've recently been running in and absolutely loving it was another star in my most comfortable shoe video recently which is the New Balance SC Trainer I would say this is the most comfortable plated shoe that I've ever worn it's super lightweight soft but again not too soft this is going to be a really good shoe to do some of your speed workouts or as an ultra comfortable race day shoe again nice durable outsole to the shoe very stable at cornering and a good amount of space in the toebox for that footplay in terms of negatives yeah it's just not the most Poppy the most responsive out there but you are sacrificing a little bit of that to get a super comfortable ride in the shoe and then finally what most people said was the fastest best RAC day plated shoe for heavier Runners is the Nike alphafly version two or potentially version three as well which has a slightly different ride what I really like about the shoe is it's got this super wide very stable platform in the front and it's also just so fast really with the massive Zoom Air Pods at the front of the shoe the carbon plate running through it Nike's flash Chi Zoom X foam in the shoe it is super super quick also really encourage you to land nicely on the midfoot through your foot strike really helping your leg turn over as as well but it does run a little bit on the narrow side especially through the midfoot so if you have a slightly wider foot through the midfoot then check out version 3 which is the most current version out at the moment a lot more space in that shoe but it's just not quite as stable as version one and version two there's also one thing to consider especially with some slightly heavier Runners is these airpods at the front have been known to pop and burst during races I've never had it happen to me during a race but I have had it happen in a very old battered pair of training shoes a couple of times it kind of depends the type of mileage you're putting into the shoe but something to be aware of so I'm sure there's a few other options out there these are definitely ones that I would wholeheartedly recommend you go and check out let us know down in the comments what are your favorite shoes help out the community as you've heard me mention quite a lot today I had a very recent video all about those comfortable showes of all time so maybe go and check that one out next that's coming up right guys keep on working hard keep on done and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

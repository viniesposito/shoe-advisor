  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run and today I have a special unboxing for you it's a little different than what we normally do normally we do a little flashy unboxing just show you how nice the shoe looks but I feel like this time I feel a little Vindicated I feel like something I said may have helped create something new I I kind of got that validated when we went to the running event we spoke with Brooks but this one I think is probably one of the coolest updates I've seen if you remember I took the Hyperion Elite 4 and the video that we did of it well I have to say I tried to be as honest with you guys as I possibly could and at the same time be as honest as I could with Brooks pretty much said this shoe was a great shoe everything except that they use the super critical foam in the midsole what they don't have is a viable race day shoe so this is kind of a review and sort of more of a plea to like please just you're doing everything else right if you threw a PE ofoam in here I think this would be a rocket even some of the comments if you'll remember were like hey we all don't need to go that direction in Foams Brooks is innovating here maybe they're athletes like this I did find out though when we're talking about athletes CJ Albertson Dez lynon Josh Kerr when they were doing their best performances in 2024 they weren't wearing this shoe they were using the Hyperion Elite 4 PB and that's what we're unboxing today so everything I said that was great about this shoe still great about this shoe with one addition I'm going to gloat a little little bit here they added PB they added the pack style foam in here it's called PB gold is what they're calling it from Brooks but look even in the messaging they're saying this shoe takes 2 minutes and 32 seconds off your marathon time compared to this shoe now the crazy thing is we all know that people were all upset that Boston keeps dropping you know their qualification times so those of you who ran in this shoe who were maybe a minute off 2 minutes off even if you had had this shoe Brooks is saying you'd be going to Boston this year it's pretty much identical the upper same weave the tooling on the foam the same the outsole is the same has the same AIS plate the shoe weighs an ounce lighter this one was at 8.4 Oz this one's at 7.4 Oz o I think that's like 210 G so you've got a lighter shoe with the things that we liked about the Hyperion Elite I haven't run in it yet I'm going to try it out this weekend but just feeling it the Sho is lighter you can feel a little more giv in the foam I just think it's going to be a better experience and then what we've seen is we've seen the Hyperion Elite 5 when we were at the running event that this shoe just keeps getting better looking I thought this was a great looking shoe I still think it's a great looking shoe so this shoe you'll be able to get in time for your spring Marathon so if you like the fit the look everything like that of this shoe but we're hoping for a paback midsole now you've got it this one actually makes me feel like I'm not taking crazy pill cuz look all of us reviewers it's all subjective for the most part it's our opinion and this time I was like my opinion is the way to make this shoe a banger is to add that PB foam Brooks has done it CJ Albertson was leading the Olympic trials for the first 20 miles in this shoe with the PB foam Dez lynon's been running this and still killing it and of course Josh Kerr stroke in the Fifth Avenue mile on this sucker so thanks Brooks thanks for listening thanks for putting this together if I had anything to do with it at all I'm totally flattered so thanks we'll give you a full review soon [Music]",

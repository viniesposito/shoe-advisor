  "text": "hello there Tom here from the Run testers with a best running shoe solo guide so what this video is is a guide to the best shoes that I have tested over the past year in the next week we'll be um publishing our Awards so what happens in the awards is that we go through everything that we've tested over the past year all of the shoes some watches some headphones and we vote on what we think should be uh the winner of every single category like cushion shoes or round of shoes issues things like that um and we then go through all of the numbers and work out what the winners are but the problem with that is that we often don't get to cover shoes in the awards that some of us really really like because it's based on voting so the reason we do these videos is that we can have an opportunity to talk about our own picks so we're all different at the Run testers obviously Nick is a lot faster than than me he runs in different shoes uh I favor cushion shoes and uh daily shoes that sort of uh thing so this gives me the opportunity talk about a lot of things that I like and each of the other in testers are going to be doing these videos as well let's dive in and find out what the five running shoes I picked for this [Music] video okay so it will come as no surprise to you if you're a fan of the channel That one of the shoes that I've picked is the New Balance Mo V5 now my running issues do tend to skew a little bit more towards those easy runs daily runs uh because that's the bulk of what I do even though I train for marathons and I train for sub three marathons the way that I train for them is largely uh about distance and comfort and getting the Wilds in and I do have speed work in there but I do spend a predominant amount of my time in Cushing shoes and daily shoes uh because I'm not uh going all out all the time I'm doing a lot more distance um so the New Balance Mor V5 uh I probably about 100K in this now I really like the shoe the New Balance Mo V4 and the New Balance Mo V3 were two of my favorite shoes this is a big uh update because it has a new tweaked mid cell phone in it so it uses the same mid cell phone that's in the ten v13 which is a bit softer um and in the ten v13 it makes it really really soft and it means that that shoe is essentially just a very very easy day shoe and Recovery day shoe you wouldn't use it for anything else more V 5 it has more of that foam in and I don't think it's exactly the same as the foam you get in the 10 v13 so it is a bit softer than the more V4 um but it's a little bit bouncier as well so you do get the same benefits um that I think you get from the mo V4 it's a very comfortable shoe to run in it's a very um uh enjoyable shoe to roll forward for longer sessions at a nice comfortable Pace recovery runs easy runs um and it's for me it's one of the best shoes out there for just ticking off Miles when I go out and run and I've got a hour and a half easy run or recovery run or a long run run at a nice comfortable Pace this is the shoe that I want to take out I'm not going to go faster in it I'm not going to uh be doing intervals in it or anything like that I just want a shoe that I know is going to be really comfortable and just make that run as enjoyable as possible um because I'm I'm doing a lot of miles at the moment and I want those those miles to be very very nice and comfortable so the Mori 5 is one of my top picks this year definitely my my favorite pick for um cushioned easy run um recovery day shoes my next pick is another shoe that I tend to use quite a lot for easy days longer runs um just ticking off the miles but it's a shoe that has a little bit more to it so it's the Muno Neo Vista now this shoe I really really like this shoe it's a very um it's such a fun shoe to wear the midle in it is really really bouny it's it's got a nice softness in it if you do an easy run in it it just feels really comfortable um and just bounces you along just feels great uh if you're doing a faster session it can pick up the pace in it it's got a nice bounce to it it has this plate within it that just gives you a little bit of propulsion as you're running it's not the fastest shoe in the world but if you're um I probably wouldn't use it if I was going for all out intervals uh and I needed to really hit hard Paces um but if I'm going out for a consistent uh interval session consistent Paces where I may be doing like kilometer reps or something like that and I'm running at half marathon pace marathon pace this is a great shoe for it it just makes it really enjoy enjoyable just bounces you along really really comfortable um only thing I would say about it is I'm not massive fan of the oper it really like these booty uppers but I've never really had a a problem with this shoe um and I'd definitely say if I was go if you if I had to pick one shoe to to go on holiday with for a month and I I was doing a mix of runs there this would be one of the top ones on my list there are other shoes that are versatile like the soing Dophin speed 4 but I find that skews a lot more towards the faster sessions wouldn't really like to use that shoe for loads of easy stuff cuz it's a little bit too firm for me and I don't really get the comfort that I want out of it this sits the other side it's more more of on that sort of comfy softer side but you can do quite a lot more stuff in it and and when you compare it the price of it compared to some of the other shoes out the market so things like the super blast this is a really really good value shoe at the moment so well worth picking up if you just want a really nice comfortable bouncy enjoyable daily shoe but also if you just want an easy shoe as well because it can do that absolutely perfectly okay so this pick is a bit tricky one because um I've actually got I'm going to mention two shoes here uh one because I've tested it quite a bit and one because I started testing it but I think it's comparable with this shoe so the uh asex met speed Sky Paris um this shoe is uh definitely the shoe that I would have said is the best Ray shoe this year that I've tested um it is very very very fast very propulsive you can really feel it bouncing you forward as you're running it feels very lightweight as well it is just it a fantastic carbon plate race Sho uh and really does the does the job um this shoe is uh I'm currently deciding what shoe to wear uh for Valencia I'm not going to use the aly3 I'm not a massive fan of that shoe didn't really like using it when I ran Boston earlier in the year and I haven't really got anything else apart from this and another shoe um that I'm choosing between so the reason I'm picking this is because the cushioning is really good it feels very comfortable feels like it's supporting you but giving you a lot of bounce back it's got a fairly aggressive um C plate in it so you do feel that propulsion that and that toe off when you're running and when you're picking up the pace and trying to maintain that pace it really helps you do that um only downside to the shoe is is a little bit of a thin shoe um which makes it a tiny bit unstable uh if you're landing on uneven surfaces um but hopefully if you're running Max Pace at various distances you probably going to be running on a flat surface anyway so you don't need to worry too much about that um but it is for me probably the best car plate racer that's that's that's come out this year uh and I really really like this shoe the other one which um I've only just recently started testing um because we're doing the awards and I wanted to make sure that I cover everything uh that should be covered is the Hawker cell X1 and I've used this only three times now I've RAC on it today um doing the bright and 10K um and I've an interval session and longer running it and I really like this shoe it be feels like the sort of shoe that I really enjoy running fast in um it it's a little bit aggressive uh I'd say it's more aggressive than the um the aex meted sky Paris um it's got a good level of cushioning in it reminds me a little bit of a more subtle version of something like the sakon and dorphin Elite which a shoe that I have a bit of a LoveHate relationship with I think it's a the fastest shoe I've ever I've ever raced in but I also think it's the most awkward shoe I've ever raced in I would not want to run a marathon that shoe just because of the way that it positions your foot this this shoe I think has some of the elements of that shoe um but just feels a little bit more welcoming and a bit more comfortable um especially based off the long run that I didn't it so um the cx1 is my uh second pick for this this area but I don't want to give it the the wiim because I don't think I've tested it enough to to justify it yet um maybe if I use it for Valencia um then I'll see if it really does compare with the um met speed Sky Paris okay my fourth pick for best shoes uh 2024 is the New Balance balos now this shoe uh we talked about quite a lot this year um and was ever since I heard about this shoe when it was at the running uh show in the in the US I was very excited about it because it's a shoe that it's essentially a shoe that's designed for daily runs but it's got a lot of cushioning in it's got a lot of Bounce in it it's very soft shoe um but that mid cell pH doesn't suck away energy gives you it back whereas some of the daily shoes that have a lot of cushioning in do tend to sa your energy a little bit um but this is really good uh for so many different runs uh it's a great easy day shoe um it's expensive for an easy day shoe so you wouldn't just buy it as an easy day shoe um but if you you run easy in it it's absolutely fine the the main reason I use this shoe tends to be more for um longer efforts as part of my marathon training block where I need to maintain a pace uh maybe my marathon pace maybe slightly slower than my marathon pace which would be like 4 minute 20 kilomet um for an extended period of time and I want to do it in comfort and I want to do it um and protect my legs uh but I'm not going all out uh so I wouldn't use this shoe for Interval sessions um I'd use it for consistent sessions where I'm just going out and I'm running fairly taxing rate um for a consistent period of time um and that's it's a bit of a KNE shoe for that um there when I'm outside the marathon season I'm probably not going to use this shoe as much um just cuz are more likely to use the more V5 as an easy day shoe and um I'm more likely to use other shoes as interval shoes but for that specific purpose where you're just running for a long distance and you want something that really makes that easy to to maintain it's a really enjoyable comfy shoe and has a lot of feelings to it like the more V5 it is it has a similar vibe to the to the midell foam and the softness and the Comfort but it's just it's just got more to it you can definitely pick up the pace in this shoe and maintain it well okay so my final pick for 2024 it will come as no surprise to anyone which is why I've left it till the end of this is the super Blast 2 uh Mike still got my Sul 2 um and I really need to get it off him because um I'm desperate to go at running in it again supl 2 is a really nice progression of the super blast I know that it's a very hard shoe to get uh there's probably going to be comments uh on this video about how it's almost impossible to get hold of that shoe hopefully at some point they will have more of uh the super blast uh to available um but it is a fantastic shoe so it's it's a nice development of the super blast super blast was a fantastic shoe you it was the sort of shoe a bit like the BOS where it really excels at maintaining a really uh taxing pace for a long period it's a sort of shoe that I use for uh Marathon efforts where I'm going out and maybe I'm doing 28k as part of my long runs I need to do some of that or all of that at my marathon pace um and I need something that's going to consistently allow me to do that but without being being too aggressive without slowing me down anything like that just lets me do that pace super Blast 2 um is very similar to super blast one as you'd expect but it's just got a little bit more to that midell fo it just has a little bit more uh responsiv in it for me um little bit softer I find the super Blast 2 and all in all it's just a nice Improvement on the super blast in fact because Mike's got my super Blast 2 I've actually been running the super blast one quite a lot recently and that shoe still is fantastic um but Zas 2 is just a nice um upgrade to the original super blast fantastic shoe definitely one that is very expensive so if you're buying the super Blast 2 and you're using it for easy runs it's probably not worth doing that you can do it in there but it's a lot of money to spend on a shoe that is really designed much like the BOS for those long um training runs where you just want a consistent comfortable Pace um and you want a shoe that's going to allow you to pick up that pace nicely and just maintain it for a nice long period of time again I probably wouldn't use the super blast two for racing it hasn't really got the proportion it hasn't really got the Bounce That I Want from a uh from a race shoe um I could do it I could race in the super Blast 2 but I just don't think it has that the benefits That I Want from from a Rao but it's really good for that sort of 85% 95% training um where you're just getting to the point where you're almost at race Pace but you just need to maintain it for for a good period so that's my five top picks for the best running shoes of 2024 thanks a lot for watching each of the other R testers will be doing their own versions which may be very similar or may be very different from from my one and we'll also have our full Awards where you'll find out how all of our choices have gone in to make the final picks for our 2024 winners right thanks a lot for watching catch you next time [Music]",

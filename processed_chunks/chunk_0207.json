  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with my first thoughts on the craft pure Trail X this shoe um is an updated version from last year's peer Trail it's a new lineup as of last year from Craft um it enters that like moderate stack category kind of trying to do be a Do-it all type of Trail shoe and um overall our reviewers loved it last year I didn't get a chance to be in it personally but they liked yeah how versatile it was the overall cushion from the CR foam um and really the only thing that it lacked was they wished for a little more in the upper and I think that's exactly where craft went with this version of focusing more on the upper getting a more dialed in fit um which in my first run they totally did um I was really impressed with the lockdown and the comfortable Lockdown from the heel and the midfoot uh throughout it it's fairly slim it felt and even a little short but overall I was really impressed with the fit and to me that sets the standard for everything else um again their CR foam is the super critical foam uh craft says that it's really durable and then it's a pillowy cushion I get the durability part after my first run but not as much the pillowy cushion I'd say it's like medium firm at uh the most positive and I hope I hope it does soften up a little a little bit but I'm also someone who doesn't mind a Firma ride so the CR foam is not exactly like the super critical Foams you would see in a lot of other Trail Racers or what you would expect I should say especially if you're coming from the road side of a much softer High energetic um this one's a little more firm but where it does really make a difference is that this 4ft rocker is pretty aggressive and I haven't felt that really in any other Trail shoe so far maybe a couple of the carbon plated Trail Racers like The Meta Fuji Trail or the vactive pro but even so it's not quite this unique so I actually like that sensation it was it was unique to the shoe um it rolls really nicely no matter the terrain my terrain was obviously uh pretty varied out here in Colorado I had a lot of snowy muddy a bunch of different kinds of conditions for my trail run up and down all all around really um and this I was really impressed with the pure Trail X so far again I I I love the the lockdown so far and it was really comfortable it's really quite padded through the heel I think um in terms of the midsole i' maybe want a little more I hope it softens softens up I know I've said that already but I really do I think that would make this a very versatile and very pleasing Trail shoe just a general Trail shoe but also a nice ultra distance option for a lot of different terrain um so we'll see I have a few more runs to put in it um let's flip it over to the outs so quick um pretty much full coverage maybe 4 mm stack or 4 mm lugs um good enough for a lot of different terrain again overall I'm pleased so far actually really impressed so far um and I hope that just continues for craft because my last experience was with the craft explore hybrid which was great from a foam standpoint and we loved it in a lot of ways but we wanted a lot more from the upper and this one gives you a lot more with that rip stop material nice overlays really secure again we'll see I'm excited for more Trails craft pure Trail X [Applause]",

  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers and to our head-to-head review of the ASX Nova blast 5 and the New Balance 1080 v14 both of these shoes have had some interesting updates over their last Generations that arguably have brought them closer together in terms of what they deliver you could say that both these shoes are shooting for a little bit more versatility do they deliver which one's the best which one's our favorite which one would we recommend how would you use both of these shoes We're going to tell you that in the upcoming video so watch on for our head-to-head between the asex Nova blast 5 and the New Balance 1080 v14 details then the ax no blast 5 stack height has 412 m in the 4 foot 33 1/2 in the hill for an 8 mil drop meanwhile the new balanc 1080 v14 has 38 m in the heel 32 m in the 4T for a 6 mil drop when it comes to weight aex managed to shave a little off the Nova blast 5 in our UK men's 8 and a half test sh It Now tips the scales a pretty impressive 8.9 o or 251 G the New Balance 1080 v14 has put on a bit of weight in its generation in our men's UK 8 and a half It Now tips the scales at 10.1 o or 285 G on price the RRP for the new balance is $165 or \u00a360 the NOA blast 5 drops in at a cheap $140 or \u00a3135 let's give you a quick shoe comparison starting with the midsoles with the novablast fire sticks largely to the Nova blast blueprint with a Max stack midsole but uses a new bouncier foam flight foam blast Max there's a large rocker a wide 4ot platform But A reduced heel extension here meanwhile the New Balance 1080 v14 has a more conservative stack of fresh foam X also with a rocket midsole now while the Nova blast 5 is softer this generation n v14 has gone the other way with a slightly firmer feel than the 1080 v13 up top the New Balance 1080 v14 has engine near mesh uppers which are More Hugging than the looser fit of the Nova blast 5's more premium jackard mesh they're significantly less Flex in the toe box of the 1080 making for a more wrapped less Airy fit overall both shoes have plush padded heel colors the 1080s have a little more the gusted tongues on the 1080 are also much more padded than no blast 5 which saves some weight with a thin nicely wrapping design if you flip them over the new Bal 108 v14 has a horseshoe around the midfoot single pad of protective rubber in the middle of the 4 foot then rubber patches on the heels which are thicker than more durable than we saw on the last generation meanwhile the overlast five out soole sticks to a relatively standard covering of AIX ahar low rubber you're still not getting that top level grip of the ah plus that you got on the ax super Blast 2 but it is sort of pretty well covered for the outsole so when it comes to fit I ran in a uk8 and a half which is my regular shoe size in both of these shoes the biggest thing to note on fit here is that the New Balance 1080 v14 fit really snug it makes for good hold and security but they're not that roomy at true to size they're ATT Tad cramped across the top of the midfoot something that you'll notice if like me you've got quite high feet some people found they might be a bit shorter on the length as well the NOA plus 5 is cavernous by comparison it's really spacious and Airy with the Roto box on the flip side of that though some people have found the Nova blast 5 a little bit too spacious but I've got wide feet and I like spacing shoes that I'd use for longer easier miles but still aside from that I'd still go true to sizing both shoes but I think some might want to consider half a size up in the new balance for a bit more of a roomy fit so in terms of fit these two shoes have been absolutely spot on for me no issues to report I've got them both in a UK size which my typical running shoe size and I would say they are or have been true to size fitting shoes for me I wouldn't be looking to kind of size up or size down at either of these shoes I think in terms of things like space in the toe boxes it's very similar for me you know pretty roomy and spacious there similar level of kind of padding throughout the shoes maybe a touch more on the heel collar on the new Bon atv4 I think the biggest difference for me is just how those uppers feel and what that kind of does for the fit I think on the Nova blast 5 it's a little bit more relaxed feeling I would say a bit more snug feeling I think with the 1080 v14 there's a bit more structure to that up and if that's something you prefer in terms of fit and I think that's what the 1080 v14 is most going to give you over the uh Nova blast 5 I think that more relaxed fit as well the Nova blast 5 just feels a touch broader a little bit more spacious in general throughout the shoe if you're looking for a roomier fit I think the NOA blast 5 is going to give you that if you're looking for a shoe that's going to be very comfortable very padded uh and give you good space up front in the toe box then I would say that both these shoes are going to serve you well the fit for me in these two shoes I'm a size eight in the UK these are both size eights very similar fit to both of them they're both shoes designed for Comfort they're both shoes designed to offer plenty of space in the for foot um and they're both very comfortable I got fairly uh average width feet and I've had no issues at all with these straight from the off they're very very comfortable plenty of padding on them uh I would say that the Nova blast 5 is probably slightly roomier it's a little bit wider than the 1080 uh v14 but not massively there's not loads in it I think if you if you can wear one you're very likely to be able to wear the other one very very comfortably there's also plenty of space before uh the big toe as well so definitely would stay to my size in both of these shoes it's very able upper very easy to lace up uh I haven't had any issues at all in either of these shoes so when it comes to the fit of the two shoes I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 with the ax no blast 5 it's a us99.5 with the new balance that kind of difference in US sizing is reflected in the way they fit you have got a more dialed in fit with the New Balance but actually even if they're the same US size I think You' have a more kind of dialed in fit around the toes in the New Balance because the upper on the no blast 5 is very roomy around the toe box like you got a lot of volume in there and there's someone with a narrow foot you know I do have a bit too much room but it's not something that's been a problem at all the fit's been very secure around the heel and midfoot I've got the right length in terms of the room in front of my toes and with a new balance I've had no real concerns at all with the fit you've got a certainly a plumper and a more padded tongue on the New Balance compared to the no blast but you know it's a nice comfortable feeling it hasn't felt too hot or oppressive although I have been running in pretty cold conditions in both of these shoes overall I would stick to your normal size with both of these shoes when it comes to the fit and I've had no concerns at all with rubbing or anything like that now in testing I've run more than 40 m a New Balance 1080 v14 that's mostly been easy plotting with some runs up to 90 minutes I've covered well north of 50 mi in the no last five including a full 4our solo Marathon test I've tested both shoes across the range of Paces that we usually do covering slow and easy long runs right up to faster intervals and progression runs and as usual I've run mainly on road but with some light off-road uh runs in there as well just to test the stability now a quick take on both shoes and the story here really is that these shoes are coming closer together I think in terms of the ride while the novablast five runs softer the 1080 v14 is back to being Snappy with this generation so they're now much close in terms of the ride and you've got from the previous generations of both shoes new balanc 1080 v14 has a marginally stiffer midsole outsole combo that offers some extra resilience and immediacy I think that Smooths the transitions uh the response is much quicker now and the foam returns FAS than you've got the 1080 v13 so it's a bit snappier and a bit more versatile round I think the as6 no blast 5 offers a nice smooth smooth ride that responds well on toe off and feels springy but controlled it's a bit softer though than I think you got from the previous generation when you're feeling good running in good form and pushing the pace no class five feels energetic though there's a bit more bounce but it's also cushioned enough to accommodate slower Paces though sometimes on heavier legs because of that added softness I did find that it felt a little bit soggy now I also did a side by side mile to see how these two really compare when you got them both on your feet and here's what I found so I've just done my side by side mile I've got the no 5 on the left foot I've got the New Balance 1080 v14 on the right foot and while I thought these shoes might be quite different in terms of the types of run that they would do and the ride that they deliver I think actually there's a lot more similarities than I'd expected between the two shoes the fact is I think the over blast five have come sort of towards the softer end than they did with the no blast 4 which were a little bit firmer a little bit snappier while the New Balance 1080 v14 has added a little bit of extra stiffness which brings them a little bit up from the really soft end into something that's a little bit firmer and a little bit snappier so they've now much closer together in terms of the type of ride they deliver type of Amy that you get all the softness and cushioning all of those things it's much more even over those two things although they do feel quite different on the foot one of them is a big roomy Airy loose fitting shoe that's the NOA blast 5 plenty of room in the toe box they just feel really spacious really nice the kind of shoe that I would happily sort of think about okay they got the room here for going Ultra and really long long hours on feet the new balanc 1080 v14 by contrast are very compact very snug fitting there's just not as much clearance there's a bit of flex across the top of the toe box but yeah they just feel a lot more hugging now than over the last five a lot more roomy so depending on how you like your shoes and true to size that's the difference one of the main difference and then you come to the ride and this is something I'm finding hard to kind of put into words the different sensations of the shoes I think they both probably cater for sort of similar runs I think they're both going to be better towards the easier end of your Paces I think the overlast 5 being slightly lighter they feel lighter on the foot I think they're a bit more kind of Bounce a bit more energy they might be a little bit more versatile overall but I actually I think these shoes would probably cater for the same kinds of runs for me and I would use them more towards the sort of lower and slower up to kind of midling and and maybe a little bit beyond that kind of run they come about this will get there in a slightly different way though I think the foam in the New Balance 1080 v14 it compresses less it's much more immediate in its return it kind of leads you to sort of roll through a lot quicker the transitions feel a little bit snappier and a bit more smooth I find a bit more consistent the Nova blast achieves its kind of energy a little bit more from a bounce so it sinks a bit more and then it returns and bounces and sort of almost kind of propels you a bit more with kind of Bounce and spring rather than this kind of smooth slightly stiffer roll through transition that you get they both offer oodles Oodles of comfort and cushioning they both really well protected under the road I I feel like the stack is quite similar in terms of the amount of Road field you get I think they're both pretty similar in terms of the stability that they offer they both got good platforms to run off nice and soft pretty reliable I think actually maybe the new balances is touch more reliable particularly if I'm landing 4 foot rather than further back but they're both nice and protective but they're both really comfortable on the foot and I would happily do long slow and easy or short slow and easy in this shoe I think if I was picking an uptempo shoe maybe I'd be inclined to go for the Nova blast just because it feels lighter in area and roomier on the foot if I was going for really really long miles I think also I'd go Nova blast 5 just because you've got that extra wiggle room or maybe i' have to go half a size up in the New Balance 1080 v14 but when it comes to sort of the ride that I enjoy the most actually I think just for clipping along and cruising at maybe middling Paces I didn't think I was going to say this but I actually feel like the new balanc 1080 v14 might be the better shoe so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I would say it's been solid overall these are very good cushion daily trainer shoes these are shoes personally I would be using for kind of easy to moderate Paces these can work great for short runs they're going to be great long run shoes I think if you're looking for a comfortable Marathon shoe both of these shoes will fit that profile in terms of the key differences one of the smaller ones there is a small weight difference the Nova blast 5 is the lighter of the two shoes for me my UK size eight I think the 10804 about 20 G heavier but the grand scheme of things hasn't had a massive influence but if you wanted the lighter shoe it you know it's the Nova blast 5 what's going to have more bearing on your running experience is going to be the midsole Foams where that midsole foam lays how it works in terms of you know what you're getting in the out soole as well which I think definitely has a part to play in terms of these two shoes we're starting the over blast 5 which is the new of the two shoes it's got the FF blast Max which has been using one other shoe so far in the aex range now compared to the fresh foam in a 10804 it definitely feels softer definitely feels a lot more plush it's not overly plush but compared to the Fresh Foam which I think has changed from the Fresh Foam in the 1080 v13 it has a little bit more resilience to it it's a little bit more Hardy compared to the FF blast Max now with that FF blast Max it is definitely spread across a wider kind of broader platform which I think you know what that dictates really is you know it's Comfort first and I think that's really what I've experienced in my time no blast fight when you get out on it it's smooth controlled stable and very comfortable first and foremost in terms of a lively bounce I think I got it in the initial runs it wasn't really replicated for me in successive runs I think with the new balance 10814 in contrast I think you're getting moderate bounce there but it's been consistent throughout my runs and again you've got a nice kind of gentle rocker there like the ax shoe just kind of you know nudging you forward just enough and helping you to kind of tip that running time off so from you know from a point of view I think you know the the runs and the types of Paces I've described I think both these shoes were work very well I think the experience if you know of those Foams and where they're set really kind of dictate you know how it's going to feel and I do feel that on the no blast 5 it's a softer more comfortable feeling I think with the 108 b14 it's still a comfortable shoe but I think as I said I think there's a harder Edge or slightly firmer Edge to the feel of the midsole foam and a more moderate notable balance throughout my running time in that shoe I talked about the out soes and I said with the no blast 5 I think you know you've got a kind of big kind of wide out soole here and I think that really contributes to that kind of very controlled feel in the in that shoe and I think it's a similar story with the 108 v14 it's not as wide but it definitely I think helps to counter that kind of controlled kind of protective feeling in that shoe from a gripping point of view I think you know you're probably going to get a little bit more kind of grip and performance out of the no blast 5 um outsole that's kind of what I found they're not perfect outsole grips particularly in kind of wetter conditions but General dry Pavements and Road that's where you're going to use them durability I think you you know the layouts are very similar they're kind of focusing on the lateral areas really of these shoes a bit more on the four foot of the shoes and I think that maybe it's a little bit more rubber than the um ax out sole so for me I'd probably get I would say getting a bit more life out of the no BL see less wear or signs of wear on that shoe so yeah for me solid cushion daily trainer shoes across the board definitely some experiences or difference in in experiences particularly around the midell makeups but yeah very good overall in my time okay so these two shoes are daily shoes they're designed to be used for all of your runs can also be clust as the sort of shoe that you'd buy if you were maybe just buying one pair of shoes and you wanted to take off all your miles in a a nice comfortable shoe that could probably do a little bit more um but these are two these two new versions of the shoes are slightly different than previous versions um because they have changed the foam in both of these shoes um the 1080 v14 um the 1080 v13 was a really really soft shoe they had massively changed the midsole of that shoe and it changed the ride significantly and a lot of people didn't like it I liked it I thought that shoe was really nice cuz I like soft comfortable shoes when I'm doing easy runs um but it lost a little bit of stability in that shoe so they um have updated the midell foam and it's a bit more like what you had experienced from an earlier version or a mix of an earlier version of the 1080 range and the 108 v13 so what you get in the 108 v14 is a much more balanced uh midsole it's soft enough um but it isn't overly soft it's not really squishy um but it's very comfortable to run in and it's probably a little bit more versatile than the 1080 v13 not massively it's not I wouldn't say it's an amazingly versatile shoe it's definitely a shoe that firmly sits in that that world of daily comfortable miles you're probably not going to do a lot of um interval training in this shoe probably not going to race in this shoe um but you can do a bit more in it if you to buy one shoe if you're a beginner or if you're just sort of General Runner who just wants one shoe to just go out and tick off miles in and then in Comfort uh this is a very good shoe for that it it tis a lot of boxes I very much enjoy testing this shoe um and I can see uh why they have made those changes on the 108 v13 which was a little bit of a a Marmite shoe um the other thing as well is by um updating that midell foone it's a little bit more stable which is something that a lot of people didn't like about the 108 v13 um and all in all it's a very solid comfortable enjoyable daily shoe that really veers more towards the easier or longer distance comfortable miles as opposed to picking up the pace a lot in this shoe but if you wanted to run a bit faster in it you can it's just not perfectly designed for doing that it's very much a an easy or long run shoe L blast 5 now this shoe has um a big update on the previous version so it does have this new FF blast Max Mido cushioning in it the Nova blast 4 I really like that shoe the nobl range varies quite a lot every time they release a new version of the shoe and they seem to tweak it quite a bit and it has quite a polarizing um experience for some people who are used to earlier versions of the shoe this version of the shoe is softer than the no blast 4 noas 4 was a really good shoe uh because it was really versatile the midso in it wasn't too soft it quite a big stack of midell foam but it also was quite responsive um and gave you quite a bit back it wasn't necessarily loads of energy in the shoe it was just responsive and and didn't sink in and and take away any energy so great shoe if you wanted to do a little bit faster sessions if maybe you're training for a marathon you want to do your long runs in a shoe that a consistent Pace uh not necessarily an easy Pace um but the Nova blast 5 it's this FF blast Max is is noticeably softer than the Nova blast 4 um and I have a a mixed reaction to this shoe I have used it for um about 70k so far uh and that's varied uh over various a number of different runs on my during my marathon training for Valencia so I've done easy runs in there I've done interval sessions in it and I've done a longer run in it and what I found is that that mid sole it works sometimes doesn't work other times um it it does feel to me like it's on certain runs and specifically um on those sort of consistent Pace runs where you're maybe running at uh near your Tempo Pace or something like that it might it works quite well you sort of it gives you a little bit back there's not loads of energy return in the shoe that I'm getting from it um but it definitely feels like it's a shoe that's designed for a certain type of run I think ideally it's it's a it's a shoe designed for easier runs um it's definitely very comfortable I really like that midsole when you when you're just like ticking off the miles and you want something that gives you a little bit of bounce back but not loads um but just feels very very comfortable on the feet on the other end of the spectrum when you're running faster in it I don't think this has the versatility of the Nova blast 4 um so it's definitely a shoe that uh is is is a different experience than what you you would get from the previous version of the shoe um I think now it's very much sits in that realm of daily shoes but but more for the easy runs as well easy runs recovery runs maybe easy longer runs where you want to just run at a consistent Pace um but definitely not shoe that You' use for intervals or anything like that it just feels like saps mind you a bit a little bit and and I sink in a little bit too much to the ground when I'm trying to run a bit bit quicker so comparing these two shoes you're probably going to look at buying them for the same sort of thing and they are very similar in a lot of ways they're really both shoes designed for the easiest side of ticking off the miles the um that sort of comfort aspect where you want to do a few runs uh maybe doing 10ks 15ks 20ks um and you just want to just go out there and and and get the miles done and you're not necessarily doing any intervals or fle training or anything like that because they they do they are a bit limited when it it comes to that they really sit on that easy comfortable side of daily running shoes however having said that I do think the tv14 has got a little bit more to it I think that midell is just a bit more um resilient to running at a faster Pace it just gives you a little bit more responsiveness back um and is probably a better all around shoe um when it comes to ticking off all those different types of runs that you'll do I think the no blast 5 is solid shoe for Comfort um I just don't think this is a versatile as the 10x v14 it's not there's not a massive difference in it I'm not comparing a really fast versatile shoe with a a really slow uh daily training shoe I'm comparing to very similar daily training shoes but I think the 108 v14 just just just gets a little bit more out out of it when you're running at a faster Pace um and especially if you're maybe doing Tempo sessions or something where you're running at a consistent pace which is probably faster than your your normal um easy run Pace I think the tv14 is better for that no blast 5 um I prefer the nol last Forge because it was more versatile I think the no blast 4 was more versatile than the 1080 v14 um so definitely it really comes down to what type of run you're doing and if you're just looking for Pure Comfort over those sort of easier runs as opposed to having a shoe that you can do everything in other thing I'd say about these shoes is the outsole uh is very similar on both of them actually there is a bit of exposed rubber on there um they're not the best outsoles I've ever seen um I've not had any issues in running in either of these shoes but the grip isn't amazing it's quite smooth on the Node blast 5 and on the teny v14 it doesn't have any major grip on it it's not like pummer grip or something like that they it's fine I've not had any problems on it I've not been slipping around on the wet ground or anything like that but um I would say they're both fairly average outsoles on these shoes comes to run these are two shoes that I did enjoy testing this year I find them both pretty impressive cushion daily trainers that do offer you know a lot of foam underfoot in terms of protection and comfort but are still fairly light do have fairly smooth rides that tick over well so I have enjoyed running both of these shoes this year tested the New Balance 1080 v14 first I wasn't a huge fan of the 1080 v13 which I just found a little bit too soft for my taste like it felt like I was just kind of getting lost in the foam in it and the extra resiliency you have on the newer shoe I is something I certainly appreciate it just means I can roll through my foot strike a bit more naturally and I get a bit more of a platform to push against whether I'm running at easy Paces or fast Paces or anything like that I just find it a more natural shoe to run in now it disappears on the foot a lot more I do find it really comfortable you fairly versatile for a day train like this it's not a shoe that I'd be using for lots of fast runs myself but it is reasonbly versatile as a cushion shoe for sure and I do think you've got a better foam in the New Balance than you have in the no blast 5 I think you know this version of fresh foam X which gets changed all the time you never know exactly know what's going on with it but I do think you've got a bouncier feeling a softer feeling than with the no blast 5 which has got this new FF blast Max foam which is good like it's a decent balanced neutral foam it gives you some comfort it gives you a little bit back if you're going to run at speed but mostly I think if you're going to try and use the nose blast or anything kind of faster the benefit you get with it is that it's a pretty lightweight shoe a little bit lighter than the new balance and you've got a nice rocket there so you can move through your footstrike quite smoothly at a range of paces and the foam while soft and comfortable it again isn't too soft just like with a new balance so you can push against it and get a bit of pace there I found it's not a shoe again that I'd be using for lots and lots of fast running myself but I do think know kind of newer Runners Runners who just want to cushion day train to do a nice range of runs both these shoes do fit the bill pretty well one thing I like about the not blast 5 compared to the previous version of the shoe is that they've shaved down this heel bevel a bit which gives it a slightly more natural rocker feeling from the back it's quite similar to the one on the New Balance actually and as a hill Striker definitely appreciate that in both shoes it makes it feel a lot easier to roll through my foot strike and in a comfortable and kind of natural way so I did do a short run in both shoes at the same time and that for me was when it was really apparent that the foam I think on the new balance is better like before that very much I had quite similar feelings about B shoes I like them they both had good Foams they did a similar job but actually when I ran in B at the same time I did really notice the benefit of I think the better foam in the New Balance 1080 with that Fresh Foam X you've got softer feeling at the heel like I say and it does have a bit more kind of lift off when it comes to the toes you get a bit more bounce back and while I don't think that really changes uh too much in terms of how versatile these shoes are in comparison to each other I do think it creates a slightly nicer feeling on the run it's a shoe I probably prefer even though it's a little bit heavy it also feels just a little bit nimbler and smaller almost because there is still a lot going on at the back of the no blast 5 but you do have that nice light feeling with this shoe it does roll through well I think if I was picking one of these to really try and pick up the pace in I probably would still lean towards the NOA blast but yeah I think the ride on the 10804 is a little bit better and uh kind of more premium you get a slightly more premium feeling from the better foam you have in the midsole but then these are both capable daily trainers at the more cushioned end both probably do better at the slower and easier Paces than the faster end both shoes can handle similar types of run overall I think but if I had to choose one shoe I think it would probably be the Nova blast 5 based on a touch more top Pace potential a bit more versatility as a result and the price it's just cheaper when I'm running with energy than overlast 5 I think returns more than you get with the 1080 v14 however if all you want is a smooth ride for your easy miles with guaranteed Road protection and comfort New Balance 1080 v14 offers that and it's very good at it too I can't kind of prefer the slower miles in the 1080 but the no blast 5 just Shades it for me on this one so if I had to pick between these two shoes I would be going for this one now what I put that down to is that you know for me they are designed for the same types of runs these are comfortable cushion daily trainer shoes and given that this does it for less money than this shoe it makes sense to go for this shoe I'd also say this is probably going to be a more accommodating fit and shoe in general for more people that's not to say that 1080 v14 is going to work for a lot of people as well too but I just think given you know what I've experienced in the Nova blast 5 and you know prioritizing Comfort which both of these shoes do I think that you're going to get that Comfort here for less money on no blast 5 I think the biggest reasons to go for 10814 as I said it is a very solid cushion daily train as well as I think the bounce in this year which is moderately bouncy has been more retained in my time in this shoe but I think for me the Comfort side of things and just being one not the the Lively bouncy novablast shoe that I thought it was going to be is going to be a shoe that's going to be great for kind of handling shorter and longer runs that those easy to moderate places just like a 1080 v14 but it will do it for less money okay so my ver on these two shoes is uh pretty easy um I think really uh it's the comparison now really comes down to the type of running that you're doing I think that the 108 v14 is an all around better shoe I think it's a balanced solid uh stable uh daily cushion shoe which can do a little bit more if if I was a beginner and I wanted one pair of shoes and I might go out and do some faster runs and maybe I'm training for something and I want some a shoe that can allow me to just maybe do a bit more and I don't want to buy loads of other shoes for training i' go for the TT v14 uh no blast 5 uh I think it's a solid comfortable shoe but the problem with it is that uh unless you are the sort of Runner that isn't ever going to do anything faster um it's a bit limited um for those sort of faster training sessions um so for me if it if I was to pick one of these shoes I would definitely go for the 10v for um but I don't think the no blast 5 is a bad sh I just think it's it's lessened the um spectrum of what it can do at if you could still pick up a version of the Nova blast 4 I'd say that that is a superior shoe to both of these shoes I think it's a far better shoe for most Runners um and just gives you a little bit more is a bit more versatile and you can also look at shoes like maybe the socony ride 17 which is a really solid um daily shoe which isn't too expensive but is is quite versatile as well so i' say that's up there with the Nova blast 4 wouldn't look at the trium 22 cuz I'm not a fan of that shoe uh I don't think it's particularly well designed uh for um easy runs or for uh more versatile faster training so yeah I'm going for the 108 v14 on this versus comes to the verdict I find the 1080 v14 and no blast 5 pretty similar overall I think I've enjoyed them to a similar extent I think I'd be using them for the same kind of runs which like I say is mostly easy runs relaxed daily training long runs that kind of thing both shoes do have a bit of Versatility to them if you are looking for a cushion daily trainer probably similarly versatile maybe the overlast 5 has a slight Edge there but do think the overall ride feel is better in the 1080 v114 because of that uh better foam you have in the mid the Fresh Foam X I think is just a livel foam a nicer foam bit softer bit bouncier just a bit more fun to run in like that said it's not an absolutely huge and massive upgrade here on the nose blast VI like the price is very similar I'd probably look at picking up the New Balance 1080 if I was looking for a nice cushion daily trainer if I was looking for a shoe to do quite a wide range of runs I'd probably get the no blast 5 anyway and it's also the cheaper shoe and you know in general as it is the cheaper shoe it's probably the one I'd go for overall because like I say I think they're mostly pretty simp IL in terms of performance if you're can to make a saving so was good to make a saving and the overlast 5 you know does a really good job it's a shoe I really like it is a good cushion shoe I think that will appeal to lots of Runners but if the price was equal I would look at getting the 1080 v14 myself for the kind of runs I'd use it for those easy runs those daily training runs I think the ride is just a little bit better because of that nice phone in the midso so you have it that's been our head-to-head between the ax over blast 5 and the New Balance 1080 v14 hope you found it useful don't forget to hit like And subscribe do all that ring the bell to hear about

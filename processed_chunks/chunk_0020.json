  "text": "if there is a preseason in the running shoe world it's the running event it's a running brand convention that showcases what's coming up in the next year and everyone looks like they've got a shot at winning it's also a pretty great time to catch up with some friends and colleagues so let's hop on a plane and head to Austin this is a runner's weekend at the running event 2024 [Music] yo what's going on just made it to the Airbnb in Austin this is the same place that I stayed last year a kafui run Club member owns this Airbnb so I love to be able to throw some business her and her family's way it's going to be a busy work week so even though it's been a really long travel day and I'm exhausted I just want to go get some dinner but first we got to go meet up with Tommy and Caitlyn who is the head organizer of this entire running event [Music] show Tommy was staying at the main TR Hotel the Hilton and I didn't film any of the two main meetings we had one was with the TR organizers as Tommy and I were going to be doing a social media takeover of the TR IG account the next day and then Tommy and I met separately because we were doing a seminar on social media for running stores also the following day afterwards Tommy and I got tacos at the hotel restaurant a productive efficient and quiet way to start TR [Music] 2024 good morning it's a little bit before 6:00 a.m. here is in Austin on a Tuesday my watch tells me I got 4 hours of sleep last night although it feels like I got a lot less a lot of tossing and turning last night bed was perfectly fine I just think I had a little bit too much coffee too late in the day yesterday and I just couldn't fall asleep got another busy day today first thing I got to do is I'm going to try to get in a little bit of extra mileage in before I meet Tommy for a run [Music] it was definitely a bit discouraging when I woke up and it was so dark to get going for this run but now that I'm on ladyb bird there are so many other Runners out here it's really quite nice to see [Music] all right got in a little bit more than 5 miles let's go find Tommy on the run this is Tommy's first run since finishing six marathons in one year [Music] that is the trail cleanup that I really wanted to do today because last year they had an option for you could pick up trash while you're jogging but there was also a kaying option and I was too afraid I'd fall in the water last year to do it this year I brought special clothes to do it so I was going to get him the kayak but I forgot that we had to film all this stuff now so I'm going to have to skip out on this year maybe another time [Music] Tommy runs Tommy kzi say your own name first hold on I want to get this actually y ready hold on oh God that's all in the mic I'm

stuff new carbon plates new people of Pham so [Music] excited we had some time before our seminar so Tommy and I got some coffee then we went to the keynote session which featured lunch and then it was time for us to give our talk on social media for running retail now even though Tommy and I did this talk last year I was still pretty nervous the session was was really well attended the last time and we had a lot of return attendees as well as a number of media colleagues and friends so I felt like expectations were high but overall I think it went well Tommy did great we had a lot of good questions from the audience and I got a chance to really emphasize one of my core philosophies of the past couple years which is that running Brands running retail and running media can work together in alignment in win winwin scenarios and in the past those groups weren't always exactly on the same team I just don't think it has to be that way and I'm trying to change [Music] that all right just finished the session I think it went well I feel like I talked too much but uh we had some good questions at the end so that was good uh now I'm going to meet up with running Warehouse we're going to film something fun for YouTube I was going to walk over there by myself but the guys are all here checking in so I'm just going to hop in an Uber with them and we'll head over do something fun earlier in the year in Boston Connor from running Warehouse took the believe in the Run crew up to the Charles to check out what real Runners were actually wearing for their daily runs and now it was my turn to do some shoe spotting along ladyb bird Lake in Austin the whole thing was a bit overproduced with three cameramen and four cameras but it was a nice way to actually spend some time chatting about shoes with a friend and I think the video we made is going to be pretty good head on over to the running Warehouse YouTube channel And subscribe to see when that video drops finished shooting sneaker spotting with running Warehouse that was a lot of fun we saw a lot of shoes a really wide variety and ran into a bunch of friends so a really fun time to G out over shoes and reconnect with some people now I'm going to head back over to the convention center the hotel across the street is where the Hoka reception is so let's go check that [Music] out this was a lively and Loud affair with drinks food and a lot of people we got to see some displays of some upcoming shoes I caught up with some friends and then it was time for me to head to my next spot for the evening TR is a lot like graduation weekend everyone has a lunch in or a gathering that you're invited to so you got to keep moving in order to see everybody and my next stop was the as6 event I had a workout scheduled for the next morning so it was a bunch of hinin 0.0 for me but it was nevertheless really good to connect with everyone [Music] good morning it is a little bit before 7:00 a.m.",

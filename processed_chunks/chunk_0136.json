  "text": "the New Balance more version 5 is one Mammoth of a shoe packed with loads of soft squishy cushioning underfoot it has the potential to be one of the comfiest shoes of all time perfect for those longer runs those recovery runs so would it be crowned the king of comfort today or will it end up being a clumpy cumbersome waste of money well today I've got all my thoughts on the more Bion 5 plus some comparisons with similar shoes you might be torn between as always on the channel I bought this shoe 100% with my own money from sport shoes here in the UK give you that completely honest impartial 100% unbiased review right let's start out talking about how this compares to the outgoing version 4 I don't actually have my more V4 here anymore but I had good fun testing it out if you want to look at the review of that I think it's over on my second Channel anyway we'll link to it down below the updated version 5 has a wider geometry underf foot but just really basically providing a lot more stability which you need with these huge High stack shoes because yeah this has now has an extra 10 mm that's crazy a whole cmet extra stack height compared with the outgoing more V4 they've also updated the tongue we've now got a nice gusseted tongue giving a little bit of a better lockdown and along with all of that extra stack heite of course unfortunately it comes with a little bit of extra weight so an extra 19 G of weight for me and my UK size 12 this is now tipping the scales at 374 G right let's check out the stats the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like this this is for your long runs your recovery runs maybe your long walks as well and for people that spent a lot of time on their feet dayto day so potentially people from working in retail working in hospitals you know who you are it's a great shoe for people that spending a lot of time on their feet when to look after their legs and be nice and comfortable all day long pricewise \u00a3140 this cost me here in the UK we'll pop up the dollars the Australian dollars the Canadian dollars and the Euros up on the screen now stack code at the back 44 mil and we've got a 4 m drop overall it's a 40 mil stack at the front of the shoe that is absolutely crazy as I said weightwise 374 G for me version 4 was 353 with the upper of this shoe we now have this engineered mesh with what they're saying is a seam free construction to help with that Comfort midsole wise we've got new balances Fresh Foam X midsole extra soft very plush very very squishy here this really does feel like you have marshmallows on the of your feet out soole wise we've just got two big patches of rubber one at the front one at the back and then some exposed midsole here in the middle of the shoe so few durability concerns there especially for some Ultra Runners which this shoe might well appeal to and you can get two different widths available although the standard shoe is pretty wide as I keep saying but of course wider footed runners go for the wide size you can get a men's and women's fit and it was true to size for me right let's get stuck into all of my likes so my first like with the New Balance more version 5 is quite simply one word Comfort it is absolutely amazing probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever run in it's very soft at all speeds but it's not really mushy you don't have to worry about sort of this big squishy mess that's not propelling you forward it really doesn't feel too dead at all yes you can pick up the pace in the shoe given this rocker that it has at the front of the shoe you get a really good turnover going that's really nice plenty wide enough to give no sort of irritation no hotpots no blisters or anything like that just out of the box Comfort right from day one a slightly sort of minor thing though it doesn't have a pull tab at the back but it's fine to get off and on anyway my second like with the shoe is this super stable very wide platform that the shoe has an a roomy toe box as well at the front of the shoe it really is the amount of width and stability that a shoe with this amount of Stack height needs sometimes when you get this High stack kite shoe the stability isn't very good and you can risk rolling an ankle you don't have to worry about something like that with a shoe like this as I say it comes in the regular wits which is decent but wider footed runners go for that wider tow box just this larger surface area in the bottom of the shoe just it gives you a lot more confidence in the corners and I like this sort of flaring at the back of the shoe as well it's just really nice design Touches at the back of the shoe and then my third like with this shoe is the ride is super smooth as I said that rocker at the front of the shoe heel Strikers are going to love this we've got a nice sort of rocker is at the back of the shoe there so you can just transitions through the foot strike super smoothly just a really nice shoe for cruising along if you're on an easy run you just want to pick up the pace from of a cruisy pace this shoe will handle that really nicely no heel slips good lock down in the shoe as well really like the improved tongue nothing moving around there and yeah nice ankle Comfort at the back no irritations or anything like that and then finally my fourth like it is a great option not just for running I know some people that like to watch my videos that aren't Runners they're looking for a nice comfortable all day shoe you can get this spect in all black as well so if you like to look a little bit smarter right it's not all smiles let's have a chat about my dislikes the first one being you can't get away this is a big shoe it is definitely on the heavy side but a lot of shoes in this category are going to be like that but it would have been nice just to be a little bit lighter there what do you guys think about lightness and heavy shoes like this they can do it the 1080 has got a good amount of foam in here and is significantly lighter it's like the sort of different density Foams between these two shoes but the weight of the shoe is distributed really nicely throughout and it doesn't feel too heavy when you got on it it doesn't even feel too heavy in the hands the second dislike with the shoe is it's definitely a shoe on the stiff side now it doesn't have a plate in the shoe but it's definitely just that sheer amount of foam it is a little bit on the stiff side I personally quite like that but not absolutely everybody will and my third dislike with the shoe is just this updated upper it's really not the most breathable this is quite thick so if you are someone that's going to be running some hotter humid climates you might want to to avoid something like this but really for anything you get in the UK you're going to be absolutely fine right we're just going to compare it quickly to some other options out there that you might be thinking about firstly the most obvious one the 1080 version 13 the 1080 is a lot lighter here probably just has got a slightly less dense version of The Fresh Foam X foam in there I wasn't a big fan of that foam it just felt quite mushy but yes the more 5 slightly on the heavier side but a lot more stable which I really like the 1080 is just a lot more versatile with that lightweight Ness you can has just got a more of a pace range that you can use it for whereas the more V5 more of an easy and Recovery run shoe only one of the another Classics the Hoka Bondi version 8 very similar geometry with that shoe but it's a lot lot firmer and it's quite an old shoe now it's really due an update hopefully that won't be very far away better for those that want that Mac stack shoe without that super soft squishy feeling but for me the more 5 definitely wins here I just really like this nice super soft squishy phone for my recovery runs and then finally probably well it is the shoe I said was the most comfortable shoe last year the aex GEL Nimbus version 26 is a lot lighter well a little bit lighter than the mo V5 and also a little less chunky as well Comfort is definitely on par I definitely prefer the stability in the mo V5 and the feel I just like I'm getting a little bit better energy return in this shoe so I can just pick up the pace a little better and they also 40 cheaper so quite a significant saving there pricewise right conclusion time do do I recommend this shoe well definitely yes this is my go-to recovery run shoe right now I really do prefer it just a little bit over the Joe nus 26 which is what it's replacing in my rotation is it worth the upgrade over version 4 well I think so this has got a significant improvements quite surprised with the amount of improvements that New Balance have managed to get into the shoe it's been a lot smoother it's much more lively much more fine it can pick up the pace a little bit better as well and also just better lock down and comfort in version 5 so you've got the budget for it then definitely Splash out on version 5 so who should be buying a shoe like the more version 5 or someone looking to add a shoe into the rotation for those slower runs of the week those easy runs those recovery runs those longer runs as well so long as you're not looking to pick up the pace too much Ultra Runners I'd really recommend a sh like this for some of your flat Ultra runs something in the UK maybe like a temps past through as long as it's not too wet in the second half of the run but Ultra Runners if you're running on prepared Services your toax fire roads just prepared services this will be a fantastic option to take on those yes it's a little bit on the heavy side but it's super comfortable to offset that and yeah finally just people need that all day Comfort up work as well then we'll be keeping it definitely really enjoyed this shoe it is not going on eBay I'm afraid right next video we've talked a lot about comfort in the shoe up here we've got my most comfortable shoe review so go and check that out and this would have certainly featured it if I had the shoe when I recorded that video that's it guys keep on working hard keep on done let me know what you want to see reviewed on the channel next and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

the support a lot of people obviously ask about Tru to size I just want to say I got all of these New Balance shoes in my regular UK size 12 and they were all really good and fitted very nicely so they're all true to size for for me right let's get stuck in with the shoe starting out with the cheapest finishing off with the most expensive so starting out with the New Balance 880 this is the brand new version 14 with an updated mids and upper here now there's kind of Two Shoes in this range you got the 880 which is for the neutral Runners out there and you've also got the 860 which is the stability version of this shoe this is your classic everyday shoe that can do everything pretty well good for doing all sorts of different types of running this sent me back one 140 here in the UK stack height around about 30 mil stack height at the back 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise we're talking 312 G for me in my UK size 12 for the mids so we've got new balances Fresh Foam X here big chunk of that there's no carbon plate in this shoe but there are plenty of wide options standard wide and extra wide here now what I really like about the shoe my Pros my likes super durable outso in the shoe this is going to last you a long time on your runs it offers some really good traction as well also a very versatile ride and a really good one shoe option super comfortable right out the box great cushioning just the right amount for all sorts of different types of runs you got a good amount of ground contact feel without that Max stack kite thing I'm feeling a bit numb out there now what I didn't like about the shoe it is it does run a little bit narrow so if you're someone that does have a wider foot definitely get the wide or the extra wide but all in all I've really enjoyed putting some Mars in the shoe and I'll be putting plenty more in as I build up towards my next marathon moving on we've got the rebel version 4 this is a hell of a lot lighter this is your lightweight daily trainer perfect for Speed work 5Ks 10ks up to half marathon distances and also say training for marathons as well I wouldn't personally want to use this for a Marathon distance we'll come on to perfect shoes for that a little bit later on price-wise \u00a340 stack height 30 mil at the back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise 242 G super lightweight midsole here we've got some fuel cell foam peber 20% and EVA foam 80% so I blend of the two classic Foams there's no plate in this shoe and there's also no wide option now what I really liked about this shoe it is super lightweight and really great fun to run in it really brings a big smile to your face it's very Lively also really good on the width option here there aren't other wide options you got plenty of space up front here on the standard shoe it's very versatile and also fantastic value \u00a3140 for a shoe like this that can do so much and it really is one of the best value shoes that you can get on sale today also I think it looks really good as well let me know your thoughts down in the comments now what I didn't like about the shoe I did get a bit of heel slip and a bit of heel rubbing little blisters starting to develop at the back of the shoe on my first few runs did some heel lock lacing and that went away so overall another shoe that I've really enjoyed running and I'm looking forward to keeping in my rotation moving on on to the more version 4 shoe I don't actually have any more because I had so many happy Mars in it and it's now a little bit worn out this is your max cushion long run super soft super squishy recovery run shoe the type of shoe you want to put on when you want to look after your legs this shoe sent me back \u00a340 stack Co at the back 34 mil with a 4 mm drop overall so a little bit flatter here Weight Wise it is a little bit on the heavy side 353 G for me in my UK size 12 mids salt we've got got Nik Nike definitely not Nike we've got new balances fresh f x midsole there's no carbon plate in the shoe and you can also get two wide options here just your standard or your wide what I liked about this shoe it's super stable given how soft it is so sometimes with the squishy shoes you can feel a lot of instability especially when cornering this is nice wide platform super stable really roomy and wide fitting as well super soft squishy ride it ticks that Comfort box really really well terms of what I didn't like it is just a bit bulky and heavy and just doesn't handle speed very well it's not really built for that sort of thing but it's really not the type of shoe you could just have one shoe and do all your runs in it this is a dedicated slower Pace easy recovery run shoe moving on to one of the oldtime classics from New Balance the 1080 currently at version 13 you can also get the vongo 6 which is their stability version so the 1080 neutral shoe vongo 6 stability version the shoes are fairly similar this do premium everyday shoe price-wise little bit expensive \u00a360 here for the 1080 stack height 38 mil at the back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall coming in at 323 G for me midsole we've got new balances Fresh Foam X again there's no carbon plate in the shore no plate of any description there are also plenty of wide options you got your standard your wide and your extra wide what I really liked about it Supreme levels of comfort definitely one of the most comfortable shoes you can buy on the market at the moment moment and it's also a really good shoe for your walking or anyone on their feet all day really wellb built shoe as well good quality upper here yes it's a premium product but you can really feel that in how well the shoe has been built what I didn't like about the shoe the standard width is a little bit on the narrow side little bit high price point here as well for me I just found it a little bit too soft and unstable and it really is no longer that doit all shoe cuz now with it's so soft it really is that only easy and Recovery run shoe so if you're the type of person that wants the ultimate soft and squishiness then B check out the 1080 but a better daily option for me I think is the 880 right let's move on to getting a little bit more expensive again to the super comp trainer getting some real speed into the mix now so the super comp trainer I really love this shoe when I had it in earlier this year this is for your fast training runs speed sessions long marathon training sessions and also racing here as well we now got a plate in the shoe not the stiffest plate but a kind of plate you can use everyday a premium everyday shoe here price-wise a bit on the expensive side \u00a3210 for this stackwise 40 mil at the back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall weight 326 G for me midsole we've got new balances fuel cell foam plate wise yes we have now got a carbon fiber plate carbon carbon fiber plate in the shoe and there is no wide option here what I really liked about the shoe it was supremely comfortable a lot of padding around the back of the shoe around your anle really good lock down in there no slipping around no hot spots or anything like that and with a plate in the shoe it's fast as well and I really think it's right up with the most comfortable far shoe that you can buy anywhere on the market at the moment and also a really good entry level option for people looking to try out a carbon plated shoe for the first time so it's also a really good option for that mid pack type Runner or back of the- pack Runner that wants to have a far shoe on their feet but running their marathons a little bit longer than some other people out there so what that really Supreme comfort to get them through the race definitely one of my favorite shoes that I've run in this year so well worth checking out and what I didn't like about the shoe yeah it cost me a lot of money basically a little bit on the expensive side but you're getting a premium product here and finally in the lineup today we've got the supercom elite version 4 currently this is New Balance allout Flagship super stiff fast carbon race shoe new Balan is Super Shoe that long distance specialist perfect for half marathons we can use this for any distance really but for a lot of people this is a half marathon and Marathon shoe price-wise oh this was a lot \u00a3260 I've just spent on this shoe stack height 40 mil at the back of the shoe with a 4 mm drop overall Weight Wise 286 G for me and my UK size 12 we've got the fuel cell midsole 100% peber and a fulllength carbon plate running through the shoe and there's no wide option here now what I liked about the shoe as I've said quite a lot today in this video very very comfortable overall really like like what new balets have done with their Phantom fit upper it's extremely bouncy very poppy but not too stiff like some carbon shoes can be it's another good entry level point for someone that wants that that all out race shoe as well that hasn't maybe run in some carbon plated shoes before and is certainly a very fast option out there I've really enjoyed taking this up to some of my allout Paces at the moment I didn't actually have any heel slip issues in this one I was using the heel lock lacing on the front as well just to combat that because the stru strcture is very similar to The Rebel version 4 what I didn't like about the shoe the tongue's just a bit weird it's just a little bit on the short side with that Hill lock lacing it doesn't leave much but just about being okay and it's just a little bit on the heavy side but as I say I really like the Comfort levels the shoe offered and for someone landing on the midfoot as well and just rolling through a really nice rocker through the shoe a very fast option so here's my final thoughts on the New Balance range the most comfortable option the super comp trainer the best everyday option the eight 80 the best for allout Speed and Marathon racing definitely the elite V4 the best value shoe here the rebel version 4 the best option for Walkers hikers being on your feet all day than the 1080 and out of all of these shoes my standout one was surprisingly I'm sure somebody would be surprised was the 880 it just a really good classic daily shoe I just put it on it got the job done no fuss really comfortable great lock down good breathability good amount of speed you can get in the shoe as well well you can feel a little bit of the ground and it was just one that caught me out and a really nice enjoyable ride in the shoe and going be racking up some more training miles in this one without a doubt so thanks for following along guys hope you enjoyed the video we'll link to the full playlist of these complete overviews down below let us know what you'd like to see coming up next maybe on or added us potentially let us know down in the comments up next we've got the most comfortable shoes for all of your runs up here that's it guys keep on working hard keep

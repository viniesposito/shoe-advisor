  "text": "[Music] all right this is going to be fun we have Victor Diaz from Renegade running and if you're not familiar with Renegade you're not really following along what's happening in running especially in run culture and uh Victor's going to give us the down low on everything that's going on Victor what's up good morning thanks for having me Thomas I'm excited to be here I know it and we kind of know each other we spent time we've uh you know shook hands and been in in our each other's faces so it's not like uh this is the first time getting to know each other we had dinner together and yeah we did yeah lots of wine that night yeah I don't even recall did you drink did you have any of that wine I did not I did not but we were at a really nice uh Hotel up in the Berkeley Hills The Claremont The Claremont yeah which we were there we came out so Robbie and I went out with norda to do an event uh kind of they were doing a release on their O2 which is kind of a lower stack closer to the ground Victor was nice enough to host everybody at Renegade and uh so I had known about you before we kind of connected every once in a while online before that but that was the first time we got to hang correct and you're from the area so we had we were able to connect on that um Talk about the um the life of the East Bay uh as you know when we were both younger and then kind of how it is now today yeah and I certainly want to get into like run culture and the Renegade store and what you're doing there but I think you have a bigger mission that I kind of want you to kind of share like you're not just here to have a retail store and to sling shoes or a sling gear what's what's your like whole philosophy behind what you're trying to do out there well I would was really um excited in the like right around like say 2015 2016 watching the early emergence of run Crews mostly in Europe at the time probably um run themm crew and pot run club and seeing um folks from a lot of different backgrounds coalescing together um sometimes around a mission sometimes around just the joy of being in community and then of course um more often than not around the joy of running and then to see that spread like wildfire into the US um black roses in New York and and then of course the energy of Korea Town and Good Vibes in La that just got me really excited that there was something different happening in the Run space unlike anything that I had seen or experienced as a runner growing up in the late 80s and early 90s coming into the sport um so I wanted to be a part of it and I wasn't quite sure where or how initially um I was working in public education for a long time and I saw as I continued to hover around the runspace I felt like there was a gap between this emerging excitement and community building and coalescing around Runners from all backgrounds and spaces for them to come and Shop hang out share information um talk about running and racing and talking about and talk about issues that were impacting our community and I didn't feel like that was happening anywhere in the country and so I thought hey I'm I think I'm perfectly positioned to do this and that's really the groundwork or the root the roots of what um sparked the opening of renegade so like a shift in culture I I would say before before that time period I really feel like your retail experience was pretty cookie cutter you'd see a rack of Brooks clothing you'd see a rack of Nike maybe you know some socony it was the shoe companies kind of like putting here's your run gear and if it wasn't a lot of like it was more performance-based than maybe style based so it's like okay this shirt Wicks sweat who needs to do anything crazy put it out in a couple different fluorescent colors maybe and a black and and that's where you go what I what I found interesting about run cruise and we started faster basts back in like 2012 was uh that this became a way to express yourself in running and kind of identify with like-minded people or other people I think what I see uh in your mission is also kind of helping that underserved clientele maybe the marginalized clientele and bringing them into the spotlight or at least giving them a place to feel where they belong in the sport and are part of the sport how important is that to you yeah uh 100% that's you know I would I would also say that you know the beauty of run Crews because nearly all of them do not have a physical location um P being the probably one exception since they're also a retail store um they'll get together wherever and and and usually you know around um you know like-minded um interest in their community be it a um Community uh Meetup spot uh a restaurant a bar places like that so they really have this um you know like go- get it attitude about them the difference and where I felt like I could make where I where where Renegade could make a difference is that run stores kind of have the opposite um ethos it's like we hold all the expertise we help hold all the information if you're if you are serious about running you'll come into our doors and that's just I think a real that's kind of like the chasm between the two the tension between the two communities so so I opened up with and and and I'm driven by what can we do to reach individuals small run clubs larger running crews in a way that feels real authentic um and we can connect around something bigger than running and and that's that's really where the work is at yeah and that interesting you say that um I've seen kind of like a a full circle uh with run Crews and I I think originally I I get what you're saying like I didn't start running in high school and then go to college and then you know grow up in the ecosphere of run specialty and I think the running stores that are getting it right and we're seeing some of these emerg that are kind of exciting and have that energy you want to be around but there was a time period where I think these run clubs spun out of like I don't want to be owned by a running store or like find my running group at a running store so they split off and they kind of create their own culture and kind of grow this organic group of people that like to run together you can it doesn't even have to be around structured you know workouts or anything you can just be like hey this is where we meet we all run this and it's social we have some beers afterwards or whatever and then it's kind of evolved into this thing where where it became real appealing for Brands now to kind of like skip the store and go straight to the Run Club MH and then there's backlash from the traditional stores that are like hey why aren't you supporting us anymore we buy all your shoes MH and then so I'm seeing these run clubs actually get almost like sponsored and pulled back into the store I'm wondering if that is going to kill the culture or do you think that grows the culture in certain circumstances and I'll give you before I let you answer that I'll give you the my thought is there's some stores that do it right I think the loop The Exchange Renegade uh you know Runner space there's there's some stores that are are embracing what the Run clubs are doing but there's other ones that are just plugging in as a marketing tactic yeah I mean I definitely feel like um you know um running stores and running brands for that matter the big shoe brands I feel like we're approaching a place now where like you got to earn the respect of the community you got to earn the respect of some of these run Club Founders run crew Founders um and if you don't yeah they're not GNA they're not going to support your business um which I think is a great is a great um um approach like you know communities of color largely are ignored by the running industry they're used primarily to like color up their social media you know it's like you know um if we want to add some flavor to it you'll put someone in your social media sadly and unfortunately it seems to be like the same person for you know showing up in like four or five different shoe brands social media for like 18 months or something it's like I don't know if like they all have conspired to some cookie cutter formula um so I think that the the the the growth um and the political nature of it also because I don't want to I don't want to lose that it's a political act when a group of people and when it's a largely communities of color um groups of people in the large numbers that they're coming together that's a pretty profound political statement so I think more shoe brands are no longer walking that fine line they're actually jumping all in with both feet or they're going to miss the opportunity because like I said at the top of this question like you really have to come and earn it you got to be real you have to be willing to just do more than just throw you know a handful of shoes um or a branded singlet at a crew now um and I think that's the way it should be all right so you threw out kind of a word that I think is kind of like a tricky word especially in today's climate political what do you what do you mean by political when you use it in that context well when you see I mean I think when you see any um it when you see a group of people of color coming together um really like let's say a from a topic or or a function um that can be that from the outside can be um intimidating to um um somebody who is not a part of that group um and the you know the the sort of historic nature of that thinking is like that group is conspiring to do something Fillin the blank mischievous political um you know social upheaval or something like that you know um so the appearance of it conjures up you know or evokes a lot of different feelings um I I call it a political act because in many ways our communities let's call it the bipo community just for the sake of more specificity um though it represents a lot of different groups of communities of color right African-American Asian Latino um when we come together there's um there's just this feeling like we can do anything together um and so um you know that's it's an exciting moment um but it but I can see where it would be um scary to to some people um and it's the first time this has happened in running and the and the numbers that it's happening in I mean that's the exciting thing is that you know when you think about like from our perspective the more people running the more people need information information the more people that will search out that information whether it's through us or through somebody else but the numbers grow the races grow the the healthy ecosystem of running grows so yeah I mean you know growing up in in the East Bay and stuff like that at least where I grew up I was exposed to bipo communities my entire childhood like you're not going you're not going to grow up in the at least when I was there it it was very diverse as far as uh the community then you know you come over to New York same thing and even in Baltimore where it's it's a pretty integrated city um it there was a time where it felt a little less integrated but now when we go for runs and we do stuff you're going to see uh you know people of every background at these runs so I I to me it's not as crazy but I came into running later than like the you know I wasn't running until uh 2000 and uh like seven and so I you know I kind of saw a shift but it wasn't it's definitely gotten more inclusive in the last 5 10 years but I think the running Community has also grown in the last 5 10 years for you when you see it I see it from a different perspective because obviously being a white guy and and coming into it I'm like I've seen the community here you know it's been happening but from your perspective you're do you feel like this is a new thing or am I like like downplaying a little bit how much it's growing yeah I mean I you know I I'm I'm quite a bit older and like I said I started running in the late 80s um and early 90s more competitively um everywhere that I've run there have always been people of color that have run um I I I think the difference between um then and now is that we mostly ran in our communities mostly if we did race it was within our communities and didn't travel very far I think that the difference and what's what makes it more visible and in my opinion more beautiful is that we're actually leaving the community and going and racing outside of our neighborhoods many people have the audacity it seems to be um to go and race major marathons around the world which is really exciting um and then many are are we're now seeing um they're actually dabbling in multiple Sports not just running you see them now taking on um cycling gravel riding Triathlon and things like that so it does give license when you start to see larger groups of people of color it gives a license for more groups to emerge as more of us travel to other races again it gives license and connectivity safety um fun excitement to to travel to those places I know a lot of people for example Chicago is kind of getting that energy where a lot of people love to go to Chicago and New York um because of the diversity of people that are racing communities that they can stay in and R race and run and train at um and and of course that's with the context of what's been happening at Boston what as well right which is kind of seems to be going in the other direction so so these are narratives that people are like diving more deeply into and um and it's changing it's changing the sport it's changing who participates um and yeah that I'm enjoying seeing that for sure so as a store owner and seeing it like firsthand who's coming into the store who's engaging with product and stuff like that what are some things that you're seeing that would maybe be different than you might see at a m city run or at a you know on Austin or some of the other parts of the country well we spend a lot of time in the community and we do a lot of events in the community that um some running related um that we don't charge for so um maybe you know and we're we're really visible so the only thing that's required of the communities for them to come out like our track nights for example on Wednesday nights it's at the local Community College we always have upwards of 100 120 130 people um and it's exciting to see that they coales themselves outside of that Wednesday night so they'll run in groups of five or six or seven on other days and things like that they're joining races together so and then of course they'll come and shop at the store and you know in pairs and small groups and things like that so so there is this sort of like inextricable bond that I feel like we have with our community we're at a place now where I don't know two-thirds of the people that come into the shop we already know them we've seen them out in the community they've come to our events um they're a multiple repeat customer so there is that familiarity I wouldn't go as far as saying it's like a barber shop because we haven't reached that level of of coolness yet but it is a place where people come and you're known um you're recognized you're acknowledg uh acknowledged um and you're celebrated and we have that sort of connection and then just I mean on a like much more specific specific note we did an event on Saturday here at the shop with Nike sportsare so the the sportsare side the lifestyle side and um through our partnership with Nike and through the event um close to 400 pairs of shoes were gifted to people in the community in a really cool sort of Nike style with like suitcases and we had DJs and food and a run and there was a dance party at night so it was essentially a celebration of yeah celebration of Nike product a celebration of our community some product and the energy was high the turnout was crazy um so it's those kinds of events coupled with our like every day or you know every week sort of run from the shop activity and everything in between so see I don't I don't know you know what the sort of culture or ethos is like at a Mill City um they have of course a long-standing relationship with their community and do an amazing job of community building themselves um yeah I would say that we just do it sort of like Oakland with a little bit more style you that's what I was getting into the Oakland thing and I'll get back to that in a second but it's funny you said barber shop because I'm always talking about like for our space here in Baltimore we're not a retail store or anything like that but my favorite place as a kid was always the record store or the skate shop and you went there even if you weren't purchasing you I would go to the SK shop and they would put in like tapes you know at this time VHS tapes of cavalero and people skating and and you you could just sit there and maybe the owner order pizza and we would just hang out and I've always wanted to have that vibe in the things that we do for uh believe in the run and one of the things I'm noticing is kind of like a parallel between us is giving to people is more fun than taking from people and we've always wanted when we do events they're free events we want to we want to bring people in and and create that party atmosphere that makes them love the sport that we're in and maybe introduces them to other people that feel the same way and one of my favorite things is seeing kind of like uh we have the believer run club we have faster basts and I've watched kind of the social groups grow out of that where they're now creating their own Social Circles outside of the Run Club but we've had marriages babies all that stuff it's just a fun like way to live is like to help spread the the passion for a healthy thing like running one of the things I noticed in Oakland was that man that's a tough place to be doing business we went to the Target there while we were visiting you there's a dude with like a semi-automatic you know rifle standing at the the guard I know that you've had people like smash windows before and stuff like that how it seems like you're committed to the community but man it's got to be rough sometimes um well it's rough to operate a business um just in general it's tough to operate a business um in a city that has many other um issues of which you know crime is one of them for sure but Oakland has much bigger problems and issues I think more um systemic than than crime um I would say it's more a lack of leadership um at the like City Council and and mayor level um which I think is just kind of generally a problem with politics in general but um um but definitely a city of this size needs stronger leadership and I think without that that's what many of the small bu that's what we talk about when small business owners get together um is it is that there isn't the kind of accessibility we would want with our political leaders and there doesn't seem to be an urgency or a plan in place and so when you don't have those things then one of the byproducts is um crime unfortunately or it's the crime that happens sticks out like is this thing just GNA keep getting worse because of the things I just mentioned you know and so it's the same here in Baltimore what's that it's Baltimore has a similar issue yeah and we're seeing that we're seeing that across a lot of cities um you know there's for whatever reason there's there just seems to a lack of leadership um around um um some some of the cities that that that unfortunately a number of people of color are living in but just with regard to Oakland I think that's the bigger issue um yeah but you actually you said something about I want to go back to though about the skate shop you know um I I'm I've been getting questions now about like how um I got good at building community it seems to be like a like a like a like it's kind of almost Voodoo or something you know in the sport of running um because people within the sport of running have asked me you know like what's the formula like if we have some like you know master plan like a plan yeah like a PowerPoint but as you were saying that you know like about barber shops and skate shops you know um I mean I grew up in a barber shop in in San Jose with my father as a barber and um I just feel like early on you know I grew up in a neighborhood and at a time where people looked out for each other um every adult had a right to parent you um you know um if you had food or whatever you had in the neighborhood it was shared with other people who needed it so there were people constantly coming through my grandparents to eat or grab food or maybe even sleep and stuff like that so I I guess in some way I can say that I've sort of been preparing for this moment like my entire life you know but it but it does bring a bigger question to the floor for the sport of running that I feel like still operates very transactional you know I mean even like your store runs you know um it's I think most running shops that do runs from their shop you can feel in most cases that that infrastructure was really set up to like bring demo shoes and to to sell you something inside the store um maybe sell you a training plan and things like that you know so um yeah unless you've been to a skate shop when you were younger and like you know you you you needed like a set of wheels so you can get home like the shop owner gave you a set of wheels to get home you know um and so so I think that that's a that's a bigger question that I wish that the running industry would have with itself you know or maybe at places like TR like how can we be more efficacious in our communities how can we have a greater impact I mean we're really just running you know what I mean it's not like yeah you know what I mean it's like we're in movement and we're in movement in spaces that in many of our stores if you go out two or three or four more miles there's a great need for the infrastructure of what we do right like we mobilize um there are people that are talented across a lot of different Industries um there's people with a great deal of like fortitude I mean to run a marathon or an ultra takes or 5K for that matter takes a lot of fortitude so what if we like bottled up all of that secret sauce and did things just a few more blocks outside of our shops you know like how then do we start to transform the neighborhoods we live in you know and not depend on political leaders or the person at Target to make our spaces safer you know yeah well I think you know we we talk about like the building Community thing I think that people can sniff out inauthentic motives and you know if it doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right and you're not going to get the vibe that you're looking for so when people talk about a Playbook or how do you do this I don't think it's a how it's like why are you doing this and I think the problem is when somebody comes to you and says hey can I get a playbook for how to build that Community yeah you're like you don't need a Playbook you just need a reason why why like do you want it cuz look maybe you will get rich owning a running a running store you know and I'm sure there are people that have but for the most of us like if you're going to own a skate shop a barber shop a whatever it is you're not looking to you know Bank you know like it's not like a investor comes in and says what's your investor deal let's let's build this up and and blow this out you know so I think a lot of people that when it resonates it's because the motive behind the shop like why why why do you have a shop Victor yeah I mean I want to see a I wanted to see a difference in our community on a lot of different levels you know I wanted there to be a safe space for people to come together I wanted us to be able as a larger group of people to have an impact in our community um and um those were those were two big reasons why um um yeah and it's I the the joy of us um um in being in movement together to address our issues in our community together there's really nothing like it you know um I mean we mobilized for a nonprofit in our community the nonprofit has nothing to do with running and on two different fundraising events the entire Community not just Renegade or not because of renegade it was all of us together raised like over 30,000 for a nonprofit that's run entirely by volunteers and is working with day laborers in the Oakland area um so so that to me is the is the is the why that's the joy of what we're doing so like a vehicle to get you to another space to be better man to be better to be better in community to to live in a better space like you were saying I mean you know I live and work in this area we run and hang out and eat and in the neighborhood I walk around this neighborhood with my kids um and you just want to feel better in that space and feel more connected to each other you know um and that's that's a big part of the why I mean if I look at Oakland now from when I was a kid and so my mom lived in Oakland for a short period of time right near your store um and Oakland in the time when she was there late 70s early 80s like it was a disaster as far as like I I remember it as a child like you didn't go to Oakland you went to Berkeley you went you know other areas but Oakland was kind of like you don't go there now Oakland Hills is a different story but when now when I went there it's actually kind of crazy CU now I saw it visiting you was like okay it took an upswing and then it looks like California in general like San Francisco everything kind of like hit a peak and it seems like it's like so even with the problems though it's better than it was when I was growing up yeah I mean there's I yeah I I don't the history of Oakland is is you know is a lot more complex than than what we can handle in this podcast you know but but um but again it's it's a beautiful city I don't think it's any more or less dangerous than any other comparable City I don't think it has any more or less promise than you know some emerging I don't know Suburban City or something like that you know it's just kind of just just like you know there are City that do well for themselves and and are able to make progress um you know I've never I haven't been in Minneapolis for example in a very long time I know that some of the cities in the Midwest and you know sort of I don't know lay their hat on how how joyful the places are um so I don't know I don't live there so I'm not I'm not going to compare or contrast it to others I know that there is a there is a beautiful energy in Oakland because because of its diversity because of its history um because of the art because of people that are out in movement together um around each other and honestly I I I can't I I couldn't I mean I most cities that I've lived in have been similar in their diversity in their challenges in the joy and um I I couldn't imagine living any place else or I else yeah I feel the same way about Baltimore I'm like I I almost feel like when when is the rest of the country going to discover this little gem that's right on the water half an hour from DC an hour from Philly a two-hour train ride to New York City like we're in the perfect spot we just got to figure this out but everybody has those challenges I noticed that you guys threw some uh attention towards Los Angeles though for a little bit there is that a permanent Renegade or is that just a popup like what's going on there yeah we opened our second store in Los Angeles um in October um for all of the same reasons I've been mentioning here about um why we started Renegade and why Oakland um I went to school in La I have family in La um La is just beautifully diverse um and um an amazing space to to run to ride to swim um to be active um and um where we we located our second shop in Silver Lake which is I feel like a great ju toos to like downtown LA East LA um and uh the sort of new gentrification of that area so it's got like a good mix of a lot of different things happening um and yeah we're really lucky to be there and a big part of the decision to move there was how much support and love and and being connected to the um the you know a lot of the Run crews in La so um yeah that's our second shop we're excited to be there and um and it's beautiful to connect there's a really um amazing sort of tension between Northern California and Southern California it's existed long before I was born um but I know it growing up I was actually a Dodger fan living in the Bay area so I was like most most hated on my little league teams um and um so it's actually nice to be in both places and have people visit from both areas um living and running in both cities so um it's great to be sort of be in both to be situated in both communities so we're gonna see a renegade cap that has orange and black with an orange bill on one and then a blue blue and white no man that ain't cool enough plus it's already been done yeah man California's a weird space uh yeah um it's interesting though you're you have a curated collection at your store and you really like here's what I find is interesting about like I feel like there's a few taste makers in the space and I think that you have your finger on that pulse for like what's coming next and kind of like what's interesting in the Run space how do how do you go about developing your uh collection there for Renegade um I I definitely am obsessed with design um capital D design in the in the most in the broadest sense um you know whether that's architecture painting um materials apparel um so that generally just draws my interest at a very high level um I studied it um in college I was fascinated by it as a kid um as a Mexican growing up and there's murals like around you all the time and the political nature of murals um has has been has been something that has um yeah I mean it it it's it just sort of grew me up actually from like a knucklehead teenager into you know a wannabe intellect as I got older um so Art and Design have kind of helped sort of grow me up to be the person I am today to appreciate you know um you know messaging and um storytelling and the impact that a narrative can have have when it's present the the chaos that happens with the lack of a of a narrative that you can connect to um so anyway I've been sort of obsessed with with design um as a as a little kid and and again even more so now as an adult um I love artists designers that have a strong purpose to their work and so so when I you know I think like I think one of the first before well in the running space um before I think satisfying District Vision kind of started to emerge around the same time and you can feel the the design in ttention in the glasses that District Vision um was creating at the time um and of course you can feel the design aesthetic and function and and differentiation that satisfy was creating at the time and my God that was exciting and so I I find I try to find Brands and designers like that that want to push the boundaries um that want to create something that hasn't been created um and and I just try to latch on to it and in some instances they're and in more so now actually um they're not even running related and I just want to have them in our space because they're just so thoughtfully designed and made and so um an wander is probably one of those brands that is not running related just beautifully made garments that straddle this like design and and function and Beauty um maybe it helps that the design team is a man woman team so it has like this beautiful yin-yang to it um and so um so yeah that's you know that's that's sort of the premise I guess I how I approach it um and at this point we we now kind of find each other through social media through um you know just kind of visiting each other in person um but yeah that's that's the level of detail that I obsess with these things and not everything meets that standard in Renegade of course you know some stuff you just you just need a waste belt to put your phone in you know so um so but but the things that excite me are are are those give me three brands that you carry that are unique to R rade say that you feel like Runners should be aware of or maybe you don't even carry him now but you want Runners to be like keep it an eye on wow so there's I mean in the shop right now there's two small brands that that I I I really like what they're doing one is Tanuki from Japan the other is Mountain martial arts from Japan they're both young small brands that um I think are having fun with um um with their running apparel um they're pushing the boundaries on like Silhouettes and fabrics um and they're kind of whimsical which is kind of fun too you know so they give you um I don't want to mention other brands names that I that I that act Whimsical and their stuff is kind of crappy um so this stuff is is I think has taken that approach to being fun like Mountain Marshal lights for example has they do like a lot of camo print and stuff like that which of course everybody has done um but they'll do it with like a Polar Tech fabric they have the absolute best um uh pocket system along the hips of their shorts and so that's um that's really exciting to see there are two new brands that we're going to be carrying they're out now on social media you can see them one is UNA and the other's portal um two brand new brands what I love about um una's um again the designer comes from a high fashioned design so there's a there's a a difference in their Silhouettes that is very as it's a departure from you know the traditional singlet with the like the exact same scoop on the neck and the exact same opening of the arms and things like that so they're just playing with different shapes um and that's exciting to see because it's all with technical materials and for the purpose of running um and then the other's portal and the guys at portal come from an ultr running trail and cycling background and in fact the first drop is going to have running and cycling um and trail running um pieces all in the first drop um and so so th those are those are brands that I'm excited about in this early part of uh 2025 all right now this is going to be a tough one but where do you see I mean we're running come in the last 5 years especially out of uh covid and all of that where it's come from in the recent history where do you see it going because I don't see it like I don't feel like we're reaching a bubble I don't feel like this new growth is these people are going to go away necessarily uh but I want to know from your perspective where do you see the sport headed I think if you asked me this question like once a week for the next like 10 weeks I probably would have 10 different answers um for sure one thing is smaller brands are having a larger impact on bigger Brands um even though the larger brands are not as Nimble and can't get stuff to Market as quickly it's gonna have it's having an impact I mean you see that already with like you know an does an amazing job with their apparel it's changing that um norda and what norda has done um in the shoe world is when you rais the ceiling like that with you know I'm sure that there were design teams talking to their bosses at every major brand when asked we want to make we want you to make a better Trail shoe and their response was okay I know all these materials I can make you a kickass shoe but this is what we'd have to sell it at and they might have been fired like mids sentence you know what I mean like that's how the industry has been functioning and Nick and Willa and norda changed all of that dramatically I mean seeing fall winter 25 shoes it's like everybody has a trail shoe at 275 and higher now and that's all because of Nick and Willa and norta you know like no one would have had the audacity to do that you know so the smaller brands are having a big impact um on the larger Brands and that's exciting to see because now you get the artisan and the audac and the creativity of a small brand um and then you get sort of like the access to insane materials and technology and hopefully environmental thoughtfulness from the larger Brands to make competing shoes in that space so so that's going to just continue to percolate and and then just feed off each other you have way too many smart creative designers on the apparel side in running that are not going to go anywhere I.E like a Bree um they're going to continue to make even cooler even more amazing stuff um and you have the larger Brands now that have recognize they're losing too much market share um and they have to get cooler hipper and be more agile and so um so I think that's gonna have we're gonna see more of that play out I can see the larger Brands having more limited drops more collaborations like post archive faction and on um so running's just going to keep getting cooler I I like that um when you said one thing that I think that there's a there's been a price raising in shoes now for the last few years I It Started With You Remember When The Vapor fly came out and people were like $250 for a ratio that's crazy and they couldn't make enough of them to Supply the demand um same thing happened with super blast when that came out there're like people like that's ridiculous this isn't even a race stue it's over 200 bucks nobody's going to buy it they can't keep it in stock the I think it sometimes it merits it and sometimes it doesn't when I look at norda and you brought up norda as an example for a more expensive Trail shoe norda is using dyema bioda which is good for the environment they're using the vbr out like they're trying to create a really quality shoe and that's why it's priced where it is but they also can't compete with the production numbers that maybe a Nike can put out or an Adidas can put out or one of the major brands so you're talking about a smaller inventory they've got to make their profit on a higher price Goods product other times we're now seeing that all the bars are being lifted and all the shoe companies are now charging more so I think sometimes when you raise a ceiling and you do something creative and you bring in a new product that's great but I do also feel like there's some bleeding from the in Industry where they're still using not as great components but they're bringing the price up do you would you agree with that um actually I I think I'd push back a tiny bit and say that you know I mean the when you raise the bar not everyone's going to sell a buttload of you know two $300 shoes and in fact that's never going to be a major shoe brand strategy um so then how do you capture I mean everybody's been trying to create and capture the market of that um what what we call now like this super trainer you know so it's like a $50 savings or a $75 savings on what you were just talking about um um so anyway I what I see now is like the Nova blast at 140 is a phenomenal shoe like it just checks a lot of boxes it performs it's lightweight the price is great um and $140 is still a lot of money but I think because of because of what we expect now from two 180 and20 and $275 shoes you can expect more from this $140 shoe so yeah um Mount to Coast you know a new brand um I think it's rare for a new brand to get as many things right as they have gotten right and the R1 I think is is an absolutely phenomenal first time out of the gate shoe a lightweight shoe eight ounces a sensible drop at 8 millimeters a sensible stack at like 28 in the midfoot um like it just like it got out of its own way and just made a very simple nice fitting shoe it seems like an easy formula right yeah so they kept it simple and and if I was in that room I would have said hell no don't charge 160 like charge a lot more you know uh but they were smart and shows that they're smarter than you know than a lot of us at keeping it at 160 and because of what you can expect in terms of durability it's even a better value because you can expect um a lot more mileage than your traditional shoe but amount to coast and the materials and performance of a Nova blast I think are aided by these super trainers and these Racing shoes that now have people talk talking about materials about you know performance about longevity and they have that formula where they're you know their own equation that to then ask themselves is it worth it and whenever you have a customer asking those questions that's great for everybody you know yeah well I agree with you I mean I can name you've got the rebel V5 you've got the Nova blast you've got the evos coming out from Adidas you've got the Brooks Hyperion those are just four ride off the top of my head that are under 150 bucks that benefit from the materials that came down from the Super Shoes to to in there I mean the evos has got the Light Strike Pro two in in the mid sole all these Foams this technology in this what I would say right now the most important thing that's happened to shoes in the last uh 10 years is the super critical Foams and the introduction of peba into the uh mix and some of these other uh T TP uh Blends and stuff like that that are trickling down to the consumer at what I would say now what used to be the 120 the MH that price point is now the 150 so there has been some inflation but there's that Tech is dropped down and you're getting an extremely incredible when I grabb one of my old shoes from you know five years ago and I feel the midsole I'm like how did I run on this yeah but yeah yeah yeah and again that you know because we we have more people in the running space now um we encourage people if you're running your first 5k 10K half marathon there's no need for a racing shoe there's no need for a plate there's no need even for like a TPU like get a shoe that fits well that you enjoy putting on every single day and have fun running all different speeds and distances in that shoe and and just become familiar with yourself your body what's working what isn't working and on your second or third pair of shoe of shoes then you can start to add more Tools in your tool belt as we call it you know start experimenting all right so we're we're talking about entering 2025 now is there anything that you you're really excited about in the upcoming year um well um we're getting a lot of Buzz Renegade is because of La I think because of the work we're doing in and outside of running um because some of our emerging Brands so I'm excited for some of the Partnerships um that we're going to have for 2025 some of the new brands some of the new um projects that we have cooking up so that's exciting like we're becoming more relevant and that's that's exciting because that's a celebration of of like the team here um I have an amazing leadership team I mean I should really pause for a second and say that like there are three folks um on our lead leadership team in addition to myself you know Hannah Mia and Sarah that are like it's like this is like the brain power behind what we're doing um I actually just want to stay on this point for a second because what we've talked about so far and and and and where we're headed and what I'm excited about is only possible because we've set up a structure where we really try to operate you know again like maybe like a design team maybe like a marketing team maybe like a charter school Founders leadership team so it's like we have this leadership team that really leans into each other's strengths creativity we brainstorm like we're a design team um so so so the team at Renegade and the the staff are just like amazing folks um and so that's exciting because this the team that's coales man when you meet them individually collectively when you see their work with Major Brands you're like holy crap did you guys cook that up you know and I do want to say for a second because it's not happen stance it's not last minute it's not just slapped together like we put a lot of time a lot of effort a lot of regular meetings research I mean like there's a lot that goes into what we're doing here um and we don't take any of it for granted so I'm excited about our team and what we have cooking up um um for 2025 um yeah I mean right now the the first thing that I'm excited about just like in runup to the LA Marathon which coincidentally aligns with the Oakland Marathon one week later so we have a bunch of like programming that we're doing um we have this campaign called the rest for La where we're going to support the running Community with all of the things that they need to start and be successful at the marathon besides a training plan so we want to like support the the running Community with the rest of everything else you know so recovery and meditation and I think it's like an art activity that's planned you know just to like forget running for the night you know so it's G to be more of that so that's what we're excited about um I'm I'm working on I'm trying to put together like a small capsule of apparel that reflects the ethos of renegade and that celebrates our running community so I'm I'm excited about that I would say those are two things right off the bat um from a from a product standpoint um I'm always excited about what satisfies is doing their Trail shoe I think is gonna really The Rocker yeah I think it's G to really shake some people up the 005 is also exciting so to have them kind of like battling it out you know in the high fashion polished floor rooms you know of our shops to the dirt it's going to be exciting I've destroyed my o5s already like I wore them to a a concert we actually we actually uh crowd surf Nick at the concert oh nice so yeah which I was surprised he was party to but we had we had again had another nice night of wine drinking yeah yeah yeah that doesn't surprise me actually yeah he's a good time um all right Victor this has been a lot of fun I'm always excited talk to you I think that you're filling a niche in the running uh space that is really useful to the community and it puts a spotlight on what's possible when you follow like not necessarily you know the traditional business plan but like going after being excited about style design with a capital D that kind of stuff and serving your community it it creates something that when people are asking you said what's the formula for community and I said authenticity to a certain degree your uh enthusiasm for beautiful product beautiful people and bringing it all together I think is that uh PowerPoint that people are looking for but it's not something that everybody can can build because you got to have a little bit of taste and style and uh a little background for it but uh I think you're doing a great job and excited to see other other stores find their personality similar to the way that you have at Renegade because I think that this is for me this is the exciting space in running retail thank you so much man I appreciate that that's like a just like a a really great you know capsulation of what we're doing and I appreciate that and um and thanks for you know giving some space and time to run specialty we we don't get it it kind of gets lost in the in the you know in the world of um you know of the running industry so I appreciate that as well and thanks for making the time for us all right Victor we'll check in with you in 2025 and see how that La went sounds great man we hope to see you out in La soon maybe maybe all right take care [Music] [Applause]",

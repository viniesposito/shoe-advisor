  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Robby with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and this is the drop Thomas What's your deal you're I could tell you when you came in the office you're on a down Zone I don't know because I'm even like call you out on the podast I had good I had good uh runs uh this week you're just uh you're just tapped out the Thanksgiving it's day one of a detox too much trip toan oh you're oh I see first day at AA huh yeah just kidding sheesh um not by the way if anyone is it their first day in AA you got this yeah what do they people do that what their first first day uh no like this is the time of year where people start making like and like resolutions and I no we still got like a month for that to happen I think you start I think that one year when I stopped drinking for a few months I did it in December and it was hard but I feel like you just got to rip the Band-Aid off just cuz otherwise if you're like I wait until January then all of a sudden January's here and you're like just like yeah or you're just it's too almost too easy to wait till January everyone's doing it you want to get it over with yeah like Robbie and I are both starting something new this week he's starting tonight yeah wait you are you gonna take a before photo oh I I mean I feel like you have to do it just do it you don't have to share it just do I have a pair of tracksmith briefs do I do I purposely slouch and stick my stomach out to make it look as fat no I say try to look as good as possible CU you'll be like I thought I look good okay and then a year from now you'll be like damn okay yeah that's assuming I would do this for a year yeah are you not committing no I am committing in my mind don't you have to like sign up for a year or is it month to month I think it's like obviously there's a discount if you do it for I think six months is probably will probably be the go-to so I'll do six months I'm gonna I'm GNA say a year like I kind of did that push-ups I'm still doing the push-ups yeah but I like I'm going to do a year of 30 push-ups every day okay and again I started that in December or something before yeah the New Year's like once I decide might as well just do it no that's good we're doing a different kind of we'll commit to a year we're oh yeah we're doing uh I guess we talked about a little bit in on past podcast we won't it involves weights yeah and lifting them and not LIF not lifting cans of beer yeah unfortunately I don't even like beer i' I've learned that about myself I'm not a beer guy yeah it does make you feel kind of bloated and stuff and just generally I used to I mean I still feel like I prefer beer though but I guess like we went to Top Golf yeah and I had beers there for for Thanksgiving or the day after the day after Thanksgiving I went with uh my brother-in-law Ryan yeah who plays golf right and you could tell like when we went but you used to play golf a lot dude I suck so bad you don't have the muscle memory uh like it's not like here was the crazy thing so it h not really um or maybe I just rode a bike really crappily before and yes I still did too but uh I have seen you ride a scooter it's often involves you wrecking it yeah um so it what was kind of fun was there's games at Top Golf so we had all these different games yeah and it was myself Rob James who used to be your neighbor uh Ryan Theo and Henry yeah and I was able to come in second place on every challenge that they had but I only came in second place because the other people we're so bad bad okay I mean that's a win but we did we did beat Ryan in one game yeah this is your brother that he's the brother-in-law Megan's brother who who plays golf on the regular yeah that's good to know well I still think we should do a pram with uh like us and people in the running industry that golf we've talked about this with Joe Rubio from running Warehouse because he always golfs with Craig Engles he's a the pro at something or was and then we're amateurs at pretty much everything in life so I feel like we need to make that happen at some point that's pretty much what's happening to me you brought up the amateur thing yeah I'm hitting the stage in my life where I'm like you always thought you'd Master something I've never quite mastered anything I'm like pretty mediocre across the board yeah and I'm like okay this is me yeah well I mean jack of all trades master of none that's always a compliment I think it's not a compliment that doesn't feel like one yeah isn't a jack a good job to have though like being Court Jester I don't know the Jack and the jester are the same thing I knew this was going to happen I thought a Jack and the jester in the cards was I thought no The Joker Is the jester yeah what is a Jack Jack is like the guy who's probably sleeping with the queen but they don't oh he's just a scoundrel yeah I think he's a scoundrel I thought he was like a friend of like he was a also worked in the same Department as the jester but I guess that's not or he could be like the prince maybe oh Jack Queen I don't know okay Megan is getting pushed out of her chair by Ralphie right now I knew this was gonna happen I maybe maybe we should stop bringing rfie in on podcast days it's a little chaotic um so speaking of J speaking of Jax I didn't really have a transition there but I thought I'd did um you're off the translation didn't go to a casino this weekend but we did gamble oh yeah there we go I knew there's some gambling I did this past week so Robbie texts me which he knew he was fishing with dynamite at this point cuz it's over the holidays there's football on the TV he sends me this link to DraftKings to play which I didn't even really know how it worked there I'm pretty sure there are rules that's or an explanation I knew I knew that you were allotted an amount of money and each player was yeah so the idea was that you pick a fantasy team just of the players playing on Thanksgiving Day yeah so there's eight teams playing that day or whatever six teams and you have so much M money to spend on a salary or whatever yeah and then you can use that for the players did you not spend all your money I did oh did you all of it yeah I at least knew that part okay but I just I you know I kind of just picked whoever I felt like and anyway I was almost dead last in the competition and Robbie won of course yeah I mean it was a good day I have to say that so it was a nice nice little come up for 150 bucks on Thanksgiving Day and then fantasy football oh I was projected to win the entire time yeah like even up until like Midway through the Ravens game I was still like 80% chance of winning I was at 1 Point 90% chance of winning I was playing Thomas's team this week just so you know and I don't know what happened but like I went from 99% chance of winning to losing to Robbie yeah sorry my team only scored 85 points it was pretty bad and Robbie's didn't even clear 100 no pretty the ugliest yeah all around bad poor performances on the fantasy front from the newberger SL Murray crowd it's okay we all made the playoffs so we're good yeah did we fantasy yeah yeah yeah I still have a scratch off in my pocket that I bought on Saturday that I haven't even done yet you could be a millionaire I know we were we were heading up to the Penn State game for me and with some friends and you know feeling good dude that looked horrible looked very cold it was it was cold it was like 24 windy yeah no thank you you were out there the whole time oh I went full full winter gear I had three like three layers on plus a winter coaters uh I did but I had those car heart mittens that I like the best yeah double socks these Hoka sleeping bag boots Hoka what I forget what they're called but I think sleeping bag boots yeah I was I was actually feeling pretty nice and those new balance sheet pants remember those pants yeah I saw I saw you I saw your gear the it I'm telling you I went to one of the Ravens games where it was cold like that and the beer you can't even drink like it's not enjoyable like yeah well what we did I mean we kind of togate for a little bit through the pig skin around so that warmed you up and then we uh and then we went into the stadium and we sat down for maybe half of the first quarter and then we were just like let's just walk around so that kept the blood flowing but yeah it was it was pretty cold the most exciting part of the day was we were we were like on the upper deck too so it was crazy up there but the most exciting part was sometimes the napkins will fly away they would they you you would they would go on forever and you could bet on which one went the further this was the most exciting part of the game I mean it was a blowout the the game was a blowout 317 by I got to say if I was at that game I probably would have been all into the napkin Bing you know what I'm talking about if you see napkins flying from the top of the stadium see how far out they travel there's a lot of action to be had I would be into that yeah more so than Penn State sound like a degenerate Gambler I don't even yeah it's anyways so uh that was but before that you did uh didn't you do a turkey oh Turkey Trot yeah how that go did you guys do one no oh we ran we ran yeah okay it was awesome uh for those listening and those who asked Nick bear did not show up I think he's a little intimidated gotta say definitely I mean I've been talking this up for a while and I'm sure somebody floberg relay it to him and he's decided to step down last minute uh either that or it was the uh the rain it was raining rain here too it was really awful so I don't think he wanted to go one more I think he went to go zero um Ralphie you're crazy and uh the um so it ended up was like 40 and rainy there's two waves so I did the 8:00 wave and my family came to do the 9:00 did you do both I did yeah so the first one I went out and honestly it felt pretty good I just didn't like I didn't even look at my watch I was just like I'm just going to go hard keep within range and uh and you wore the adios Pro 4 yeah the adios Pro 4 which turned out to be I love that shoe I mean I did too like I know the toe box we've seen a lot of bloody to bloody toes I think it's just a little shallow and a little short basically yeah so it ended up we we got uh I just felt good and even the last mile was uphill and it was my fastest mile so I did like splits of basically 634 634 4 628 and uh been just strong which I can't believe that's still like a 20 over 20 minute what is it what do you have to run to be sub 20 like 62 or like 6 uh well the course was also like a tenth of a mile long at least and so official time was 2055 so it probably it was on point like everyone had that on their watches like it's 3.2 miles so I mean there's NE it's never well I mean a 5k is usually pretty pretty straight like turkey trots are all over the lot yeah the crazy thing is is that the last part of it is a straightaway so it's like you just need to move the line up a little bit um no it's probably measured correctly I don't know some people have 3.25 but I feel like it could but if you're weaving in between kids and turkeys and yeah turkeys yeah it's a turkey trbe anyways but the um what was I gonna say did you win any awards I wasn't I was third in my I think I was third in my age group so one of the guys I I met someone who like was a believe in the Run fan he watched the YouTube videos and saw us so I was talking to him he beat me by like 30 seconds he was crazy fast and so we ended up talking and then I did a I did a long run the next day and he came out with me and some other people and he was a cool dude and he lost he said he used to weigh like 325 and I think he lost like 100 lb so he's like an obber dude like he he was Trucking he he crushed me and uh anyway so I think that maybe is it possible that if you had all that extra strain on your heart yeah that once you loosen it up you have this really strong pumping mechanism that's what I was we were talking about cuz I was saying how our friend and reviewer John Uber has his heart rate is always so low and he said the same thing he said said his heart rate's always crazy low and his resting heart rate's like 32 or something so maybe we're doing it wrong maybe we should all get super heavy yeah for and then five years yeah and then lose that weight it'd be like elevation training I mean in a way you're not wrong but that doesn't sound I don't know if that's scientific yeah anyways so that was cool and so my brother ran the 9:00 a.m. rais and my wife and uh and so we I ran with him just thinking oh cuz he doesn't run he plays soccer in in M soccer whatever but he doesn't um he doesn't run and so we kept first mile was chill and then he kept picking it up and I was like I I don't know if you can do this but I can't not run with you so he ended up running the last mile was a 7 minute mile or just under and I was like dude this is right after a hard 5K was not so you did a workout after did another yeah it's like a 20 under 25 minute 5K you did a 10 you did a 10K basically yeah um but it felt good I mean I do like I said I love that shoe it's it's really nice my favorite was the um Megan and I were supposed to have workouts we both had 12 miles on Saturday yeah and both of us decided after being with family and all that stuff that the workout were going to the side yeah and that's fair yeah and our coach called our rod in we both were like he's like how do it go I was like it didn't go yeah it stopped he didn't even respond to me just I think he's like yeah okay we'll just move on I mean yeah it's something to be thankful for I mean I had a a nice uptempo run the next day you were talking about the foam in the um or I don't even know if you're talking about the foam but the pro four foam yeah the shoe that we're going to talk about a little bit later has what I would say is the closest sensation to the pro four foam okay that's cool yeah I so I was maybe going to run in the cloud boom Light Strike or light spray I mean that that shoe that's impossible to get on and I I had a Tuesday night workout in it and that was like at 5K Paces for like th000 M and I I tried so I ran in it but it was like so constrictive at in parts that my foot my left foot just like fell asleep M asked when you said that she's like is that in a good way well no I was like I didn't I didn't even know what that means cuz you said the shoe's insane my foot fell asleep and I was like does this mean he oh I see Li it or he hates it I see what you're saying I did I was like no it sounds horrible yeah it the it also has a really high arch kind of like the alpha fly which I don't do well with and then the The Rocker is pretty nice and it feels aggressive and fast underfoot but yeah like I think because it tries to lock your foot in so well that part like basically at the top of you're getting pinched in the ankle joint I know it just cutting off all the blood flow to well I've seen other people are cutting the shoe and and you know trying to you know customize it yeah um I but I would guess like look that's never it's not a mass production shoe it's not like you're going to sit there and make you know 2,000 pairs of these shoes on on on that thing maybe I mean who knows but I'm thinking that the ideal situation is if you're one of the pro athletes for on they have a mold of your foot yeah and they make a last and that she was sprayed on specifically for your foot right which would make sense in a in a custom thing like that where it just needs to spray over a mold yeah no I mean that's what I assumed that the future of it is but it was the ride and everything else felt pretty cool pretty nice I love that cloud boom Echo what two or three three yeah yeah I thought it was a fun good chew mhm um did that one make you bloody though and it already had that like design that looked like it was Bloody so that it kind of like Blended in with the rest of the shoe I don't know I can't recall if that one did but I I used that one for a 10K last summer or summer ago that was the white one that had the like it looked like bruises on it no I know what you're talking about that was a different one the echo 3 was the one with was just all white what is the one I'm talking about that had strike CL clom strike that's the one I like yeah that's my favorite a good one too on um but yeah I'm really looking forward to that like um Cloud boom Max um yeah yeah some of the stuff want try that pretty good coming out next year all right first check in you know we complain about this weather cuz it's really chilly it's really hard to get out but once you get out man this is fun running weather just you don't get all hot and sweaty it just feels good you stay pumping for some reason my muscles don't ache as much afterwards it's like having a cold plunge without having to stop and sit in cold water all right guys element is still a sponsor of this podcast but for a limited time they're offering their chocolate medley ooh that sounds pretty delicious you know it's not like the you're not going to put that in your bubbly water no you could could you you could uh you want it heated up I think yeah some hot water with either the chocolate mint the chocolate chai or the chocolate raspberry I've heard it's pretty good in coffee too you could also put it in your coffee okay would you do it before your run yeah okay some hot coffee some chocolate medley I do like a mocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also our offer is still available so you can go to element.com thedrop and get a free element sample pack do you know if the sample pack would have this chocolate in yeah oh there you go so go get them and enjoy um we have so many shoes right now it's like the end of the year and deluged I have been running pretty decent miles so I I have I'm ready to write up the premium the vomero the Solomon uh arog Glide 3 which I would say is a really sweet shoe okay haven't run it yet it you know what it reminds me of so it's right in that line of like the Endorphin speed but it doesn't have a plate but it reminds me of the tier shoe um I forget the name of the tier shoe tier uh yeah but it's that same midsole it just has a really nice upper and it's like medium low weight okay and it just felt good I just find it like it is like it's a great shoe I've been running in it too but it's just it's so hard to get excited about that style of shoe now because we're like at least I'm so used to having a carbon plate or I don't know something Jazzy in the mid sole yeah I feel you of foam is it is a really good simple shoe what I think it makes it hard for for me is the other shoes that are like your basic daily trainers cuz if they're over like if you're using some Eva compound and the shoe weighs over 10 ounces and you're kind of in this like Gray Zone of like it's you know a weird spot like I I've been enjoying the vomero and that's what I've been liking about the heavier shoes is when we run in a heavy shoe uhhuh and then I throw on a shoe like this one the Endorphin Elite you feel like you're flying so there may be some logic to maybe training in a heavier shoe that's well protected and then again weight gain training yeah I ran in the Vero 18 what do you think last week um it's nice yeah it's a if if you're tired it might feel a little heavy I don't feel like if it's as heavy as it when I'm running in it it doesn't feel that heavy as it says on the scale well that's the thing I I think that's the new Foams kind of mitigate some of the weight so the Zoomix the balce and also Megan's finally running in the premium cuz she was like got it when she was inas premium and that shoe is heavy but it feels so great Under Foot again like you have a full layer of air under your foot so it's like fun yeah like it's it's hard to then go put on an arrow Glide three from Solomon which is a great shoe but it's hard to just get excited about it cuz it's like feels fine the arog Glide was the one you were just talking about or you talking about the ultra Glide before we're talking about the arog Glide three oh okay yeah um it's it's real basic like if you look at it looks like the if tier had made it it looks the same like the tiar shoe yeah the vomero was pretty nice like I said I did that long run in it and I did a couple other just six mile runs felt pretty good yeah we should get the review up for that I think it's a good shoe all three of us like it yep yeah it's not the lightest I'm actually the the premium and the plus of that like I'm I'm I'm very curious about the premium same very curious but the plus looks really nice yeah definitely like I didn't like necessarily the Pegasus 41 mhm so going up and then we didn't really love the Pegasus plus Fells a little thin underfoot and so now liking the Pegasus PR premium a lot which I'm actually surprised especially because of the weight but it just yeah it feels like the glycerin Max to a certain degree would you agree um in some ways in other ways it feels very different like the Max has got this nice wide platform I feel like the premium is more narrow and maybe a little bit higher stack maybe in the forefoot I don't know okay um so what' you eat for Thanksgiving we always do two turkeys one deep fried one roasted oh I like that little column A colum B business yeah um thank goodness my mom was in town and I pwned off almost all of the cooking to her oh nice yeah but Ryan and I do the deep frying of the turkey turkey but I can't like if you put them side by side I can barely tell the difference between the two huh can you tell the difference um and I also carv both turkeys for the first time oh nice after watching a YouTube tutorial I mean I get it I I would probably do the same thing I would you want to do it right I'm sorry my father's dead and I didn't have anybody to show me how to car well your dad probably wouldn't your dad probably wouldn't carve it anyways maybe my mom car my mom carves it up I and like I'm saying I probably don't know how to carve carve a turkey I didn't that's why I was I was actually watching the YouTube because I thought about doing it and then I was like here you go can't figure this out my dad did carve the turkey but he had he was like from the 70s so he had like one of those um electric knives I thought I just assumed that's what people why don't people still use those I feel like I kind of wanted one yeah cuz like I'll get you one for Christmas yeah it was it was there I don't know if you still can I think oh I'll find it someone is making those surely yeah someone's thrifting those but yeah we did all the traditional stuffing cranberry mashed potatoes roasted potatoes roasted veggies nice um we got an apple pie and a pumpin pie and I have to say the apple pie yeah was Bonkers I loved it oh was that the one from BJ's nice and the Pumpkin Pie was trash did the Ice did the ice cream work out the ice cream was delicious okay and then uh no one noticed it wasn't hog andas no one of course they didn't but I will say I went to the store and since now I was like well it doesn't really matter I saw this Blue Ribbon ice cream or something oh yeah actual trash in a big bucket Blue Bunny no I don't think it is Blue Bunny is it blue bunny I don't know that's another whatever it is it wasn't that good but like so I may or may not have dozed off during the Ravens game uhhuh and I woke up and I thought it was halftime yeah the game was over and I was like where's the ice [Music] cream and yeah nice I like it uh that's cool though what what good food did you have uh pretty much the same deal turkey stuffing do you do any of the cooking uh I didn't this year sometimes I'll make like a side dish but I didn't this year cuz I does your family like hunt the turkey and then eat it like do you have pellets in yours they don't they don't actually it's um it's store-bought but the corn is from the farm so corn sweet potatoes uh mashed potatoes just kind of the general and then desserts I kind of feel sorry for people in other countries that don't have Thanksgiving because we kind of they do like this meal for Christmas yeah we get this meal and then we reup in a couple weeks for another fantastic meal Christmas is basically the same just substitute ham for turkey well Megan and I have done a little tradition if if we are uh like if nobody's over and the boys aren't there we do a steaking cake so we do a filet like and and a crab cake that's a good tradition it is it's really nice because you just sit down delicious meal bottle of wine I don't hate that at all yeah I don't know if that's the case this year or not um but yeah it was good and we did I saw two movies over tell me saw GL or too the state of Hollywood is just absolute garbage right now let me say that as a preface that's so sad I thought that was the name of the movie the state of Hollywood it should be it should be a documentary uh saw Moana 2 yay why does there even need to be a Moana too well I would think the rock needs the money probably it was it was the most mediocre just regurgitated Disney trash I've ever seen hated all of it there are some parts for The Rock was all right he's funny but apparent according to my kids Disney's lost their way oh they did they they just keep recycling the same crap like the music was terrible apparently the show is supposed to be a series on Disney plus and then they just kind of mash it all together into a movie do you know what's crazy have you seen the liveaction what's the blue alien thing Avatar no oh they're doing a liveaction uh dragon that Dragon movie uh how to train the dragon and it looks it looks like the cartoon like you're like why are we doing this the there's not real dragons pull up the trailer and watch it it no it the dragon is obviously CGI but it looks like the CGI dragon in the movie so now you just have a real kid going oh wow they're doing a lot oh they're doing human like a movie not I thought you meant like a Broadway play no they're doing that and then there's a live action one of the Hawaiian blue alien movie oh Lilo and Stitch yeah Lilo and Stitch and I'm again I'm like wait what again I'm like that kind of just looks like the cartoon with people standing oh my gosh this is Disney someone needs to just stop it they needed well is it because rer strike that there's no new like there's got to be new stories are we just done with stories it's because they know it's going to make $200 million in the box office no matter what crap they put out and they just keep recycling the same garbage over and over you saw Lilo and Stitch when you were a kid so now you're the parent you're going to take your kid to see it now you have a reason to do it but the thing that I think is crazy is that we sto telling stories and someone did a thing there like it was he was it was actually like why aren't people making up names like they used to like uh like or sayings like um like I don't know come up with any of the saying from like the uh 1940s and stuff oh like you mean like you you mean like things they say in the [Music] South not like things like uh that are funny like tallywhacker or scall wag you know these different things that you used to like insults that you would call people it's like there's no new nobody's coming up with new like slang like that and even I mean if you talk to I mean I guess isn't Riz basically that no that's that's a short for short for Charisma but it's still like a I mean skib is definitely slang no one know skib is I don't think I'll give you skib I don't think that's going to carry on for Generations though yeah that' be insane if it in 100 years people are still referencing that yeah I'd have to give you it was it was a funny meme that I saw and the guy went through all these words I see what you're saying he was like what happened there the storytelling aspect is gone because no one wants to take that risk of building a new franchise um so it's just they know they can make any Marvel movie is going to make whatever a few hundred million dollars they might as well just keep pumping it out but so I did see Gladiator 2 as well you didn't like that one either oh no here's the deal I approached it from the from like this is a brand new movie don't care about the other one cuz it's been so long since I've even seen that it's my the first one's Kimmy's favorite movie though is a great movie yeah and so I was just like I just want an action movie don't really care about the rest and I thought it was generally fine in that way if you have any feelings for the first one and want to see a continuation of that you're going to be incredibly disappointed um Denzel Washington is just a guy from training day he's literally the same person just in in another role okay it even ends the exact same way as sorry spoiler I was surprised he didn't say it honestly actually the guy behind me said it okay cuz they were talking the whole time during the movie and interjecting their comments which sometimes was funny sometimes wasn't when they were using homophobic slurs to describe the two Emperors like or whatever I was like yeah probably cut that out and and uh so it was I don't know it I it also follows the plot of the first one like exactly it's pretty much the exact same thing see that's what got me upset I you know obviously I have an emotional attachment to Star Wars it was something that I grew up with loved it new story and then they redid the Star Wars and it was like wait the same they're going to blow up a death star yeah oh they're like it's the exact same story and you're like wow this is crazy yeah and right there's no creativity yeah was it just as like gory and bloody cuz we watched Gladiator the original this week it was yeah yeah there and I was like I had forgotten how much blood and there's a good deal of that well Ryan and I were going to go see it we ran out of time okay it just wasn't there wasn't time for it yeah um top golf the aquarium oh yeah we went went to the aquarium we reup our members because to take eight people what it cost the same is like to do a annual membership so if you want to go to the aquarium Carl you could be my kid we can go and uh we can run around the aquarium that's awesome and of all the things so I tell our nephew that he can pick out a toy at the like I'm the gift shop I'm Uncle Thomas yeah I want to be the guy that he's like oh I anything is mine so you're like go into the gift shop you can get any yeah anything you want and which by the way their gift Shop's pretty awesome there I have to say what aquarium themed object do you think he would have gotten from the aquarium oh anything that three and a half he wanted to get three and a half like a not a stuffed animal I'm guessing it started with I thought he was going to be going home with a snake and I was like really cuz it looked like one of those Carnival snakes you're like I'm going to spend $35 on yeah you know one of those trash snakes was it like a dump truck or something yes sure was was it that's the he was he was running around the entire gift shop with it just like sprinting and uh apparently he had gone to an aquarium in Charleston a year before and picked out the same toy and he was told no and it was like whole thing so that's what we got I don't understand I thought the same thing when my kids were there I'm like why is all this non aquarium toys in the aquarium and that's why also his favorite aspect of the aquarium was the revolving doors that we got to go through I mean the escalators yeah so that was the best part that's we literally could have taken him to a mall yeah when my kids went to Disney a couple years ago the favorite part was winning like the carnival game that you can play at literally any Carnival just the one where you just throw try to knock a bottle over whatever and uh and the other one was like a ride that was like a fair it was like the dumbest rides and then whatever I have only cost $300 I love going to the aquarium I like the animals the general smell in there is not good can't handle the fish I'm not I don't even know if it's the fish smell I think it's also the people smell uh yeah there's a heavy algae presence whether on skin or on land on SE people got to learn not to block the entire exhibit people this is the and I I know what you're saying the more I get older the more I'm just I understand why the people don't want to go out in public anymore it's like the things that probably didn't bother me before they just added up over the years like silt and sediment on the ocean floor of my heart and just eventually I don't want to when I went to the see Gladiator there's the guy talking behind me the whole time yeah dropping his keys 45 times in the span of 2 and a half hours why why do I need to do this I could just just watch it at home and it'll be fine well that's when you went to the Penn State game and and my other friend has Ravens tickets and I was like when it when it was really cold when the Ravens were playing mhm and you'd probably get an Eagles fan next to you mhm last time I went there they tried to remove a guy for vaping and then he ended up yeah making a stand oh yeah for I'm just like don't blame him you know my couch is nice it's warm inside there's food yeah that's not $25 for a side of chicken tenders exactly um yeah I get it all right second checkin as you're starting to build up mileage you're probably doing grit if you're listening to this podcast most definitely doing grit if you're doing grit make sure that you're starting to you know slowly increase your mileage now just getting a little bit extra if you're starting it even the low amounts 25 just make make sure you're getting out the door and kind of getting warmed up before you get into the challenge you want to hit this healthy all right guys let's talk about our sponsor Lagoon pillows all right let's do it we've been using them for years now still my favorite pillow ever and now's a great time to gift a pillow do you ever remember sleep without a lagoon pillow under your head I mean when we travel and it's not great yeah I I felt like the last hotel we were at it was almost like someone rolled up some socks and put it in the pillow to give it the stuffing socks and rocks yeah yeah well if you want a really great pillow you can go to lagons sleep.com believe there is a quiz right on that page just hit the button fill out your information say what you like what you don't like and it'll populate the perfect pillow for you and if you use the code believe at checkout you can also save the the aquarium that's why if we do go to the aquarium or try to go like right when it opens or on a weird time because no one wants to deal with that well that's what I used to do with the boys uh when they were young we would go there because they' basically just run through the building and we'd be done they just want to get a piece of pizza at the end I I have to say too what they're doing to the Dolphins there I hate it it's doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense that there are dolphins there but and they're playing with them when people aren't watching they refus to do a dolphin show this has been what 10 years at this point yeah so the Dolphins don't get to play or have fun they do though do they so when the audience isn't there when the aquarium's close cuz they they need interaction they're in a tank they need to be interacted with they need to have challenges they need to be stimulated so when the when they humans aren't there they play all the games and have them jumping through all the stuff and doing all the tricks and the whistleblowing and all that stuff and they're doing all that stuff it's when we get there that they're like okay just watch them swim it doesn't make any sense just the F logic I also feel like the Dolphins want to show off a little bit oh of course they're Dolphins they're the coolest animals in the ocean yeah well apparently they're also pretty bad oh like they like my son Rob liquor stores and stuff yeah they're they're pretty aggressive in a lot of different ways dolphin prisons blow holes are getting filled okay I got you there's they bully each other there's apparently really un what you uh non consensual yeah non-consensual activities okay so I mean I don't know can you I yeah I guess they can't talk they probably could say a no is a no underwater they want it to well I think what it is it's it's more like maybe a few dudes oh really that kind of stuff gez yeah all right well maybe I could this be the third episode that we bring up Diddy party maybe there's yeah Diddy and dolphins two peas in a pod two pe's in doph you got the idea for the baby oil I don't know um yeah so anyways the the aquarium's cool what oh yeah Gladiator just I don't know I don't think it's maybe maybe he w't watch it when it comes out we watched a really good movie last night oh yeah was it a lifetime or Hallmark Christmas yeah it was right up there it was on par yeah it was the new Lindsay Lohan holiday movie okay what was it called okay uh it was called our little secret our little secret and here's here's the craziest thing sounds so we sit down and I haven't seen the movie I haven't seen anything but the opening scene I go oh oh you know what's gonna happen yeah I'm like this is what's GNA me's like no I don't see that me what happened I mean yeah it was pretty no spoilers on the Lindsay Lohan Christmas movie I spoiled the entire of Gladiator 2 let's hold back on that one yeah a couple gets a no one's watching the Lindsay load movie couple splits up in the beginning of the movie and oddly they're going to be back in each other's space somehow and I I have to say I don't know what it is but I am kind of a sucker for the Hallmark Lifetime movies really the Christmas ones I don't understand why but when they come on trash I absolutely love them I I I think it's this like the romcoms yeah like I think it's this idea of this Christmas Town that doesn't exist but that I want to exist like when I see a when you go to a train garden it has like those little towns I'm like I want this to be a real thing but I don't think it is anywhere there there is one of those like behind the business podcast where they talk about the rise of the Lifetime movie and why those came into existence and the production all that the weird thing for me was Lindsay Lohan at one point was gonna be the biggest star in Hollywood right parent it' be like Zenia right now yeah she was huge and imagine Zenia in 10 15 years doing a Hallmark movie I mean I don't think we expected Britney to be on Instagram Dancing Yeah that's a treat though that was like who could have predicted that greatness yeah I watched Herby the Love Bug a couple weeks ago and that was pretty good Lindsay Lohan movie I got to say I was pretty I don't think I've seen that yeah I mean kind of know the premise of it okay so a movie we did watch which we watch every year which is really good the holiday oh yeah I haven't se I haven't seen that is that worth watching it's so good it's the best Christmas movie Thomas's take I disagree I think it's I think it's enjoyable and it's pleasurable to watch but it doesn't compete with um elf elf and what's the Love Actually is got to be my if you're going to talk about a love M Life movie that one's the best okay that little kid drumming at the end yeah for the girl the I've prime minister I've actually never seen Love Actually okay watch Love Actually and the holiday and then report back okay all right dude the fact that you haven't seen Love Actually I know it's just one of those things that I never got around your soul isn't complete are you going to watch that um Tailor Swift Travis Kelce Lifetime movie they made is that true is that a real thing there's yeah there's a movie that's based off of their he's like a football player and it's in Kansas City it's not wait a dramatization It's a drama yeah it's oh yeah yeah but it's a lifetime movie you said you love the Lifetime movies I would watch it I would watch it do you know that right now at McDonald's you can get the Happy Meal toy is a little piano and they come with little cards that are Taylor Swift songs and you can learn to play the Taylor Swift songs on the little piano you should get it for the boys and have them take it in in class though they will get straight AIDS from their teacher oh teacher doesn't take everybody to McDonald's and get the key no I don't think they're this round of teachers is cty in that way uh We've switched yeah I think they're in between years so that's been kind of nice I think we saw your kid out in the Park yesterday yeah um on recess or something oh probably with through through your binoculars no we were driving down Eastern a okay and then we're like yeah I think that's one of them sounds about right um what was I gonna say about the oh I bought the Home Alone Lego set you did oh you did get it yeah I finally caved in my heart desire another Christmas movie I would watch that's the best Christmas movie that one pretty good that's my favorite for sure I could watch that a 100 times we just saw the woman that's in that um what's her name make that was also in uh shitz Creek oh who's the mom yeah any I always forget her name do you know it Carl all right anyway we we saw her she looks fantastic yeah like she could be doing another and they asked her about Kevin oh nice and uh you know McColly Cookland yeah she had nice things to say and was happy for him and his wife and their children I got to say you really could become a m Catherine O'Hara oh yeah sorry he could have become crazy messed up he's held it together I think he did get a little messed up for a while for a little bit his brother was fantastic in succession yeah I mean time I tried to start liking him he would do something so ridiculous that you're like okay there was a lot of awful characters in that yeah drama there was it was very hard to you would start to like one and start going uh towards that character yeah and then you Unfortunately they would do something that would be yeah yeah they were all a little troubled kill it for you yeah I never um ended up watching that oh you should good dude we should just make you a list you should shut down between now and New Year just too much to do he's too busy watching Moana too oh that was I can't believe you got sucked into that how that my brother had bought wanted to take my like the nieces and nephews and stuff I could see and so he kind of just bought 10 tickets or whatever and I was like might as well go and take a nap which I did take a nap in it um was it even more musical they had this real nice seats that Lounge back the whole way so I had I had a couple little five minutes naps in there that were kind of nice yeah so I didn't hate that at all and by the way this is a thing now I guess people just bring blankets to the movie theater and act like it's their house no like so many people even the normal theater where I saw Gladiator people that don't have the lean back seats people are bringing blankets and stuff I'm like what is this see that I also think this is the problem with like airplane travel yeah people come like it's their living room well they give you blankets on the airplane yeah but I'm saying people show up in pajamas yeah and are like like we've talked about it ridiculous it's gone too far uh anyways but the um would you like to talk about this shoe what's happening no I'm just I'm just showing you something I'm noticing look at the heel like it's flat not flat oh interesting I think this is a problem um any let's see if there's anything else we had to mention oh the only other thing I wanted to mention when we were talking about Thanksgiving dinner was we had my uncle was over who's my dad's brother wait your uncle is your dad's brother well it could be my mom's brother could be um and he that was a good David Spade laugh by the way uh it turns out that he's raising a family of raccoons basically which when you said raising a family like I I was getting worried there no he's do you mean a gaze of raccoons yeah a whole gaze of raccoons because I guess their mom was coming up to his back porch and this is dude this is out in Pennsylvania people just do weird stuff so don't be judging for him feeding are you are you going to get a baby raccoon feeding the raccoon hot dogs but he would make the raccoon dance for a hot dog and then he I want a video of this I think there is one I'll find it and then he ended up like the mom got hit by a car but dancing she had already had six baby raccoons and she's a r she's a rockar they just started coming over to his house like to the back porch to be to stay alive I guess that would be you realize he created a raccoon strip club the mom was coming dancing for hot dogs yeah Mom gets killed now the baby babies are coming she was a little too a little too uh putting herself out there too much Crossing why did the raccoon cross the road to get to the hot dog on the other side yeah and uh so I guess now he just has this he's spending like 50 or $75 a month just on feeding raccoons what does he feed them raccoon feed yeah just whatever he buys trash yeah can't he just leave the trash out like that's what I thought I leave the off like instead of taking it out our trash this morning there was so much turkey stuff and and B and leftovers I was trying to tell him this is going to get out of control really quickly if you don't six raccoons yeah yeah also they're not going to be able to make it out in the world we're going to see him on the news a bear is going to come because it's going to find out from the raccoon that there's a man feeding stuff why would the bear did you bring them to Thanksgiving no they're not they just Co up to the they're not like he doesn't keep inside the house they're just kind of he's their primary primary uh caregiver I guess so he's basically their stepdad it is it is like a little strip club yeah I mean honestly I was thinking in my head could I take one could I sneak one down to Baltimore and would it would I be able to keep that a secret yeah from Hill well you wouldn't be able to keep it a secret but you get it down here you could live here could I keep it in my house and keep it a secret yeah from your kids and wife you could put it on the back porch here not from my kids and my wife just from General repu cuz I don't want the government coming and take it from me like that that happened to that one guy with the what what did they kill a squirrel in AAC squirrel yeah wait you're not allowed to own them not in Maryland they euthanized his squirrel right in front of them well it wasn't right in front of him but they did euthanize it speaking of squirrels we were at the park they did kidnap it though several times this beds week what's that we were at the park several times this week and the squirrels have gotten so fat yeah they're they're ABS there needs to be a one day of hunting in the park for squirrels no I they're not I like the lazy you can approachable squirrels they're yeah they're not even scared of you like they were like walking up to us like looking for food it's unnatural I like the video of the guy who is feeding a bear and like that thought that was a good idea yeah immediately you could see in the Bear's eyes he's like oh if he's got food let me find the rest of it and it just mauled the dude oh I haven't seen that skipped the food and went right after the dude J that's why they tell you not to feed those things yeah probably not a good idea I think you I mean you probably could feed a squirrel but imagine how much if you get rid of all the deer in Drew Hill Park one day of H one day of Baltimore hunting wait deer in Druid Hill squirrels in Patterson Park you probably feed like the whole homeless popul population in Baltimore for a day you'd Fe you'd feed unhoused people um squirrel I mean I would I mean it's I guess not plenty of people in appalache eat squirrel and survival and it's fine they're do they're doing fine up there yeah but like the deer especially in Druid Hill that's out of control I don't think you can use Appalachia as an example of thriving I mean I don't know like think about other stuff that's going on up there well I mean they're alive that is true it is they're surviving on food yeah but whatever I mean as let them destroy the deer I agree with you the deer for sure no I'm just kind of joking on squirrel but I honestly do think the deer I mean if you mix if you ground it up mix some squirrel in with the deer nobody gosh yeah maybe but the but for real like the deer have you have you ever been in the back of drood Hill Park it's crazy yeah there's so many deer and they're getting hit by cars and whatever well that's that's the hunting in Baltimore it's a cars yeah it's like a Honda Civic every once in a while takes one out yeah but that's sad it's way worse F to get smashed by a car did you see there was a Turkey Trot where the deers ran onto the um course and actually hit some people and knocked them down really yeah that man that'd be a wild time just out running your 5K yeah I they look cute and stuff but I'll bet you when they hit you that's like getting hit pretty hard well it's a couple hundred pounds coming right at you it's got to be like 300 400 lb when I was like 200 when I was in high school the lower end two 200 250 one like ran into the side of our car on my side and I was in the passenger seat and like I just saw saw it coming and like the whole thing like and I like felt the window come in and like his nothing broke and like the door just popped right back out but like his whole like they're so much bigger than you think and it it hit the side your car yeah and then just like popped off and ran off I've always been amazed I've never hit a deer back in Pennsylvania because I would always drive late at night and there's deer everywhere I mean much everyone my put deer whistles on their cars what happened to that uh I think some people still do okay what's a deer whistle the these little plastic things you can stick on your car that as you're driving it makes a high pitch noise that the people don't necessarily hear but the deer here that's it's pretty smart I have to say though the deer and headlights thing is real and yeah that's a craziest thing they just stand there yeah freeze wild what is that they're they're probably is that someone I know that's that's not it final checkin um we should be cold we should be getting ready for grit we should be slowly building up that mileage the other thing to remember is a good pair of gloves a Good Hat good you know I hav been running in regular sweatshirts lately it's fun you should give that a try but just stay in cozy and getting out the door makes all the difference uh find your temperature it's going to be a 31 days of January you're going to want to know how to hit the temperatures that you want out on the run if you have any questions about that you can hit it up in the Facebook group or ask people with experience of what temperature requires what clothing you might get some different answers Robbie can go out in a long sleeve t-shirt and that's about it where I'd prefer to have a little something to break the wind so maybe a light jacket on top of that for those colder days and then yeah gloves and a hat you can always pull off your gloves if you start getting warm all right see you next week okay let's talk about these shoes yeah all right yeah it's time so M these are the socky Endorphin Elite 2 all three of us the first pair we got we got early pairs of the elite one none of us really liked him you were probably the most closest to like him I liked it I just thought the the foam was a little firm and we were the only people who thought that yeah and like kzi everybody else was like no it's pretty soft and we thought maybe we were crazy Robbie do you remember that yeah and so I retried those and I was like no it's the foam's not right so we were wondering if maybe they did like an inline change or change the foam somehow but it it wasn't squishy this one is extremely squishy like like probably the squishiest foam in the game right now for a a trainer that I can think of which I feel like sometimes cannot be great for race day but in this case you've worn it now for almost 20 mil so what's I I love it I think this is the closest foam that I would compare it to is the pro four foam but this just feels like a higher stack even though I think it's just like 40 mm and an 8 mm drop yeah I think that's correct um so what's that 32 in the in the 4 foot it feels great and it feels really light on the foot the upper looks kind of wonky when it's not on like the like I thought oh this heel is not going to work uhhuh but the fit of it really nice it does have a secondary Loop if you want to do like the lock down lacing which is kind of unusual in a race stue but I found my 10 and a half fits really really well Megan you tried your pair on I was going to run it this morning but and I had a pretty thick pair of socks on cuz it's very cold here and it was very short so I'm going to try again when I'm wearing uh less cushy socks and hope that I can fit my foot in them what what's kind of neat about it is it has you see the tongue how when you have it through the one lace down lower it's like folded down uh but if you were going to do the heel lock you can fold the tongue up and have that protect the top of your ankle which you were complaining about with right the other shoe but yeah like we're in the middle of Thanksgiving I'm not exactly in Peak Fitness after eating and drinking all weekend but like Sunday I did an 8 Mile running these and it just I just felt like it leans you towards picking up the pace so even though I wasn't like pushing hard I was running about a minute and a half faster than normal okay in the shoe and then I was like but you said it doesn't feel as great running easy like it feels much better when you're running faster I think that's part of it is like it's a because of foam squishy the heel feels a little unstable like when you're walking in it the heel definitely feels like it's mushing all around and and everything like that but when you get up and you start going through your stride the foam actually firms up a little bit but still bouncy when you're going a little bit faster and then I I wanted to you know just see if like I liked it um so I I put it back on today and again just felt like it was easy to kind of like I wasn't trying to like run hard yeah but it was easy to do like faster Paces just kind of moving along all right I haven't thrown on the scale you want to throw it on the scale there Robbie yeah see this is a men's 10 and a half yeah all right so ounces 7.75 it's not bad yeah 220 gram yeah not bad and I not bad I think the price point is staying the same right 275 so this is like their premium race St shoe just slightly above the pro four and what I thought was interesting we were like okay is this going to be you know for somebody running like I think we even mentioned like yeah is this meant for like the 230 Marathon or is this for anyone and um the team there said that this shoe was designed for anyone from the 2hour marathon to the 5-Hour marathon it's just if you want the quote premium experience and I do think that they are correct in the fact that there's elements of this that remind me of like the New Balance uh SC Elite where it has it it feels like it has that wider platform it's definitely not stable people were asking if it was stable I wouldn't call it stable I also it didn't seem particularly wide like I didn't have to cinch up the laces too much it it's funny because it looks wide it does but I guess that's maybe the base platform that's that's so wide which should help with stability a little bit and it looks like off foot like look at it this looks all walk you know the top of your hand with the c Elite Wade yeah it's like 8.5 okay so about an ounce heavier that feels insanely soft right I was almost worried like did like you can squish these down so that when you're walking in it I will say it feels unstable when you're walking in it and also Al felt like around corners it's okay but it's not the most stable okay and the trainer the new film is called incred run which makes no sense why it's incredible running experience worst name for a shoe film I've ever heard uh I mean they're running out of names at this point um yeah doesn't mean it doesn't make sense it's like if it would rhyme with Incredible it would make sense but incred run doesn't need even it's [Laughter] just D think about think about all the legal people involved with the naming of that they probably had to just settle with something it's called Power run Pro or something it was the other one was power run plus right yeah but this got confusing because then it was power run HG power run PB yeah oh I mean you're already pot committed might as well just keep going with it yeah but this is the quote Next Generation foam so they got to distinguish it well yeah they're really I mean we look at as6 and they flight foam plus flight foam turbo flight foam blast plus it's just yeah it just keeps going Max yeah I mean that's fine cred run what what are you where do you go from that what's the next version in credit run Plus in credit run blast incred a Sprint credit dumb all right so the doesn't that heel remind you of the old school new bals like 1080s look at the heel though this one there seems to be a defect in these see how that one's flat and this one is not wait what see the heel um how this one's smooth circular and that one goes PL oh this has a yeah it just looks like it got like I don't know increda smashed yeah yeah maybe a this is weird yeah I have to say though like between this and the Pro 4 Adidas Pro four these are probably my two favorite all right uh right now and I would like I know we probably haven't updated our uh home page for our site I guess we'll have to wait till you and Megan get some miles in these um but I think that you guys are going to agree I think that this one defitely takes a spot deserves a spot I ran in the cuz I was going to run in this shoe this morning but my neighbor has the box cuz it got delivered when I wasn't home and so I just grabbed the deodora gar carbon cuz I dude I I love that shoe it's a great shoe is heavier though it's is it that much he it's not that much heavier though it's eight something for yours for your 10 and a half yeah so it's about an ounce heavier than this okay yeah I don't know I the fit of the upper or what it is but it's a great shoe what I kind of wish on that one though is it had a little more to Spring like this one definitely has a little more aggressive toe probably true um but yeah I do love it it's definitely I'm wearing the nucleo 2 right now so the one guy who always runs at 5K that I run in and I gave he his name is Scott He coaches cross country at my where I went to high school and uh so I gave him a bunch of like our old running shoes like more of like the faster stuff that aren't walking shoes or whatever so but I was talking to him and he works part-time at a running store near there uh I think it's called like inside track or something and he said that the the diodora nucleo is like one of their top selling shoes and they're not even a fleet Fe like they're not a fleet feed either why did he did you ask him why like I don't I should have I could find out but yeah he said that the nucleo and the V like they all do really well that's one of their top sellers this the nucleo is it's good I like a lot about it I think that some of the other color ways that I've seen are a little more interesting than this blackon black yeah um the foam is pretty simple and like this is one of those ones like when Megan was talking about it's hard to get too excited like I feel like this one's it's definitely a doable running shoe yeah the one knock against this one I'd have is the rubber on the bottom just doesn't feel it doesn't have the right feel like stickiness it's not sticky it's more waxy okay and it just doesn't it doesn't add to the overall feel of the of the shoe all right so that would be my knock on it other than that the fit is good good and even though the foam's pretty basic it's it feels good this one's not made in Italy but it's it's a pretty decent shoe I think it's it's right there with anything else that you'd put out like in yeah in that middle area that's like the it's better than the Pegasus 41 yeah yeah but nice yeah um I think that was all I had to say about that what we didn't say CU for some reason we always forget winter grid uh that was pretty awesome yeah we only have a few spots left for Smalls and extra small so if you know some people that don't want large yeah uh sweatshirts but I mean we much we pretty much sold out in four hours but the Smalls and extra Smalls it's all unisex so like if you're a lady or a smaller guy you can still get in yeah and you should I mean uh or you could give the sweatshirt to a friend yeah it's going to be so embroidered front and then it's a screen printed back and I think it's going to I think it's going to be a banger yeah and the and the the cap I can't wait the cap people are excited about it as they should be so lots of action in the Facebook group and other stuff uh people are stoked M's been wearing the old green knit cap this weekend okay and I have to say she looks pretty cute is it nice it's a good cat that's a good endorsement are do you have are you going to run a certain amount of mileage you have any I mean I'm real excited so over this year uh I've run more miles than I did last year oh even with some of the injuries that I had this year okay I've already passed the 2000 Mark wow so now I'm just uh picking up I think I'll probably end up around 2,200 for the year really yeah man that's I I don't think I'm anywhere close to that and I think that my January training should probably be around 250 so I put in I want to do the 200 miles 200 okay how do you find out how much you run go to your yeah and then where you have the oh I only run like, 1400 miles you better catch up what I don't you got to run 600 between now and 2025 I'll do it yeah no big deal yeah you could do that double grit this month I think that's pretty accurate Sometimes some of my runs don't get up loaded to straa but that's got to be pretty close yeah I mean let's see 1400 that sounds about right man you run 50% more mileage than me I run a lot how do you like running that much sometimes I do sometimes I don't right now I do I don't know about you but this these these temps and this weather makes running feel easier yeah it's hard to get out the door except for the wind the wind is the only oh yeah the wind but otherwise great yeah cool CHS are nice but like this morning it was 23 there wasn't any wind and when I first got out there it was a little shocking yeah and then you know you start rolling and I was like it actually makes me run faster cuz I want to heat up that's the thing I'm always it's the first mile is supposed to be a warmup I'm like dude I'm like this is my Fast Pace cuz I'm trying to just warm up like actually warm up actually I think I did a really good agression this morning like it went I it should look pretty like good I will say I was wearing like all black with a you know like a neck warmer on my no across my face you're the neck warmer guy and uh yeah I'm 100% it's like the best thing ever I'm do you not wear one I do when it's when it gets really cold I I start to wear it even for your face your face gets face gets so cold put it over my face I usually just use it like where the jacket to like insulate where the jacket and the neck meet yeah make through one on the other day I did I saw one in the laundry room oh I used it as a headband okay I to me I'm just like the nice it keeps your face warm for the first mile or two and then I take it off you know or put it on my neck but it's nice especially on Windy days but all I that to say I was running with that on and had like a like a hoodie Style over my head and people thought I was coming up to Rob them left and right there's definitely comments in the Facebook groups about some random dude in all black there's a kid well there's a I was I was running behind are you kidding yeah I don't know okay no there probably is I was running behind a kid who was on his way to school like uh over by Patterson high school and he definitely like got off the sidewalk and went the other direction like completely out of his way to avoid me cuz I knew cuz it looked he didn't know looks like you're it looks like everybody who jumps people in Baltimore yeah which kind of is cool I forgot to say the shoe behind us is the Endorphin trainer which was the convar pro but now it's called the Endorphin trainer I did get I do have that in my house they didn't s me yet oh you know what wait I don't even have the I don't know why I did end up getting my shoes after the run I didn't get the Endorphin leite you were the only two that have it what

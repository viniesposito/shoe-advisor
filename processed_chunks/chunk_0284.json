  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the Nike zoomfly [Music] 6 so zoomfly 6 is the six version of the zoomfly a shoe that's had a slightly up and down history the early models were pretty good shoes they were the original training partner shoes the ones that you'd use in partnership with the vaporfly second one was a plated trainer for the first time and since then the line has gone off the rails a little bit the shoes have got progressively heavier and less speedy and less suited to really any kind of running I'd associate with a super trainer but the zoomfly 6 aims to put that back on track with the changes made all looking very good on paper you know have a lighter shoe it's got more zoom X foam in it that's the classic zoomx foam not the recycled material used on the zoomfly 5 and all around it looks much more like a plat super trainer in line with the best on the market things like the hok ma X2 so endorphin speed 4 New Balance SC Trainer V3 like hopefully this is going to be a competitive shoe and spoilers it is a competitive shoe I really like this shoe uh we're going to go more into the detail of that during the rest of the review but yeah I think Nike's knocked out the park with this shoe I've really loved running in it it cost \u00a3155 or $170 which is pretty good for a super trainer these days a lot of them are now edging quite near or even above2 200 and it also weighs about middle of the pack for a super trainer as well it's 266 G or 9.4 o in UK size 9 which is a US size 10 it has an 8 mm drop and a stack height of 42 mm at the heel 34 at the 4ot comes to the design of the the shoe you've got a two layer woven mesh upper you know it feels like quite a lot of material but it is a very comfortable upper something I've definitely noted on the run for sure got a fair bit of support at the back with an internal heel counter bit of padding around the heel not too much on the tongue though then you got a two- layer midsole with a top layer being made from zoomx Pham this is not recycled zoomx like we have seen on some Nike shoes this is the original stuff the good stuff which is a peber based foam that is lightweight bouncy all the things you expect from a top foam and underneath you have a layer of sr2 carrier foam which is a bit more mysterious in terms of makeup but it's basically there to bring a bit more durability and stability to the shoe with that zoomx layer above it running between those layers of foam you have a full length carbon plate which is not quite as stiff as the plates on Nike's Racing shoes but still gives you that kind of propulsive feeling and stabilizes this High Midol stack you have a couple of side cutouts and one on the bottom as well to reduce the weight of the shoe a little bit and then you've got a rubber out soole covers the for foot and two sections at the heel got a typical outsole setup for a speed Focus shoe like this with Nike's waffle p on [Music] there comes to the fit of the zoomfly 6 it's been really good for me in my normal size got a uk9 here which is a us10 with Nike across Nike's range this is the size I pretty much always used and it's always worked for me and it certainly works for me in the zoomfly 6 it's maybe a little bit more dialed in around the toes than with of more everyday training Focus Shoes like the Pegasus or the Invincible or the Vero something like that you might get a little bit more space but it's not been too dared in for me I haven't had any problems with my toes hitting the front of the shoe or any rubbing around there in fact in general it's been a really comfortable upper for a super trainer the comfort of this upper is notable because it's a speed Focus shoe and it is a fast shoe but you actually do get a kind of daily trainer level of comfort here which you does make it that little bit more enjoyable to use at slower Paces as well so yeah all around the fit was very good and I would stick to your normal size with Nike or running shoes in general so I've run 112 km in the zoomly 6 now mostly doing pretty long run runs in the final stages of my marathon training ahead of the Valencia Marathon like done a fair mix of sessions in it like so mostly all my runs I'd say have involved some kind of fast running at the end or as intervals and also some easy running pretty much so I've done a nice variety of Paces in the shoe and I did an awful lot with it in the first few days I had it so across a 4day stretch in the shoe I did my first run in it which we have a video up on the channel about where I did a a track session running 10 times one Mar reps progressively quicker reps from 530 mile down to 5 minute Ming then the next day I took it out for a steady 90minut run so that's steady for me with my coach is kind of you know an effort a controlled effort it's not quite Tempo Pace but it's you know it's a decent effort so he running pretty quick on that as well took the Monday off this shoe and used a different shoe for an easy run and on the Tuesday I did a really hard progression running it doing 45 minutes with the last 15 minutes of that being at 325k pace so in that 4-day stretch I did three runs in the shoe of over 70k in total and it really impressed me each time one thing that definitely stood out is how comfortable the shoe is for a plated trainer a super trainer like this like it's got the speed which will'll come on to but the thing that stands out is its comfort so it's a really nice shoe to pull on it's a shoe that feels really good on cool downs and warm-ups you know and then feels comfortable on long hard runs as well like the upper is a big part of that but the underfoot feel is really nicely done where you still feel fast it doesn't feel ponderous at all but do get a lot of comfort and support and you know using it for those three hard runs in four days like it really protected the legs well it bounced back well from those and all around just really enjoyed it on that front and then like I say it has the speed like this has definitely not been the case with a zoom Fly Shoe over the past last couple of generations like it's not a shoe that feels really Nimble and agile like some in this category like the sakon Endorphin speed 4 but it's a shoe that just delivers a lot of Bounce propulsion and really helps you to dial into paces and hold those Paces so I was doing those mile reps on the track and it felt great in the first kind of nine when I was doing you know more relaxed Paces down towards my half marathon pace like I say 530 per mile 525 a mile 520 a mile doing an allout mile at the end of that when I ran around five minutes was a bit tougher in the shoe because yeah that's when you want a slightly nimbler feeling shoe but you know still did it and it still moves really well and then on that steady run the next day like that was one of the best runs of my whole training block where you I was running to effort to feel like I was trying to keep my heart rate you know fairly low and just make sure I wasn't getting out of breath or anything like that and the pace coming out was you know surprisingly good for me and really enjoyable and just the Run felt great and the whole run I kept wondering oh I'm going to start flagging a bit is this shoe going to stop feeling great but no it felt amazing I do think it's got the chops to be you know a lower cost alternative Marathon shoe for lots of people you know for a run like that where where I was ding not not far off my marathon pace but you know not at any kind of race Pace but still running you know fairly quick and it just felt really enjoyable comfortable again protected the legs felt great the progression run probably showed the limits of its speed for me where like I say the last 15 minutes I was running uh like 325 a k pace so that is around my marathon pace my go marathon pace with Valencia you know few hard runs over the course of the days befor hand and the shoot just started to feel a bit big for me then like still did the Run completed the run two plan and you know has that in if you want your training shoe to do all your training runs it can do them but that's the kind of run where as someone with a high Cadence High turnover I gent prefer just a Nimble lighter feeling shoe like even though you're getting loads of Bounce from the shoe just feel at more Flatout race Paces I like that lightweight feel to a shoe which you get from some of the super trainers like the Mac X2 or the Endorphin speed 4 which have that slightly more lightweight feel but you know all around the shoe felt really good throughout those three sessions I've used it since then for a couple of progression runs done a 22k progression run in there and then a shorter one as well and yeah it's just always delivers the good and it's showe I really look forward to pulling on which is definitely not the case with the previous models which were kind of get through the testing you know hasn't really worked again and then move on this is a shoe I'll be coming back to after the review because it is so comfortable whilst having that pace and especially for someone like marathon training you it really does feel like a shoe that you can use for lots and lots of different runs so big tick on the run test for me like Nike has changed the shoe in the way I wanted to see it changed I think lots of people wanted to see it changed and the results are as good as we expected I think like it really is you know now a competitive super trainer and one that will work really well in partnership with something like the alphafly with that really nice cruisy setup that can handle lots of different speeds feel comfortable and general just be a shoe that you look forward to pulling on for lots of different kinds of [Music] runs so i' say that Nike has done a fantastic job here in resurrecting the zoomfly line and really making it a competitive supr trainer again it's just a very good shoe it's comfortable it's fast it does all the things you want from a plated super trainer you're going to use for lots of different runs and it's enjoyable to use them for all those runs when you look at the super trainer Market at large which is a very competitive area of the market I would say um it sits probably more at the comfortable end of things so things like the New Balance FC trainer V3 or even the AIC super blast shoes that can do it all but especially are very comfortable and great for long runs but it's a bit cheaper than those shoes and I think I do like the Zoom F six a bit more even than the superlast I know people love the superlast and they won't be happy about that but I really like the feel you get from the shoe and the superlast sometimes just feels a little bit too boatlike for me as great as it is this is a slightly Nimble of feeling whilst delivering loads of pace as well it's also the Muno Vista in this area which is a really fun and bouncy lightweight daily trainer I think you get a bit more Pace out of the zoom fly be more comfortable going to do a hard long run or track session in this shoe than the Muno but that's another great option and really good value in the UK in particular and then my favorite super trainers at the moment are the Endorphin speed 4 and the Mac X2 which are the lighter weight faster super trainers and they do a really fantastic job of being great race day stand-ins or perfect for really hard sessions the Nike isn't quite as quick as those shoes doesn't feel as Nimble as those shoes but it is a comfort upgrade like compared to the Endorphin speed 4 you've got a lot more foam Under Foot and a more comfortable feeling there especially under the four foot the Endorphin speed 4 is relatively low stack compared to lots of super trainers especially under the 4f foot and I think you get a bit more Comfort there for long hard runs even if the speed 4 is a bit more Nimble and fast for actual racing or shorter sessions and the Mac X2 is really comfortable is really balancy like has a lot of the same great underfoot properties as the zoomfly 6 whil it's being a bit faster in nimbler but has a slightly trickier upper so I've gotten okay with the Mac X2 upper but I do know it's caused people some issues around the heel you're not going to get that with the zoomfly 6 which I think has exceptionally comfortable upper as I've mentioned so the Mac X2 is still my favorite shoe in this area because it has so much speed and I do get on with the upper and you really can do anything in that shoe including very easy runs but think the zoomfly six is a bit more comfortable bit more relaxed on those easy runs just maybe have quite the same top end speed as the Mac X2 but certainly you know really good shoe you could use instead of that if you don't get on or find the MAC X2 a bit too racy or unstable or anything like that so overall really liked the zoomfly 6 I think it's a really good super trainer that can handle wide range of runs really well especially someone's looking at marathon training I think it does those long runs in particular very well indeed and yeah like I say it's very comfortable pretty good value super trainer that now can compete with the best out there might just depend which one you go for might just depend on what exactly you're looking for from a super trainer in terms of whether you want that top end speed race day stand in or more of a comfortable shoe that's just exclusively going to be used for training but certainly a lovely surprise to get here at the end of the year that the zoom fly is kind of back to its best that's our review of the Nike zoomfly 6

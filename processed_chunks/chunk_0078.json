  "text": "[Music] the sun is out a new day a new opportunity right that's all we want here on YouTube that's all we need is the opportunity not the guarantee but the opportunity to turn the door knob to go chase down you know what all right your dreams your goals your Fitness your health your joy oh man if I uh if I had a new tagline it would include uh joy in the in what I say every day because it's uh it's just so it's just so key for what we do here as Runners here on this Earth and yes the joy Pursuit The Joy train today takes us up Mount Yale starting from the Avalanche parking lot and yes we're back in BV Hometown buav bua not bu buav Vista and I just got to say it's uh it's so nice to return to the hometown and see the 14ers see the Collegiate Peaks oh I'm on Main Street right now beautiful I just love soaking it in seeing you yes yes it has changed a lot but it's still it's still BB it really is at the core at the heart even though it does look different with new Banks and new new new a lot of things here on here on the old Main Street but um so today Avalanche Park Avalanche parking lot that's where we're going 5 miles up uh 4,900 vertical feet and why I'm really excited I I went back and forth on what mountain to pursue today but the reason I am going to to Yale is because it's been 5 years almost exactly to the day 5 years since I did this segment this route up Mount Yale and I know the time that I ran 5 years ago thanks to straa this is one one nice little benefit of straa is that it's easy to track okay it's been five 2019 everybody in fact a little Side Story I didn't have a lot of money back then and so I slept in my car at the trail head the night before wasn't really willing to dish out money for a motel or anything like that so I just crashed if I have if I can find footage I'll put it in I don't know if I'll be able to find it but uh that's how much life has changed and we've moved along uh and now we are going back to 20 so I would have been 34 so now we'll be 39 today uh going after the fkt on Mount Yale it's going to be Stout it's not going to be easy it's going to be difficult but we're going to go for it all right and yes we do have some boxes in the uh back of the truck that if I have time I'm going to try and open up for all of you after the run we'll see how see how it goes so 5 miles to the top and 49 so it's about an uh 8 % grade up the trail the average grade up the trail all right main Street's looking good sun is looking good opportunity is looking good all right onward we go let's lace it up and let a rip he meady I could be your there's no gue on anything and I'll take care of you along the way my love one day a time will leave our troubles [Music] behind and you'll take care of me along the way my love one day the time will leave our troubles behind here we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] w you too we got it 12630 from uh Avalanche but I got to keep going cuz I'm going for the fkt awesome round trip so what's your name Seth de more there'll be a video on YouTube in a couple days love you guys good job wo all right I got to go that was a cheerful crowd usually nobody pays attention to me but they were they were excited all right let's get off this mountain that was that was no joke tip of the cap to Mr Feebas he [Music] ah well believe in yourself especially as you get older especially come on everybody I do believe I don't have sell service here but I do believe we beat uh we beat 5ye 34 year old Seth by 12 minutes to the top I'm not sure yet about the round trip but at least on the Ascent over uh basically 5,000 ft I'm shocked actually so my clock said 128 20 12 or sorry 1262 to the top that feels real real good so in 2019 when I slept in this parking lot it was uh I ran 138 I'm dying to know what shoes was I wearing 5 years ago cuz the pulsars weren't out yet uh the innovates um like the mud Talons or the uh yeah the X Talons from innovate that I don't think I had those yet I'm just wondering if I was in Speed goats speaking of which so I you'll know if we got the overall fkt uh here in a minute if you know what I mean going through a drive-thru but uh in the meantime uh let's let's see if I can run them down everybody Rudy Project Smith sunto uh Hoka Solomon and it's funny Once you become a billion dooll company you hire PR firms to do your marketing and so that's like the third pair of speed goats so thank you Hoka I don't need any more speed goats just so you know speed goat sixes but I do appreciate you sending them and uh let's see what else did I open C wow they're coming out with some clothing now not just hats just so you know I will not wear the hats I really won't wear the singlets I'll wear the shorts uh but as you know we got our own running gear now and so I I haven't worn another company's hat in a long long time so C if you're listening to this you can stop sending me uh uh hats that's for sure I I will give it away though to somebody on the intro webs out there so it's a fun unboxing let me just make sure I got everything Cel sunu Rudy Smith Hoka Solomon um thank you thank you Brands thank you companies and the postar I'm going to say we're going to save that pair for the Italy races when I go to Italy here in about uh 3 weeks with my brother so those are going to be those are going to be fresh Freshies for you always want fresh running shoes as fresh as possible for race day great day up in the mountains oh my goodness all right let's uh let's get uh get back through BB here and um see if we can't get to some cell service if you know what I mean [Music] all right camera died I think we're back I think we're back so as I said earlier um I'm 5 years older so for you question of the day like what are you when you are and this is where I know oh I'm I'll say it I'm a preacher well I preach patience on this YouTube channel because if you don't have patience in the game of long distance running it's just going to be difficult and and I'm just I'll be honest I like what did I say on YouTube we're in the top of the second inning now maybe we're in the middle of the second inning if you don't have patience in YouTube or running it's just going to be difficult for you to maybe see the gains because it is that aerobic engine building and so to go 12 minutes faster today it's just like a little uh a little okay okay we still got this and keep cha keep dreaming keep working hard all that good stuff keep eating andies along the way so let's go deliver this uh deliver this goodness to those those boys and and girls uh can't forget Kate now I don't know if we'll uh maybe we'll let Francine have a little bite as well but that's the question of the day how have you um progressed over the last 5 years in the game of long distance running because it is a game and it's a fun game and it's a it's more fun if you got a little patience mixed into all the goodness all right I think we'll close it out everybody that was just a good good effort uh a tip of the cap again to Ryan all right we'll toss it to Mountain running playlist as per usual actually no no no fkt playlist fkt playlist we got one of those too all right see beauty work hard and love each other",

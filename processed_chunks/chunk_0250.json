  "text": "hey this is mar the rant testers this is the new Brooks gin 22 a new brook shoe that's actually launching an early 2025 in the UK and I'll put a precise date when that is up on screen now for glycerin fans there's one pretty big change from the glycerin 21 there's also some smaller changes which we'll get into in this video as well now myself and Tom have both had some early running time in the new glycerin what we're going to do as I said take you through the key differences and what's new from the glycerin 20 1 they get into some early running thoughts and let you know what we're thinking of the Brooks Glycerin 22 so [Music] far so let's run you through those key Brooks Glycerin 22 details first price and Brooks is sticking to the same \u00a3165 and $165 price as the gliserin 21 putting it below the new gin Max and above the ghost Max 2 in terms of pricing Weight Wise a UK size 8 dropped in on the GS at 292 G making it heavier than the glycin 21 in the same size Brook sticks to a 10 mm drop and these same stack Heights and swaps its DNA Loft V3 Cushing technology for its new dual siiz cell DNA tuned foam that debited on the glycerin Max that new foam puts larger cells in the hill for plush Landings for Hill Strikers and smaller ones in the 4ot for a more responsive feel above that is a new double Jack on it upper which provides provides plenty of ping throughout including more around the hill collor for additional support and comfort Brooks has added more rubber to the outsole with notably more coverage at the 4ot to boost durability and make sure the gisen 22 is fit to clock up plenty of running [Music] mileage so the fit for me and the brook glycerin 22 I'm a size eight in the UK uh this is very similar to the fit that you get in previous versions of the glycerin there's plenty of space in the for foot uh plenty of space for the big toe uh the space around the side of the front section of the shoe is pretty good so there's a lot of space for your toes to move around and the mid midfoot is pretty average as well so uh it's not it's not the widest shoe out there but it's definitely a shoe that's designed to be a bit more accessible um I've got fairly average WID feet and I found it to be very very comfortable and had lots of space in it as well there's loads of padding around the ankle color of the shoe it's a very very comfortable shoe quite a plush suo to wear um so yeah all in all very able good shoe and I didn't have any issues so I definitely stick to my size in this shoe so fit has looked solid for me so far in the Glen 22 I've got it in a UK size 8 the same size I had the glycerin 21 I've gotten the standard width fit option and expect to see alternative you know options if you want something a little bit more roomier like you did on the glist 21 to be replicated on the 2T but for me it's felt very good in terms of that fit very good in terms that space up front of the toe box you know opening up into the midfoot as well you know is still going to be a roomy accommodating shoe and that's kind of what I'm seeing so far in my time in the 22 I would say the biggest differences for me is that you just getting a slight leveling up in that padding you know there's a bit more padding in that tongue to improve things in the comfort side of things I think it's most noticeable in the hill collar particularly the inside of that Hill collar you're getting a little bit more padding in the 22 compared to the 21 and Visually you can just see there's a little bit more going on there around the hill collar to add that you know additional level of support and comfort but for me I think going true to size should be absolutely fine I wouldn't be looking to you know sizing up or down in this shoe and pretty much sticking to the shoe size of the GL 21 I think you for most people it's probably going to be the right way to [Music] go so my first run in Brooks F 22 was an 8 Mile Run and I was averaging 83 minute mile Pace in that run dropping it slightly less than that but not much less definitely kind of utilizing the 22 in the same way that I would use the 21 so you know easy runs recovery kind of relaxed runs you know this isn't a shoe I'm expecting to run my faster sessions in now the first thing I would say from that first run that I really noticed was you know there's a whole lot of shoe here just like the 21 you know this isn't the shoe you're going to go and forget that it's on you know it is a big shoe to kind of running and you know you're reminded about it throughout the run or I was you know definitely that's probably one of my criticisms of the 21 you know I would have liked to be a lighter shoe for me and it's now got heavier and the 22 and you know I think you know for me I slightly disappointed to see that has jumped up a little bit in weight I can see why it has you know there's more padding there there's a you a bit more rub on that alol and that's obviously contributed to that addition in weight that you're getting in the glycin 22 I think the other thing here is obviously the ride you know you're getting a change in Cushing technology I think I felt for me the ride on the 21 was a little bit lackluster for me I don't think I got a really memorable experience from it I think particularly given what else was happening in Brooks's range with it cushion shoes I think they were shoes that I had a more memorable experience in I think with the changes here I do think the ride so far feels a little bit nicer for me I think the biggest thing I notice is that there's a slightly higher rebound compared to the 21 I think there's you know there's a little bit more bounce it's not know massively elevated it's not massively Lively in a way that I think the glycerin Max you know the experience M Max was but I do think the rebound and that higher bounce just feels a little bit more noticeable I think what that does it instantly makes the ride again feel a little bit more memorable than it did on the gon 21 I felt like it could roll through very nice in the shoe it still has all those qualities of the glycerin shoe it's very stable it's very controlled I think you know as I said the qualities of the glycerin is still very much there but I do think that bounce is just a little bit more pronounced for me you roll through a little bit nicer still you know very you know kind of smooth fashion but yeah there's just a little bit more there for me you know is it as soft and plush feeling as the this Max don't think for me it is and I think you know does that mean that the DNA tuned here gives it the same level of Versatility I'm not quite sure when I did try to pick the pace up in this I just think there's a lot of shoe it's a wider shoe as well compared to the Gin Max and I think that probably counts against it being a shoe that you probably want to run a little bit more at Tempo and even more moderate Paces so I think yeah the qualities of the gliten are still there I do think that the ride for me and the change of the midell make it a more memorable or definitely made it more memorable experienc in that first run compared to my first run in the glisten 21 but it is a heavy is shoe there's a little bit more rubber and the outsole you know which for me was fine it was in dry conditions and it was absolutely fine you know as I said there's more rubber and I think you can get more durability in life out of this shoe which I think from a GL already going to get good life out of it from a gripping point of view it's fine but I'd like to see how it fed in wetter conditions and you know see whether it holds up from that point of view so yeah I would say a good first run in the Gin 22 does feel very similar to the giten 21 but I do think that DNA tuned you know I'm intrigued to see how that's going to feel over more running time because I think right now I'm definitely seeing a more memorable ride and experience is it going to soften up maybe is it going to still have that liveliness over kind of more testing those are things I want to find out whether I can kind of maybe forget about that or you know would help to forget about the added weight that you're getting on the glycerin 22 which is probably the quality that I'm not loving most in that first run so my first run in this shoe was a 15K run at quite comfortable pace for me it's two days before Christmas I can't be bothered to do any fast intervals or anything like that this week uh so I went out and did a 15K at my easy pace which is about 5 minute kilom and what I found on that run is it's very similar to what I've experienced in the previous version of the shoe and quite similar to the earlier versions as well it's uh the this new uh DNA tuned midsole which is the same one you get in the Brooks Glycerin Max in the Brooks gin Max there's more of it and it does feel a bit softer uh a little bit more uh energy returning um than it does in this shoe to me this feels very similar to the previous version of the shoe the glycerin 21 um which is essentially a very balanced uh midsole it's it's very stable it doesn't feel really soft there's not loads of energy returning it but it does feel very comfortable out on the run but that 15K it felt absolutely fine didn't really think about it on the feet um felt very solid no issues at all with it equally it didn't it's not an amazingly bouncy shoe or amazing soft shoe or anything like that it's just a very balanced shoe which a lot of people can can run in and that's really what the glycerin range is always really gone for a slightly more expensive version of something like the the ghost range where it's really trying to tickle those boxes you want a nice Balance shoe that's giving you stability and comfort um but it isn't going too far off the rails and giving you loads of softness or loads of um engy return it's just very much designed for to to make everyone happy and it and it does that very well it's a very comfortable solid reliable shoe uh and definitely over that first 15K I think it's much much of the same of what you would experience from this line it's a shoe that's very much um just designed to just tick off the miles I think it'd be a very good shoe if you were doing easy runs recovery runs and long runs as well at nice comfortable pace so yeah very much uh found it to be a solid ride on that first first run that I did nothing particularly Spectacular from it but that's not generally what you you you look for in the um in the glycerin range you're looking for that sort of reliable um that ride that gives you a good level of comfort um wasn't that wet out there today or at least it wasn't too slippy or anything like that um this out soole seems absolutely fine though from from that first run um there is quite a bit of exposed midsole on it I haven't seen any signs from that first run of any sort of wear or tear this rubber on the out soole is really thick so I think it take a while to wear it down to the point where you start uh getting to that mids sole but the midsole is actually seems relatively durable um it doesn't it doesn't seem like a delicate midso foam so um yeah nice outs Soo on it as [Music] well to my early verdict on the Brooks Glycerin 22 very much what you would expect from the glycerin range solid sturdy stable comfortable um and nicely balanced the Midol phone isn't a massive detraction from what you would have experienced in the Brooks glit in 21 it's may be a tiny bit softer but not massively um and you're getting a very very similar ride so uh it's definitely a shoe that if you are looking for s a shoe that just gives you a good level of um everything really a bit of cushioning bit of stability this is a good shoe for that doesn't particularly have any performance elements to it it doesn't feel like it's pushing you forward doesn't feel like U it's giving you energy back it's just a solid um just a solid shoe for eating up the miles in in Comfort um and that's if a lot of people are probably looking for so I think after that first run nothing surprising from it um but looking forward to doing a few more miles in it to see if I get anything else and that mid so maybe maybe softens up a little bit more so some other thoughts of that first run in Brooks Clon 22 and I would say this still feels like a glycerin shoe so for anyone worried I think or cautious about the changes here particularly from a kind of cushioning technology point of view I still feel like this is going to be a shoe that's going to work for the same types of runs and give you a similar experience know this is going to be a good long run shoe this is going to be a good shoe to spend a lot of your kind of training time if you're doing a marathon and really not massively fast about your kind of speed but just wanting to kind of make sure you're getting that running time in your legs this is still going to be a Shue to do that and it's going to be very comfortable very controlled very reliable very stable all those qualities I think are still going to be here in the gliten 22 I look at the changes the big changes from the 21 I think see it's a heavy issue I really would have preferred a lighter shoe than the glistan 21 and that's not what we've got here in the Gan 22 so I'm a little bit disappointed about that I like the fact that it is a little bit more padded in places particularly around the hill collar you know I take more Comfort but obviously has come at expense I think along with you know a bit more rubber in the out soole you know adding that weight over the previous shoe which wasn't a light shoe either then you get that DNA tuned midsole which is inevitable we're going to see it rolled out to other brick shoes the glycerin 22 is the next shoe I think it worked really well in the glycerin Max and I think with the glycerin Max it was a a really kind of well-rounded you I think it had a little bit of a versatility about it and you know it worked very nicely I think for me I think am I seeing the best of it here off that first run but I do think compared to the my experience in the glisten 21 I do think the ride is a little bit more memorable a little bit more bouncy a little bit more rebound there which I really like and I think you can roll through a little bit nicer compared to the glycerin 21 so there's definitely some positives here there's definitely some things here that I think over longer term testing I really get a sense of whether that Cushing technology change is going to make it a significantly better shoe so all things to kind of work out there with longer testing you know it's good to see that the price has stuck to you know you know the glycerin 21 price is it going to be I think the shoe that I would probably go from the Brooks range or that what I'm seeing I think probably I think the G Max is probably that shoe that I would probably pick over those cushion shoes but I think in terms of the changes I'm seeing here of that first run I think they are going to be positive ones and crucially it's not going to detract from what the glycerin is about and what it really kind of delivers so yeah I say a very good first run in the glycerin 22 one that I'm intrigued to spend more time in to really get a sense of what's you know how that DNA tuned kind of cushion technolog is going to feel over more testing okay so they have it some early first run thoughts on the Brooks Glycerin 22 now obviously plenty more testing to be done in this shoe over the festive period and early 2025 when this shoe will be launching in the UK we expect Nick and Kieran to get hold of the shoe so we'll have a full multitester review for you then until then if you've got any questions about this shoe other shoes you're desperate to see it compared to or want to know how it compares to do let us know in the comments as always like And subscribe hit that little bell to find out about latest videos and yeah we'll see you for next round test this video [Music]",

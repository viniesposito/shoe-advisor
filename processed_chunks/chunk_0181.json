  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and we're talking Trail now with Becca Becca can you introduce yourself and yes yes uh I'm Becca bro on the senior director of performance fitware at Hoka okay and I mean um I would not be doing Hoka due diligence if I didn't say that it started in trail I'm always going to say that it's a trail brand at heart and um bringing back a shoe moving forward a shoe that started it all is that what we're here with today yeah mafat is a huge part of our origin story as a brand you're totally right we started on the trail start with Max cushioning on the trail so we were really pumped to use this opportunity in Spring 25 to add a new mafat inspired Max cushioning option to our Trail line awesome awesome can you walk through your specs and what we can expect what separates this from other uh shoes with X noted on it so absolutely uh so the mafat franchise has existed previously so we have a great shoe in the lineup right now called the mafat speed 4 for us that has been amazing Staple in the collection we've seen people use that for everything from Long Haul Trail efforts uh to one of the top three shoes that we usually have for the brand at races like UTMB yeah and we we talk about that of like as another option the speed goat is so popular it's the more cushioned option a little more generous but you can still access the same type of train yeah and there's an element to the mafat that has always been about like the duration of the experience so for us mafat means absolute Long Haul totally what we thought we could do to shake things up with the franchise a little bit though was consider a couple different things how can we interject more plated technology into the trail space and how can we also consider a broader variety of trains so when we built mafat X we did a couple things in mind we actually took a little inspiration from the Skyward X on the road side that uh show with a couple of props here so you can actually see the setup of the shoe so like the Skyward X we have this amazing top bed of peba so this is our highest most resilient uh cushioned and bouncy foam in our collection right here would this be the same formula that's found in the tecton X 3 or slightly different similar top foam to what's in the t tecton x 3 yep uh beneath that we have this amazing carbon fiber plate here that's going to add some really great articulation at toe off a little bit more connection at midfoot and this amazing shape that's going to help provide not only that feeling of like suspension and dampening but then also that little bit of propulsion at toe off that's going to Nest within a super critically foamed Eva chassis so when those two things work together you get a really amazing combination of cushioning responsiveness and just that little bit of dampening sensation to help you when you're on really gravel gravel your Rocky train totally and it looks like this plate looks like there's still some of that side by side and kind suspension going on there but is there anything more about the plate that you'd like to share yeah so I think one of the things that we've loved in a shoe like the tekon X3 is how those parallel carbon fiber plates work to really provide that articulation medial to lateral and EnV when you're little cutting in this example of the mafat X we did want to make that for Really T stack Heights we're also considering that torsional stability and that control in a trail environment so when we're going taller we got to make sure that those base Nets are a little bit wider and where that plate can help us get just that little extra rigidity through the midfoot we felt like that was a really good call for when you start getting fatigued later stages and long races that's awesome and then what is what is the overall stack with this shoe uh so we are close to 50 mil on this men's so I we at like 48 49 mil on this so that's going to consider that really amazing SCF Eva chassis the plate stack height a 5 mil sock liner in there um and then a couple really amazing details here our incredible designer Sean who worked on this product he's also an ultra Runner himself so he uh was really excited to put the the fun and functional on this uh you do some lawn hul Trail racing stuff abely yep are you hungry during the race always so am I so is Sean uh so what we wanted to do was just put some really fun Easter eggs in this thing for Ultra Runners out there if you flip this bad boy over uh you'll notice we have pizza and Tacos on the out soole for us so if you are behind someone who is uh who's running this Sho you're going to be motivated by that that footprint of a a food kind of picking up the pace in front of you and that doesn't at all inhibit the grip and the grab it has on it's all designed with be's help to make sure that we're not detracting from any sort of functionality here on that gravel Rocky terrain awesome and this looks like it's it comes from like the Challenger line a little bit of like a little bit more exposed foam have the rubber in the right places um looks like it'll go on a lot of different terrain including the smooth stuff and feel good yeah and for the mafat in particular we wanted to make sure that for those longer more runnable courses you had that really great cushioning when you needed it but then you also felt like when you were on those more rolling portions of like a lighter gravel that you could pick up the pace so so that was super important for us so very versatile lot of Stack a lot of fun uh when can we expect this uh so we're going to be launching this uh this spring at $225 okay yeah so just another long haul option race or not yep if you're a slow 50k Runner like me perfect option out there absolutely okay that's awesome thank you for taking us through this absolutely fat X that's exciting",

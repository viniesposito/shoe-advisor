  "text": "the New Balance 1080 has been a staple daily running shoe for many years now it used to be one of my absolute favorite shoes one that I'd recommend to almost everybody looking for that classic comfortable everyday running shoe we reviewed and absolutely love version 10 version 11 version 12 but it really was unlucky number 13 which was it was still a very comfortable shoe the cushioning was way too soft and it had no stability whatsoever was it just an unlucky blip has the greatness now being restored well stay tuned because we're going to find out very soon and we're also going to be comparing it to the New Balance Mo 5 and maybe the greatest daily running shoe you can get at the moment the Nova blast version 4 so stay tuned to the end of the video for that just before we start out I just want to say I bought this shoe 100% with my money from the Running Company in jalong on our recent trip to Australia so shout out to those guys and girls in there and also thanks for everybody supporting the channel checking out benp parks.com we've just launched our brand new long sleev perfect for all that winter running you'll see me running them in all of the footage we've got here today and feel free to use code youtu10 for 10% off your order right let's have a chat about everything that's changed in version 14 from the outgoing version 13 well we've got an all new mesh upper this triple jackard upper with increased breathability this is what New Balance are saying I actually disagree with that we've got an updated out soole with the shoe as well with some repositioned rubber to give it a little bit more stability as well as improving that grip in those High wear areas and to increase that durability as well we've also got some of that increased stability from version 13 and it's not quite now as super soft and plush and really marshmallowy as version 13 now a little bit firmer and a little bit more stable and we can start to use this as a daily running shoe again the price is the same the drop and stack is also the same but the weight has slightly increased right let's get stuck in all the facts and figures so what's the purpose of the 1080 well this is a premium daily trainer sure you can do the vast majority of runs in pretty well with some good high quality materials in here as well pricewise this is \u00a360 here in the UK \u00a310 $165 $270 Australian dollar which what I paid for the shoe or around about $210 Canadian do stack out of the back 38 mm and a 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise and fortunately a little bit on the heavy side here coming in for me at 360 G version 13 was 323 so for me around about a 40 G increase in weight neutral stability this is a neutral shoe with the upper of the shoe we've got this triple jackard mesh upper midsole we've got new balance's classic Fresh Foam X midsole there's no plate in this shoe whatsoever outsole we've got this rubber out soole it's not covering the mid soole completely just adding some extra grip and durability in those High wear areas different widths available well unfortunately it varies from country to Country if you're in the USA you've got four different widths available narrow standard wide and extra wide in the UK we're just getting two just your standard and your wide so check with what's available in your country in terms of men's and women's fit we have that available for both and the sizing it was true to size for me right let's get stuck into all of my likes my first like with this shoe is the improved stability versus vers 13 it's now not quite as super soft a marshmallowy which some people won't love because there were a few fans of version 13 although most people agreed it was just so soft and unstable that's definitely gone it's now just that little bit firmer a little bit more usable the slightly wider base we've got with the shoe and the improved rubber on the outso all adding to that extra bit of stability the updated geometry overall is working a lot better for me on my runs so for fans of version 10 11 and 12 this is going to be a real turn to form and you're going to be a lot happier in the shoe my second like with the shoe it's just extremely comfortable for those easy runs those recovery runs walking around and genely having a comfy shoe for living your life around Outdoors the upper is great the lockdown has been spoton for me the sizing was true to size it's the same size I've used in all of my previous 1080s as well the width has also been improved in the shoe it's now a little bit wider just a little bit more accommodating as well and you can always go for that wider option if that appeals to you if you're someone that you think you've got a wide fit definitely go for that wider option I particularly like the padding around the ankle at the back of the shoe here as well and the updated upper is just really working well for me just holding that foot in place no sliding around no hot spots no blisters or anything like that my third like with the shoe is just very very dependable it's not the most fun shoe I'm going to review it's not the most exciting but it just gets the job done in minimal F there's no fancy plates no fancy Foams or fancy rods it's going to be really great for a beginner Runner that's looking for that premium shoe they can get started in or that intermediate Runner just looking for something that as I say it's just very dependable it's going to give you no issues out there The Rocker at the front of the shoe provides a really good confident feeling and for heel Strikers too at the back of the shoe the way the heel tapers here it's going to feel really nice through that whole foot strike so again really good option for those heel Strikers it just feels like a really premium well put together product it's built to last for a very long time but as always it's not all smiles I always buy these shoes so I can give you my 100% honest thoughts on it so let's have a quick chat about the dislikes the first one being I have experienced a slight little bit of overheating New Balance say this is an improved upper with better breathability unfortunately I would sort of disagree I have been heating up a little bit in this shoe especially when you do pick up the pace but yes it might be just one that's going to be good for winter running if you're the Norther hemisphere you're probably going to be fine in the shoe over the next few months the weight gain is just a little bit frustrating now 360 G the last one was 323 the wet weather grip isn't fantastic in this shoe it's very wet in London here at the moment just sliding around a little bit more than I would like with my fourth dislike like we saw with version 13 gone on the days of the 1080 being that shoe that really can do everything really well now really the 1080 is just the shoe that's going to be good for the day after your really big effort it's the day after your long runs easy runs recovery runs people going out for longdistance walks or people just working in retail and things and being on their feet for a long period of time if you want to pick up the pace in the shoe you're going to need to invest in something a little bit speedier a little bit faster a little bit lighter with this shoe it really was hard work to pick up the pace in anything faster than marathon pace and I'll just be begging to put something else on but it's fantastic at those slower Paces for me right let's have a chat about some other options as well now my best daily shoe of the year was the Nova blast version 4 and how is that different to this well the Nova blast is slightly narrower but really a very similar fit overall it's a little bit firmer a little bit bouncier and it's got some better energy return through the foot strike as well and as I say it's just a little bit more versatile has a bit more pop about it and it can pick up the pace a little bit better that's where the 1080 is lacking unfortunately and when the 1080 is different from the Nova blast it's just a little bit more comfortable it's a little bit softer as well and it's a little bit better on those easier and Recovery runs with that foam just absorbing a little bit more of the impact as you go along the no thought is a lot lighter too plus lighter on your wallet as well coming at just \u00a31 135 so for me it really is a bit of a clear winner there I'd really recommend saving the money and picking up something like the Nova blast 4 if you're looking for that classic daily Do-it or shoe and maybe pick out one of our new wraps for just \u00a3 12 which we' just released on the website with the money that you will save as well we're now shipping those worldwide what most people have been asking me about the 1080 is not how it compares to the Nova blast but how it compares to the more version 5 we've just released our dedicated review to this shoe so we'll link that up here and at the end of this video the mo version 5 is very very soft for that pure recovery and easy run shoe it's a hell of a lot bulkier as well if I put these side by side here you'll just see it's got a much bigger footprint especially at the back of the shoe as well yeah this is just a big shoe and you really feel that massive bulk on the end of your foot as you run along both have the same Fresh Foam X as well but more 5 is a lot more of it and it is just a little bit heavier but surprisingly not as much as you would think this is really quite a heavy sh I'm not sure where they're getting all that weight from the mo version 5 has a wider 4ot as well a little bit more of accommodating toe box neither of the shoes have a plate in them and the more first and find is just a little bit more stable little bit wider and it's got some of the higher sidewalls in the shoe as well the 1080 just has a bit more of a traditional run feeling through the foot stripe really because it's not quite anywhere near as bulky as the mo version 5 so go for the 1080 if you want a little bit more versatility a little bit lighter you can pick up the pace a little bit better more version 5 is that Pure Energy absorption Bliss super soft to look after those legs on those easy and Recovery runs so let's a chat about my final thoughts on the 108 version 14 do I recommend the shoe yes I do recommend the shoe if you want a soft very comfortable shoe for easy and Recovery runs that isn't too bulky that you get a lot of these Max cushion shoes then this is going to be a good option to go for the more version 5 might be slightly too soft and too extreme for some people so this is where the 1080 comes in is it worth the upgrade over version 13 yes it very much is for me I really did not get on with version 13 at all this one is now definitely a shoe that I can now happily go for running and I really don't have to worry about it too much it's just a nice Dependable good easy and Recovery run shoe and who should buy a shoe like this well any Runner who wants a simple no fuss comfortable trainer they can get the majority of their runs done in pretty well be more than happy with the 1080 so to answer the question that we've called this video is this the most comfortable daily shoe ever I'd say it's very close between this and the asex Joe Nimbus version 26 which is my most comfortable shoe of all time they're both very similar shoes and you really can't go wrong with it either the Nova blast version 4 is still the best daily shoe out there in my opinion but the 1080 Strays away from this sort of daily shoe segment it's fast becoming a little bit more like the Joe Nimbus and that's really where its bigest competition is coming from so thanks very much guys for following along with the video if you want to watch the more verion 5 full review that is coming up up here if you want to check out our complete New Balance lineup review and learn all about what the different shoes are that review is down here so that's it guys keep on working hard keep on getting done let me know your thoughts on the 1080 and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

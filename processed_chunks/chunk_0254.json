  "text": "hey this is mik from the r testers this is the aex no blast 5 and this is the aex super Blast 2 two shoes as you'll know from our multitester reviews we are big fans of now these are also two shoes that sit at very different price points super blast do is the more expensive the no blast 5 is a lot cheaper and it's a lot easier to get a hold of than this shoe now what we're going to do in this video is take you through the key differences and give you a sense of whether there is any kind of overlap in terms of experience in terms of the types of runs that these shoes can work for and whether no blast 5 could give you a super blast like experience for a little bit less money so first we'll get into those key differences then give you our multi test to take on whether you should go for the Nova blast 5 or the super Blast 2 so let's get into those nitty-gritty details and differences between the Nova blast 5 and Super Blast 2 let's start with price and the noov blast 5 is considerably cheaper than the super Blast 2 while both are offered in stand width size options only weightwise the Nova blast 5 weighed in heavier for us than the super Blast 2 in a UK men's size eight you're getting shoes both of 8 mm drops with the super Blast 2 offering a bigger stack of cushioning at both the heel and the 4f foot compared to the latest Nova blast at the upper it's engineered woven mesh versus jackard mesh with similar tongue and lacing combinations used and the Nova blast 5 heel collar offering a touch more padding there's big differences at the midsole where the no no blast uses the new FF blast Max for a softer feel compared to the Eco plus included in the Nova blast 4 and also the super Blast 2 where it's combined with the FF blast turbo plus found in asx's metas Speed Carbon races asex adopts a similar trampoline inspired outs soole design on both shoes to spread those Foams across a relatively broad base to bring that bounce throughout the shoe you're also getting similar outo designs with the no blast offering a bit more coverage at the for foot and lateral areas of the shoe comes to the fit of the super Blast 2 and the no blast 5 I've got the same size in both shoes which is a uk9 us10 with aex it's the same size I use across the aex range and both of them have a really good fit for me I'd say you have got really roomy forfoot on the no blast 5 but even as someone with a narrow foot like I am you know have too much room there as someone with a narrow foot but it's not being a problem in any way with lockdown or anything like that got right amount of length at the front there in terms of room for my toes good hold around the heel and midfoot I find them both very comfortable shoes just to slip on day after day so yeah no concerns with the fit I'd stick to your normal size okay so the fit for me in the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 quite a similar fit actually um both very comfortable I'm a size eight in the UK i' very much like wearing both these shoes they're both AIC shoes so a similar fit what I would say is that the um nov blast 5 is a little bit more forgiving it feels a little bit wider and the upper just feels a little bit um more flexible in in terms of how it puts pressure on your feet so uh if you maybe have a slightly wider foot you're probably going to be better off with the Nova blast 5 over the super Blast 2 but there's not a lot in it and I find both of these shoes very very comfortable so I would stick to my size in both of them so in terms of fit it's been very good for me in both of the shoes I've got them both in a UK size a that my typical run shoe size and that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in ax shoes now what I would say is the key differences for me is that with the Nova blast 5 it definitely has a more of a relaxed fit and I would say you know it's a bit more roomy in the toe box of the shoe I think it opens up a little bit more of going further back in the shoe as well and if you prefer something that's a bit more accommodating particularly if you've got slightly wider feet then I think that would be a better fit for most people I've got quite skinny narrow feet and while it is a lot rier I found it's not been overly roomier or generous with that space I think with the super blast too definitely does narrow a little bit more it's not super narrow in any way but I do think like the space up front in the toe box is still very good that hold at the midfoot is very good as well too another area I think is a key difference for me is that there's just a bit more padding around the hill col in the Nova blast 5 where you know it's definitely issue for me that's geared towards kind of giving you a little bit more of that Comfort side where you're getting that padding a pretty good amount of padding on the hill col and the super Blast 2 but it definitely isn't as much as it is on the no blast 5 so the things for me would be that the Nova blast 5 is a lot more roomy particularly the front of the shoe and and the middle section of the shoe the super blast to has less kind of padding at the hill collar but generally for me I think going through the size for both of these shoes should be fine for most people let's give you a quick word on fit then in amongst the pistachio shells on this bench and in the ax superlast 2 and the over blast five i r in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half I think these are both really kind of roomy accommodating shoes there's loads of space in the toe box up front big thumbs width there nice clearance across the top of the toes super lastar to for me they hold really well in the midfoot the heels are nicely padded I have no slipping at all Everything feels locked down and comfortable and nice and I would recommend going through to issues particularly if you want to go Long Haul because they're plenty roomy in the Nova blast 5 these are even area I mean there's so much Flex in the toe box here these are sort of spacious some people have complained about the fact that they feel too spacious particularly if you've got narrow feet maybe they will feel a bit wide but I ran in my regular running shoe size and I found everything good I I really look for lots of toebox room so look you can see you've got lots of clearance on the end there's plenty of Flex for the toes that TOS the top lock down across the midfoot was nice and secure I had good hold in the heels as well tongues take the Ed jof no problems with this and I I recommend going true to Siz in the shoe unless you really want a snug fit where or you've got a narrow foot where you might want to think about going half a size down so the aex super Blast 2 and the aex no blast 5 are both shoes that I've really liked testing this year I think they both fit their roles very well within the ax lineup with the no blast 5 being more of the mid-range shoe the daily trainer that's designed to be pretty good value appeal to a wide range of Runners have a fairly inoffensive ride that's actually no very pleasant ride in fact and one that I think will work for lots of different Runners you obvious got a load of cushioning there under foot but it's still a fairly lightweight shoe got a slight rocker there that does help you roll through your stri foot strike smoothly and actually that's been improved a little bit on the no blast 5 compared to the no blast 4 for me thanks to the redesigned heel bevel which is a little bit less huge than the one on the no blast 4 which does make it a slightly smoother ride but you've got a good foam in the Mido there which is comfortable but it's not necessarily as responsive as exciting as the stuff you are going to get on the super Blast 2 for me the no blast 5 definitely works best for kind of easy runs relaxed da training long runs that kind of thing you can pick up the pace in the shoe but you're not getting a huge amount of responsiveness out of this foam it's more just the fact that it's a pretty lightweight shoe and one with a nice rocker that means you can turn your feet over quite well the foam is soft but not too mushy for me so I find I can run faster in the shoe without it feeling like I'm you know waiting through a big wedge of soft foam so it's reasonably versatile but certainly not as versatile as something like the super blast which is a kind of a special shoe so it's obviously a lot more expensive than an overlast 5 it's build as a super training without a plate you've got the huge stack of asx's best foam there the FF turbo plus and that foam just is a lot livelier a lot more responsive and it it really makes it a lot easier to pick up the pace in the super blast compared to the no blast it's also a lighter shoe than the no blast and really you can kind of do everything that you would do in the no blast you can do it in the super blast and then it's got a lot more range in terms of that top end speed like it's not necessarily a shoe that I absolutely adore running fast in myself because style of Runner I am I've got a high Cadence fairly short stride like quite a shuffly runner and you know it's a big shoe so it's not a heavy shoe but it is a big shoe and sometimes turning it over it can a little bit too boatlike and big for me I actually would be quite Keen for them to shave off a bit of that heel bevel on the super Blast 3 as they have done with the no blast 5 I think that would probably improve it a little bit for me but I certainly can pick up the pace in it I do enjoy running it a lot recently I took it away for a trip was the only shoe I had for everything and you know it's a comfortable shoe to walk around in it then can do all the runs I did on that trip at a range of paces and it just works all of for all of them you know really very well and you do get a much livelier feel from the foam in this midsole compared to the one in the nose blast 5 so when I was running both of them at the same time that's the thing that really comes across like the super blast feels lighter and it feels a lot poppier and more responsive under the for foot in particular you get a lot more lift off the toes in general just feels like a you know more exciting ride got a denser foam on the nose blast it feels like a much more solid shoe you know a heavier shoe which it is and one that's a bit more suited just for cruising along it is still a pretty lightweight shoe like I say and it turns over well but compared to the superl you can get a lot more kind of pace and liveliness out the shoe and it's also stiffer which I think does make it more comfortable that pace that stiffness might detract from the ride a little bit at easier PES for some people like I don't really mind it myself you know it's not a shoe that's designed for Pure Comfort but it does feel fine for me on easy runs but then the extra flexibility you get from the NOA blast might appeal to some people when they're looking at just cruising around their daily training like there's a fairly big wedge of foam you get on the super blast and it does help with pushing you along but it is quite stiff like I say okay so you'll notice that I'm still not holding up the super Blast 2 because Mike still has it so I need to go and get that off him at some point desperate to get that shoe back so I can do some training um for uh Dubai Marathon uh that's coming up in a few weeks uh so these two shoes are shoes that um if you if I reviewed the no blast 4 and the super Blast 2 and compared them they're quite similar in a in in in how they run they both have a same level of firmness in the midsole they both have similar level of respons and it feels like uh the Nova blast 4 took a lot of learnings from the super blast um to provide a better all round versatile experience for runners um and I very much like both of those shoes especially for training uh a longer distance where I want to retain a consistent effort but I still want a bit of comfort and a lot of padding as well uh the Nova blast 5 uh it's quite different than superlast 2 now U because this new midell phone this FF blast Max is um a bit softer than what was in the Nova blast 4 and as a result it changes the ride of the shoe uh quite a bit for me in comparison to the to the Nova blast 4 the result of that is that um it's definitely a lot softer than the super Blast 2 um but also you don't get that same um turnover that you get in the super Blast 2 Su Blast 2 is a shoe that isn't very soft um and it has a quite a rigid midsole so it rolls your foot forward and really helps you maintain a nice fluid Pace I use the superlast 2 quite a lot for longer training sessions um where I'm trying to maintain maybe my marathon pace and it just really helps you just smoothly just cover that pace it's not really noticeable like a carbon plate shoe or something where you can feel the the carbon plate doing something uh to to impact the way that that you're running it's just a really smooth motion very comfortable nice level of padding for running at PACE and doesn't in any way um sap your energy or slow you down or anything like that but still retains a good level of comfort as well uh the no blast 5 is a Sho that um because of this softer midell foam it doesn't work so well as the no blast 4 or the super Blast 2 when you are uh running faster because for me it feels like I'm hitting that a little bit too hard um and I'm not getting a lot back there's a little of energy return you get back from this phone when you're running at a slower Pace or more of a consistent Pace but when you're picking picking up the speed um I feel like I'm really putting too much pressure into that mid cell Pham and it's not giving it me back it's it's it's sapping the energy a little bit um when I'm running faster uh I think that's really the the the key to what the Nova blast 5 is now I think it's more a daily shoe that fits more into that easier realm longer runs maybe where you just want comfort and you're not trying to pick up the pace or maintain the tempo Pace or anything like that um and and the superlast 2 is all all out designed for uh those consistent long run Paces uh it's a fantastic marathon training shoe probably be a great Marathon shoe I haven't used it for a marathon uh race but the way that the shoe rides is just very fluid very comfortable um but really allows you to maintain a pace which for me for marathan training would be about 4 minute 30 km uh if I'm going out to do like a 25k 30k long run and and that shoe just Smooths your feet and just makes you just be able to do that run really really comfortably without really adding anything to it it's a very natural ride as well it's not really forcing your foot into a specific position no blast 5 I wouldn't use it for those sorts of runs I think it I'd really feel it after a while it just deadening the the impact and not really giving me a lot back but it is a very enjoyable shoe to wear for those easier runs or a longer run where you're just trying to just maintain a nice comfortable effort you get a little bit of bounce back back it's definitely very comfortable shoot to a but for me it definitely sits into that realm of easier day shoes now um as opposed to a versatile option Su Blast 2 is very very versatile shoe great for easy runs I know Kieran thinks it's a fantastic easy run shoe I don't use it for easy runs uh I prefer a lot more softness when I'm running easy runs so if I'm just doing easy runs I'd probably pick the no blast 5 but for a shoe that is really really well designed for faster training sessions at longer at longer distance uh you can also do a lot more with it so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I've done over 50k in the Nova blast 5 now I have done near to 100 miles in the super Blast 2 and what I would say is these are two shoes that are very good at being ones that you just throw on and they are very easy to forget about what's going on in and around your foot to be ones that you know really can kind of tick that mileage off you know really get that running time in your feet without really thinking too much about it there definitely are some differences between these two shoes I think does kind of influence how I would use them how I think a lot of people may end up using them and want to use them I think the first uh Factor area for me is the weights now these aren't heavy shoes either than my heavy shoes but when you consider at least for me that the super L 2 is you know is a bigger stack shoe comes in a ways in lighter for me than no last five you know it just you know feels like it runs a little bit nicer with that weight just handles that weight a little bit better now it isn't sloppy and isn't heavy or cumbersome and the no blast 5 and it's not a lower stack shoe by a huge amount but I just found that you know having that kind of light away on a on a Max taoe is is a very nice kind of experience overall and it really kind of kind of feeds into what you're getting in the midsole what you're getting below you know uh in the out soole as well and what that kind of does for the ride in these shoes I think for me the no blast youve got the FF blast Max for me it's spread across a kind of larger surface area and what that does first and foremost is just create something that is a lot or kind of naturally very stable I think it's also a lot sof the feeling than the kind of dual density mids cell makeup in the super Blast 2 I think that what does for me the no blast 5 it just you know Comfort is the first thing it ticks off it rolls through very nicely very smoothly and for me when I've running it I found it felt more comfortable to do that kind of easier and moderate Paces when I've tried to run a little bit quicker in it it's not you know been totally uncomfortable to do that but I've just felt that when I've tried to do that in the super Blast 2 it's felt more at home it's felt more depth and that's really down to that midsole that dual density midell being you know there's some softness there but there's definitely some firmness as well too there's some bounce as well I think there a more prominent bounce for me in the super blast 2it I think the rocker is more prominent as well you know the rocker is pretty good in this in the no blast 5 but I think coupled with all the things that you're getting in these super Blast 2 it just rolls through a little bit more aggressively for me and I've raced in it I've done track sessions in it I've done faster sessions I've done shorter and long kind of runs in it as well and I felt it's covered you or felt comfortable to do it at all of those Paces I think the other thing I mentioned other videos I think transitioning from those different Paces you know the super Blu does a very good job of that and that's why is kind of a standout do it all shoot I think the Nova blast five for me when I have tried to mix the Pacers in a single run I haven't found it as comfortable I haven't found it as Lively and bouncy barring the first run that I did in it but it's a definitely good experience in both these shoes just for very different runs so I think these are good daily trainer shoes you know relatively kind of big stack shoes as well for me there clearly one that is a little bit more versatile and a little bit more friendly towards running a little bit more Tempo and faster um but definitely good shoes for me other areas I think the out Souls I think you know for me I think the no blast 5 is giving you a little bit more rubber on that outsole and I think durability wise I'm seeing less wear obviously less running time but for me the super plus 2 has been H holding up pretty well obviously still getting some exposed areas there's definitely a bit more more rubber on the Nova blast 5 for me in those kind of similar areas as well so for me from a you know durability point of view I think you're going to get a bit more from no blast 5 gripping has been fine for me I've run in kind of wetter and drri conditions for both these aren't the best kind of you know Road running outsoles available but they seem to be up to task or have been up to task in my run so yeah two very good shoes two very good Asic shoes two very good daily trainer shoes but it's definitely one that I pick of the other that's not to say the other one is bad but I just think the other or there's one shoe here that works a little bit better for me and I'll get to that in my verdict so in testing I've run north of 30 mil in the new Nova blast 5 I've run much more in the super Blast 2 including a full Marathon test in this shoe that's on the channel now if you want to go and find it all of that has been across a range of paces and terrain I also did a side bys side Mile with one shoe on each foot to really tease out the differences between these two shoes and here's how that went so I've just done my side by side Mile with the super Blast 2 on my right foot I've got the Nova blast five on my left foot minute you put the shoes on you feel the higher stack in the super blast you can feel that there's that extra stiffness and firmness in the midsole compared to the softer novablast 5 which feel sort of sinky when you first put them on by comparison superlast to sort of you know they're cushion but they sort of hold you up and you're expecting that kind of stiffness and that roll through and that transition to come uh as a result of a slightly kind of stiffer ride there's a more immediacy as a result of that they're both big Cush C shoes though I don't think the superlast 2 you know sacrificing that much cushion for me anyway they it does feel like a bigger shoe on the foot there's a lot more kind of heft to it doesn't feel quite as Nimble you know it's a thing to say that NOA blast feels a bit more compact by comparison because the Nova blast is not a compact shoe by any stretch of the imagination but it does feel I mean they're about the same weight but I would say the no blast 5 actually feels a bit lighter I think it's just because you've got more of the superlast underf foot stability wise I quite like the firmness of the super Blast 2 I think that provides a bit more of a stable platform for me a bit more reliability you do feel a little bit of mush and wobble I think into the Nova blast five if anything I expected over blast 5 in my head for the runs that i' done with it initially to be a bit more like the super Blast 2 but actually I think the over blast 4 which had that kind of slightly additional stiffness firmness underf foot now feels much more like the super blast than the Nova blast 5 does the Nova blast 5 brings softness so how does that translate then well if you've run in the super blast to if you've watched reviews and you've thought actually maybe they might be a little bit too stiff for you to go Long Haul into the long miles and you wanted more softness and the Nova blast 5 is going to add that it gets to the energy in a different way though it's slightly more reliant on a sink and a bounce for the energy to come back where you get a lot of energy and bounce from the super Blast 2 but you also get a little bit of that kind of immediacy from the stiffness that comes so it's a bit quicker to respond it's a bit punchier as a result there's a bit more kind of top speed potential I think of the superlast 2 it's overall just a bit more of an energetic shoe where the Nova blast 5 now I think bit more cushioning probably bit more accommodating for going slower and longer whereas the super Blast 2 is probably better you know cruising those kind of tempo Paces maybe a little bit higher up if you don't mind running in a big shoe that is how I would divide those shoes but we'll do the verdict back in the office it comes to my verdict like these are both good shoes and shoes that fit their roles well within the aex lineup if you are looking for one shoe absolutely everything and you want you're prepare to pay for a special feeling under fit you are going to get it with a super blast 2 like it's a pretty amazing shoe it's not one that's entirely to my taste like I've picked out shoes that I prefer to it that are also you know really fun all rounders and all that but it's certainly an amazing shoe one that I do like running in and one that obviously is very popular with people at large like if you are just looking for one shoe to do everything the super blast is the one to do it in if you're looking for a fast training shoe then the super blast is the one to pick over the no blast the no blast is certainly better value you can use it for the same kind of runs as the super blast you're just not going to get the same energetic ride feel and is a bit more kind of cushy and relaxed when it comes to easy runs like you're looking at putting these shoes in a rotation superlast either could be you know a rotation killer a shoe you're used for everything or one that fits into rotation in the middle of it there like picking up the bulk of your mileage with a maybe a very easy comfortable cushion shoe for some easy runs and then a fast plated shoe for you know really top end Speedy stuff whereas the no blast 5 I position more towards the cushion end of things in a rotation I'd want to have you know a faster training shoe alongside this and maybe a racer as well though you can use it for a bit of everything like it doesn't really have the pace that I'd be looking for in an allrounder if you are a newer runner though I think the no blast 5 is a really good allrounder actually I think it's one that will protect the legs well but is fairly lightweight you can use it for some Speedy stuff like if I was a new Runner I wanted one you to do everything I would get the no blast first before know spending loads of money on something like the super blast I think the no blast does play a role in being you know a cheaper version of the super blast in a way and it is a fair bit cheaper but the super blast you know you are paying more for it but you are going to get a big upgrade in performance if you do spend that money okay so my verdict on the super Blast 2 and the Nova blast 5 is obviously the super Blast 2 is a much more expensive shoe um so if it came down to cost and the fact that it's almost impossible to buy the super Blast 2 and I know many of you will comment on this video uh saying that you can't get hold of it sorry about that there's nothing we can do to get them to stock more super blast 2os um but because of that no blast 5 is probably going to be the only option for most people anyway if even if you could get it it's a very expensive shoe2 200 is a lot of money to spend on a training shoe um which is above a lot of people's budget so the no blast 5 comes in under that it's a shoe design for more General Runners it's a shoe design for people that don't want to spend \u00a3200 on a running shoe um but it's not as good a shoe um obviously uh it's a lot significantly cheaper than the super Blast 2 um if I was looking at purely the shoes themselves and ignoring the price and the availability of them I would say that super Blast 2 is a far superior shoe um for most runs if you're going to go out and buy a shoe then you wanted something that you could do a lot of stuff in easier runs daily sessions faster sessions um long runs super Blast 2 just ticks off all of those really really well noas 5 doesn't really take off all of those well at all it really ticks off the easier runs and the comfortable training sessions the daily runs where you just want a nice bit of softness uh and comfort and you want to take off the miles uh in as much um with as much padding and and comfort as you can get um but it's really not a huge design for versatility or uh it's defin not sure I'd use if I was training for a marathon I was doing lots of longer sessions or faster sessions so I think it really comes down to that if you're looking between these two shoes and you're not worried about price or availability but obviously if you're just a general Runner that's looking for a comfortable daily shoe you're not going to go for the superlast 2 because it's just so expensive uh and hard to get so out of for me I'm going to go superlast 2 all the way but I understand that the no plus 5 is a more cost effective option but it's limited to easier sessions you can't really do a lot in this shoe after my first run in the no blast 5 where I ran well and the NOA blast 5 gave back good energy I was wondering if they might be a more affordable alternative to the super Blast 2 a sort of super blast light if you will but after logging many more miles in both shoes I don't think that's quite the case here both shoes are enticingly versatile but the superlast 2 is by far the more energetic shoe with a smoother ride and I think a more consistent punch across all the ranges of pace the no boss 5 has energy and it's also a capable Cruiser but but for me the softer Edge just isn't quite as encouraging as the ride you get from the super Blast 2 it just doesn't quite give you that extra oomph I actually think the Nova blast 4 runs more like the super Blast 2 it's a bit firmer a bit snappier now The Sweet Spot for the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 is really cruising from around my marathon pace up to Tempo there's enough cushion on both shoes to eat easy miles in relative Comfort too I could Long Haul in both of these shoes but I find both shoes can get a bit sluggish at my very slowest pace at least when I'm running in my heaviest form when it comes to the fastest training both shoes can be a bit too much shoe on the foot I find for me to want to tackle things like all out of intervals again you can do these sessions in either shoe but I wouldn't say either of them really excels at it over and above some other shoes now the superl 2 is a better shoe all round the grip Superior the ride is snappier but if you're on a budget could you cover the same runs in the over blast five the answer I think is probably yes would they be as good I don't think quite if you're taking money out of the question I'd certainly choose the superlast two out of these two shoes I think on balance is the more accomplished all rounder and the slightly snappier ride which appeals more to the way I run so my take with you should go the A6 blast 5 or the as6 super Blast 2 now the first thing I'll say is that these are two very good daily trainer shoes if you're telling me which one is the best it's a no-brainer it's a super blast too this is the shoe if you want a shoe that can do uncover all of your runs and do it in a really good way then that's what the super Blast 2 is going to give you in terms of the Nova blast 5 being a super blast light I think it works for some of the runs that the super Blast 2 works well at but not all of them I think this is a shoe you get if you you know can't get hold of the super Blast 2 you want a shoe that's accommodating that is comfortable works for shorter and longer runs and I think for me easy to moderate Paces that's really where you know it fits best for me so if that's what would work for you that's what you would look for in a daily trainer Sho and go for the over blast 5 if you want the best shoe between these two shoes the one that can work for faster Paces longer runs shorter runs could be used for track sessions as well it's a super blast 2 you1 I appreciate it's hard to get a hold of but if you can you're going to be rewarded with a very good daily Trainer shoe that weighs in at the kind of standard daily trainer weight and overall it's just a very good shoe one of my favorite shoes to running or to have running this year so for me if I could get a hold of it and you know I'm fortunate that I do have one I would be going for the super Blast 2 if you wanted a shoe that you know and that daily trainer profile that definitely Vees towards being more comfortable but can definitely work for shorter and longer runs easy to modate Paces I'd be going for the Nova blast 5 okay so there you have it that our take on how the Nova blast 5 compares to the super Blast 2 if you got any questions about either of these shoes or other shoes you want to see them compared to do let us know in the comments as always like And subscribe hit that little bell to find out about our latest

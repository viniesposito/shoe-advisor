  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and now we're here with Russ Stevens PLM at toppo athletic uh we're here to talk about Trail yes your Forte my forte this is what I love yeah yeah so we're here to first talk about our new Mountain racer 4 which is a product that's going to be launching in May the Mountain racer is the cushion option in the Topo athletic line for running quickly over technical Trail this has become that kind of go-to almost daily Trail runner for folks looking to run on technical terrain within the Topo athletic line with this product we haven't done any major updates we've kept the same midsole and outsole here just changing the durometer of the midsole to be a little bit softer but you still get that same really technical vber Mega grip outsole delivering traction and slip resistance on technical Trail y like I said same midsole with a 33 to 28 mm midsole platform just a little softer a little bit more responsive underfoot and that that zip foam has been doing really good throughout your lines um a lot of great application for this particular zip foam and why why is it why is it such a great application for trail sure so our ZIP foam formula actually changes a little bit shoe to shoe we use zip foam as an umbrella term to cover all of our Eva based Foams so I think the versatility of that of that name and that foam is kind of what you're experiencing where the zip foam in something like Traverse where it's more hike oriented kind of meant to be more protective a little firmer exactly it's going to be a bit different than the zip foam in something like Mountain racer or the next product we'll talk about where it's a little softer a little more lively kind of more run oriented y um something else that's going to make the shoe a little bit more lively is this new footed that we're going to be using which is our fkt insole got to feel that right away yeah go right ahead oh yeah yeah it's uh made using TPU beads so delivers a really nice soft and comfortable step- in feel uh really resilient foam and is also closed cell so it doesn't hold as much water which allows the shoe to drain and dry water more quickly if you're going to go through a stream Crossing or otherwise just get your feet out when you're running on the trails okay um yeah also just updating our Gator attachment system on our shoes to something that's a little bit more unversal so it can work with um other types of gators within the market as well as the Topo athletic Gator that we be releasing our Switchback Gator which will be compatible with these models okay is this your bestselling Trail shoe the ultra Venture is actually our bestselling Trail shoe this is this is number two close because I I see most when I go to races I'm looking around at everybody's shoes and when I see toppo athletic and maybe it's more at those Ultra oriented type events that I do see this one a lot yeah I honestly I don't have the numbers in front of me but I would be surprised that in the Rockies where you live this might be our number one Ultra Venture from a national perspective is the number one but uh it can change regionally kind of pocket to pocket what what that most popular but this has the grip it has really nice fit in the upper of course you guys are known for that more anatomical shaped 4ot um and so it has like Comfort measures and Technical measures on lock right thank you yeah yeah that's the goal yeah exactly and what does this come in out uh this is going to be launching in May it'll retail for $1150 and the men's n comes in right around 10.4 ounces okay it's it's really hard to find a good shoe these days that's like $150 $140 so I mean this is tried and true already yeah we try and always make a you know make product with a really good value and really high build quality when we're when you know we're starting that process and always always try and deliver a lot of value to the customer totally and and the third version of this got a lot of uh a lot of High Praise from us personally and around the industry yeah um and so this four is just going to improve the ride and that's pretty much it right exactly which is great I mean it's it's a good problem to have where you shouldn't have to update it year after year MH so this just a little bit of experiential update I think a lot of people will be happy with that we hope so yeah we we certainly hope so okay but cool so what's next next let's talk about something that's a a bigger a bigger change and some more more excitement and uh maybe even more excitement which hopeful athletic a shoe that I'm really stoked about um this is our new Vista which is going to be coming in June and then will retail for yeah you feel that right away yeah uh and it's going to retail for $170 okay this is going to serve as the max cushion Trail Runner within our line designed for technical terrain okay so this product really came out a feedback from our athletes and customers that were running in the Mountain racer and Ultra Venture so folks in the Mountain racer were using that shoe for you know everything from their daily Trail runs to 50ks 100ks even 100 MERS and folks we just reviewed the ultra Venture for and like that's something it punches above its weight class in terms of like what you can handle in it and and maybe what it's described as being yeah but you're right there sometimes I would want a little more out of some of the technical features yeah a little bit more um definitely in terms of Stack height but on the ultra vendor especially we had some customers that were just looking for a little bit more out of the outsole cuz we wanted to and we didn't want to change that we wanted to keep that designed for really mile to moderate Terrain Road to Trail use allow for folks um that want room Trail pack single track things of that nature so we wanted to bring out the Vista with even more cushioning and a more aggressive lugging as well yep so this is the highest stack heite we've ever put out in our Trail line with a 38 to 33 mm midsole platform we have uh vbra Mega grip outsole with 4 mm lugs uh and a segmented outsole design to allow the outsole to flex semi-independently allowing it to kind of adapt to the underfoot terrain so it's not going to kind of Kick the whole shoe out if you're running over rocks are underr relating Trail it's going to flex into the midle just keeping you really comfortable and secure over the platform okay um as you felt the soft as zip foam we've run on our Trail line before super soft I want to throw these on right now after a day at the EV I've been sending near daily AML store production team begging them for my FIT trial pair so yeah as soon as I have it let you know uh along with that um we're going to be using our fkt insole here as well that same insole that you saw on the Mountain racer made from TPU needs and then we also have that new pokon Loop Gator system on the heel yeah and I I mean just looking at this the colorways you guys are bringing out too this looks good this is a trail shoe that looks good thank you I appreciate that yeah we're we're really excited with the kind of evolution of our Aesthetics in on recent lines and and feel like we're really headed in the right direction okay looks good feels good ready to run any Trail really that's awesome yeah yeah so like I said retails for 170 will weigh right around 10.9 o and look for this shoe when it comes out in June awesome thank you very much Russ all right thank you Taylor appreciate it",

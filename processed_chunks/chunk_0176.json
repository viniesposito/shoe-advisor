  "text": "[Music] all right hi this is Thomas believe in the run this Robby with believe in the run and this is Megan with believe in the run and I don't know why I'm yelling but that was quite aggressive yells at Clouds this is the last podcast of 2024 really limping into the end here yeah I feel like wheels are coming off everyone's sick everyone's sick I think you know this is like I was been looking forward to this time because we traveled a lot we did a lot of things I was just like we'll get to the holidays we can kind of relax and I think my body is gone and said okay yeah let's get sick let's everything's broken yeah yeah I mean everyone's getting sick around these parts I think it's inevitable when it the weather gets cold I mean actually I think you two got it at the gym I that's why my theory I was going to go with that as well I don't know everyone's that or maybe I don't know my kids also get sick so maybe Robbie brought it in yeah Robbie's the real problem yeah I'm the small poox blanket of Believe In The Run hey Robie before we get started you got a package from tracksmith why don't you rip it open and let's see what's in it oh we're already starting Christmas presents I think I know what's in it I hope I know what's in it it's going to be so good tracksmith came out with this new piece of apparel it's what it is oh yeah it is actually that man yes they're running bibs what size are those dude that does look big looks big no it's a small look I mean they come up to your armpits and you got pockets in the back like a it's like a reverse is it like a reverse that actually is kind of cool basically like the same thing you'd wear if you went skiing or cycling yeah except for no no uh shammy yeah I don't know the pocket I think would be cooler front like a sweatshirt like on the bottom that's what I was trying to figure out do you wear what do you mean on the bottom like your do you wear underwear when with your no I think it's just normal tights like you don't wear anything underneath I don't wear any do you no man okay are you a never nude um but they what's a never nude it's from Arrested Development Tobias fun uh there's dozens of them but so you're going to wear a t-shirt under or a long sleeve or whatever shirt under that and that's it yeah I think I guess so that's kind of weird dude I dare you to run around with not a jacket over the top of that just a long sleeve shirt that's how they model itas I'll do it on Christmas yeah how else you going to model it like you can't show it with a jacket over cuz then you can't see it and if you wore a top over it would just look like normal running tights right so you got to wear underneath Farmer John I I will say I don't know I don't understand the utility of these versus a normal pair of running tights it keeps you warmer allegedly allegedly I mean so does a thicker like or a light jacket yeah but this makes it real challenging if you ever have to go to the bathroom the bathroom putting them on oh dude I wish it had a flap in the back like old uh cartoons where they had the just good the ouse and pull that flap down yeah this is I love tracksmith but this is an unnecessary I don't know what's waiting see what Robbie says maybe it's the new favorite thing yeah we got to test it out dude you should run with no shirt on underneath it's just the bib it's illegal in some countries it look like look like Bor B ass Carl's and Carl now has switched sides he's into it yeah he's going to cut the legs off it'll just be a banana hammock with the straps yeah I like it all right well I'll try it out I did actually run in the Fels turtleneck this past yesterday actually when it was very like 15 degrees and uh it was like I thought it was 20 was it it was in Pennsylvania you were that was a mistake there was actually I just wore that with a light Marino layer over top of that it was it was perfect my question though is like you ran in that mauno shoe that we all like which on my ratings on the you know I'm trying to get more accurate with the rating system for the videos yeah and I felt like I put it almost close to like yellow and I think it's a really good shoe but because of the way that we rate things now um it'll it'll be interesting because everybody likes it you like it me likes it I like it but I was thinking you were in colder temps did it affect the um I didn't I feel like it's such a soft foam that I don't feel like it really did I was a little nervous because the first there was a couple inches of snow on the ground so the first couple miles of it's like a you know where we went running yeah I recognized your Strava map I was like oh that's where we went yeah for Robbie's bachelor party that's not a bachelor party yeah midlife grais bachelor party didn't it feel like a bachelor party Carl it kind of was in a way uh we had like yeah we had Robbie's mom and uh Justine arsing yeah that was it yeah my mom wasn't hanging out the whole time she's she helped with the food but anyways just a little dancing left she still got it she still got it the and my uncle brought his stripper raccoons with it was good yeah the tassels were amazing yeah how do you train a raccoon to do that I don't know you can trust me um but they yeah so there's snow on the ground I was running at first in straight snow I was like this is a horrible idea um and then you got to the gay snow yeah yeah and it was super colorful and all all was good no it was then the crush gravel was showed up and it was fine uh but yeah it was I was wearing those tracksmith ndo tights which are like those without the suspenders yeah pretty much well they're you know how they're almost like a wet suit yeah I get the worst uh chaing grundle CH from those and I just take a whole handful of snow and shove it down with tights no that would make it worse yeah that's not the answer believe it or not it actually helped what all right yeah I don't understand that somebody who's a scientists in our audience maybe can help with this I can wear like the short tights yeah pretty much guaranteed to get grundle chafe uhhuh but I can wear regular tights and pretty much be fine oh weird maybe it's just a certain cut any short typ or is it because the weather that maybe I'm sweating a little more when you're wearing the shorts I don't know that's probably what it is but I there's nothing rubbing there I don't understand what's causing the friction I don't know some sort of yeah maybe there's it's antimatter or something dark matter yeah uh but I I do like it when it's super cold out like today this morning that was too cold for me she just as long as after you get past that first mile me didn't she came back in her skin was red I don't I don't think I was wearing warm enough stuff actually I that's probably why my upper body was fine I was wearing the new rabbit jacket they just sent called warm up and go I think that's what it's called yep sorry rabbit and that sounds about right and it was good so my like upper body was fine but yeah my legs felt like I Les I have to say the rabbit tights I think Traxx makes a great tight but the rabbit pocket tight oh is also one of my favorites for the winter that's actually probably my second favorite especially when it's getting cold yeah is it thicker it's thicker yeah which is funny because they're from California yeah but that is one thing they do really well is it the trail tights I think I I I think they mine are just the pocket tights yeah I don't know I don't know they are though I wear those all the time and trying to think what else was it is sometimes it's hard to dial in those temperatures but when you do is it's it's great I don't know but I nice I will tell you this we've been recommending those car hard gloves yeah and I wore those the other day when it was 20\u00b0 cuz I'm like 20\u00b0 too warm one yeah and when I I stopped to change my music cuz I had like this this new punk rock playlist and I was like not vibing on it so I stopped to change the music had to take the gloves off trying to get them back my hands back in cuz my hands were a little bit like not even that sweaty but just a little bit trying to get them back in yeah was nearly impossible I felt like it was like two things of rubber trying to go past each other it's like I know what you're talking about actually but yeah those are for running yeah it's almost has to be below 10\u00b0 today would have been a good day for it I think yeah I had mittens on and I was still cold well the good news is I think you got a pair now for Christmas okay Thomas can't really good with the with the surprises really can't resist surprise oh man we should have just brought them in for the show this at that point I think they're probably from M's mom um just open Amazon package even better um yeah but otherwise what else has been going on well I wanted to since this is our last show of the Year recap the Year talk about some fun stats hey before we get into that can we talk about a show that we watched uh well we watched another Christmas movie but besides that we watch what Christmas movie red one red one yeah what is red one the one with the rock last night B oh yeah it was I thought it was about a Santa Claus it red one oh it really red one is Santa Claus okay so by the way it also sounds like a Russian spy movie the dude who does those State Farm commercials is like Santa Claus in this okay you looked up his name JK something yeah uh I forgot oh yeah from dude the drumming movie dude is strapped yeah oh really ripped and apparently he started working out when he was like 61 for a movie or something he's he had he like remember he had to like lose a bunch of weight for this role and then he wanted to gain it back so he started this like strength routine oh and he got jacked what was the what was the drumming movie Whiplash yeah and I don't know if I is that good yeah he's like intimidating in that movie okay so it's a great movie he gets jacked and he's playing side by side with the rock so you know look like you got any muscles at all next to the rock is impressive yeah dude's 69 wow man we looked up everything that's cool we know his background the movie on the other hand that was ter it had a lot of Rotten Tomatoes 30% Rotten Tomatoes it earned him yeah I mean hot Froot hot Frosty's been the Talk of the Town is it did you watch it I haven't yet but I heard I heard people talk about it at parties all kinds of stuff oh yeah I think it's so no we haven't out there that it's it's almost so bad it's good yeah kind of thing but yeah I think it helps that that guy is also jacked in the movie yeah so man Jack he's shredded yeah shredded he's shredded jul Julian salad um soy boys are out jacked and shredded is in that is true we also May so I started I go on Prime TV to watch the Beast show oh yeah and that's what I wanted to talk about and uh I I start watching I'm like I actually think me would like this uhhuh so I me was about to go out on a run I was like hey come here check this out cuz I won't watch ion I won't watch this if you like it uhuh I'll wait till we can watch it together Meg was glued to her seat and so we were like all right good I hate how much I I couldn't stop watching it I was like this is so dumb and I was like but I can't stop watching it no it's amazing the psychological game he comes up with is so messed up I was telling Thomas I was like does he have a degree in Psychology like where does this come from I'm sure he has Consultants that are like this is what will happen if you do this because that they so when I I'm Psychology major and throughout College they like they did all these tests after World War II to find out why the German public would go along with like extermination of the Jews and they did all these tests of like obeying authority figures and doing what you're told and we are kind of messed up yeah people yeah but like the the fact that there was such high emotion so early on was crazy well I think when people have that idea that just that seed is planet that you could have $5 million yeah I guess we should tell people who don't know what we're talking about what the premise of the show is so Mr well first of all who's Mr Beast I mean if you don't know who Mr Beast is you probably shouldn't be listening to this yeah but no he's the most he's the biggest YouTuber of all time he has like 300 million subscribers just ridiculous but I don't know I would say probably more kids watch it but teens but at this point I feel like most people know I think I don't know well maybe especially after this show which yeah yeah just started what is it even called Beast games Beast games so he's doing the largest game show in history which has a $5 million grand prize and giving away tons of more money like Millions every day and there's a thousand contestants it starts out with a thousand but it goes down pretty fast yeah so you start weeding out uh the contestants pretty quickly but the games and everything they're ridiculous the the people who like self-identified to drop out that that part was the craziest part for me I think like I yeah that wasn't so interesting to me and I was we were waiting for like the people that sacrific themselves for this whole other team to win like I was expecting Mr Beast to be like yeah here's a or here's a prize and it was just like bye I wonder if they come back later in the show but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't yeah I've only watched the first episode they had to eliminate a thousand I mean it's it starts with a thousand people I doubt those people are coming back the other thing that I thought was crazy is the people that informatically were like I won't take the deal I won't take the deal I won't take the deal and then they take the deal like and you're like you just screwed everybody everyone on your team yeah I mean like people are inherently selfish and terrible people I feel like like that guys falls apart quickly like you said with the whole self survival is there's two parts to it though you feel like when you start cracking you're like if I'm cracking then someone else is going to there somebody else will crack and this is my opportunity CU like right now they ended on the second episode with like a cliffhanger I haven't seen a second one yet I'm waiting to watch with my kids I won't tell you what happens but it's a cliffhanger and it's getting to a point where you know someone's going to fold and it's going to eliminate an entire team of people I mean the worst one for me was was and we can move on after there is a Mr be cuz he he does all these kinds of games on his show at other points but he had two people living together for I think several months and they were in the same room I remember you telling us about this yeah and then at the very end he gave him the chance to steal the other person's money like right when they were leaving the room like they were each going to get $500,000 or something and he was like you have 30 seconds to steal the other person's money I was like dude that's messed up did of them take it they didn't like but you know they would never see each other again they could it's pretty yeah but you got to live with that for the rest of your life I know but and the $500,000 I mean your taxes T be taking with taxes but anyway so it that that is entertaining that was I was looking forward to watching that the thing is that his premises are so simple mhm that you're like why isn't anybody done this but it's the resources he has yeah he built a city well what I love about him is that the whole rock and too he's been H he's just having fun and so he's like if he makes money he puts it back into having more fun that's what I love about him so much is that he he doesn't because he's definitely had a buyout offers from you know networks or companies but he literally just loves what he does and he doesn't do it for the money at all like he just pours everything right back into it which is why it's so successful and he's partly autistic stick I'm pretty sure like I think he's even said that they did they did have problems like my son was telling me that um one of the guys was got in trouble for messaging little boys oh yeah oh yeah I remember that he's not he's no longer on the show that makes sense um I mean but at this point Mr be has got to be worth a ton he's got chocolate brand well just his brand value the day he's got restaurant stuff have you ever looked it up yeah I did I did when we were watching and I forget what it said what I thought with genius is what he did during um Co where he 500 million put his Burgers into other people's oh yeah restaurants yeah no he's he's smarter whoever his team is but anyways uh so yeah that that's been cool and yeah what did I I had too much caffeine yesterday and sometimes I'll wake up that's do you know when you you wake up the middle of night and you can't go back to sleep why did you have so much caffeine I don't know I was just drinking stuff with caffeine in it like all day and night Monster Energy I had a couple these of coffee and then I had some Diet Dr Pepper in the afternoon and that usually in conjunction I don't do well with caffeine Dr Pepper has his caffeine mhm yeah and then so I woke up in the middle of night and I was thinking about you know all this stuff probably that we're doing now and you just start thinking about everything in life yeah that's the ones where I wake up and Mak like why did you get up and I'm like cuz I just knew I was up like yeah there's a certain level of alertness I almost I almost was there and then I was managed to fall back asleep but I I for some reason I think I had this dream about a cat like a kitten type cat kitty cat yeah and and I had this idea in my head that I couldn't let go of which was if if you found the two biggest house cats in the world okay and started what what size are what would you consider the biggest house cat like a large Tom cat like um like this big right or those cats that you like that are like I one of those that look like leopards yeah no these are just I'm talking like they are domesticated type cat talking a big big fat cat like Garfield yeah yeah and you started and you bred them could you eventually well if they're two Tom Cats you can't or what's the Tam cat what's the opposite of a tom cat I think just a female cat a mom cat so if you take those and you would breed them to create bigger Cats Could you ever reach the size of a tiger no over time I mean you could probably get a giant cat yeah like you could manipulate into larger and larger cats but it would probably like have like health issues you know how humans over time have gotten taller yeah so I'm talking about if you did this over centuries could you take a normal house centuries they reproduce a lot faster than us and if you we ours is naturally through selection happen we could artificially select for them and so so it could happen yeah I think you could that's they do that like that's have you heard I just want to see if you could have a house cat that was as big as a tiger they mix uh Buffalo with Buffalo with regular like bows and and steer oh and they got that what is it called like the like a liger it's kind of like that it's a it's a very hearty like big bowl thing bread with bread for skills and Magic yeah okay well anyway sorry that was ridiculous but I I was legitimately thinking about that 4:00 a.m. and wondering how if that could have be ACH I like how that's what you're thinking about when you get up you're like yeah I was thinking about working today and mostly it it's spun it's spun out of control well I will tell you there's a bunch of cats behind the hair's Teeter so you could probably start there and a bunch of animal food well yeah oh do you get so we're driving around there there are bags of dog food they must like expire and then they just put it out by the dumpster oh like the Petco yeah bags I'm talking like bags no way and I was just like like it's like hundreds and probably thousands of dollars worth of dog I would dumpster dive that well I was thinking what do you do with expired dog food who'd eat it it's a dog I'm prettyy sure I I thought you were just saying for yourself like yeah out like it could be camping food yeah I mean it's kibble dude it's F you think your dog is going to put up a fight if you throw down the it's not it's the same the expiration dates are suggestions always that's true we've talked about this that's that's just science all right first check in man year comes after your fast but this is great because you have the start of 2025 to make some new habits and maybe go after some new goals so this is a perfect time if you you know want to go after a mileage goal or maybe start lifting weights to you know help out with your running this is the time to set those goals and uh kind of make an effort to do it all right guys element is still a sponsor of this podcast but for a limited time they're offering their chocolate medley ooh that SS pretty delicious you know it's not like the you're not going to put that in your bubbly water no you could could you could uh you want it heated up I think yeah some hot water with either the chocolate mint the chocolate chai or the chocolate raspberry I've heard it's pretty good in coffee too you could also put it in your coffee okay would you do it before your run yeah okay some hot coffee some chocolate medley I do like a mocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also our offer is still available so you can go to element.com thedrop and get a free element sample pack do you know if the sample pack would have this chocolate in yeah there you go so go get them and enjoy are there really that cuz sometimes I'll drive back there just see there's anything out there so my whole trick now is like if you drive the normal way you're supposed to drive in that parking lot I always no this has always been my trick I always go behind yeah so that we have a shopping center near us and the parking lot is clear clearly designed by people who designs parking lots it's like the Hunger Game parking lot yeah and it's just horrible like we saw somebody hit a boulder in that parking line and rip open the side of their car it's a bad design I say so yeah so I started driving behind and popping up the the back yeah you were all ending that oh yeah that's been cuz I used to ride my bike kind of back there just checking things out and then I realized this is way faster to do this go drive past the Tesla Chargers yeah which that's a weird scene back there oh just people hanging out in their cars I think they're all Uber drivers or something just charging while they're yeah sitting waiting yeah but um you can't look in those dumpsters though there's too many people driving past these are but the dog bags are outside of the dumpster that must just stacked up man that's crazy I hope someone does get those cuz presumably they wouldn't be that out of date I'm wondering if like even the people that like even if you're the garbage guy you like oh bags Giant and I'm talking those giant bags like the it's I don't know how many pounds that' be like 50 lbs yeah 30 lb that seems like too much 30b maybe of dog food like in a big sack I don't know man I'm sure if you look in the dumpster there's some animals too but oh I hope not but anyway there's cats living back there and so we could try that experiment see if we can make a giant cat yeah the cat Situation's out of control in general too many cats they're they're an invasive invasive species cats yeah house cats they're they're killing bir populations at unprecedented rates do you have any stats to back this up I I yeah I have looked these stats up recently and they're it's it's out of control there needs there should be some sort of I think Robbie should get a ranger outfit and just walk around City Stun Gun jur Hill and just be like I'm the I'm now the urban Ranger I bet you could and no one would stop you no no if you had a if you had just a badge yeah and like all green outfit everybody think oh you are give him your uh Adidas media vest' be good to go like think about it what what Authority like if you saw a dude walking by and he had like oh yeah State Park badge and like a right little thing you'd be like oh yeah yeah and in Baltimore nobody knows what's going on in the government anyway so they would you could convince them probably seen a lot of anti Baltimore Instagrams in my feeds now why like people like filming like they go to like the crappiest areas and film like the boarded up houses and stuff and they're like don't visit Baltimore oh that's at first I got mad but like I'm like no maybe our people need to see this that this is what's being projected out there and this is what I mean we got to fix this stuff I'm pretty sure people's opinions on Baltimore are solidified at this point yeah but like at this point we keep I don't want to get I mean I agree with you I agree with you there I mean yeah there should be some sort of pressure to change things or make things better yeah but there's a lot of layers to that [Music] um yeah at least our cars haven't gotten stolen this week what a week years that's our that's our no your yours is the one that gets broken into you got to stop leaving stuff like owner manuals in your car I know I just got a new license plate and I uh I'm like why do I even put my registration card in there I know it's just going to get taken out at some point but whatever um yeah I'm excited for so Meg let's go over some of these year end stats um not year out stats like do you remember everything we did yeah I know I got to go through our trips but okay podcast wise what do you guys think was our number one episode maybe you already looked and saw actually hav't is it Boston Marathon yeah oh the Boston Marathon recap fans who like the drop also like The Joe Rogan Experience Alli on the Run armchair expert with Dak Shepard nobody asked us with desen Cara and the cious mag podcast okay first off we need a different list The Joe Rogan Experience is skewed because it's literally the most popular podcast just across genres so I feel like that's going to be anyone who listens to any podcast almost it's going to be also the number one or in the top five whereas and it's such a huge podcast it's so much bigger than any any other one and then was then did we turn off the heat cuz it's getting cold down here dude there's no heat in here okay go ahead uh cuz even with the heat on it was so it's still cold okay um the Alli on the run that makes sense yeah I mean the rest are well armchair expert with Dak sheer one and then obviously cious and do and Cara you know what has fallen off that I used to really enjoy is the um smart list yeah smart list you know what the smart smart list podcast has become almost unlistenable with the amount of ads in it is that the problem it's unbelievable it's there's so many ads uh even I think Conan's podcast has a lot too now but the smartless one for sure is just so many that it's I hate skipping through it so often and they're long too it's like five minutes of ads um I don't really listen to that many podcasts but um I don't know what happened I was I might have been in my car and I wanted oh I know what happened I was listening to the BBC and they had this um thing on this like yoga school that was actually trafficking people and so I started listening to that and when that went off the next podcast that came up was a Joe Rogan podcast and I hadn't really listen to um Joe Rogan uh I was like well you know I'll just check this out yeah let it roll and I was like oh this is actually pretty interesting it was the one about um the drones and what's going on with the oh yeah yeah I feel like I've listen I listen to some of that one just CU I'm interested in the Drone stuff but what's your theory what's happening I mean I'd say it's pretty much it's definitely us but I don't know what the purpose is I know this because I I've I've I have a couple friends who have are in space to know and they're just like I can't talk about it so it's like that means it's a thing but they can't they're like we can't say anything it's that uh I can neither confirm nor deny yeah so you know I don't know what it is but it's maybe a new shoe release that is under embargo yeah that's what it is it's a new it's going to be a box from Nike that you're going to open up and have a shoe inside of it yeah just sending them out to influencers in the New Jersey area with we can't we can't talk about it my parents said they saw one over the near our farm on two separate nights exact same location and it wasn't like start like wasn't there the night before the one after like I would miss it cuz we're normally watching hot Frosty stuff night so it would go right by my house they're proba knocking on her window and we're like's barking we're like shut up try to watch Hot Frosty what if the Drone was trying to watch Hot Frosty though well maybe they're like hey they figured us out we're the snow aliens yeah give us that magic scarf wow um okay so website wise we had about five million visitors which is cool top pages five wait you just blew right over that this is the stuff that blows my mind cuz like I can picture like when we get a few thousand people watching a video or watching this I go okay over time I can understand how that happens you know there's interest in a particular issue or something like that but 5 million visits unique visitors to the website that's that's insane yeah that's that is that's a lot of hum um this is what's most insane though outside of obviously like the home page you mind if we got a dollar for everybody who visited that'd be nice yeah maybe we should set up a gofund me to open on our page yeah just if you visit pay $1 or yeah to open this page you must submit a dollar like Wikipedia I want to punch the screen every time I open Wikipedia and they're begging and they're begging me for money yeah they don't even write that stuff oh and they have and they're like there's a whole thing with that's a whole different story anyways um but so anyway outside of obviously the homepage and stuff the main pages that were visited and this one's GNA make one person extremely happy is it a person with wide feet yeah number one is the best wide foot running shoes number two was sakon endorphin speed 4 okay then hokok 6 as6 Nova blast 4 and then best running shoes of 2024 so far okay makes sense what's crazy to me about that is you're going to see one Trend kind of go across and it's the speed four like this shoe they must I didn't really how popular thato they're not selling this like on a conveyor belt yeah they should be because it's across the board on all our stuff and I didn't I don't even think of it as like I know you guys love it but to me it's like an okay shoe yeah yeah that's a good one yeah I think it probably just it works yeah it's so versatile okay um so YouTube stats 6 million views in 2024 that even crazier 6 million people look at our faces yeah and then feel sorry for them the top videos are always usually like our top shoes so race day was one of them 15 most exciting the two shoes that stood out though which I wouldn't have expected was the New Balance Rebel V4 that was our third most popular video so wait give us some numbers cuz like when we were looking at it I was like Blown Away by the the best running shoes for race day in 2024 had just under 200k views 200,000 views best running shoes for race day yeah oh wow and then the second one was the 15 most exciting running shoes of 2024 that 120k okay New Balance Rebel V4 92k 15 favorite running shoes of 2024 75k and then the S indorfin speed 4 came in at Fifth Place most popular yeah that's impressive so I'm guessing they're selling a lot of those or people are just looking at it could go either way yeah I'm just that is that's interesting though I I I wouldn't have expected that what I thought was interest because you pulled up Instagram stuff yeah get into that like there there's two brands that are definitely hot with our audience and I would say two three years ago it would have been different brands uhhuh yeah so just looking at like photos and that type of content the most popular was A6 across the board like the top three but then the second top three second three were all New Balance shoes wow yeah A6 in New Balance on top and at least with our audience Thomas loves the most popular reels of 2024 I do just the shoe the New Balance shoe yeah pressing which it's still for 2024 those are the top two but here's the crazy thing it's the original one and then the Remake that's ridiculous the original has close to 2 million views on it own which is so silly yeah that's insane and then yeah some unboxings and stuff but nothing too crazy um in terms of that yeah I was looking at our our um our trips from the year and it was pretty wild name all the places that we went okay Orlando La that was just me Boston Venice nurg Brooklyn back to New York Lake Tahoe for two events uh slow Nashville Boston Columbus St Petersburg Ridgefield Paris Berlin Chicago New York Austin dude hurts my head We've Been Everywhere man yeah worldwide no that's a song I was going Happ oh so yeah it was it was quite a year very eventful but what like what were what were some of your favorites I know we kind of touched on a on our individual podcast but yeah in terms of like favorite work event what do you think it was I mean Olympics has to be up there for sure ah this it's so hard because I always love Boston there's just a different vibe there like it's almost like the running event is industry people that you get to see Boston is like running Community it's like you see everyone you see the industry people you see the athletes you see it's just like even if and I would tell anybody even if you're not running Boston even if you're yeah not and maybe you may never run Boston who cares come to be part of the it's like a celebration of running yeah just there's an entire street that is dedicated to all your favorite Brands there's uh spectating is just as much fun as running it's yeah it's definitely like a carnival for without the dunking booth unfortunately for uh for runners we got to get RAB a dunking booth I know one one of these events it's going to work out yeah it so I really love that but then for me visiting Germany and going to the Adidas headquarters there's two like I when I went to the Nike headquarters I was like wow this is what like this is what where people get to work for and it's like really impressive and I felt the same way when we went to Adidas that it was just so mindblowing and seeing the archives and the different stuff and and just being in in nurg I thought was such a beautiful city um especially if you're not on trial there yeah it's always a good or thing to just visit probably yeah there's a couple times you wouldn't want to be there but uh it was a be beautiful city I mean that was a fun trip yeah I kind of I kind of a little bummed uh I mean it was just situation at the time but it seemed like it was cool for sure like it was so different than Berlin right it's kind of like you know how people would be like New York and they think of America I think people think of Berlin and they think of Germany yeah but nurg was more like going to like a German Village I don't know how okay it was like it seemed like a smaller town and like Cape Cod or like if you went to like somewhere in New England that was yeah nice uh like not New York City you know it it was still a city but it just had this like a charm to it like theur cobblestone streets and which that thing must have gotten hammered with I don't know how they rebuilt everything to look like it's been there for centuries but almost looked like probably Deep Creek Maryland yeah just like it pretty much um and then the Olympics were just so surreal it's even hard for me even now to wrap my head around the Olympics like for me that was such a um you know what was my favorite part I think was I thought the whole Olympics We are the world [ __ ] was like not a thing like I was like thing they do on TV oh the world's come together everyone's in unity but it actually felt like that when you were there like everyone was super happy the everyone's from all over the world different countries but when you're in the stands and like walking about everyone's just super positive even I think Paris in general felt like that and I was like man that actually was a real thing which is cool and it is it's a testament to like how much you can't get fooled by like the media and just by politics that like when we're all together as people and it's sport involved and I think that's why Kip chogi is always like if everybody ran we'd all get along just fine except for yakob b or britson and Josh kry Josh kry um yeah but it it is such a like fun environment of just yeah there's you didn't care if someone was like the you know rooting for Greece over here or you know a different country over here there was no animosity there was no it was more friendly than even like a soccer match or a um like a football game yeah well because I think it's like these are the best of the best athletes like it's just cool to spectate any of them because these are like the best most talented humans in the world so I think it's just exciting to be in that environment and like yeah I don't know I think I would have liked Venice a little bit better if it had been warmer I think I was cold the whole time I was and if they didn't lose our luggage yeah yeah it was Venice was cool though that and that was the first time I been to Italy so yeah I'm just saying I would have liked it more like I I liked it for sure but just even more I still can't get over the fact that you can't get hung over on Italian wine like I'm not sure that's 100% accurate dude it's true it's it's facts okay I Googled it too and there's so many things on Reddit and and person but you can buy that wine here I think they still add more soft fights to preserve it if they're shipping it here I don't know man they I and but like but that explains why we had prco at every single meal dude I yeah and you don't you feel fine the next day like no matter how much you drank I never had if I drank that amount of wine or whatever in the US it the running event yeah okay that was a little above and beyond the call Call of Duty there Robbie became a some remind me never to do a dinner with tasting again I think next time we go to Italy we have to test out this Theory and see how much you can drink I'm pretty sure we tested it out not to that extent but we definitely had some good nights yeah I also thought California was a really good trip the western states and the um Broken Arrow like I thought that was good for like I like the group of people that we are with yeah was good no I feel just the pretty much that's why Taylor's coming on fulltime because I was like yeah you're yeah you're kind of cool to hang out with Carl needs someone to go in the hot tub with does he though Western States was also cool cuz I I've never experienced it like firsthand and you always see it happening on your news feed or whatever but actually being there it was it was just totally different and then I was like so hooked and interested in the people running that I was watching the YouTube all the way home on our flight and so yeah that was that was definitely cool what that was one of the craziest things is that our flight left after the race started yeah we got back to home like all the way across the country and then watch the finish and watch people finishing the next day you you saw the race start though like it wasn't like your flight started when you saw this race this guy Carl from the top of a mountain uh I'm trying to think of a alliteration for not Carl going up the mountain camera Carl camera no more like I'm trying like more like a billy go climbing Carl climbing Carl uh he was that morning was a long morning we climbed up to the top it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen I was freezing my ass off but it was worth it because the photos the photos just were I I don't know how you could take a bad photo up there second check in hope you're enjoying our recap I'm sure you're thinking about your year and kind of thinking back on all the good stuff that happened and isn't it funny you tend to start to forget the bad stuff and you start to focus on the good stuff and I found that that's always the way that at least my mind works the further you get away from stuff the good stuff remains and the bad stuff goes away so if you had a rough year let's hope that 2025 is even better all right guys let's talk about our sponsor Lagoon pillows all right let's do it we've been using them for years now still my favorite pillow ever and now's a great time to gift a pillow do you ever remember sleep without a lagoon pillow under your head I mean when we travel and it's not great yeah I I felt like the last toe we were at it was almost like someone rolled up some socks and put it in the pillow to give it the stuffing socks and rocks yeah yeah well if you want a really great pillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com believe there is a quiz right on that page just hit the button fill out your information say what you like what you don't like and it'll populate the perfect pillow for you and if you use the code believe at checkout you can also save um but yeah and then just seeing the athletes come through and knowing that it was only the beginning of their trip how many miles was that up that was like three right not even three or four and they still so they had 97 miles to go they're all pumped up they're all feeling good they're coming through it was it was pretty insane and the fact that there was probably 100 spectators at the top of that mountain yeah just like cheering these guys on like it's got to be anti-climatic after that because you climb the mountain you get this big cheering group at the top of the mountain and then you've got 97 miles of no more people but they've got Crews and yeah it's not the same as like reaching the top of the mountain and having to run through a tunnel of people yeah but um yeah that was sick that's cool and I do have to give an update because the podcast went out uh with me telling you what I was excited about for 2025 one of the things was something I'm not doing the OC was sold out so we are Carl and I are not running the 35 mile race are you relieved or sad uh yeah it there's a part of me that's like okay yeah that's that's okay and there's a part of me that's like oh that's kind of like that was going to be something big we are doing a 20K version which is also weird because I think it's actually only 15K but they're listing as a 20K and they're giving you the extra because they say the vertical climb is so much that it's worth a 20K so it's just an arbitrary number well the other one was a 50k but it was 35 miles so I they're just like ah this is close yeah I think it's like that European thing yeah close enough yeah yeah um yeah that's okay that's cool though so uh yeah Carl will be doing that Taylor myself we're we're all we are all signed up and we'll be running that with craft if you guys not the cheese not this singles I might also have Crafty car singles with me yeah crafty car Carl that's a good one yeah um if you guys had to choose one brand of the year would it be like in terms of maybe overall best running shoes or most Innovative h i mean it's tough I would I would say the t uh like if you think of the top I'm trying to think about the shoes that came out trying think brand shoe brands yeah I mean the top shoes that we picked out for most of our stuff were always Adidas as6 and Hoka and New Balance I would say were our top I think Hoka did some pretty cool stuff uh I mean Brooks honestly yeah I think Brooks next year okay and I brought the Brooks Hyperion Elite for PB and which we'll talk about yeah I ran in that I I also feel like asex I would push into 2025 like I don't feel like they did anything amazing this year yeah they have amazing stuff coming they were consistent this year yeah yeah I feel like Nike came is starting to creep back from the depths true like they've had some cool stuff especially towards the end of year that's going to be a 2025 yeah um Adidas had some really good stuff but that's also kind of coming 2025 see and I kind of feel weird about this because I do like our best of if it if we could have included would have probably included two Adidas shoes that we didn't include the pro four which yeah but doesn't come out till that one definitely doesn't come out till next year so that hasn't even been on sale yeah you you have been able to buy it at like Expos and stuff just not not I mean Mass wait how did uh how did uh Eric and get it no it has been on sale yeah wait right I think I was thinking the white color way um yeah no I guess I mean but it came out yeah right so it's all after Thanksgiving yeah but yeah if they just released stuff in a month before they there Adidas's strategy for release is strange to so originally they when they came out and yeah you can buy the pro for right now yeah you can but originally it was supposed to be January 1st yes and then then theel was supposed to be March which now it it like they did a drop with dicks or whatever in some running warehouse but this is confusing to me cuz like okay where do you want us to put this shoe yeah and we we could have legitimately given it top marks for 2024 now it's in 2025 plus you know that we're going to see some crazy stuff in 2025 so if they just push those releases up a little bit like or just honestly if they would have just told us oh it's dropping in first week of December I feel like we could have right after Thanksgiving yeah but we didn't know that before we put out our lists yeah what about Sak uh they had some cool stuff towards the end of the year is the Endorphin Elite 2 on no that's March I think it's all 2025 uh no not them yeah like they had some okay stuff although I will say I didn't run in the Triumph or I did yeah and I've run in the ride and I like the ride it's fine but I think that that Solomon shoe is a better version of it the oh what's the Solomon um Glide Max or no Arrow Glide yeah yeah it might be the arrow Glide two or three yeah three I thought that was same concept same type of foam better shoe speaking of someone asked me about they can't remember they're a bigger Runner or they just needed some stability in a race stoe and they were like what I I I I'm looking I'm running my first marathon around four hours or something like that I was like dude just get the slab Spectre and they said they took it out for 20 mile long run and it was amazing oh nice like yeah like perfect it's made a few people's lists yeah for the end of the year I Solomon's a sleeper I don't know how to get more people to try them for their Road shoes but there's something weird that they they kind of have this premium feel for the trails and then they kind of it doesn't carry over to the road for them yeah yeah like some of their shoes it's a little Hit or Miss um what about what about mauno is the comeback shoe of the year I think what about New Balance they've had some good stuff New Balance had some good stuff I my favorite this year from them is probably the rebel Pacer yeah the Pacer I did like the Pacer too I really liked the new SC Trainer I know you guys didn't as much yeah I was meum and I was surprised some people like the ballast but I thought I did it wasn't it was a good shoe just I'm unsure of where it fits but I it's one of those ones I felt similar to the Endorphin trainer that it's like a shoe that's like is it worth like oh you did the peba and stuff it feel feels like a premium 1080 yeah but not enough for me to go let me drop another 50 bucks like I'd be like oh this feels like the 1080 yeah totally um trying to think what else I like the newcomer we gave to mount Coast yeah I like their shoes they have some cool stuff coming in they came in hot out of nowhere yeah I I think um definitely Muno up and coming from traditional brand that's been out of it for a while Nike would also be on that list yeah yeah um I think 2025 might be a pretty fun year for shoes and Brands it's I feel like it's so I feel like some brands are in an in between year and then other ones are turning the page you think like 2026 is going to be I think so yeah I don't know I think we're going to see a couple fun things from asex this year yeah I'm I I actually I think we are you got to try that racer I I think this is going to be a big year for A6 yeah probably I uh on the trail the trail side is Bonkers though the trail side's coming out crazy like for 2025 just is it norta o5 2025 [ __ ] Mar that's going to be ridiculous the people are going to love that even the satisfy shoe looks oh yeah The Rocker super legit um when can we post our video on The Rocker that's until February or something okay or whenever they yeah it's weird cuz they put all the specs like and all the details on their Instagram but just haven't shown a full photo of the shoe I'm just put the shoe out there yeah um but it's not coming till July oh oh it's not yeah oh that's a ways away it's a pretty it's a pretty shoe yeah um and then the I just so many trail trail shoe brands are out there and coming out really awesome stuff The North Face is pretty much at the top creating some crazy good shoes so I've seen some of the new arc TK stuff and I don't know we know that one of the designers that we really loved from New Balance is there now yeah but they're kind of getting away from what I thought was kind of their look which was that really clean like silhouette and matter of fact Taylor he had that slab black boot zip up thing I was like that looks to me like I'm surprised that hasn't caught on with like the fashion yeah probably will it's it's like a very cool looking uh we're reviewing a couple of the arteric shoes right now yeah I saw Taylor posted them and I'm like oh they're I'm wondering if these are ones that our guy is working on because they it looks different than what we've seen in the past yeah I'm not sure I have no idea but yeah I think the trail scene is going to see some really cool stuff normal um and there's so many Brands too coming out and making Trail stuff do you think that the trail side is easier than the road side uh like what do you mean I for me the dirt surfaces are more forgiving and a lot of times if you can make a good upper that holds your foot over a midsole oh you don't have to get as crazy with the midsole and then you just have to make sure you have like a VRA mount soole on it and you're good yeah yeah but the problem is that I think a lot of the brands want to take advantage of the moment with the carbon plates and super Foams which is just very very hard to dial into the trails like so many in the very beginning you know a year or two ago everyone was trying to do that and it was just a really crazy some disastrous shoes like uh the saky whatever was the oh the one that fell apart theorin the Endorphin Trail the first one that fell apart but the uh this why am I forgetting the the the next version of it basically um and that was just super unstable and crazy to run in and so it's very hard to to do I feel like hok has done a good job with the tecton do you think it's harder to go from Trail shoe to legitimate Road shoe or is it tougher to go from Road shoe to a legitimate Trail shoe oh like are you talking about like Solomon going from Trail to Road or or even we're going to see speedland moving into a road shoe yeah that one's exciting too we're watching mounted Coast go from road to Trail yeah I don't it's weird because as6 kind of just slaps uh an outsole on some of their shoes and I mean there's some other changes too to some of their Trail stuff but their their trail shoes are really solid and nobody talks about them I think because they don't Market them at all I don't think they care about yet they really don't care but people really love their trail shoes that try them out the juko was a great shoe like that one was one that I went out on the trails I was only going to run a certain amount of miles and just kept going I was just like oh this feels so good well I also feel like that's kind of what I haven't worn the hookas in a long time but when I was running trails it was like I loved the Hoka Road shoes and it just felt like they put lugs on them and that was the Challenger was the clip with like that's I love that shoe in that yeah you I think you came in second place at hat 50k in that shoe yeah I always wear those shoes for hat because they work for road too yeah but then that mafat X that we saw at ter that's 50 mm stack height I'm like does that does that really need to be a thing on the trails I mean if you don't want to feel the trail yeah I'd wear it yeah I don't know 12 something ounces 12 and a half ounces oh another big comeback brand and and it probably doesn't feel like comeback cuz they're already at the top for most of is Brooks I think that they finally yeah have decided to join the party with some of the tip of the spear product and then it seems like the rest of the product line is getting upgrades that are really nice I gave my glycerins to Carl to to review I know that you ran in the glycerin yeah I did you run it yet Carl yeah it's freaking great shoe I've never say that about a glister before I don't and uh I thought it was I loved it it's not the glycerin Max but it's similar yeah build it's pretty high stack yeah it it just the glycerin Max yeah it's kind of ridiculous um but it's it feels the same as the same phone they finally dialed in the the DNA flash V3 or whatever to where it's like just really nice well it's got the Dual density yeah yeah I think that was a huge game changer for but yeah I mean I think and especially since they already have such a builtin uh F you know not fan base but you know just runners in general I think yeah they're set to wish they weren't a private company I thought they were uh birkshire hathway I mean they're like part of that whole thing you can't you can't I don't I I'm pretty sure they don't have their own stock ticker can you look that up be weird yeah birkshire hathway I'm surprised it wouldn't have what do you want to know about them do they have their are they are they just part of Brookshire hathway Holdings or do they have their own like stock ticker are they publicly traded as I think he's trying to say I think they I think they might be publicly trated as a portf like in the whole portfolio but that includes all of waren Buffett's Holdings Coca-Cola Walmart whatever no I think it's just BG hathway it says it's a holding company run by War yeah so it's like a conglomerate of a bunch of bunch of Holdings but yeah cuz they've like year-over year are ridiculous 715 billion yeah it's the sixth largest public company in the world yeah what is bshar pathway yeah it's insane um okay if you guys had to choose two shoes you get one race day one Whatever daily trainer or Tempo whatever you want it to be that came out in 2024 what are you picking did you say one overall best One race day shoe and one one other daily trainer is shoe what are you choosing that came out in 2024 it's so boring but i' I'd have to go super blast to for one of them uh if the evos is considered 24 it would be kind of a TP it' be a tough choice between those two for the daily trainer especially knowing I could have a race day shoe if if I know I could have a race day shoe then I'd probably go uh Evo and then um get a race stue but if it's super blast dude Adidas is going to sell so many of that shoe it's insane like like forever and ever that's it almost might be a problem because it's going to be like you're gonna not want to get the shoe because people are going to be using it for like lifestyle yeah and you be like H but it yeah it's great um so what's your race day issue that came out this year yeah I know this sounds insane oh wait are you going no you can go if you got yours I I seriously love the diodora gar carbon I know that came out this year yeah okay it's like February okay but I know I only did one actual race was the Charles Charles and you know what I'm going to say about it uh may maybe for me I I need a little more topring oh yeah I kind of I don't know I just really liked it maybe I just had every run I had was great in it I don't know but I mean that's what it is it's a great shoe where I would knock it is weight it's in the middle weight for my size 10 and a half is like eight three yeah but that's not too far I mean that's you're right yeah it's in the 8.3 average I really like even though I didn't race well I did do a a 10K in it the I really like the the pro four the Adidas Pro four oh no I would put that if yeah I guess it just depends where you put it okay so that we're not putting that this year um I would put that I guess you could I mean either way if if I had the more room in the toe box where I could maybe half size up yeah I mean cuz I ran br and the turkey chop 5K were I me had a pretty good day I like both those and um I thought the a A6 Paris Edge was a phenomenal shoe yeah yeah I thought they did a great job with that shoe and I love so two of my favorite races this year was the Anapolis half and then the cherry blossom 10er and I wore The Edge and the uh sky for each of those and I love them both I thought they were both great I thought the shoes performed really well I really like this was the first year I kind of stepped away from the alphafly where as much as I love it I kind of felt like you could line up in some of these other shoes I still was getting really good performance out of them without feeling like I was wearing like a bazooka yeah what about oh yours the alphafly right M yeah I'm going to have to say Alpha fly 3 for race day and then this has some recency bias to it but I think I'd get glycerin Max all right yeah I like that is crazy really yeah wow queen of kush yeah I like it daily trainer though yeah I mean it probably beat the super blast too but it's so hard to beat a shoe with that much cushioning that light that just rolls yeah I will say I've been reaching for the Nike uh was going to say Zoom xly six yeah I was going to say that's probably another one and so that's a good like that would be I never thought I'd be saying that but yeah the zoomfly 6 is such a fun shoe Carl did you run in that yet what' you think it was I did on a treadmill because outside it was I mean it's great but I can't actually all right so you can't really hear Carl off but he said he ran on treadmill cuz it's too cold out I agree with him I got on the treadmill this morning I was like I went outside and regretted it yeah you came back looking all like like had second degree burns all right final checkin man thanks for hanging in there making it all the way to the third check in if you're out there running keep hustling and uh we can't wait to see what you do in this New Year maybe we'll see you at one of our Events maybe we'll see you at the grit party in January 11th who knows or maybe we'll see you in Chicago or New York or one of the other Majors so keep an eye out for us we'll keep an eye out for you and hopefully you're having a great 2025 all blistered up so we did you give your daily I don't uh I was going to say probably super Blast 2 but again I like the Adidas SL2 I thought that was a great shoe but like it was also $130 shoe so if I had the choice price not Factor yeah super blast too I I mean why else you would pick anything price is not a factor I like the clo x one for daily training that was that was fun yeah the I 280 $275 is wild though and I'd also throw I I really enjoyed I did that extra bit of mileage in the rebel to get that review after a bit I enjoyed the rebel MH I'm excited for I think the slight Improvement that you're making with a little bit more cushion under the forefoot is going to make it a little bit nicer um and they're also kind of streamlining their like shoe lineup how do you mean like how Nike just sort of redid their whole lineup it seems like they might sort of streamline it in 2025 okay not to that extreme but a little bit I mean do you think we'll see a SE trainer for I think it might turn into something else oh I think I knew that but that poror shoe cuz remember the original trainer the real squishy one yeah that like people loved that shoe and it was so unique in the space at the time like we didn't have that yeah plated giant stack heavier training shoe I've been purging shoes and I can't get rid of that qu that one yeah that's one that I can't get rid of I get it it is weird that is a weird thing when we so people always ask us what we do with this there's certain shoes that we hold on to just because sentimental value or just they're unique in the market or you know a lot of times it's we keep you know a pair or two from the previous version so we can see the updates um and there is some that just have why you holding on to it you're just like I don't know I just don't want to let it go yeah it it just seems like there's some shoes you're like that was a shoe that changed things or that was like the first of that kind of shoe I felt like the SC Trainer was the first of the super trainers like the that you actually run in here's the one that I think we always Overlook it but I I believe that the first super trainer to me I mean I guess zoomfly was supposed to be but the the real one for me was the tempo yeah that's I never actually ran in that shoe I know um I didn't like it I think my trainer went to Jarrett I so I don't like I don't have my original and that was the RC trainer or whatever but okay yeah I thought you meant you're like a train that you were working with went to Jared the Jeweler yeah I was trying to buy engagement like align that in my head there's a whole lot to unpack there yeah um oh what was it oh I forgot I just remembering we did shot the Endorphin trainer review which we didn't give it a good review I forgot I didn't even say how much I hated how loud that shoe was that was the other thing I hated about that shoe you know I was always wearing headphones so I didn't really hear oh it it's louder than the alpal fly oh jeez you know it was the loudest shoe ever was the first meta speed yeah oh the original meta speed was just a real noise maker guy the first one oh okay not that he was like clap clap clap clap no not the meta racer um well wasn't the tempo next percent kind of known as one of the loudest shoes as well it's pretty loud yeah yeah yeah because it had that space I still have a pair of those yeah sentimental reasons yeah sentimental but it like I felt like that was almost the peak Nike yeah uh age the other shoes I just can't get rid of are the Nike Trail shoes because they look so good I just can't I can't do it it's so hard especially the ones from a couple years back when they're doing those really cool colors with the Kyer and stuff like that yeah like the are you talking about the white and pink yeah yeah just can't do it that was a the when we saw when we were out at Worlds in Oregon was that Oregon yeah yeah um and somebody was wearing that new Nike Trail shoe remember we saw oh yeah the Zama yeah and it looks all so good yeah yep yeah um good times anyway you want to get into speed of Ray shoes let's talk about this shoe that you have said a lot of things about all right so if you ever known we kind of slapped Brooks with a video last year or in the beginning of this year about the disappointment of what they were using for a foam in the shoe and it's funny because we already put a video I put a video out with uh Carl's help uh on YouTube that talks about how they updated the shoe after we kind of said hey it sucks that Brooks does doesn't have a viable race stue they're using a super critical uh foam rather than using Pea in their race day Sho so it just doesn't compete with the rest of the shoes it's heavy it's clunky it doesn't feel great underfoot and you know we had heard when we went to Boston last spring you know people think that I know that sometimes our feedback doesn't have any effect on the companies or that because they're already working on Next Generation say they're like two years of shoes ahead yeah so a lot of times it doesn't but I did somebody that the rep didn't know the person knew us and the rep told the person that he was talking to in the shoe store that believe in the Run killed the sales of the Hyperion Elite which I don't know if that's we can't confirm if that's true not we can't can't but I'm sure it didn't help yeah so you know it's interesting that when we went and talked with them at the running event they basically said hey they heard our review they listened to it and they may have already been working to get PB in the shoes but the difference between that and what we're looking at here is an inline change so this isn't a new shoe it's the exact same tooling exact same you know uh uh molds for the midsole same upper everything the only thing they changed was the ingredient was the they put the peba midsole on the shoe so that's an inline change it's not like a new development so to me this could possibly be basically not maybe just our feedback but other people's feedback that they needed to get in line with having a super foam for the super shoe and they have it here are there two Foams there no it's the same okay same foam it's just the split where the uh plate is but the point I'm making here is this isn't a new developed shoe this is their current shoe just with a new ingredient inline change I mean it's still called the Hyperion LE 4 yeah yeah so this could potentially be reflective of people's complaints about the shoe and I have to say after running in it I did 10 miles in it and I was like well welcome to the show like welcome to the this this feels just like it's comparable to like I'd say vaporfly it's comparable to um the Megan said she thought it felt like the Nitro Elite from yeah the most I was trying to think on the Run of what it felt most similar to in terms of race day shoes and I think the Puma Elite shoe is is what it felt like to me but a better upper uh yeah I was just thinking more of the underfoot feel um I yeah I haven't run I got it on Friday I think but or Saturday but I haven't had a chance to r i I think you'll love it I put it I put it on I was like oh this for sure feels way different what's also interesting is the marketing on the box they gave us is compared to the Hyperion Elite 4 mhm they feel like this will take 2 minutes and 35 seconds or something 32 or something like that yeah off proven to take that off your marathon time I'm guessing they're basing that strictly off of one person's performance I would do my best to prove them wrong yeah is be that hard but but that's that to me is like they know it their athletes have been running in this shoe so Dez when she ran trials CJ Albertson ran the trials with this foam and uh you know when you saw Josh KR on the Fifth Avenue mile he was wearing this shoe with the PB gold see alberon ran like 10 marathons this year do you think they were all in that or do you think they took his time from the original race he did I know he ran trials and this and they said you know he's leading up until mile February so yeah so I'm guessing that this is what he's been using it's a really good shoe I have to say that you know congratulations to Brooks to putting together a good shoe with the right ingredients and to make it a competitor in the market and I'm excited like the Hyperion Elite 5 I love the design if it feels like this I think it'll be great it does not have as much pop as some of the other ones that are on our list and you know I actually think of Adidas and their phones aren't it's not a pea foam that's in the Pro 4 so some of the I think it's the super critical TP um some of those I'm not sure that that's exactly what it is that's what's in the Endorphin Elite too from salony those seem to be um The Next Step yeah of of Foams and stuff like that but or at least competitive with the the umbs okay I do we have spec sheets for this I don't know I think um yeah I mean it's going to be the exact same as the spec sheet for the hyper for just right right I liked the the brook shoe um I think what I'm realizing about myself is I prefer a bit of more mechanic feeling shoe like where I can feel the plate and feel like I'm getting a lot from the shoe not just maybe from the foam but like everything working together yeah we talked about that like that's one of the reasons I used to like the Newton shoes was that you got that perception of kind of like that lift Levy you know kind of I think that's why I liked the original alply so much is because you there was just like you had the airpod you had the plate you had the zoomx and it was like all yeah and when you hit the shoe right it kind of rewarded you yeah so it also helped with form and stuff I think yeah I got you um the other shoe that we tried that has the paback in it Robbie which is one of your favorites Topo which I hadn't tried like full peack shoe it's a cyclone 3 yeah I don't how did I not get this shoe I don't know how you didn't get it maybe someone snatched cuz I got this with the other one what's the maybe there's a cyclone and what's the other one no it's definitely maybe it's at my house uh Cyclone 3 and the the higher stacked one the Spectre yeah the Spectre both with peba but the Spectre I think the Spectre is the old one though like not old one but this past Year's model so is this meant to be a race day shoe or a training shoe with Peck it's yeah a training shoe with peex okay so this is this one definitely let me know that I've gotten used to more cushioning under me feet yeah it's light it's fun as a matter of fact it do even though it's got the foot shape it doesn't look I I thought I think it looks good I think it's a good- looking shoe yeah and I mean for toppo I was G to say I think it needs an asterisk yeah I would say shoe for toppo I would say their uh design has has been a limiting factor in their uh perception of the shoes but and I think they're privy to that but the that one actually yeah I like the all white it's pretty nice I did too all White's nice but yeah definitely it feels really light on the feet the packs though like I think I did eight miles and then a Four Mile Run so so in total 12 miles the it just it's a little thin for me um and it's funny because somebody was asking on one of our video reviews are like hey what's a lower than 30 millimeter drop or stack or 30 mm stack shoe that you guys like does that exist I think not for me I mean what's say stack on this that's more that has to be still more now this one has 8 mm drop or 5 millimet drop or six mm it's five all their shoes are pretty much five I can't they did that is that five um five five or four yeah it says five on the on the side of the ship yeah five millimeter drop okay um yeah so I don't know why I I was trying to look up some of the specs but I don't have it right now well something I did like about this though it has a nice Arch it's very lightweight was that we on the scale can you put that on there yeah um that's what I love about the Cyclone CU yeah it's not going to be the most forgiving shoe as far as cushion but there you go yeah 7 and2 o that's like a race day light isn't it yeah oh like race like lower end of race4 G yeah so you're talking that's a pretty straightforward Tempo shoe yeah I think is kind of the goal and it did feel like that like I felt light on my feet the only thing that was kind of weird though is I did feel like the shoe pushed me to pronate a little bit like it wanted to collapse inwards okay for me all right that sounds like a you problem could be I got 99 problems yeah and Megan is one or not one be careful with your words she's up there um yeah number one um by the way if you haven't listened to Thomas's podcast on Monday I'm assuming if you're listening to the drop you've listened to Thomas's origin stories yeah everyone's everyone's loving it I don't know about that course everybody's Loving Story they loved your story they're going to love Megan this one was a little nerve-wracking I I so we did end up there was a part where um it we it kind of got edited you can kind of see where a [ __ ] eded but um we actually had to stop for a little bit during the podcast and uh start over um and uh I was a little nervous about it so I went and I kind of like listened back to it and I I think it flows fine um yeah with it but it was a it was a tough moment yeah I mean but I think everyone appreciates that though that you're willing to share all that and absolutely it gives people more insight as to who you are MH yeah man that's what we need today more people being real yeah I have a feeling someone's going to use it against me though no yeah I don't not our audience we've got a bunch of good people yeah even the YouTube trolls I think would be too low for for them I don't know Carl was typing away on it he like um I do want to thank everyone though for listening to this podcast it still amazes me that you all are still listening to the nonsense that we talk about every week um but you're all the reason that we get to do what we do so very grateful for all of you yeah it it I think that you know this is one other Avenue that we do that helps us continue to bring you know content to to you and and do it in a way that we talked about a little bit about the fact that you know we're able to provide free content because you guys are good about our sponsors or participating in things that we do so yep you know we couldn't do this without you we appreciate you and uh we want to say have a happy happy New Year because we will not yeah just a reminder we will not have a Friday episode next week which normally come out January 3rd you know what we didn't even talk about grit oh jeez yeah cuz that'll be starting by the time this uh we come back yeah yeah yeah it'll be starting and hopefully you saw the printing of the sweatsh they look sweet and um we you know I went down and made sure that the stitching that's going on the front for the believe run logo on the front chest yeah is kind of matches the hat that uh the beanie that's going out so it should all work together quite nicely and I hope I don't know do we have a everyone always asks what the timeline is it's it's honestly we can't the timeline for shipping it out yeah did you see that pile that was not all of them that in the okay if you watch the re yeah there's after they print them they stacked them up uhhuh and that pile was like four pallets at about like well they're they're hoodies it's not like they're singlets mean crew but it's not like they're singlets but it was like four pallets and they were like 4 feet high and I was like Scrooge McDuck into those yeah we're going to have to Helen and crew is going to be working hard to get them maybe like don't look at me I'm out uh is any yeah um but yeah so it's all it's all our small little team that makes all this happen and get them shipped out so we're always very grateful for your patience as as soon as we get them we'll start shipping them but it's kind of out of our hands and as a matter of fact this is probably the earliest if we're going to get get the stuff done so pretty much during the during the uh event you should be getting your stuff yeah which is nice yeah so people love that I think I they were saying that they weren't going to get the left chest embroidery done until the new year oh wow and then I got an email that they might be starting on it today okay so Co now it takes a lot longer because they only have a certain number of uh embroidery machines yeah so the elves are working over time yeah I this is to me this is probably one of the best pieces of Swag that we've ever done oh yeah easily yeah I love the print was nice it's not too high on like when you feel it it feels soft on the thing it's not like a chunky print it yeah it looks good all right well cool um happy holidays to everyone drink that element before your New Year's Eve party yeah yeah maybe make you feel better the next day maybe you're running uh git miles right now yeah preparing or yeah depending if you're a late listener a late bloomer maybe you'll be listening to this in the New Year never nude in the new year yeah

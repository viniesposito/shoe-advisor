  "text": "I've brought loads of running products this year mainly to review for the channel but also some for my own running to overcome some of the little issues I've been having throughout the year I found some really great bits of Kit along the way some of which I now use every single day and that's what this video is all about as with everything you see here on the channel and of course in this video as well I've bought all of these products 100% with my own money to give you that completely honest unbiased impartial review and it also means we can have a chat about some of the negatives in there as well thank you so much to everyone that supports the channel by checking out my website benp parks.com with the best running gear and also some amazing five-star training plans it really helps us so much with what we do here and also everybody that just likes shares comments on the videos and also subscribes as well right let's get into the first one now which is a big change I've made with my nutrition products Morton is out and this one's coming longer time viewers of the channel will know I've mainly been using Morton in my races but earlier on this year I listened to to an interview with a guy called Andy blow the CEO of precision hydration I was really impressed with what he had to say so I placed a big order and I was really excited to test it out and see what I thought of the product I've always struggled to get those Morton gels down late on in a race never easy today my body just doesn't want to have it so yeah as I say I got these in and I've been using them in pretty much all of my races so far in the second half this year so they're vegan there's nothing artificial and they're informed Sports tested as well they taste kind of like a bit like a peachy yogurt but it's an incredibly mild flavor and they've just got that sort of yogurty texture to them too I just love love this 90 G pouch that's sort of three regular gels worth I did actually I've just bought a new box of precision hydration gels here from xmes the other day so this is what the regular gels look like and then you get these Mega ones here which is as I say three times the size 90 G and that's what I've been taking out in some of my races as well it's super easy to get these down just unscrew the top and then you can just get it straight in much easier than using a regular gel and then you can just take as much or as little as you want as you go around and this fits in my naked band which I wear around my waist really really well but if you are using the regular GS which I will probably use in some of my races coming up I just really like because they've got this band here so you really can't Litter with it really important for anyone really but especially TR athletes who can get disqualified for that sort of thing yeah you just pull that and it stays attached nicely and it just goes down super well I've had absolutely no problems getting these Wings down late on in a race and really actually enjoy having them in my training and in the races as well on top of the gels I actually got some of their drink mix as well I've only used this pre- run I actually use it before my run today cuz I had a speed session to do today it just tastes really good this is their electrolyte and carb drink mix I think they do one without the electrolytes in as well but I I do sweat quite a lot so I've gone for that mix there it just tastes really good it mixes really well I've used this a lot on the turbo trainer inside as well and it just goes down really nicely again a very mild flavor to this one the customer care has been really good as well they offer video chats to help you get the right product they offer sweat tests I think that's probably only in the UK again to see what type of electrolytes might be good for you the taste is good it's not as sweet as Morton and I just don't get sick and bored with it especially not in something like a road Marathon over that sort of time and in terms of dislikes it's really hard to find I think and I honestly I can't i' be trying to come up with dislikes for this but I've really been impressed with this product it's performing really well for me performing a lot better than Morton mainly because I can just get it down when it matters in terms of alternative to something like prision so many gels and things nutrition it's about trying a few out see what works for you I was chatting to another running YouTuber and recommended he tried this out and he said he did and it just didn't work for him so that's just one of those things but this is definitely working for me at the moment next up we're talking strength training now I've always been told I'm a very quad dominant Runner a little bit weak on my hamstrings and my glutes so this year I really wanted to set about doing something about that to improve my running form improve my strength and get a lot more power coming through my body when I'm trying to pick up the pace and a lot of power comes from your glutes and then if you follow my training on straa you might know I actually got a hamstring tear right at the start of the year so I was doing a lot of hamstring rehab exercises in the gym but I wanted to improve my home exercise regime as well so I basically set out to find what's called a glute ham roller which looks like this I got this from a company called Mirror fit and there's loads of different exercises you can do I'm mainly using this to basically get into a bridge position extending my legs out and then pulling the roller backwards into towards sort of where my glutes are and then pushing them out again this loads up the hamstrings super well it looks really like quite a torturous thing and it is when you start but it's amazing how strong you do get after a few weeks of doing this the other main thing I'm doing is really improving my core to support my body as I'm running but I didn't just get that in I actually also got a new Castle Bell but this is my 24 kg Castle Bell and I got this to really improve my squat game as well and I think for runners especially and just everybody really a squat really is one of the best exercises you can be doing now it's great if you've got access to a gym go to the gym I'm so time poor a lot these days I like do a lot of my strength training at home so I've been doing a lot of goblet squats with this holding this into my chest and doing those squats like that I'm using the 24 kilo when I'm feeling quite good I've got my 16 kilo one down here which I actually picked up in the cathlon but what I like about both of these items the're extreme High Bill quality that you get with them both and they just work really really well I'm definitely feeling a hell of a lot stronger by doing this it always stores Away really easy just slides underneath our little TV cabinet in terms of dislikes make sure you put it away afterwards you could easy stand on this thing and it could slide away and you could have quite a nasty acccident so it could be potentially dangerous if you leave it lying around your house I'm really kind of proud of myself for how well I've been doing with my strength training the second half of the Year there're just a few items I've been using check them out we'll link to everything down below no affiliate links doesn't benefit me in any way next up I bought this lovely little thing this is the Garmin 65 so many people on my straa have been asking me about this basically saying why you got the cheapest garon watch and is it actually any good and surely you should be using something like a 965 or one of the more fancy watches in the range and people are just a little bit confused so that's why we're doing this video so I picked this up in the spring quite soon after it launch I just paid the full RP I'm pretty sure I got this on sport shoes couldn't find any discount codes but I really wanted to try out the cheapest Garing watch I've been using the epex 2 which had kind of a fancy screen it had been out for a few years really enjoyed it it a really good watch and it had great build quality but a lot of features I just didn't really use in the watch and it was quite heavy it was very expensive it still worth quite a lot of money so I've sold it now and I wanted to see how well I could get on with basically the cheapest Garin watch in the lineup I fully expected to really miss all of the color Maps the Dual Band GPS the really good battery life that a lot of the higher end models have I really haven't missed any of it to be perfectly honest I've used the 165 for every run every race every walk every hike I've done done every workout and it's really surprised me I've probably done around two 2 and 1 half th000 K and this one of my real pet peeves with running and running watches and me included I'm including myself in this is that so many people buy these high-end smart watches \u00a3800 900 \u00a31,000 only to use the most basic features they just go for a run and put it on their stra don't use any of it anyway here's my lights first thing the screen this AMOLED screen that you get on the entry level garment is really fantastic it's so clear it's really easy to read in all sorts of different light at night in the daytime in bright Sunshine the graphics are really great you can only have four data fields on this some of the more fancy ones you can have up to six I've only ever had four on every watch I've had and that's been absolutely fine it's so slim and lightweight as well I hardly notice I'm wearing it I really just hate having things touching my skin I can't wear a watch all day anyway I really like the lightweightness of it also it has all the good health Basics things that you're going to need HR V the heart rate variability sleeping and napping tracking and body battery as well I don't wear it to sleep in so I haven't actually been using it for that but it has those features if that means a lot to you it's also got the alterer built into it as well which has been absolutely spot on when I've been out in the Hills tracking the elevation the battery life has been surprisingly good for the size of the watch I didn't get the music version I just like to listen to music and podcast and Things by my phone this watch I'm getting around about 10 to 12 hours over the course of around about 12 days as I say I'm only wearing this for running actually still do have my uro which lasts for abs like a 100 odd hours of GPS battery life the GPS accuracy has been absolutely surprisingly really good it doesn't have the Dual Band GPS the fancy GPS that a lot of the higher end watches will have I'll come on to that a little bit more in the dislikes I know all of my roots around here where I live extremely well it's been bang on even running through Canary Warf where the skyscrapers are again it tracks as well as pretty much any watch is going to around there a lot of people have been asking me about the navigation on this because it doesn't have those lovely color Maps it just has the basic breadcrumb navigation because the screen is just so crisp it's super easy just to follow that breadcrumb navigation and I actually do take less wrong turns with this watch than I do on those couple of times when I was using my uro because with the color Maps it's just so overly complicated there's so much stuff on the screen you got always see where you're going with this it's just follow the line and it's really a lot more basic but I find myself getting cost a lot less using this watch so let's come on to some of the dislikes with the Garmin yes as I say the Dual pan GPS would be nice they can't give every single watch all of the features obviously otherwise everyone would just buy the basic one this watch is sort of main competitor the choros pace 3 does get that for roughly the same price point but then with the course you don't get this lovely AMOLED color screen so dual pan GPS is a big feature for you and you've got about this money to spend you don't care about the screen then the chorus might be a bit of a better option I certainly do have to charge it up a little bit more than than my regular old watches but charges up so fast anyway if it is a little bit low just put on for 5 minutes I'm going to have more than enough to get my run done some people might like the Garment feature which is called trading Readiness and the load metrics which the 165 doesn't have and there's also no Triathlon settings on this watch you need to go up to the 265 if you want to get that I've personally never used those anyway the Garmin app is getting a bit better and better but it's just not the most userfriendly thing still after all these years so in summary I've really enjoyed I love this little thing I'm never going to let this go and I'm using it every day and it's so simple to use the price point is right and it really will make the perfect running watch for the vast majority of Runners absolute five-star product the next thing which I bought to review which is part of the influencer running video I think but I've just carried on using it and it's just been so good it's this little mini massage gun this is the th body one I actually bought this on eBay for about 125 the RP is a little bit more than that but just really enjoyed it it travels with me wherever I go and I just take it with me for pre-run and post run this has helps me keep me going if we're doing a lot of running on our travels but anyway let's have a quick shat about the the body thing what do you get with this you get a nice little travel bag here USB a to USBC you can charge this up with USBC and you get three different heads which you can attach onto it basically like that this also goes absolutely fine through airports and things well this only does every airport I've taken it through in hand baggage as well so let's have a shout out all the likes I really like the app that you get with this it syncs up perfectly with the device biggest issue with mass drones is people just don't know how to use them properly so they don't know what to do and it ends up just of sitting in a drawer or they end up hurting themselves by not using them properly so the app is just super easy to follow along the USBC with the device is again really good don't have to have specialist charging cables just use it with my regular Chargers dislikes with this you can certainly get a lot more pressure with your more regular shaped massage guns and yes it's definitely a little bit more on the expensive side there are some cheaper alternatives out there a lot of people Rave about the Bob and Brad massage gun there are a couple of physiotherapists that have a YouTube channel I'm sure pretty much every Runner has come across some of their videos so definitely check theirs out if you're looking for something and of course an actual foam roller is a good alternative and way way cheaper and probably the best thing we can be doing is getting inperson massage if you have the budget for that sort of thing so yeah this I've been really surprised it's kept me running it's kept my hamstrings in shape it's kept my hips in shape maybe more of an older athlete thing as I'm getting a little bit old these days but yeah really enjoyed using it right next up I have what's called a sports recovery pillow so as I said earlier this year I had some hamstring issues and some hip issues as well so I thought I'm going to get this pillow to really help my hips as I sleep now a lot of people obviously recover really well during their sleep for me sometimes I was wake up in more pain than when I went to bed but anyway that's where this comes in basically you put one leg over it and it's just going to help keep your hips aligned a lot better in reality it's kind of just a pregnancy pillow rebranded for athletes so they can put the price up a little bit and that's how they definitely got me when we travel my body definitely mythes this but then I just use a regular pillow that you get in a hotel or air BBE to put between my legs in terms of liks with this thing I wouldn't say it has helped me sleep any better but I certainly I wake up a lot less stiff and a lot less pain in the morning and my hip issues have definitely improved it's really also sort of good quality it's comfortable and it comes with this easy to remove cover as well for when you do need to wash it in terms of dislikes of course spending \u00a355 on a pillow is absolute Madness in terms of Alternatives well Ikea have one for \u00a39 so maybe we were a lot better off going to Ikea and getting that but as I say earlier on this year I was just in a lot of pain and you end up just sort of throwing a little bit of too much money at things and so that's where this Sports recovery pillow comes in we'll link to it down below I wouldn't recommend you spend this amount of money on it if you having some hip issues then look at products like this and pregnancy pillows and just type in like sports recovery pillow and see what you can find but yeah it's worked for me another really interesting product I picked up at the start of the year is what is called a slant board to help me with my carves and also my ankle as a lot of people know I did break my ankle a couple years ago it's been a long process getting it back to full strength this was one of our best products on Amazon video but I've been using it so much since I've also been been using this to work on my car for my Caya strength as well couple of really important muscles there for runners stretching those out nicely at the end ofi runs it's also been really good at helping me work on my ankle range of motion to increase my ankle dorsy flexion what I really liked about this thing it's really good quality this one it's solid metal it's super easy to set up and then slide away again when I'm not using it in terms of dislikes well with that really good metal build quality it is definitely on the heavy side so not that easy to move around once it's set up you're good to go you certainly wouldn't be want to be traveling with anything like this yeah for me just been really good at helping as I say with that ankle strength that ankle dorsy flexion and stretching out those tired calf and cus muscles as well right next up we have some socks a really interesting product I thought a lot of you might like to know about this as we head into the winter months here in the northern hemisphere last year my girlfriend Sarah used some of these Dex shell waterproof socks when she ran a race called the winter Downs in December you really couldn't believe how good they were and to be fair pretty much every runner in this race was using them having wet feet for such a long time in these like more longer distance races or just whenever you're going out to get your runs done really can be quite uncomfortable and when they get sort of wet and all sort of shriveled up a little bit can be incredibly prone to blisters happening and that could be a race ending thing and for me I always like to look for something a product like this to really sort of have that good barrier between your feet and the shoes rather than using gortex waterproof shoes which I just find just don't really work that well on my feet overheat and everything just gets a wet soggy mess inside so what I really like about these socks you can fully submerge your feet in water and it won't get in and you can confidently run through puddles bogs streams there's no need to alter your stride dislikes with the socks they are quite thick despite being called ultra thin they definitely are on the thick side you might want to have a little play around with the shoes you're wearing make sure you've got a little bit of extra space at the front of shoe and what they really do keep your feet surprisingly dry from the outside if you're running them for quite a long time your feet will start to sort of sweat they are quite breathable so moisture can escape from your sweaty feet to come out but also after a amount of time with a bit of friction your feet are inevitably going to get a little bit wet so definitely worth checking out just really think this is going to be the best thing to keep on your feet if you're going some snow wet conditions boggy conditions this is going to do a far better job than some regular socks I've be really impressed with them so far let me know down in the comments your favorite running gear of the Year what's the stuff that you found this year that you've been really impressed with this video coming up here next is all of my best running products that I found on Amazon and this video down here is testing out loads of running influencer products as well that's it guys keep on working hard keep on getting done thank you all for the support and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

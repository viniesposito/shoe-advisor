  "text": "over the past 3 months I spent over \u00a3700 on some of the most popular running products that influencers are promoting I've been on a mission to see if they live up to the hype that they claim or they are a complete waste of money as a consumer it can be hard to tell if these products are genuinely good or if they're just promising great things you'll go out and buy them with their discount code no doubt so they get a really nice chunky commission check at the end of the day well that's why we are here today so I can give you a completely honest un bied opinion to help you in your buying decisions now just before we start I want to say this is not me having a go at influences in any way whatsoever I've got many friends who are influencers all going to make a living in lots of weird and wonderful ways but like so many of you I'm curious about the good and also the bad about these products but also the complete buying experience that some influencers aren't going to see because they just get sent most of these products completely for free and touching on that I did have a bit of a negative customer service experience with one of these things today so hopefully it goes without saying that I bought all of these 100% with my own money exactly the same way we do with everything we buy here and review on the channel so starting out we have this from purport this is a muscle balm to help you with your tired and aching muscles it's infused with 1,000 mg of CBD also some magnesium and arica in there as well like a lot of people I found out about CBD a few years ago when it was all the rage and I've actually bought six jars of this stuff over the last couple of years at40 of Pop \u00a3210 I've spent with pure sport I've actually used a little bit of CBD when I was having some a not so good mental health time to try and improve things and at the same time I heard about pure Sport and what they were doing with this stuff but let's start out with the likes of the pure sport muscle B the first one being it really got me into a good routine of looking after my body learning about my body doing some self massage working through those little aches and pains it's also informed sport so I can trust it there's nothing and anything here and good customer support when I did have to contact them for a couple of things it smells really nice it feels really nice on the skin the ingredients that they using it the arica the cvd the Magnesium all appear to me to be really good quality ingredients and it's actually quite good value for the amount of CBD that you're getting into this it's pretty potent stuff so if you want to try out this type of product with some CBD in this is going to be a really good high quality premium product and then finally I'm not sure if this is a like or a dislike but it's just that sort of Stellar artto or that weight rro effect maybe Whole Foods in America it's just a premium thing it's like reassuringly expensive but it you spend \u00a340 in it so you're going to use it but talking about the dislikes here it is obviously super expensive I've spent over a couple of hundred on this so far you're paying for that influencer Kickback you're paying for the marketing teams all of that the benefits probably are a little bit minimal I feel the benefits I had were for me actually doing the massaging into my skin I feel I could have used all sorts of different type of muscle bombs and probably had a fairly similar effect I didn't personally receive any sort of real pain relief or any reduction in inflammation or things like that if something's gone wrong I've rolled an ankle or something I'm getting an ice pack out of the freezer rather than rubbing something like this on and finally some of the people I do follow that are promoting this stuff it's just very scripted and I'm just very uncomfortable watching sort of how they're promoting it so yeah are there some Alternatives well Holland and Barrett do a CBD one doesn't have the aner and the magnesium in it and it's certainly not as potent and then Neil's y do a one without the CBD and but I've just got some arac in as well that does appear to be really good and that is a hell of a lot cheaper so if you have the cash to spend on something like this then it's going to be worth trying to some extent CBD is going to affect everybody slightly differently but I would say just take some time to learn some self massage techniques just slapping this on your skin and thinking you're going to feel better in the morning is not going to happen so what's my rating for this and I'm going to keep using it well i' give it a three out of five it's worth trying but it's not going to be for absolutely every it's certainly very expensive I'm probably not going to be buying much more of it now and just use it a little bit sparingly but yeah not too bad three out of five Right Moving on we're going to be talking about pillar performance triple magnesium powder I've bought a couple of packets of this from xmars here in the UK they're a great company always give them a shout out and you get a bottle with it I think if you get the pack at the start it's basically a magnesium drink powder you put one scoop in with 250 Ms of water ideally having it before you go to bed it makes a right old mess here Sarah's get me on the camera mix it up and then just give it a shake up and that's you done and yeah and then let's get this on the microphone give it a good Shake because then it has this really ASR now someone like me I've always really struggled with my sleep over the years I find it so hard to get my brain to shut down late at night so that's really interested to try this to help with my sleep but also as they say on the packet supporting muscle function tiredness and fatigue to help you sleep better so you recover better you wake up feeling ready to go the next day as I said I picked this up from X Mars here in the UK they're one of the official suppliers I think pillar are from Australia they all The Branding is quite Australian they sponsor quite a few Australian athletes as search and they also do this in a capsule form as well so you can take this as tablets or make this little drink mix they also did this in Berry and pineapple I just got the berry version twice and I've had two packs over the last three months 40 servings per pack costing \u00a345 a go so as usual a lot of talking about here it's a little bit on the expensive side and I took this around about 30 minutes before bed not absolutely every night but probably sort of about five nights a week so what does it taste like well very very very very sweet we'll come with that in the negatives right let's have a chat about everything I liked about the pillow performance first one being it mixes really easily no lumps or anything like that just whack it and any bottle give it a shake and you're good to go 30 minutes before bed we're also getting some really good quality magnesium glycinate in here which is the best to help with those tired muscles do I feel I slept better the most important thing yeah definitely and I did have some very more peculiar dreams after taking this as well so there certainly a lot going on one thing I really did notice though was getting back to sleep if I do wake up in the night I stir you go to the toilet or anything like that getting back to sleep was just so much better after I had this and then finally I really genuinely felt it did help with my recovery I was just sleeping so much better I haven't had any injuries touch wood over the last few months since I've been using this anyway let's have a chat about the dislikes the first one being it didn't help me fall asleep any quicker initially I haven't taken any sleep medication or anything like that over the years cuz I don't really know what that type of stuff is this is not that and it certainly didn't help me get to sleep it was just if I woke up and getting back to sleep it definitely helped with and then it's also very sweet and very artificial tasting this is just to the berry flavor it just tastes like you're having some kids sweet so it's not going to be for everyone's taste let me know if you've had it what do you think of the taste and then finally some alternatives to something like this well pure sport du magnesium capsule with added beetroot in it as well so you could potentially check that out so my rating for this i' definitely give this four out of five and I totally will be keeping up taking it I'm not going to be able to afford to take it all year but just when I'm doing my hard training I'm training for some marathons now at the end of the year I'm definitely going to be trying to take this sort of four to five nights a week so four out of five super expensive but does seem to be making a difference next up we are talking about this this is the Thea gun mini version 2 RP of \u00a3175 though I bought this one on eBay um for 125 so yeah massage guns some people love them some people hate them they have been increasingly popular over the last 5 to 10 years they're kind of Builders I guess the foam roller for the modern athlete to help with their Master recovery seemingly every pro athlete out there has one of these in their bag you're seeing people using them quite a lot and the body or Thea gun as they used to be called they've rebranded I think um seem to be the go-to brand that sponsor a lot of high-profile Athletics teams and influencers and stuff like that the world now I bought a Theon Prime which is just like the basic entry level one a couple years ago it was a bit of a pain to travel with and charging it up and always lose a stupid charger for it so I bought the mini so I could travel with it charge it up really easily cuz it's USBC so what you get in the package is obviously the theun mini you also get the USBC cable um three different heads that you can snap on and then snap back off again this runs at three different speeds there's some lights on the side here these LEDs those light up with increasing different speeds and then finally the other fact is it's 12 mm of amplitude there so I've been using this to warm up before my runs using it for some recovery after my runs the first like for this is actually not the the massage gun itself but the app that it comes with on your Android or iPhone whatever it just syns up so perfectly to the device with bluetooth the biggest issue for most people using massage guns is they just don't know how to use it now I'm not an expert I'm learning like everybody else but so many people hurt themselves by using these things badly using too much pressure in the wrong sort of places the app is really good it guides you through you've got videos in there it tells you how much pressure to use where to place it and everything like that for the problems that you're having in that particular point in time it's just very easy to use when you know how so I definitely recommend use the app if you're going to be using one of the the body products and I think if you even if you don't have a massage gun from theab body you can still use the app obviously it won't control it and it won't speak to each other but you can get some really good guides on there for how to use things second like USBC is just just so much easier to travel with I've been traveling loads with this we've been on planes driving in the car it's gone through security absolutely fine in hand luggage no issues anywhere in all of the travels and the battery life has been pretty good I've been getting at least 2 hours out of this which is lasting sort of about 10 days of use probably 10 days to 2 weeks of use so I really don't even have to charge it up that much and I genuinely feel better by using it I've had a lot of issues at the start of this year from driving my car getting really bad super type hip flexors I really put a lot of credit into this device for helping sort that out I mean I can do a bit more driving than I want to do so this goes with me pretty much every time I go on a long car Journey this thing's coming with me I can charge up in the car stop every hour or so and just go through my hip flexors and then my final like is it's pretty powerful it's surprisingly powerful probably not going to be if you're a massive Burly weightlifter or something like that it might have struggle to get through your sort of muscles but for people like myself and the vast majority of Runners out there it's going to have more than enough power to look after your muscles but as always it's not all smiles my dislikes with this it doesn't come with a plug so you're going to need to have one of those like little adapter boxes to be able to charge it up and you can certainly apply more pressure with a more normal shaped massage gun the way you hold this it's not the best thing but it's super convenient and easy to travel with it's obviously quite expensive if you buy it for full RP so are there alternatives to this of course there are the main one being like the Bob and gr Bob and gr the Bob and Brad massage gun let me know if you've used that you can obviously use your foam roller at the gym or at home if you're going a little bit more old school or of course get a Weekly massage if you can every two weeks 3 weeks 1 month whatever you can do whatever you can afford that is going to help you out way more having some some actual human go through your body than these sort of things can but it's a nice thing for me to keep everything ticking over between saying my regular massage therapist so my rating for this I really really quite impressed because it's helped sort out so many little problems I've been having dayto day so four and a half out of five and will I keep using it yeah this is coming everywhere with me we good friends traveling around the world together right just going to have a quick drink if you are enjoying the video let me know hit that like button down below and is there any influencer type products or just any products you want to see me review let me know down in the comments there it's going to going in there pick a few and we'll do another one of these videos in a few months time I'll go and buy all this stuff and see if it's any good right back to the video I think we're talking about aftershocks next right aftershocks as my girlfriend is just behind the camera has reminded me they're not called aftershocks anymore they are just called shocks these sent me back \u00a360 if you don't know what these are thinking what the hell is he waving around these are headphones basically for active people Runners cyclists Walkers well that's certainly how they brand them on their website these used bone conduction Technologies they sit on the side of your head like that and I'm going to read this because it's really complicated but if you're wondering how they work they convert sound into mechanical vibrations that are transmitted through the skin and the temporal bone to the clear basically these pods on the side of these headphones vibrate and they go through your bones and you can hear them what do you get in the Box well you get the cable the charging cable the traveling case and the headphones as well they come in two different sizes for different size head shapes they charge up super quick you can go from n to 60% in around about 20 minutes and they'll be fully charged in one hour the battery lasts about 10 hours so let's chat about my likes one the sound quality for listening to podcasts and any sort of spoken word audiobooks and things like that is pretty good my second like is the safety aspect of these because there's nothing actually in your ears you can hear of any potential dangers traffic other people cyclist whatever around you and you can also use these pretty much all the time in races you still need to check with the race organizer but pretty much every race certainly here in the UK you can use aftershocks even when headphones are banned because the safety aspect you can hear medical people you can hear directions and stuff from everything going on around you you can also connect these up to any phone any watch so you don't have to take your phone with you if you just want to connect it to your garment and listen to the music on that that works absolutely fine also super comfortable you could easily wear these all day without any problem at all some people also like to use these in like office environments and things if I've got a call in the house this is normally what I'll be reaching for battery life as we touched earlier really good as well they also do work well in heavy rain I've never had a problem I've never had a pair break I think this is my third pair I've just upgraded so the build quality of these things is superb let's have a chat about some dislikes well because they're not properly in your ears the sound quality for music isn't great especially the bass I've got the like the pro version here which is meant to have a bit of better bass if you want to listen to music you're a big audio file these are definitely not the headphones to be going for also you really can't hear much if you are in a noisy environment the whole point of the safety thing you can hear the dangers but if you're running through a busy Urban environment all the time you really can't hear a lot of what's going on in these I guess that's just the flip side of being safe which a lot of high volume alerts I don't know if Android has this but on my phone it's always warning me because I keep listening to these too loud because you listen to it nearly about sort of 80% volume most of the time so Apple thinks you're absolutely ruining your hearing but they don't have a setting for these type of headphones um you so I can't really wear these under a beanie so we're coming to the winter now so I tend to get my airpods out for wearing under a beanie and just put them on the past three mode other Alternatives out there I really would say maybe just save \u00a330 and buy the not pro version just the open run they actually have a better waterproof rating as well they're \u00a33 cheaper and when I'm out a run I really honestly can't tell the difference they've also got a refurb section on their website where you can buy some with a pretty hefty discount as well so if you're in the market for that then check out the refurb section other alterers as well sunto have actually released um two new very similar headphones to this I think they're called the sunto wing and the sunto Sonic um the early reviews say they are quite good so my rating for the after trucks is 4 and2 out of five will I be keeping them definitely I use these on absolutely every run I go on right our final product on the list today are some running sunglasses from a company a British company called Su God I see a lot of people wearing this influences love a pair of sunglasses I think I look more like I'm about to go and do something in a laboratory with my bunson burner but yeah for them it's a nice little earner they s me back \u00a330 they make all sorts of different sunglasses um also like ski go they sponsor loads of pros and influencers as well what do you get you get a nice little case you get three different little nose section things which are here and you can just unplug that bit in the middle and put one of these on the standard pair fit me absolutely fine that starts out with my first like because these do not move around anywhere on my head whatsoever I was jumping around shaking around they do not move even when I'm like Midway through a run here as I'm it's pretty sweaty here in the summer they don't move they don't bounce they just stay there they're also extremely lightweight as well just 26 G and when I've got these on I can't see anything around my face at all they completely block any sort of normal bit of light coming in here you can also spec them with recycled material for the same price as well when you sort of build your glasses on the website you can custom pretty much everything on here but it's really nice to see them offering a recycled Plastics as well here for the same price as the new stuff and then my final few likes I really like how you can just put these on and you can run from shade into light back to shade into light never had to like put them down like this to be able to see in sort of more darker areas like that I'm not sure what this lens is I'll put the name of this lens up on the screen it's got quite a yellowy tint to it so it was really good in low light but then even when the sun was quite bright it worked pretty well as well I've never actually running them in the rain or any sort of high humidity but never got any like fogging up issues with the lenses here and they do offer a lifetime guarantee which I haven't had to call on for these obviously they're still in good shape here but when I did a bit of research online some people that had said it was really quite good and they're having some positive experiences and then finally when you've got these on and maybe you've got your aftershocks on as well you put them the other way around or whatever headphones you've got everything sort of went together pretty well and comfortable and it worked absolutely fine when I was using everything together right of course like all these things it's not all smiles I did have a bit bit of an issue with the customer services it's probably my fault to be fair but basically I logged on at about 9:30 in the morning to order these glasses because I wanted them to go away on a trip in a couple of days time and they had a special offer on them buy one get one free I was like that sounds really good then with my whole adhp D brain just abandoned the checkout went off and do something else came back about 40 minutes later about 10 10 and the offer were gone it was like their weekend offer so I just sent a little message saying I I started my check out do you think you can do the offer and they was like no so that that was the end of that one I was like like I run a website here in the UK of course I'd help someone out uh with that but they was like right frankly no sorry you missed it you should have checked out your fault it was my fault they didn't have to but it would have been nice and then I then paid for like the next day delivery said if you order before 3:00 p.m.",

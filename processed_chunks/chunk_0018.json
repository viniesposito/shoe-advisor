  "text": "[Music] the mo version 4 was my top Max cushion shoe back in 2022 and I guess it was so good that New Balance didn't think it needed updating for almost two full years so was it worth the wait let's lace up the more version 5 and take it for a [Music] run heart beats going [Music] yo what's going on my name is kzi and I'm a non Elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to tell you guys all about the New Balance Fresh Foam X more version 5 but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that I bought myself nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the more version five and let's start with the specs this is a very tall shoe starting out at 44 mm of stacky in the heel with a 4 mm drop giving us 40 mm of fresh foam X in the forefoot of the shoe and that's the only thing that's in the shoe just that Fresh Foam X goodness now the big thing that I noticed with version 5 to version four is that there is a major Aesthetics change the version five is basically getting a design update to match the same design language as the rest of the fresh FX line so if you've seen the changes to the 1080 version 14 uh you'll see that there are a lot of similarities to the more version 5 but it's not just a cosmetic change there's a couple of really big hints that newbounds drops in the way that they talk about this shoe for one thing when we look to the outsole of the shoe there is a bottomup outsole for additional 4ot stiffness and the other thing that they've done is that they've changed the rocker profile of the shoe so when you're looking at these two shoes the way that these two shoes curl up as your foot moves through the gate cycle is very different in the mo version 5 than in the mo version 4 so those are going to be two very significant differences that are going to end up making a very big impact later on when I talk about what the shoes actually like to run in my US men's size 9 came in at a weigh measurement of 318 G or 11.2 Oz [Music] now that we've talked about what the shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on the road the more version 5 is a very good Max cushion shoe the fit of the upper is true to size it's not too baggy it's not super wide I feel like it's just right and the materials that they've chosen for this shoe are very comfortable especially if you're putting this shoe on on a recovery day or after a tough workout the upholstery work on this shoe is excellent and I think it's a great example of how you can have a very comfortable and luxurious feeling shoe without resorting to a bunch of excess fluffy padding that is only going to end up being a sweat sponge in some of those warmer months so I feel like the fit on the upper is exactly what I want which is also something that I could say about the mo version 4 the fit of the mo version 4 and the fit of the mo version 5 are excellent fits but when it comes to the actual running in the shoe as a more version 4 Super Fan I find that like the mo version 5 a little bit less the shoe feels like it's a little bit firmer and a little bit more stable and that's something that we saw in a lot of shoes across 2024 so it's not a surprise that this is what happened to the mo version 5 but overall The Sensation that I'm left with is that this is a shoe that seems to be more intended for high-intensity walking than it is for high mileage running and there's nothing against a walking in a running shoe or even having a shoe that is really well suited for run Walkers uh but it's just very different than the experience that I felt in the mo version 4 and I really am kind of caught off guard I wasn't expecting such a drastic change between one and the other now the most common question that I got when it came to the more version 4 was how is this shoe for walking which indicates to me that a big portion of the at least more version 4 curious audience was not only is it good for running but is it going to be a comfortable shoe cuz it looks nice and big and comfy is it going to be good for standing in all day or for long periods of walking or if walking is your primary mode of outdoor activity and the thing that I would say the most is because of the aggressive rocker that was on the front end of this shoe I really enjoyed it for running but I didn't like it as much for walking because I felt like that transition felt a little bit awkward at the walking pace where as at the running pace it was just right for being able to move this large amount of foam now the change that they've made to the rocker geometry which New Balance told us about in all the documentation and this additional 4 foot stiffness that they talk about is intended to make it less aggressive which then flips the script on the more version 5 which makes it much more comfortable if you've got to be on your feet all day or if you're using this for run walk or just walk but for running I felt like it made the shoe a little bit harder to Wrangle all this midsole foam that was here so for me it felt a little bit less exciting it felt a little bit less like the more version 4 that I fell in love with and it made it feel more like kind of traditional Max cushion shoes at the end of the day I'm not mad at New Balance or the more for changing in the way it did I think that this way the more version 5 is going to have much broader Commercial Appeal it's just not going to appeal as much to me now before we wrap up this video let's take a moment to zoom out and see where the more version 5 fits within the broader New Balance lineup and to understand New Balance you have to understand that they have two different types of foam they have fresh foam X which is what we've been talking about with the more version 5 and they have fuel cell two different types of foam that are intended to give two different types of experiences fuel cell is supposed to give you speed rebound and responsiveness and the Fresh Foam X is supposed to give you softness and comfort but let's take a look more closely at the Fresh Foam X shoes because I think that's going to be more important in the discussion of the more version 5 now within the Fresh Foam X shoes and there are a lot of fresh foam X shoes there are kind of three main shoes that I want to talk about there's the 880 the 1080 and the more version 5 now the 880 has always been kind of the daily training shoe and I think as you go along this direction C on this spectrum you're getting more and more cushion and comfort the 1080 used to kind of be the max cushion shoe in this lineup now is until the more came to be and ever since the more existed in the lineup the 1080 has been shifting ever so slightly more towards the daily training side so there aren't clear cut offs as to when it's a daily trainer and when it's a Max cushion shoe it's all kind of a spectrum based on how much comfort and how much cushion you want underfoot these days as far as the Fresh Foam X daily trainers are concerned I'm really loving the 1080 as the daily trainer and the more version 5 as the max cushion shoe now there is one additional wrinkle because this year New Balance also introduced The Fresh Foam X BOS or BOS I've never really been sure how to pronounce this shoe now while I personally had some difficulty running in this shoe it gave me a little bit of of foot pain which is a weird thing that happens to me once every like 30 to 50 shoes certain shoes just disagree with with my foot but this has been a really interesting higher cushion shoe than the 1080 which I really think is kind of an either or with the more version five I think if you like traditional Max cushion shoes think shoes like the Bondi from Hoka then I think that the more version 5 is going to be the max cushion shoe for you but if you like something that's a little bit bouncier a little bit more kind of in my mind modern and fun then I feel like the BOS is kind of like the runnner version of the more version 5 and that's kind of how I understand the the Fresh Foam X shoes now let's bring in also the fuel cell foam shoes and in the interest of brevity I'm not going to go through each one of these individually but there are also fuel cell foam shoes that kind of cover a lot of the same bases as the Fresh Foam X shoes but keeping in mind that fuel cell is a little bit more of kind of a performance oriented product that's where the racing product from New Balance is going to sit so if we take these shoes both the fuel cell and the freshx and kind of Shuffle the deck and kind of mix everything together to make the best five shoe rotation that you can here's kind of how I would put that together in the daily training spot I would pick Rebel version 4 in my opinion this is one of the best daily trainers that you can buy right now it's fun it's lightweight it's Snappy it can do fast stuff it can also go long distances as well this would be the center piece of the rotation and you can either put the 1080 in that position or the 880 in that position the all can kind of be interchanged depending on the experience that you are looking for now as far as race product go then I would go to the SC Elite version 4 this is their Marathon racing shoe in the lineup and I think kind of in between these two shoes is the SC Pacer version 2 now this could also be the marathon racer for some people and I really feel like this year newbounds tried to make this an alternative Marathon racer a lot of Brands now have two different experiences for your their marathon Race product but for me this one just felt a lot firmer than I would like for Marathon distance and I'd kind of put it here as a workout session shoe for something that I'm going to try to go a little bit faster than Marathon workouts might normally entail and I feel like this is more of like a 5k 10K racer now as far as the max cushion goes that's where I think you can bring in a shoe like the mo version 5 or if it works for you I think the BOS is a lot more fun of an experience so because this is a more version 5 video I'll leave the more version 5 in this position even though personally if it did work for me I would go with the BOS and then you've got the SC Trainer version 3 which kind of fits on the end over here in that new generation of long run shoes where they're very comfortable but also still very peppy and performance oriented and for a lot of people this like long run shoe category is where a lot of people might be picking out their Marathon Racers if traditional carbon plated Racers aren't working for them so this would be like the five shoe lineup that I would pick from New Balance but if we're going to trim this down to three shoes then I think the shoes that I would eliminate from this discussion would be the pacer version 2 and the SC Trainer version three the rebel version 4 would be your daily trainer and your workout shoe the more version 5 would be your time on feet and Recovery run shoe and then for your toughest workouts and for your Marathon racing you'd go with the SC Elite version 4 and then if we're going to drill that back even further to just a shoe rotation then I think you could have a lot of fun with just the rebel version 4 and the SC Elite version [Music] 4 now let's wrap up the video by going over the buying guide and we'll also discuss some of the Alternatives that you'll likely want to consider the more version 5 is a classic Max cushion running shoe with a healthy dose of both comfort and stability it's going to be a great shoe for those looking to set time on feet PBS as well as those looking for a really good RunWalk or pure walking experience this shoe has been out for a little while but it's still selling for the retail price of $155 and I think for the amount of shoe and the kind of shoe that you're getting here I feel like that's a pretty good price but if you are looking for the more runnable of the two options I would look at last year's more version 4 and you can find it at discount in some select sizes there's not a lot left remaining but you might be able to find it at a discount in your size at $110 but there's also competition from other brands that you're going to want to consider and let's take a look at those the first one that I think we really need to take a look at because I feel like it's the barometer against which all kind of classic Max cushion shoes are mentioned is from Hoka and that's the Bondi this is the Bondi 8 and I feel like this is a very mature shoe it's not going to be changing a ton year over-ear you're going to be getting a pretty consistent experience and that experience is something that's really great for people who are on their feet all day and want something comfortable people that want a RunWalk shoe or people that want to set time on feet PBS and want something that provides both comfort and stability and that's a lot of the same ways that I would explain the more version 5 now I feel like the Bondi is kind of the most old-fashioned of the max cushion shoes if we can kind of talk about them that way so I think there's a little bit more firmness and a little bit more stability in that shoe so depending on what you want the Bondi might be the better choice but even amongst these two shoes for people looking squarely at this type of shoe I think that the more version 5 is still a bit more comfy and a bit more fun now the Bondi retails at 165 but it's been out for a little while and you might be able to find it at about a 20% discount at 132 bucks and then the last two that I think we should talk about kind of sits in the middle between I guess the modernity of the more version 5 and the Bondi 8 and that's from toppo and this is the atmos now when I reviewed the atmos I kind of felt like this is what the Bondi should be looking to in terms of staying true to what a Bondi is but also being able to take advantage of some modern techniques and materials that can go into shoe construction and so a lot of the things that I've been saying about the mo and that I've been saying about the Bondi apply to the atmos as well but I feel like it's kind of like a step elevated from the Bondi 8 in terms of being a little bit more fun to run in and a a little bit peppier and the Topo Atmos comes in at 160 so a little bit more expensive than the more version 5 but kind of splits the difference between what you're getting in the Bondi 8 and what you're getting in the more version 5 so we've got kind of three flavors of classic Max cushion shoes here for you to choose from if you have any other questions about the mo version 5 or any other shoes that I talked about today feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet stop of the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel love to see you guys over over there in the chat that's all it for today everybody thanks so much for making it all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music]",

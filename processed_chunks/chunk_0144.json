  "text": "over the past few weeks I've been getting so many messages and comments asking if I was going to be testing out the new Muno Neo Vista there's been so much hype for this shoe Muno went on a massive promotion drive my social media feeds been bulging with people promoting this shoe I checked it out and everything sounds really exciting an all new shoe a really radical design the new booty upper and a new foam to go with it as well is this the value super trainer we've all been looking for well stay tuned because we got all that and more coming up with my full review of the Muna Neo Vista before we start out just want to say I bought this shoe 100% with my own money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review if you like this kind of content please drop us a like leave your comments down below and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and of course check out my own website BP parks.com where we've got the best running hats and Technical gear to help you with your running right on with the video now as I said at the start of the video this is an all new shoe from Mao it's not replacing anything and I think the look are really polarizing from what I can tell what do you think about the looks of this shoe you a lover or a hater for me I really like it well let's start out chatting about all of the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like this this is a premium daily shoe really good long run shoe for those Marathon paste long runs that high stack Max cushion shoe to really look after your legs on those longer runs and some similar examples here something like the Hoka macx the Boston series of shoes more the more recent Boston series of shoes or something like the Nike Zoom fly 5 this shoe sent me back \u00a350 here in the UK stack out of the back 45 mil 8 mm drop overall 3155 G or 11.1 Oz it's a neutral shoe it has this seamless knit upper with a tongue integrated into it like a booty type construction so it really hugs your foot probably the most famous shoe like this is something like the Nike Tempo next perent in terms of the midsole oh I really like the midsole in this shoe but this is mauno super smooth speed assist energy NXT midso foam this is an EVA foam which is normally quite basic as Foams go and some people have been worried about that but they've injected some nitrogen here they've got to hold their special process and it really brings this shoe to life one of the best Eva Foams that I've ever run in there is a nylon plate in this shoe which is a little bit more forgiving a lot less stiff than a carbon plate shoe really suited for that daily trainer type aspect I've got mizuno's own rubberhead on the out soole and as you can see there's this massive cutaway along the bottom of the shoe which has probably been done to save weight more than anything there are no different widths available which is a little bit frustrating but in terms of width it was really good for me this booty construction really means there's a lot of space to get your feet in there so you should be absolutely fine as you got severely wide feet and it wasn't true to size for me I actually couldn't get my size so I ordered half a size down and that was perfect so it probably is about true size to half a size down if if you're at all unsure go half a size down and finally there are two different colorway options there's the blue for the men's and the white colorway option for the women right let's get stuck into my likes my first like with the shoe is this upper really good lock down snug fit the upper really does hug to your foot like a sock as you'd expect I suppose and I was worried about some potential overheating issues because this upper is quite thick but for me in the UK it was absolutely fine no hot spots blisters rubbing or any sort of discomfort like that really good lock down at the back of the shoe as well with the ankle is very soft here at the back but just held the foot really nicely through the whole foot strike so yeah upper really fantastic super comfortable right from the off and it was just an absolute joy to run in my second like with this shoe is it super smooth across the surfaces really great cruising long run shoe it really shines at that easy steady marathon pace half marathon pace that's where this shoe is best used I didn't really notice the plate through the stride yeah you can tell it's there just about but it's really there just to help assist with the stability more than anything rather than speed which is all due just the huge amount of foam we've got in this midsole so you really need to add that plate in just to give it that solid structure yes the shoe is a little bit on the heavier side of things again just for a sheer amount of foam in here but it really does cruise along really nicely just a fantastic cruisy long run marathon training or Marathon racing shoe and then finally the value of the shoe for in the UK \u00a350 for everything this is delivering is really quite exceptional in my opinion for the plated training shoe sort of Market of course you can get shoes way cheaper or way more expensive for this type of shoe this is definitely on the very cheaper end and one of the best ones out there at the moment as well I was really worried they're going to be cutting some cost by using this Evo instead of a p PX Pham which you get in some of the more Elite models out there but the midsole feels so bouncy So Soft but it's just the right amount of cushioning to really bring a smile to your face and the right amount of energy to get your long runs done moving on to my dislikes the first one in just really sharp Corners it's just by using this kind of booty type upper there is a little bit of sideways movement but for those marathon training long runs when you're just going a straight line you'll be absolutely fine and again with this big big bit missing in the bottom just a little bit of instability there very very minor thing you might notice that you might not but I really wanted to bring that up the second dislike with the shoe is it is just a little bit chunky and it's a little bit too soft for those faster pacing runs if you're going to do some K reps some 5K races 10K races things like that it's not going to be a super allout far shoe it is actually quite lightweight for the sh size and volume that this shoe is a lot of people don't like these big clunky shoes which this one definitely is but there's still a lot of bulk here there's a lot of mass underneath your foot but yeah it really does deliver a really nice fantastic enjoyable ride for those as I say half marathon Marathon easy tight Pace runs so if you wanton a firm ride with lots of ground feeling this is really one to avoid in a similar vein it's just a little bit too chunky for those 5K 10K races and that sort of training yes I really think it's a really good solid daily shoe but it's not perfect the shoe's far more suited for long distance cruisy Pace half marathon Marathon easy Pace yeah you could even go for a recovery jog in it as well it does take a lot of these boxes but it's that middle sweet spot where this shoe really shines also a really good option for someone that feels like the flagship carbon Racers a little bit too expensive they're not quite sort of supportive enough not providing enough Comfort this shoe is really comfortable and again it's a really good option to have a look at I say the perfect person for a shoe like this is someone that wants some really good value wants a shoe they can do all of their marathon training in potentially do their marathon race in as well doesn't want to get too involved by building big shoe rotations yes you can put this in a rotation get something faster get something slower either end it will look after you really well there I say this is a really good one sh option for people maybe in their first second third sort of marathon with an allout Comfort shoe and following on from that this shoe was exceptionally comfortable if you want to see my best comfortable shoes then check out that video that's coming up next here that's it guys let me know your thoughts on the new M let me know down in the comments how I catch up there keep working hard guys keeping get it done and we'll see you very soon in the next

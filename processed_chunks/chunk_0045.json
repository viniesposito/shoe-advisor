it's time to lace up the adios pro4 and take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm an not only Runner reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the adios Pro 4 but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that Adidas sent to me for the purpose of review so I didn't have to pay for these shoes however no one's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video no one knows which other shoes I'm going to include in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the adios Pro 4 and let's start with the specs this is a 39 mm stack heite shoe with a 6 mm drop giving us 33 mm of Stack height in the 4 foot and in this shoe we have two components the first is Light Strike Pro and the second is the energy rods 2.0 now as far as the Light Strike Pro goes it's the same name that they're using for the foam that goes in this shoe that they used for last year's adios Pro 3 but it's a different formulation of foam than what's in the adios Pro 3 it's also different than the similarly named Light Strike Pro foam that's in the adios Pro Evo one so now we have three different Foams from Adidas they are all labeled Light Strike Pro but they're all very different as far as the energy rods are concerned though I believe that energy rods 2.0 are the same energy rods that were used both in the adios Pro 3 and in the Evo one so there isn't to much different going on there but those energy rods are intended to serve a function that's very similar to what a carbon fiber plate would do in a marathon racing shoe now to protect all this foam and energy rods we have light traction on the outsole as well as a little island of Continental rubber now the light traction portion is the rubber that used to be almost kind of clear that's on this shoe here now it's a little bit stained and dirty from the miles that I put on this shoe and then the Continental is this colored piece of rubber right here right underneath kind of where the big toe would be now Adidas tells me and I don't know if they were supposed to tell me this or if I'm supposed to be telling you but I'm going to tell it to you anyway now Adidas tells me that the rubbers that they have been developing the rubber compound that they've been developing for the outsoles of their racing product have similar characteristics in terms of traction and durability as the Continental product but they tell me that their Elite athletes as well as their customers really enjoy seeing that Continental co-branding that's on the outo there so that's why they've maintained certain aspects of content to rubber on their shoes I'm not positive that's the only reason why there's a small section of content rubber on the adios Pro 4 but I do know that that is the case for the rubber compound that they made for the adios Pro Evo one even though there are some Elite athletes that prefer to have a more traditional Continental rubber outo on their Evo ones moving to the upper we have a new oper for this year as well it's Adidas's light lock material it looks very similar in terms of the Aesthetics and the design of the evo1 but the materials are quite different if we look at the Evo one's upper it's almost seethrough and Adidas tells me that that transparency or near transparency is a met4 for the absolute lightness of the shoe with the light lock we're getting kind of a rip stop type of material material with a diamond pattern through here but it's still very lightweight although it's not the most breathable of materials overall it kind of feels like kind of like a fabcy paper almost like currency like like money and one of the things that I really appreciate about the tongue on this shoe is that they've kind of taken a lot of the similar materials that they used in the tongue of the adios Pro 3 and made it in the shape of the tongue on the EVO One although they did make it a little bit bigger so it's a bit easier to get your foot into the shoe and it's also a lot easier to get the tongue settled as you're lacing down and cinching everything up there's a little bit of bumper pads around the back of the heel in fact there's a little bit more I think in the adios Pro 4 than have been in some of the previous shoes like the EVO One and the adios Pro 3 but all these are intended to make the shoe a little bit more comfortable and help keep your heel in place I did feel like getting a really good lock down in the heel was a little bit difficult and took a little a little bit of effort and I think for some of you who kind of constantly have problems with heel lock down this one still might not quite be precise enough for your liking otherwise I felt like in terms of fit goes this shoe was true to size for me I went with my usual running shoe size 9 and I felt like that was the perfect size altoe this shoe comes in at a very lightweight Adidas says that this shoe should come in at around 200 g for a reference size I do happen to be reference size US men's signs 9 mine came a little bit heavier than that 206 G and 7.2 [Music] Oz now that we've talked about what this shoe is like on paper let's talk about what the shoe is like on foot I'm absolutely loving the updates to the adios Pro 4 it feels like a lighter shoe that allows for quicker turnover there's a great amount of compression in the foam and I'm liking the updates to this new Light Strike Pro not only is the foam lighter but I also feel like it's compressing a little bit more while still retaining a really great amount of the responsiveness and bounciness that light strike pro has always been known for running in the two shoes kind of like in series one after another I find that I'm gravitating towards the foam that's in the adios Pro 4 and every time I go from adios Pro 4 back to adios Pro 3 the adios Pro 3 almost feels firm for me and what my foot and stride ER I'm definitely enjoying the response that I'm getting back in terms of compression and decompression from the Light Strike Pro in the adios Pro 4 now there's some changes to the geometry of the shoe that I think make for some improvements in the shoe and the first kind of way that the geometry is different is that they've kind of made the adios Prof for a little bit narrower it at the front of the shoe and that's something that I appreciate because we've seen a trend in the last year or maybe more where every shoe seems to be getting wider in in the hopes of making that shoe a little bit more stable without having to add a ton of stability elements and that's even infiltrated into some of our race product that we see on the market today now I don't necessarily think that's what was going on with the adios Pro 3 uh I think that this is wide in the forfeit because they were trying to make this kind of like gigantic almost circular landing pad for you to be able to hit the ground and push off on now in this year's version they have kind of narrowed that a little bit it's still really wide almost kind of like at that base of the pad under your pinky toe but then it kind of flares in a little bit more aggressively but it does make the shoe narrower as you are Towing off and I feel like what that does is it makes the shoe feel a little bit more Nimble now the other way in which that the geometry is changed is that they moved where the rocker starts on this shoe now they've adopted at least what they say on paper is a 60% rocker position and but what they mean by that is as you go through the 100% length of the shoe The Rocker starts at the 60% position I'm I'm not positive on it but I believe with the aios Pro 3 The Rocker didn't start or this curl on the shoe didn't start till 70% into the shoe now the thing that they say is that the 60% number is pulled directly from the Evo one I'm not sure if it kind of actually is or if it just is because there's a bevel over on this part of the shoe but the main rocker starts maybe at 65 % in either it feels earlier than it did in the I Pro 3 but it doesn't feel quite as early as in the EVO One But at the end of the day I do feel the change and I appreciate wherever this number actually is I like the position where it is on the adios pro4 I feel like on the EVO One The Rocker starts maybe just a little bit too early at least for a non- elite Runner like me now when it comes to sizing and Fit I feel like the adios Pro 3 has the most generous fit and it also has some of those similar problems where the heel can be a little bit finicky to lock down especially with the thin laces that Adas is using they aren't very grippy at all so it's hard to kind of like selectively apply pressure in different areas of the shoes depending on where you might need it on the other hand even though there is the same slippery laces in the evo1 I feel like that upper is just a lot more snug on the foot and so it's a lot harder to get in the shoe when you're in it the material wraps on to your foot a little bit more tightly and it feels like there's just a little bit less room in there I don't think that the size is wrong I think that's just the cut and fit that they're looking for the adios Pro 4 sits in between those two where it has a little bit less room than the adios Pro 3 and a little bit more room than the EVO [Music] One now before we wrap the video Let's zoom out for a moment and see where the adios Pro 4 fits Within an Adidas lineup and while there are a lot of different kinds of shoes that Adidas makes and those all cater to different preferences let's build a lineup that I would enjoy and I think someone who's enjoying the adios Pro 4 would also enjoy and so whenever I talk about shoes and a rotation I always like to start with the daily trainer and for Adidas right now I think the best one is the Azo SL it's the shoe that you're going to run a lot of daily training miles in and this one's really great for it because it does have Light Strike Pro Different Light Strike Pro that's what in the audio Pro 4 but a Light Strike Pro foam which is really nice and then it has a more daily training foam as a carrier around that core of foam but it's great to log those everyday miles and it's got plenty of durability built into it and then where the adios Pro 4 would fit in is as the racing shoe that you would reach for on race day uh so this is for your biggest workouts your races uh this is the shoe that you're going to really enjoy now for your recovery runs and for runs that are going to be a little bit more chill and relax in what you want for your daily trainer there's a couple of options out there but right now let's talk about the ultra boost 5 and the ultra boost 5x the difference between those two models is that one has a cage over here that kind of uh plastic piece that gives you a little bit more support I prefer the one that doesn't have the plastic cage on it and I'm going to put that over here cuz it's for days where you want to be a little bit more relaxed you're not worried as much about pace you're wored a little bit more about just pampering yourself now if you have workouts that are going to be a little bit faster than what might need for your daily trainer and maybe not quite as big or maybe not quite as long uh as what you're going to use for your Marathon racer that's where I think a shoe like the tkumi senent comes into play the Tumi sent has been penally one of my favorite shoes that Adidas makes every year uh and this one is really great for 5K 10K racing and any of those faster workouts anything that's faster than you might want to use for a marathon Racing type of shoe and then if you really want to go crazy and add a fifth shoe to this lineup that's s a shoe like the prime X X2 strong can come in this is a shoe that has two layers of carbon fiber plates and Light Strike Pro all throughout the shoe although again a Different Light Strike Pro than what's in the adios Pro 4 and this is a really fun shoe for long runs if you're going to be putting some speed into those long runs so it is a jumbo shoe but it's not exactly like a MX cushion super relaxed plush shoe uh it is comfortable but it's really designed for those times where you're going to be in your shoes for a long time and but still want a little bit of extra oomph to it because you're going to be putting in either marathon pace miles or uptempo miles that are faster than just easy and certainly faster than recovery and so this would be kind of like the five shoes that I think right now make a lot of sense together as an Adidas running [Music] lineup now let's wrap up the video by talking about the buying guide and we'll also talk about some Alternatives that you're likely already considering the Adidas adios Pro 4 is a lighter and faster shoe I think it's a really great blend of its predecessor and also the EVO One I feel like it takes really great aspects of each of the shoes to make a great product that I think Pros are going to enjoy but I think that non- Elites especially are going to really gravitate towards it'll be on sale in January of 2025 for $250 and that's quite a bit of time away so let's take a look at some of those Alternatives that are available now and I'm using air quotes because we're halfway through or more than halfway through fall Marathon season so while they're technically on the market they may be a little bit difficult to find but in either event let's talk about some of that competition I mean I feel like the first two shoes that I need to talk about are the shoes we've already been talking about this entire video and that's going to be either the EVO One or the adios Pro 3 these are two shoes that are currently available although I'm not really recommending the EVO One and the main reason for that is that it's a $500 shoe that doesn't really have the durability that I would want for a shoe that I'm going to recommend to you guys to spend $500 on and I do think that's it's probably the closest thing to the adios Pro 4 but for most people the alternative that I'm really going to be recommending is the adios Pro 3 this is a shoe that's been available for about 2 years at this point at the time this video was shot and you can find it usually for $250 at the full price for some of the latest colors or you might be able to find it at a discount for some of the other colors that are available it's still a really great shoe now that I running the adios Pro 4 the adios Pro 3 has lost a little bit of its shine but until you run in the adios Pro 4 if you haven't done it yet the adios Pro 3 is probably going to be the racing shoe from Adidas that I'm going to be recommending to people if you are part of that three stripes life but now let's take a look at the one shoe from another brand that I'll talk about today that I think doesn't really feel the same but I know a lot of you guys are going to be thinking about and that's from the swoosh and this is the alphafly version 3 currently I think it's fair to say that this is the fastest shoe in the world at least when it comes to Marathon because this shoe is the shoe that Kelvin Kipton ran the men's World Marathon record in and it's the same shoe that Ruth chapen Getti ran the women's world record marathon in just a couple weeks ago in Chicago in fact both of those records were set on the streets of the Chicago in this shoe now the differences between these shoe are substantial in comparison to the fit of the adios Pro 4 the fit on the alpy 3 is generous if not almost baggy which is a weird thing to say about an alpha 5 3 cuz the alpha 5 typically every year have been a bit of a toe cruncher this one the fit is much more accommodating the one thing that I will say though is while I do love a really good knit material and this is really good racing knit material the edges of of this shoe are very harsh so if you like to wear low socks and you're old like I am uh you're going to have to be careful because uh anytime it does touch your bare skin it's going to make you bleed a bit of your old blood but in terms of the real Essences of these shoes let's talk about the midsoles and the midsole Technologies I feel like the Zoom airpods that are in the alphafly 3 feel very different in comparison it almost feels a bit clunky and a bit harsh when you're landing on those foot pads it kind of reminded me of like when you're running across a kind of like a plywood subfloor where there's like a bounce to it and it's noisy uh those are the kind of two things that I felt when I was running in the alpha 5 3 most recently I'm not really sure what the exact right word for it is that it's kind of feels rickety in in comparison to the smoothness that I'm feeling out of the adios Pro 4 but then on the other hand like the noise aside the ritin aside and kind of that almost mechanical feeling that I get from the zoom airpods that are in here I feel like there's still an efficiency to the shoe that can't be denied I feel like it's a really great set it and forget it kind of shoe it knows how to find what your Marathon level effort is and it helps you just run in that for mile after mile after Mile and it's an excellent racing shoe it just feels very different than what you're getting in the adios Pro 4 but to the Alpha's credit even though it feels like it's a heavier shoe and the adios Pro 4 feels like it's a much lighter shoe the alha 5 3 only comes in 2/10 of an ounce heavier at 7.4 oun so it's also a very lightweight and efficient shoe so depending on what you like I think that's going to help you decide which one is the best for you and I think that's something that's going to be a theme for all of the super shoes that are reviewing in 2024 into 2025 we're at a point where it's not just one brand having one great product that's way better than everything else many brands have a good race product if not multiple really good race product and which one is the best is really going to depend on who's doing the running in them it's about matching the right Runner with the right tool so those are my thoughts on the adios Pro 4 let me know in the comments if you any questions about this shoe or any of the shoes that I talked about today or better yet stop by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run cpub Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all for today everybody thanks so much for making it all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music]",

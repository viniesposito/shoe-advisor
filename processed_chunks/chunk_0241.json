  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Jeff Colt um on Superstar I'm just going to say it that way and also to te it off I've been thoroughly whooped by this guy multiple times cir series hes Mountain Run Like that's such a good race oh wow such a good race um but we're here to talk about on um I've seen a couple of these shoes around at different events throughout the SE prototypes of this one on your feet many others um and when we show on media I get comments like is that an on shoe tell me more yeah because I'm just going to say it an has not been playing a major role in the trail scene for a while athletes but here we are give us this next Generation give us the rundown on what you got okay I've been running with on since 2020 and since 2020 the date has been 2025 okay of like we're going to make our Splash and Trail in 202 so as an athlete for the last 4 years uh anytime someone's like Jeff you run for on like what trail shoe do you like what have you've been running in and you can't tell them I've been running in this yeah and and I different prototypes and versions of what we're calling the Ultra Pro um so for me it's it's huge to be able to say yeah I'm running in this product it's now commercially available and do I believe in it like 100% um so I got to work on this product from the early stage prototypes all the way through to what we have here in my hands um there's only one thing that remains with the ultra line and that's the name okay this is the Ultra Pro this is the ultra 3 you might know the ultra and the ultra 2 I would say both of those shoes they've had success they're a little bit more in the like hike run space um everything is revised with this shoe and I'm going to start on the bottom with the mission grip this is a totally different rubber compound uh than on those ear iterations it's incredibly tacky it works really well in wet slick conditions it works really well on you know faster uh Colorado dirt trails I took it on Falling Waters uh Franconia ridg loop back in New Hampshire which is notoriously Steep and wet and I'm like still in Prototype phase before the 2023 utnb and literally videoing telling the engineering team like Antoine I can't slip and I was just so fired up so fired up so um new rubber compound really really grippy you'll see this Center Channel and this Fork the fork here is actually kind of showing that the plate that's in this shoe is a forked plate so it's going to allow for you know variable foot strike on different terrain without actually forcing the entire shoe to can of lever or or um you know kind of tip uh additionally this Center Channel mixed with the clouds these clouds look small smaller from the sides if we go into the center they actually get wider and deeper okay inside the shoe what that means is for such a tall 38 mil sack heite shoe okay and what's the so narrow through the uh through the midfoot this shoe when you're actually rolling on it it collapses in on itself and it hugs the foot really nicely so it provides a really stable platform for being 38 down to 32 so 6 mil drop um traditionally a lot of trail shoes will do that with some more other stability mechanisms fo so this is the CL actually doing its job yeah a lot narrower through the midfoot than some of the other Trail Super Shoes on the market um if we see helan HF that means it's our super foam so there are different densities of a super foam but Helen HF we have two different densities here we've got a peba and then down below we have a tpe um so little below the nylon fiberglass plate so early iterations where carbon fiber wasn't the right fit for the shoe um it was a little too stiff um okay and is this the same the same plate that's running here or is it two separate pieces sorry it's it's one plate so the orange you see is is the plate this is just kind of showing that it's a a pronged plate um moving on from the foam we go into the upper and with the upper you have a completely static material it's a really Progressive design uh it's really lightweight which is wonderful but for a higher stack Shu again with a narrower width you have an upper that's really going to hold the foot tight in position uh more of a conventional heel cushion okay not quite uh needed to go to like the the kind of Road supero uh minimal heel cushion it it it's really comfortable um everything around this shoe was designed for efficiency so let's look at the 100 mile distance Western States UTMB the thought was not like maximum uh return always it was let's make this a really comfortable shoe to actually stride in so you don't see this huge rocker but you get a really nice roll through from both the Dual density foam and again this ability to kind of collapse in on itself um So ultr Pro we've had you know two and a half three years of prototyping to get to this point uh athletes have been running in it now for just over you know a year and a half and races it's an exceptional shoe and you said it like on showing up in trail in a very intentional and meaningful way in 2025 this is that showcase piece okay okay and and is this your piece just for race state are you bringing this out on certain types of Trail runs where does this show yeah I when I've had this shoe it's been Jeff put as many miles as you can in this send it back to me uh so like get 350 400 miles in a shoe I'll ship it back to Zur my Western States this year didn't go as as planned it was kind of a sideways race which ended up being kind of nice cuz the two pairs that they sent me for the race they were like giving me some space and they didn't ask back for it uh they didn't ask for them back so um I'll train in this shoe uh longer like I wouldn't treat it quite like a road super shoe that maybe it's like two three runs a month type deal I'll do two runs a week in this shoe pretty comfortably when this shoe comes out though there's a reason I'll I'll end up in in a year putting more miles in the ultra 3 probably than the Ultra Pro okay and some of that is um this shoe you know the the foam the super foam's going to wear down or kind of lose its life a little bit quicker um this is still a redesigned you know very different from the current Ultra line it's way more similar to the Ultra Pro got a 32 mm stack height yeah so 32 mil stack height a little lower to the ground I think for faster races I would say for like cir series I'd probably lean toward this um the foam densities you've got Helen HF up above and then a more standard Eva below the plate is slightly softer it's still a St shape and still a nylon fiberglass layout but stiffer Foams slightly softer plate lower stock height I think it's a uh shoe for you know everyday training runs um long run and then uh maybe faster like in the 50k race or just something more technical yeah it's much more moderately stacked for Trails so still a 6 mm drop really still a really really nice upper these shoes drain incredibly well yeah so breathable you can see right through them as we're we're looking at yeah that's a a big thing when we were working on this at the 2022 2023 Western States was just like guys I I need a shoe that like if water goes in it's going to all pour out like gortex is that right like don't don't give me stuff I don't need trim it down make it make it so that it's going to work really well for the athletes um the ultra 3 is still going to do that okay so thinking of this as not necessarily just your daily trainer good option for a variety of Trail a variety of distances Paces but this is your Ultra race day Sho yeah yeah so targeted for UTMB in western states um really made to be an efficient shoe for that 100 mile distance and when when is this when can we expect to see June 19th okay of 2025 so the week before Western States this shoe will launch and price point 260 okay and the ultra 3 will actually be a little bit later July 3rd and uh 190 all right so these two are kind of the the ultra line also keep your eyes out in the future for more uh you know uphill short course oriented speedier trail shoes so lot to come from on okay and will that other shoe come 2025 or are we going to wait till got to be patient on that okay that sounds good thank you Jeff for joining us tell us all about",

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Connor with normal and he's going to walk us through normal's updates we don't see updates a whole lot in terms of every season or anything from normal so this is really exciting uh updating some of the the Heritage stuff the stuff you guys started out with um what kind of updates can we expect in this next year absolutely yeah so a couple of big updates in Fall 25 I think you know the Brand's mission is to make super sustainable product so that's why we're not necessarily updating every year for the sake of adding a new number to the shoe right but we had you know some some pretty critical uh feedback across the lifespan of these shoes and we're ready to to get some updates in the mix uh to make the product better functionally right so we have the two shoe franchises the jarag and the toir um and they both see uh updates of some kind for a fall win 25 yeah yeah and I I mean in our experience in the shoe it's just one of those kind of you built it to be timeless and it kind of feels that way when as Trail Runners we for the most part we want to be really connected to the trail and that's what the shck has been based off of and so what kind of update can we expect from that yeah so yeah we've got the jarro one here this is uh live through spring 25 and then the update is my jarag 2 right so that will be uh July 15th launch so certainly a lot of kind of similar design cues right you're not looking at it and wondering if they're related or not um um but we made yeah some some subtle updates it's a lot of under the hood updates I would say so from the bottom up vbr light base Mega grip this is the exact same outsole material pattern it's crazy light very sticky and uh longl lasting tried and true perfect uh the foam is actually all new so though it looks similar this is an updated foam we're calling it uh xure plus it's a new compound we found that it was lighter it had better bounce and it was more durable durability is a big deal for us so easy upgrade there um being and how does xper plus compared to like xper that was in the toir right and as well as in theer yes um yeah so uh better durability testing and kind of a more responsive foot feel uh at a lighter weight it it feels mod better yeah kind of better in all ways right um so really happy to have that what you'll see you can probably notice if you look at the two shoes um we added 22 Mill M of Stack right so here we're at a 2620 stack height uh with that new foam so there's a little bit more material and keeping the shoe with the overall same we again because it is a lighter product we also added a bit more rocker to the shoe as we added some stack we wanted it to continue to have that you know really quick Toof kind of launch ability it is you know a light and fast troll racer for sure yeah totally and so it's I wouldn't say it's moderating the performance at all but it's expanding exactly that the idea is that we're going to you know we're going to accommodate more foot types and more Runners with the update to the jar too we feel really good about what's the upper material same upper material yeah so we're working with Matrix as before however we uh we've got a single layer uh jard knit Matrix which is a less material overall Matrix of course being so durable so great at foothold we were able to essentially minimize material there and get the same performance we're really happy with that uh for again accommodating movement and Dynam dynamism in the foot um and then the tongue uh is probably the most visible difference right we're going to a knit stretch 3D tongue fully gusseted fully gusseted yeah for a little bit more Comfort um in the shield that is awesome yeah yeah couple nice updates stays at 195 retail so okay and when will we be able to get this again July 15th 2025 okay hopefully earlier that's a lot of Summer I want summer in this Sho that's right right okay what else do we got what else we got so here we've got the jar brute so this is a uh spring 25 launch um Q2 uh forgive me the exact date probably sometime there in April there but this shares a lot of traits with the jarag one being that 6 mm drop um the primary difference of course is that traction story it's a very aggressive um 6 mm lug deep lugs widely spaced so you're getting grip where otherwise you know you'd be slipping around um you know best inclass grip in worst possible condition conditions with the jute uh and then on the upper we're again we're using Matrix we love the durability and the fo hold provided by matrix but it's a different material and notably there's much less like foam and padding on the upper this is meant to be a hydrophobic upper on the shoe so we're not adding water weight when we're in those sloppy conditions that necessitate this level of grip yeah that's awesome so this is like this is everyday this is Big Adventures maybe more um yeah above tree line loose footing whether that's mud scree snow you know places where you need that extra bite that's where the jar Brew comes in that's awesome that's awesome okay and and what else I know we have one more shoe right yeah we've got one more shoe so here is the to toir 2 and gortex so the toir updated to the second version in Spring 24 y um and that's been cruising along we love great update I love it too I'm wearing it now it's uh I just keep putting miles on it waiting for it to break down haven't got there yet yeah exactly um yeah super soaked about the toare 2 adding a gortex model uh really critical you know in certain regions of the country going into the fall winter season in the Outdoor Channel we know outdoor you know they sell a lot of trail shoes to Trail Runners and other outdoor sports right yeah so the gortex is super valuable in that context um but it's the same tooling as far as outsole midsole go the upper is an invisible fit gortex membrane which we like invisible fit because it takes up less space there's less taping so it breathes better um and it kind of moves better than maybe your typical booty construction does in that in that case uh to go with it you'll see kind of renewed refreshed branding and we went from a curved tongue and eyes days to a straightened out which we found is a better uses the width of the material in the last to kind of fit better around the for foot of the shoe and accommodate wider feet better awesome yeah so like a little kind of a little tweak Midstream um by adding the gortex to the to 2 thing that Runners deal with is like if I am going to go gortex typically it's heavier but how what this doesn't seem to be much of a weight difference yeah so you you are adding material right you don't get to swap the gortex in for something else so at what um you know was about an 8 and 1/2 o shoe we're just under 9 o um so yeah minimal amount is this one Gator compatible yeah yeah for sure Gator compatible all the way um definitely yeah maximum izing kind of your gortex by adding a g what was the price on this one again 205 no 200 forgive me 200 200 for kind of typical what you see in most you know gortex breathable models plus 20 to get that gortex yeah exactly cuz cuz what is the normal or the to 2 is 180 okay awesome awesome and I don't think we got uh that's the one that's 205 that's one yep okay awesome thank you for the rundown of course thank you guys mean it's exciting from a it is it is it's like a tight line but really good a lot a lot of uh kind of runners needs covered so absolutely happy to happy to serve thank you Conor of course thank you guys",

  "text": "you've put in the hard work done countless Mars over the last few months pushed through many difficult runs no doubt highs and lows along the way running has completely taken over your life but you can now finally see the light at the end of the tunnel that start line is in sight congratulations you've reached the taper phase my name is Ben Parks 225 Marathon I've run nearly 100 marathons over the years and Coach so many athletes to achieve their PBS over the Marathon distance this is a collection of everything I've learned and used in my own training and everyone we coach so starting out what is tapering well in simple terms that tapering is reducing the volume we are running each week to maintain our accumulated Fitness while allowing us to fully recover from the training block that we've just been through this full recovery period we're about to go through will allow us to use that Fitness to its full potential and reach race state in our Peak state to go out there and perform if you don't take then you run the real risk of arriving at the start line tired and fatigued so many Runners are really scared of losing Fitness but over the tape of period our muscles will be repairing our body is recovering our mind is recovering as well it will give us the opportunity to sharpen everything up to be in the best possible shape on the day all of our training plans follow a 3 we taper the first week you've only got a very small reduction in the amount of volume and then two weeks out you see a decent reduction and then one week out quite a big reduction in overall volume right let's go through each week in detail starting out with 3 weeks to go so with 3 weeks to go you're talking around about a 10 to 15% drop in overall volume compared to our peak week so if your biggest week was 100K for example this week you're talking around about 85 to 90k in volume we want to be keeping our intensity the same so our long run our speed sessions and our strides should still be in there just as they always have been the number of runs should stay the same as well we're just slightly reducing the the length of those runs your long run this week is still going to be fairly long around about 16 to 18 mil for a lot of people and it's the final chance to practice in your race day kit and with your race day nutrition as well to make sure they're completely dialed in so you're going to be feeling really confident you also want to have a quick look at your nutrition now just making sure you're getting some good protein sources in there each week just to help that recovery and help our muscles repair right it's getting a little bit serious now 2 weeks to go and this has been a lot of people St getting a little bit nervous and thinking they're going to be losing a little bit of a fitness but don't worry trust the process you're going to be fine at this point in the taper we can't add any Fitness we're now just concentrating on maintaining that Fitness we've built and refreshing everything and getting nice and recovered to maximize the potential of using that Fitness so in terms of volume wise we're looking around about a 30 to 35% drop in that peak week volume so using our 100K example there we're talking about 65 to 70k running this week you want to also be keeping the same structure that you've been used to as well again just slightly shorten Those runs but don't go adding in any extra rest J just keep the structure the same as you've been following throughout your plan you going to be keeping a little bit of intensity in there as well keep your speed session in there for the week maybe just cut down the Reps a little bit if you've been doing say 6 or 7 by 3 minutes maybe now do four or 5 by 3 minutes just so our body can recover that little bit quicker from that workout and in terms of long run range for anything from about 10 to 15 miles for our long run and it's also a really good time to book in a sports massage and again get those legs nice and refreshed get everything flushed out of our legs so they'll be feeling really nice and Poppy and ready for race day it's also a really good time to plan out your race day Logistics your travel how you getting there any last minute gel purchases but don't go try any new gels just those gels you've been practicing and you know they're going to be working how you get into the Expo where you're going to meeting your friends and family and of course downloading our race day checklist from the website we'll link to that down below because we want to be keeping that stress to a minimum and what was going to make you very very stressful is if you go and get a cold or an illness this week so really try and focus on getting some extra vitamin C in your body just a supplement or just natural things like orange juice things like that just to help keep that immune system topped up and keep those colds and sicknesses at Bay right moving on to the most important week race week is here probably 6 days to go before one of the biggest runs of your life but don't worry you're going to be absolutely fine this week is going to be quite common for a lot of people to be feeling just a little bit lethargic maybe your energy levels are a little bit lower than normal there maybe be a few little extra eights and pains this is called taper Tantrums or Marino we'll come on to chatting about that a little bit later on but for now in terms of our volume we're talking around about a 60 to 70% drop in overall volume about 30 to 40K plus the race this will be a bigger drop for the beginner plans if people are following that though what I really like to do with everybody is a marathon pace practice session so lower int inity something like 3 or 4X 5 minutes at your goal Pace on the Tuesday or Wednesday with just jogging recoveries between just reminding our body what that race Pace feels like again and it won't add really any extra fatigue into our body I would also say this never feels easy but it's a really good thing to do but don't go panicking too much of how am I going to run 3 four hours at this pace it never feels easy but it's just good to remind our body what that race Pace feels like some people like to put some strides a little short burst about 15 to 20 seconds of running just to help freshen up the legs just get that turnover up a little bit more and they won't be adding really any extra fatigue I personally wouldn't be doing any strength work this week probably from about 10 days into the race I wouldn't be doing any strength work because as you know I've said quite a few times this week is all about recovery many people will suffer with what is known as marinia or taper Tantrums as I just touched on earlier when your body presents these really weird pains and aches you freak out thinking that every pain in your body is going to be some career ending injury this has happened in pretty much every race I've done and about nine times out of 10 your body is absolutely fine it's just the stress you're going through and your body adapting to all the changes and just becoming a little bit fresher and ready for RAC so try not to get too stressed about it but believe me I know that's a lot easier said than done but just be aware that is a thing that happens to a lot of people should I run the day before the race run if you want to it's not going to have any bearing on the race but just two or three Mars 3 4 5K something like that very relaxed and very easy the main benefit of doing this is just keeping your stress levels lower just helping combating those nerves this whole week is about listening to your body and trying to get as much sleep in as you can so we're going to be feeling fresh for race day now a lot of people it's going to be very hard to sleep on usually that Saturday night the day before the race you're going to have all sorts of stress and worries going through your system so we really want to try and prioritize that Thursday and that Friday night to really try and get to bed early and get a decent night sleep and then so when that inevitable slightly Sleepless restless night happens on Saturday which has happened to me so many times over the years and I've always had a pretty good run on Race there as well so don't worry about it Thursday night Friday night that's the key nights you want to be getting a good night's sleep also starting think out about car bloing in those 2 to three days before the race as well and if you are doing like a destination Marathon you're going to some exciting place please this week don't go go doing 20,000 30,000 steps a day doing all your sing do that after the marathon wear that metal with pride as you're walking around a beautiful city if you're interested in my exact 24 hours before a race dat everything I'm doing and eating and things like that that video is coming up next click over here for that but finally best of luck with your race let us know how you get on I'm sure you're going to be amazing we're going to be in Boston and London coming up London will be at the Expo as well exhibiting there every day we'll hope to you there keep on working hard guys keep on it done see you very soon in the next one",

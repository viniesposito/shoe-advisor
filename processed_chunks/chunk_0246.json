  "text": "hey Tomy from the r testers in this video we are going to be doing our full review of the aex GEL Nimbus 27 let's take a [Music] look the A6 gel nibus 27 cost 180 or $165 it weighs 306 G or 10.8 o for men in a size 8 and the drop is 8 [Music] mm the ASX gel nibas 27 isn't add IC update to its predecessor but it does include a couple of big updates to improve the overall comfort of the shoe the most important of those is an increasing the stack height of FF flas Eco midell foam by 2 mm to add even more cushioning to the ride and the other is a new engineered jacked mesh upper to improve comfort and breathability in the rear of the shoe you'll still find the same pure gel technology designed to improve shock absorption and there's an authorly x55 sock liner to add even more cushioning to The Ride Like the earlier versions there's still plent of padding across the upper including a knit rib collar as well as a gusseted tongue wi fit system to ensure a good fit on the outsole is a hybrid aex grip to provide grip and protect the mid comes the fit of the ASX Jael ners 27 I have my usual size here which is a uk9 or a US 10 and it fits me really well I've got no concerns told about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size as I'm someone who's slightly on the fence between a 9 and 8.5 UK it's quite roomy in the toebox for me but not in a way that i' consider too roomy for a Big Easy Day Cruiser like this so yeah all around was very happy with the fit good hold around the hill of midfoot there was a lot of kind of cushioning at the back here but it didn't irritate my achilles at all sometimes found actually when walking that the slightly high collar here would feel a bit weird under my ankle but actually on the run that was never a problem so yeah all around nice comfortable fit as you expect I'd stick to your normal size with a nimbus same size I've used for the past three generations of the shoe just give you a quick word on fit then and I think this is pretty much more of the same as the aex Joe Nimbus 27 you've got really ample room at end of the toe box nice amount of clearance across the top of the toes there's plenty of flex these jackard uppers are a bit more structured than you got with the nip from the 26 but this is still a really roomy happy shoe to run long distance in oodles with space basically lots of Flex for the toes comes back up I get good lock down across the midfoot no problem there we've got these tongues that they're sort of quite loose they're sort of knitted they just take the edge off but they aren't maybe as padded as some you do have to make sure you get them in the right place into the heel colar I think you've got exactly the same heel package as you got in the 26 and they hold well there's lots of plush padding which creates Good Foot security little bit of a heel counter here that's not too stiff but very present holds you nicely I had no slipping no problems with lockdown and I would recommend going TR size in these shoes so fit for me has been very good overall in the gel nus 27 I've got mine in a UK size 8 that's my typical running shoe size that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in aex shoes that's the same shoe size that I had the jamus 25 in I didn't test the gbus 26 now like my experience with the jbus 25 given I've got quite skinny narrow feet I would say the fit is naturally very Ry and accommodating and you know for me that's been absolutely fine given also that there is a wider fit option here but I think for most people going for that standard fit is going to be generally fine I think you know when I talk about that room I think that's particularly in the middle section of the shoe I think in the toe box as well where I think personally I would take maybe things being rained in a little bit to give you something that sits a little bit closer but I think you know it hasn't been an issue having that kind of roomy kind of spacious toe box for me in my running time I think other things to mention here I think in terms of getting a good lock down here I think it it does take a little bit of work here I think you know given the material which is quite skinny and stretchy and that kind of stretchy tongue you're getting here I do find you have to pull them in quite tightly those laces to get a good kind of lock down there when you get further back into the shoe you've got a fair amount of padding there I think you know particularly in the inside of the heel collar the um kind of heel counter is you know it's a pretty flexible one didn't cause any kind of irritation for me at my achilles and there definitely some elements there creating that kind of supportive kind of comfort um at your getting at the hill of the shoe so yeah overall very good fit for me as I said I personally would take something maybe that's sat a little bit closer to my feet but I think in terms of my running time it has been absolutely fine and I think unless you want a really spacious roomy kind of wider fit option going for that standard fit option and going true to size should be absolutely fine for most people so the fit for me in the gel numberers 27 I have a size 8 foot uh I also have very average with feet I don't tend to have problems with shoes very often um the gel number is 27 absolutely perfect there's plenty of space in the 4 foot for me um it's not the widest shoe in the world but it's definitely wide enough on my feet and they are pretty average there is a wider version of the shoe as well so uh you can get that but for me with my average width feet and average sized feet for uh a size H shoe uh is absolutely fine very very comfortable I had no issues I really like the upper design um there's a little bit of giv it so it's quite comfortable around the sides of the foot and there's loads of padding in it as well it's definitely a shoe designed for Comfort I would definitely stay to my sides in the GEL Nimbus 27 run test then and in testing I've logged around 40 km in the GEL Nimbus 27 lots of slow and easy which is largely the intended purpose for this shoe but I've thrown in some faster miles as well tried building to a bit of Marathon Pace on a progression run just to see how they pick up now the big difference here is obviously that extra 2 Ms of softer tuned cushioning that aex has managed to add to the stack without increasing the overall weight and that does change the ride somewhat between the 26 and the 27 but essentially what you get is a shoe that stays pretty true I think to the Nimbus Heritage delivers a plush soft cushioned Comfort ride that's happiest when you're moving slower ticking out those got an easy miles it's not like the Nimbus 26 wasn't cushioned and plush an impact eating but the 27 now offers more of that there's more protection more softness more Long Haul comfort and I think there's also a smidge More Bounce and energy coming back from the midsole as well not enough to make me want to run a lot of marathon pace miles in this shoe which is generally a bit heavy uh it's ultimately still a heavier shoe but you can do marathon pace miles if you really need to though it's a bit harder work for the legs I find now I also did a side by-side Mile with the 26 on one foot and the 27 on the other and wait Wi on the run I think the shoes feel the same there's perhaps a touch less stability in the numers 27 because you've got the extra softness and you've got a bit higher off the ground but it's still a big wide stable shoe stable platform to run off I really like the uppers I think the changes are a step on there's a bit more structure to the jackard than you've got with the knit it's a minor difference here overall in terms of how it wraps the foot and overall I wouldn't say one is more comfortable than the other but I do like the more premium feel and I think it looks nicer than you've got with the old 26 knit I still generally prefer less shoe on the F something lighter and more compact for most of my runs but I still think this generation of the nimus delivers a happy cushion ride that if that's your thing you'll still really enjoy so in terms of my running time in the G num is 27 I would say overall it's been very comfortable I would say it's been a very reliable shoe to run in it's a very stable shoe um to kind of spend time in you know runs very smoothly as well I do think there are some changes here from the the previous gimbus which I tested the gimbus 25 and given that the gimbus 26 was really around kind of changes with the outsole the cor exp has been very similar to The Joe numers 25 I think there as I said some changes here that I think do make a nicer shoe to be one that you are you know is designed to absorb a lot of your running time this is a cushion shoe a cushion daily Trainer shoe that for me very much ve on that kind of easy kind of recovery Pace but I have found I've been able to run at more moderate running Paces in this shoe and it hasn't felt you know totally kind of awkward to do that but I do think this is a shoe built for those kind of you know when your legs are tied and you are doing those kind of easier runs and maybe kind of longer runs as well you're not running at your hardest or fastest now one of the big changes here is you're getting a little bit more of that FF blast Eco um foam here which is you know used in the super Blast 2 but not on its own and then you know we've seen with the Nova blast 5 you know asex has moved away from the um Eco plus kind of phone and use that kind of new FF blast Max phone which is definitely softer compared to this now having that extra you know you know stack of that foam doesn't make it a inherently kind of plusher shoe than the previous shoes I think you know gives you I would say a lot more protection and you know that would be the main quality I would say I think the biggest change for me has been really about where that foam you know is setting and I feel like the geometry of the shoe the slight changes for me have made it a nice issue to run in I think as I said for those Paces those easy recovery Paces I just found the num 25 the ride felt a little bit dull for me I don't think it rolled through as nicely and I feel like that has changed for me with eel Nimbus 27 I I think as I said I have been able to run kind of more moderate Paces in this and it's felt comfortable to do that it would be better if it was a lighter shoe and I think that would give it a touch more versatility but I do think overall it's been a nicer shoe and I think for me some improvements from the gers 25 for me I think out so wise I think there's not a huge you know major difference for me I run in a mixture of dry and wet conditions and for me I think you know this isn't the best outsole grip that you're going to get on a cushion daily train of shoe but I think it offers enough for me I think given you know how most people are probably going to use this shoe and as I say you know you know ticking off a lot of your training Mars when you're not running at your fastest then I think it's going to be generally fine I would be sticking to roads and Pavements maybe handling a little bit of those going to Li to Trails so yeah my experience has been very good overall very much feels like a Gel Nimbus I do think the real story here that the geometry has changed and made it a nicer shoe to tick that running time off and I do think makes it a nicer shoe for me than the joers 205 is it the cushioned you know or the best kind of aex cushioned daily Trainer shoe you should get I'll get into that in the verdict and more so the GEL Nimbus line or the last two versions of it which were the updated versions of the shoe the previous versions uh I never really got on with but the last two versions um I've I've always enjoyed uh I've always found them to be shoes that do what they say on the tin they're comfortable daily shoe you can do easy runs in them recovery runs longer runs um the changes to this version of the shoe essentially from uh the perspective of the experience of the ride is is that midsole a little bit extra midsole foam in there um and for me it doesn't massively change the the ride I'm getting a very similar experience to what I got from the previous two versions of the shoe I think it probably does feel a little bit softer because you get a little bit more of that mid foam in there but for me the um the way I run in the shoe I'm a midfoot striker uh so I'm hitting it right in the middle um the way the geometry of the shoe works uh and the previous two versions of the shoe I don't get much of a roll through in this shoe it's a very comfortable shoe to wear but I I just don't get any sort of transition or comfortable transition um that makes it in any way versatile it still is a very Slappy shoe for me um not as Slappy as the first uh well the the 25 that was the Slappy version of the the new versions of the shoe um it's not as Slappy as that but is quite Slappy for me and I think the reason is that it does have this quite flat bottom section of the shoe I know Nick is a heel Striker so he's probably benefiting a lot more from this big wedge of um mopo at the back for me I'm hearing it dead on this flat section uh and I'm not really getting any sort of transition from it that's not a massively bad thing if you're just buying this shoe for comfort and those easy day runs those longer sessions where you just want Comfort um the runs that I've done in it I've not found it to be particularly versatile it's fine it's comfortable it's nicely stable for um a Max stack shoe uh and as a result it's probably quite accessible for a lot of people who want a load of cushioning but don't necessarily want a really wobbly or or soft shoe uh which can be the case with a lot of Max stack shoes at the moment so over those runs what I've really found about the shoe is that is very much the same as what I've experienced in those pre two two previous versions it's a solid shoe that is just very good for comfort and and everything about the shoe really screams Comfort the upper the the way the midell sits um I did try and pick up the pace in it on a couple of runs didn't really enjoy it one because I really started slapping it quite hard I was actually one point where my girlfriend was about two streets away walking the dog and she saids she could hear me um coming back home so it is quite a loud shoe from that perspective and it really does when you pick up the pace uh I I really start hitting that midsection really hard um so for longer runs I think it's uh I've only got up to 15K in this shoe but for that it was really nice I don't think about this shoe on my feet when it's on there it just feels very comfortable I don't have to worry about the stability of the shoe or anything like that so I think really it's a shoe that is quite nicely balanced if you're looking for a lot of cushioning whereas that's not always the case with these Max stack shoes the outside of the shoe uh it does have quite a lot of exposed areas from that from that midsole foam um the rubber itself is is fine I wouldn't say it's the grippiest outsole on any shoe I've tested but I haven't had any problems on it uh on wet Pavements uh the exposed section here I've not seen any issues on it so far but that does concern me a little bit because this rubber doesn't go out very far from the midell foam so that is just a concern which I think I'll just keep an eye on as I continue to use these shoes all in all though uh outsole is fine just nothing that impressive when compared to some of the better outsoles on the market so I done about 60k in the ax ja Nimbus 27 Now using for a mix of easy and long runs and one progression run move from an easy to slightly faster Paces by the end and on my first run I'd say that the main update that aex had really done to the shoe was to bring it out in teal and send me a teal shoe which is a smart thing to do it immediately made me like the shoe a lot more than previous versions just straight away cuz teal is the best color we all know this but actually I didn't think it' Chang much at all on the run like it has got a little bit of a higher stack heite but in that first run I thought yeah it's a nimbus it's nice comfortable it's protective cushy solid enough job but actually as I've done more runs in the shoe and done different types of runs in the shoe I started to like it a bit more I do think it actually is know a sneakily big upgrade on the previous models of the shoe so you got a little bit more stack heite there which doesn't add too much really in terms of the overall comfort of the shoe it was already a very comfortable shoe but I think the extra end of the foref foot is important and I think actually the geometry has been changed a bit more on the shoe and that's what's made me enjoy it a bit more especially as a heel Striker I think you've now got a much smoother transition from Heel To Toe like I get quite a Slappy ride with the Jo nus 25 and 26 and actually it sometimes even create a bit of discomfort coming through on the shoe and I think it's definitely been smoothed out here I really noticed it when I was running at slightly faster Paces in the shoe and I did that easy to steady run like in the previous models you know as I started to increase the speed it would feel quite Slappy and it wouldn't feel great at all like it's not really the best shoe for speedwork still because it's quite heavy and big it definitely felt less Slappy and more comfortable to me like it's still slightly Slappy shoe but definitely less Slappy than previous models and I do think the heel has been redesigned to just ride a bit more smoothly and I really did notice that as a heel strike and it made it a lot more enjoyable on long runs and then when I was moving a slightly faster Paces at all so like I said I did that easy to steady run pretty standard daily training run but moving down towards almost marathon pace by the end and I thought you know this is going to feel a bit unpleasant in the shoe cuz it is quite big but no not at all I think it's got a stiffer and faster ride than I think I expected and you'd probably expect from a shoe like this I'm not going to say it's a superv style shoe that I'd love to go do a load of speedwork in it but I do think it now has a bit more hostility to it and even as a heavy shoe uh I think it does work as you know a daily trainer for people who want to really cush and ride but one a shoe that can then do kind of tempo effort you know the odds kind of long session long long runs that kind of thing I think it you can do them okay in the ja nus 27 if you're not that fuss about those kind you're not someone like me who's someone who have a rotation have a dedicated speed work shoe for those kind of runs if you just want you know one shoe to do lots of different kinds of runs then the Nimbus 27 is actually better than than I expected for such a big shoe while obviously really excelling on those nice relaxed easy runs as well because of the comfort you have underf foot like I say the ride is a little bit stiffer than I expected and some people might not like that so much an easy shoe but I think it probably the kind of thing that breaks in a little bit like it's eased a bit over the first few runs already and I didn't find it uncomfortable at all but yeah it's probably a slightly different feeling than you might expect from a shoe like this when you step into it you're not getting that soft squishy feeling you get on some of these Big Max cushion shoes like the 1080 line or the Nike Invincible or something like that like it has a bit of firmness to it and resiliency while still being really comfortable and that I think does help with the smoothness and the speediness of the transition from Heel To Toe which is something that I find comfortable like it's not really the definition of comfort but have that smooth and natural transition from Heel To Toe that just means I can tick over without thinking about the shoe too much is almost how I Define Comfort on those easy and long runs and the Jo nimbers for such a big shoe does disappear on the foot nicely so after you know prettyy standard first run that I thought was going to be much the same as previous models I've actually ended up really enjoying the gimbus 27 more than I expected I think it's a really natural feeling shoe for such a big shoe and you do get a little bit more versatility than you might expect and yeah it comes in teal so that's fantastic so my ver on the ax GEL Nimbus 27 is that this is a very solid update to the Gel Nimbus line and for me personally it does feel like an upgrade on the previous gel nimas shoes I think particularly from a ride point of view you and I think if you are looking for a shoe that is very comfortable very protective I think very stable and you know you know can really help you kind of tick off that running mileage then this is a shoe absolutely can do it I think if you're looking for your first running shoe this is a good option if you're looking for a good long run shoe this is going to fit the bill as well I think when you look at the other kind of cushion daily trainer shoes and asx's kind of range of shoes I think there becomes a bit of a problem I think you know look at the Nova blast 5 which is cheaper and I think you would use for the same types of runs as the gel number 27 which is a more expensive shoe I think that is a shoe that can work for long runs as well I think gives you that comfort as well and that protection in a slightly different way but I still think in a very effective way I do think there are super Blast 2 qualities in the GEL Nimbus but that's really around the midsole and you know when you look at what you get in the super Blast 2 and you know it just has a quicker feel to it has a lighter you know overall weight as well is apparently a more versatile shoe compared to the jail ners 27 I think if you look outside the aex range I think it becomes a problem as well again for the Jael nimbers particularly around the the midso foam and just having other midsole Foams that are just a bit more enjoyable just has a little bit more fun about it I think you look at what you're getting in kind of you know Brooks's range particularly at the moment I think you look at saky as well what you're getting from New Balance as well so I think you know from that point of view at this kind of range this type of shoe maybe aex is playing a little bit of catch up is falling a little bit behind but crucially it does have something in the Nova blast 5 and I think that FF blast Max phone which I think probably for me will probably end up in the ja Nimbus some way down the line if not you know very soon the Next Generation the ja Nimbus but for me I've had a very good experience with the G Nimbus 27 I do think it's Improvement on the G nimus 25 which I tested and the g nimus 26 which you know wasn't massively changed from the Jus 25 and I think if you like the JIS range the most recent range and you like the idea of something that just has a little bit more of a noticeable kind of you know rocker and ride in it then I think that's what you're going to get in the jail number 27 if you're looking for the best kind of value cushion daily Trainer shoe the most memorable shoe this is probably not it but I do think a lot of people are going to like what you get from the GEL Nimbus 27 to my verdict on the aex GEL Nimbus 27 I think it's pretty much more of the same of what you're getting from the previous two versions of the Jael Nimbus line it's a very stable comfortable um accessible shoe if you're looking for easy runs longer runs um recovery runs that sort of thing I don't think it's particularly versatile still I don't think the updates that have been made to the Midol foam have had a dramatic impact on its versatility I would pretty much only ever use this for those easier runs daily runs are I'm going out ticking off the miles and I'm not really bothered about the speed for me that's probably going to be about 5 minute kilm 5 minute 15 km feel spying at those Paces picking up the pace in this getting down to like 4:30 doesn't feel very comfortable doesn't feel like it wants to do that and definitely I don't get a lot of um smooth transition from the the geometry of the shoe it feels very much like I'm landing on it it's comfy and then I'm pushing off again it doesn't feel like there's any sort of comfortable smooth transition uh from this from this geometry there are a lot of alternatives to the shoe and at \u00a310 this is quite an expensive shoe I know a lot of shoes are getting quite expensive now but I've always thought the nimus line is a very expensive shoe for what you get from it for me um I'd look at something like the new band Mo V5 is considerably cheaper than shoe little bit softer now um but I just get better transition from that shoe I feel like um it just smoothly Glides me forward as I'm maintaining a nice consistent Pace at like 5 minute 20 or something like that um and I get a lot more of that transition from that shoe um so I definitely go some like newbound more V5 for my style of running over the over the Nimbus uh I think that she was like 108 v14 quite similar in a lot of ways to this shoe um but I do think that the um 1080 is a little bit more versatile in the more recent version it just has a little bit of a smoother RVE for me and just feels a little bit lighter on the feet and then something like the um Brook ler in Max I think is very similar in this shoe to a lot of ways um but the only difference is I just think it's a little bit more versatile not massively but I would prefer that shoe to this shoe if I was doing very training sessions in it and I wanted something maybe from marathon training or something like this uh I probably would Reserve would use this shoe primarily always for those easy runs or uh daily runs where I'm getting up to about 15K or something but I definitely would try and do anything faster in this shoe so I definitely enjoyed my time in the axd on Imus 27 I think it's one of the better Big Max cushion shoes out there probably put it in line with the sakon hurcan 24 is my favorite of these Big Max cushion shoes which are not generally the kind of shoes I go for like even on my easy runs long runs I tend to prefer to be in something that's a little bit smaller and lighter and just a bit more Dynamic and ticks over a bit better but the Jo 27 is certainly would be a contender for my iritation if I was going to have you know a big Max cushion shoe in there it would be between this and the suc Hurrican 24 which also thing is an excellent shoe that runs a lot lighter than it is has a nice rocker has a little bit of resiliency to push against and that's build more as a stability shoe and has maybe you a few more stability features but the gel 27 is also a very stable shoe for a neutral shoe and yeah wouldn't really you know worry about it on that front at all despite the high stack so yeah a really good shoe I think a nice update on the previous model I still think the previous model is more similar than different to this shoe I prefer the ride on this shoe for sure and I'd get it over the Jael ners 25 or 26 if there was only a little price difference if you are finding the older shoe at a massive discount then I'd probably still get that because that is still a good comfortable easyday shoe but at the same time I do think this is a better shoe and one I enjoyed a lot more than the previous model so I do think it's a successful update despite the fact it felt like quite a minor update to me initially also in the attics range you have the NOA blast of course now the no blast 5 I really like as well I think that's a good shoe that also had I think a redesigned heel bevel this year that made it a smoother riding shoe no blast is still really cushioned that's probably the shoe I'd go for as more of a generalist cushion daily trainer like it's a lot lighter than the ja num 27 has a bit more versatility they're both really good shoes I think they almost do quite similar jobs so I'd just get the lighter shoe and the no blast and the cheaper shoe as well but if you're a slightly heavier Runner or really crave like loads of cushioning under fo then the ja nimus 27 I think does a really good job and we'll provide that at that slightly higher price few other shoes you know in this big Max cushion Market I think the 1080 v14 is a lighter shoe and a slightly smaller shoe and that feels a bit more Dynamic and maybe has a slightly more exciting phone than the G Nimbus 27 I think that's another one that I think has a bit more versatility and almost feels more like a similar Feud to the Nova blast the de Nimbus these days for me because it is a little bit lower stack and feels a bit more like a cushion daily trainer this feels bit more build just as a Max stack shoe even though I do think it is a bit more verstile than you might expect I think I prefer it to some like Su Triumph 22 which is just not a shoe I really got on with that well there's a Brooks Glycerin Mac which is a bit more expensive and you know has quite a similar Vibe actually a big Max cushion shoe a bit of resiliency there you probably got a livel foone with the glycerin Max but you're paying a bit more for it and don't necessarily think it's a much better shoe for faster runs or anything like that and the Nimbus 27 is certainly as good if not a little bit better for just allout easy runs so yeah that' be a bit of a toss up there's a glycerin 22 coming as well which looks interesting so all around I think this is one of the better Max cushion shoes out there for sure it's probably one of my favorites like I say with the sakon Huracan 24 just got a ride that is big and cushioned but turns over nice and speedily feels quite natural has more versatility than you expect and is nice and smooth from Heel To Toe with a little bit reduced slapp compared to previous models so a successful update for me the SX Jo Nimbus 27 verdict then Nimbus fans are going to like this Nimbus because this is textbook Nimbus just soft and more cushioned without adding any extra weight that's a trend I think we're going to see a lot of the stack Heights rise across many shoes with new light performance Foams coming across the lineups for me the Nimbus is a shoe it's a bit limited on versatility I'd only tend to use it for my slowest runs I think that's still the case despite there being a little bit extra energy out the midso it wasn't great at marathon pace but the Nimbus 27 does an equally good job as the 26 for that easy slow Comfort running if you wanted more Kush than the nimus 26 offered you'll absolutely love this shoe if you prefer things a little stiffer then I'd stick with the nus 26 if you own the 26 I wouldn't rush out and buy the 27 until you need to the changes aren't that pronounced the other plus I think is the numers 27 feel built a last this is a shoe that should have long mileage lifespan and even if that phone bottoms out a bit I think it's still going to be more cushion than many shoes out there if you like your easy Run shoes to also pack a bit more versatility though I think the new Nova blast 5 might be worth a look probably not as sort of overall cushion but it's got a little bit more softness I personally like the Brooks ghost Max 2 which is a bit snappier but it's not as cushion and sof as the nimus 27 I also think the New Balance 1080 v14 now offers sort of nimus style easy Comfort but maybe a bit more energy as well that's it from us on this review of the asex gel niers 27 thanks a

I've got some maps to look at so I think we'll I think we'll find our way but switching back switching back everyone to the pulsars agil were fine but the pulsars you know my the balls of my feet were a little tired slnb after Monday's fkt which was only 2.4 miles and this one or sorry 2.6 mil to the Top This one is three today uh less elevation gain today so it's going to be a little faster but I am excited to explore new trails seek a little beauty along the way and see if we can't snag this uh snag this mountain Carpenter Peak Carpenter Peak it's not really a peak I would say it's more of a more of a hill but you know they call it Carpenter Peak here in the uh South Denver area all right um let's get laced up as we do in pulsars and Let Her Fly okay we'll get to these boxes here in a second once we get back to the car I'll open these up for all of you thank you thank you companies for [Music] [Applause] [Music] move it on down the road got to [Music] [Music] move you got down the road was [Music] it's my dreams Flash [Music] down the road got to move it on down the road don't wait don't to sh those got move it down you got down the I wait of round but I never feel the pain yeah the hor fire to blaz oh oh oh Oho [Music] oh my oh it's exactly 5K to the top 3.1 miles let's just say it's time for a vacation literally the next Vlog on this channel will be from some beaches around the world everybody cuz uh it's been a doozy so obviously as you know the year did not start off great uh but we've had a really strong second quarter of training really strong I think this is the seventh or eighth week above 100 miles so it's just been a nice I I'll put it on the screen right now the uh mileage graph I was running like 20 30 miles a week the first two months of the year not much maybe 40 mil once it just was that was life but now we're coming it's like you just you learn as you get older as a runner to be be incredibly patient and so that's what I've been this year and I feel good but but when I started today this is a carpenter Peak uh my legs were done they were heavy they felt like lead they didn't want to go the effort on Monday where I had to really really dig and I missed that fkt by two seconds um I felt it today but we got it today all right oh that was fun um I think it was Scott shout out to Scott you threw down a good time I threw down a decent time and now somebody else go throw throw down an even better time all right so good second quarter second quarter the second quarter isn't even over but uh oh man feeling good all right I haven't forgot actually question of the day how is your second quarter of training progressing cuz we're basically halfway through I'm realizing it feels like we're in July but no it's only May uh how's your second quarter of training progressing all right first box I said we oh my my hello a lot of people as you know I've been wearing the goggles I don't wear them all the time because they get sweaty when it's really hot out like today these are coup all right but now a little Smith action Smith was my first goto uh sunglasses for trail running about 5 years ago I had the chroma pop Max remember those glasses I wore them for a couple years but I ended up breaking a couple pairs so Smith Oh My My look at this oh is that gold a little a little CU Buffalo gold don't mind if I do oh that's nice you know what I've learned though I'm literally I might save these for race day because if you wear glasses all the time they just get those micro scratches and it's no dice so oh those are real oh man they look I can tell it gets a good depth of field which is critical for trail racing all right thank you Smith do appreciate that all right let's see what's going on here uhhuh oh that's awesome

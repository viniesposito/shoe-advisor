  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Brett Rivers senior product manager of the North Face and they have a ton of updates for this this next year right away in the spring right um and like couldn't be more excited these shoes um many of these shoes have made our year- end Awards uh and they're just getting better like the North Face is really you it feels like you're becoming a marble in a Groove and you are going like we are building we're not starting from zero each time you know going from Z to one is hard but now we're going from 1 to two to three you're chisel chiseling away that rock and becoming exactly you're ready to go so what what do we have the new Summit vective Pro 3 so this is that Pinnacle you know athlete tested race proven Summit Series style within the line This the concept here is is really Revolution versus Evolution it really starts you know from the bottom up on this style does this ask if I want the highest performing and I need the highest performing Trail shoe on the market that largest competitive advantage and so uh The Innovation team at all triangles and an ay really got to work for that spring 25 season of how do we develop a system that enhances both that that performance rebound that propulsion as well as that stability and so we designed a completely uh new and really Innovative um platform in the summ effective Pro 3 we increased the total stack height four millimeters overall from the pro two you still have that amazing um proprietary peba Eva super foam um midsole here yep with then and that's the dream foam same you're going to find in Alesa the vecta Pro 2 um it it really is dreamy I mean we've loved it so far great for trail application what what makes it so dreamy like what about it that's the secret sauce yeah come I mean I really it's how effctive is a system so we think of it just plates but it's geometry plates and how that entire system works so here we now put a carbon fiber propulsion plate down in that midsole and then a 10 mm dream foam drop in above that and what that's going to do really build in that long ultra distance Comfort um and really still continue to enhance that propulsion that you have below the foot and for for those in the past that have had some of that rubbing of the plate some athletes do some athletes don't this is completely embedded it's all hid under there and so correct it's peeking out of the window some cutouts in the midfoot but it's down in there and then as you go up in stack height and you do these these newer softer Foams you still really need to stabilize that foam for trail application and again this is about Ultra racing um you know winning the big ones as we say exactly so what we've done is we've taken this recycled carbon fiber injected stability plate and the idea here is really carving that out shaping it you glue that in it's giving you a lot of that lateral stability building in more of that almost independent suspension um around the foot you know so really embedding that down as well what this does is really accentuate and improve that midot to 4ft stability transition which you know again if you're running for 20 hours 25 hours um you know really gives you an advantage stability wise saving your legs with this entire system so that's all what goes into to you know that Pro yeah and so like you're taking the the stability mechanism we know we need that and you're taking the propulsive mechanisms and and spreading them out through and separating them and I mean we can't necessarily see this in something like a road shoe where there's this layered this isn't necessarily a plate but in the trail there's some serious application to absolutely yeah this is Performance Tuned for the trail it's not just taking Pinnacle Elite marathoning shoe and putting more traction on the out so yep it's and I like I like that idea of like a full system it really is this layered system yeah so what about up top cuz I know that that upper is pretty special too yeah so uh an improved version of that that TPU reinforced um uh TPU yarn upper hydrophobic uh very breathable drains incredibly well an improved race lace um uh with that as well um and you know here it's like we still really needed to stay under 300 G this is racing product we come in at 294 G on a men's nine um so as we go up in stack height and really you know do this dual plate stack Plate System you know you're really not paying a weight uh having any significant weight tradeoff with all of that as well yeah and and for Elite Performance we know that's one of the things that Runners look for lighter weight but they want all these other benefits what what is the total stack for this so it's 37 mm in the heel uh plate midsole and outs sole um and everything we do in the trail run side is a 6 mm offset so it's a 3731 stack height awesome and and weight do you know that weight after the top of your head 294 g94 and price uh $250 of maintaining price which is huge yeah go so in lot like what you'll really see is us really striving to maintain price as much as possible you know this this Elite uh segment of Footwear is growing but we still want to be hyper competitive in that while at the same time really delivering something that's unique to the market yeah and I and I don't want to put too many spoilers out there but I've been in this and it it's special it's a special shoe um let's go to like it's training companion right was that what you would absolutely so the vective endurus is really going to be I would say that that more consumer uh relevant style from an everyday perspective in this we want to really uh bridge the gap from that everyday you know training shoe to race day you know for the person who has a one shoe quiver this is the perfect you know single shoe for them if they're wanting want you to do everything at the same time you can directly see a lot of the Innovation that started in the prob that's really cascading down into the endurus um and what's neat here is we're coming in at $160 with a lot of improvements that are going on in this style overall and in the endurus the past couple models have really almost have created a cult following a little bit people love the endurus so what are what are they going to see that familiar in that line and what's going to be different again it's problem solving based off of athlete and consumer feedback so what we want to do overall is really continue to accelerate that underfoot performance so now you have a ful length nitrogen TPU dream Foam midsole High rebound lightweight that rebound really stays throughout the life of the shoe um we've increased the lug depth to 4 mm and completely redesigned that outsole again to really enhance the action uh underfoot uh and then a lot of just smaller improvements really focusing on that InStep fit a bit more where in the endurus 3 if you had a narrower lower volume fit or lower inep could be yeah there's more room so this new dual warp upper that you're seeing um in several of the new shoes um really uh wraps the foot incredibly well so some pattern improvements that we did there um but at the same time a materialization that you're not going to have very much mechanical stretch at all really secures and holds the foot still breathable still very drainable um so yeah overall a package that we're super excited about and and it seems that it's pretty similar in terms like if you just looked at this on paper compared to the Ula Mesa uh which has been so popular like what is something that what consumer would look toward this as opposed to the ultim itself if you want to if you want that enhanced stability that VCA provides you still have that that full length TPU plate it's forked and we're doing some carve outs with it to get your foot a little closer to the foam certain areas but that vective system really provides that enhanced stability again for the demands of trail running um yeah and uh uh you're coming in uh at a 32 mil stack height in the heel so 2 mm more than the prior version we're really aligning that to the stack height of the the pro one and the pro two yeah so really having this tiered system of not only performance but also you're filling a lot of holes of Stack as well exactly and uh next which one do you want talk about next let's talk about the sky next CU then that brings you into the infinite as well so uh we talked about the pro that would be that high stack ultra distance long distance maximum cushion maximum propulsion Trail shoe the counterpart of that is the athletes are still saying hey I still need that lighter weight shoe I'm on technical terrain uh I need that that agile closer to the ground um shoe even if it's not my ultra distance ra Sho you know per se um so that position for us is the summit VC of sky this is now the summit effective Sky 2 and the athlete need here was I just need the shoe to be lighter and more traction um and I was like all right we we uh there's a way to do that exactly we have we have the goal uh we cut uh over 34 G out of this shoe compared to the first version exactly yeah so now we come in at uh 238 G um light uh it has a ful length nitrogen TPU dream midsole um so enhanced underfoot experience even though we cut so much weight out of it we also increased lug depth to 5 mm and you have much more rubber coverage in the areas that you need ITT um so again wanting this shoe to really excel in technical train uphill train or you know areas where you're going to be much more in a a vertical application of this style is this the same surface control rubber that we would have seen in the past correct yep exactly yeah and we're continuing to to to work on um some more innovation in that space that we'll be talking about uh in future season right not yeah but uh yeah overall here is really improved traction lighter weight and an enhanced underfoot experience a new dual warp upper again really breathable really drainable similar we have going on uh in the uras but in an even lighter weight application awesome awesome so with that it then brings us into the infinite and how we want to have that that race day shoe um but really still bring in that consumer relevant shoe with the infinite 3 right so we actually able to lower the price on this to 160 wow so the infinite and the endurus are both coming in at 160 now um the main difference is a 3 mm difference in stack height between the endurus and the infinite um but also this has a 5mm lug out soole ripping off of the design of what's going on with the sky even those Silhouettes I know there's more foam here but the Silhouettes these are likely to be a pair if you're enjoying one of those and the other two are likely to be say hey like I'm a a runner who gravitates towards higher stack shoes or hey I'm a runner who gravitates more towards low to mid stack shoes and we have two different kind of sublines within vective that are really going to appeal to those different consumer which is unique within the market for sure I I mean maybe you're not comfortable saying this but this might be the true dream team right this is this is the Dream Team I love your pun absolutely um so seem like it there's something for everybody but yeah keep absolutely yeah um ful length uh uh injected TPU plate where you have that carbon fiber on the sky little softer and a little more stability focused on the infinite um and again a complete upper overhaul too really wanted to improve uh some of the fit especially on the infinite when we talk about the infinite 2 versus the infinite 3 so again yeah enhancing the underfoot experience on all of these shoes it's really exciting I mean and I've been in most of these shoes and the goal every year is to innovate and enhance The Experience like you said and I'm already feeling like these are truly doing that like you guys are the team to beat right now in terms of like best lineup for next year and something for everybody I think that's what North Face's goal is there's something for everybody every terrain yeah and here we have that Ultima line for kind of everyday training and an even broader Runner that off Trail line for the most kind of rugged applications and then the vective line is really more of that that race point of view but how we continue to expand that again based off of the athlete need of building a true quiver of Footwear uh for what they need yeah awesome thank you Brett all right thank you",

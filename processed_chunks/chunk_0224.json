  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Drew from Merill and Corey Merill athlete and uh we're going to go over two new shoes that are um a little bit different than the normal Merl that we've come to know the more the more technical Savvy the lower to the ground connected to the trail and you have two new offerings uh this next year that kind of bridge a gap that you haven't had yeah absolutely absolutely um Jump Right In yeah let's Jump Right In cool uh so first off we have our MTL adapt so this is part of our Merill test lab line uh the long Sky 2 Matrix and Skyfire 2 Matrix are existing models in that line which are much uh lower stack kind of yeah we have them back here oh yeah low low stack um kind of grip it and rip it type of category for sure um but yeah keep going as we looked at uh use case and our our roster of athletes there was a need for a higher stack longer distance shoe but we still wanted to deliver on the uh Trail connection throughout the rest of our line so we came up with the MTL adapt which utilizes our full length Flex connect so there's internal geometry that allows the shoe to move with the foot but because there's so much foam here we wanted to take that geometry and extend it around the sidewall and into the out soole so you see this decoupled rubber with these Flex Groves allows this big platform to really adapt to the terrain do you kind of think of it as like kind of like a podular midsole in some ways like acting yeah yeah pieces of foam think of like a a slinky that each part kind of moves independently yeah okay Cory I can't help it to notice that you have a pair that looks to have like a ton of miles on it I do so this is my personal pair uh has over 800 mes on it right now and as you can see I mean the lugs I mean they've been worn down a bit but other than that the shoe is still in great shape the Matrix upper is holding up super well and honestly it's been comfortable the whole time and in what kind of terrain are you as an athlete an elite level athlete what kind of train are you choosing to use this on is it your does it become your daily trainer does it just become your long racer what is it I mean you know this is great because it do a lot of different things it can be something that you're going to race say 100K or 100 miles or even a multi-day event in just one pair or it could be something that you can use on a recovery run a long run just like your easier days um anything from dirt road snow covered Road even like semi-technical terrain it performs very well yeah and it seems like this is VRA Mega grip yeah yep Mega grip 4 mm 4 mm okay 4 mm lugs I mean for 800 Mi this looks incredible yeah I mean it's it's still in great shape and honestly it's like I'm still using it just on some of my easier days now yeah and I mean we talk about sustainable Merill has had that sustainable conversation too of like and that's sustainable if you can actually get 800 mil out of a pair as an elite Runner like that's that's something to make note of 100% yeah anything else about the adapt Matrix that you want to like do you have overall stack uh so overall stack is 4135 so six mil drop yep um everything in the marrow lineup is six mil is that right uh the long sky is 4 mil okay yep yep um midsole is dual density so you have a softer inner layer uh encapsulated by a slightly harder outer layer okay and that allows The Rocker to really uh maintain its form throughout the gate uh and then ultimately because it's such a high stack platform uh we wanted to hold the foot down so the Matrix upper and the fit panel really locks you down to the platform a so you can experience it awesome and then is this a fully gusted tongue semi uh it has the wings that come down awesome okay thank you and then um what what is price point and when can we see this uh 170 and this will be first half 25 all right so really fair price too for a lot whole lot of foam yeah totally okay what else do we have here uh so this is the pror um this is a road to Trail offering uh it has the same float Pro Plus midsole compound as the adapt so dual density softer inside with a slightly harder outside it has the internal Flex connect geometry which you can see referenced or or mirrored on the out soole this is the big story though um we're taking Vibram into a crossover space between Road and trail with their excess Trek Evo compound okay great and we've seen this kind of compound on just really a couple other hiking shoes couple other trail shoes in the industry not many have utilized this excess so that's awesome yeah yeah lots of little biting edges so um especially in like wet pavement this this really shines is this something that you've been in yet yeah so I've actually tested a pair of those as well and you know it's a great shoe um with everything that we have we have you know the rip it and grip it the fast Trail shoe we have the longer stuff this kind of fills that void of like going from one to the other um you know I do a lot of road like dirt road work in it and do a lot of just longer runs in it as well okay and uh is there any while you're running what kind of sensation do you get with this you said you could go faster and it has the geometry you know it has a little bit of a rock to it so with that it's like you you do feel like you're on your toes a bit more but it's just it's a faster feeling shoe but yet still cushioned yeah and you and I were talking about just a little bit the gravel category is a pretty new one in our space it again it fills a small hole in the road to Trail and it's not necessarily just road to Trail but it can work in that application um what do you envision this being if if someone's going to grab this as their soul shoe who is that who is that person what are they doing most it's the Enthusiast who loves running as a sport um and isn't necessarily siloed to one distance one environment uh you can run in the road you can run on trail it's all about democratizing the sport so for with one buying occasion you can do your local half marathon on the trail you can do your 5K on the road like it it spans um a lot and honestly is a great daily trainer okay and I can't remember if you said stack or not What's the total stack on this uh so this one is have to check my numbers this one is 3226 okay so moderate and Y yep just kind of a good for anything kind of shoe right yeah okay and price point on this that's 150 okay awesome and this one's coming out same season or is this fall mid year okay awesome okay thank you guys for giving us the rundown looking out be looking out for Merill [Music]",

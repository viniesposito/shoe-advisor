the leaders and it's just good to see like what's the pace all really all the top 10 that we saw looked strong they were looking happy and you know talking to us and we were cheering them on so that was that was perfect that's what I wanted to see I'm not going to see the finish I got to get back to Denver but congrats to uh all the racers Joseph and I today uh I definitely did not get the fkt cuz Joseph beat me Joseph crushed it and that's what's so fun about doing fktsgi sometimes we feel the same and today he right from the gun I could tell like he was feeling strong I felt pretty good in the warm-up but my legs definitely didn't quite have the pop you know that just a little bit I guess they're a little tired and that's okay and so he just kept putting ground on me putting ground

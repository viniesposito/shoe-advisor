  "text": "you've gone through months and months of training done countless miles and now the big day is finally here you'll no doubt be nervous and a little bit stressed about the day ahead especially if you're running your first marathon and not knowing what to expect well today we've got a full race day stepbystep guide to get you from the start to the finish with full time stamps throughout the video to help ease your nerves and get you pumped up for the great Marathon that we know you're going to have so with 2 to 3 hours to go we're going to wake up get out of bed the first thing I like to do is check the weather for ask is it going to be as expected is it all good do we need to make any last minute changes it's likely that you won't have slept that great but don't worry about this it's happened to me so many times and so many other thousands of Runners around the world it really doesn't make too much difference just get up and get your breakfast down you that's the most important thing we should be doing in the morning for me I love to have a bagel or two Bagels peanut butter and jam now you might not be feeling like eating too much at this time of day most likely due to some nerves and you might be just a little bit earlier than you'd normally be hydration here is also equally really important for me I'm trying to have about 1 and 1/2 to 2 L before the race this is usually for me about 2/3 of my volume out having in a sporty carbohydrate drink something like a Morton 320 or a Precision hydration carb mix and then for the other third in a separate bottle I'll have some electrolyte fluids in there as well I'll be sipping on these drinks throughout the whole morning all the way up to the start line and then while I'm sipping on my drinks I'm getting all of my race day kit ready as well I I've laid it out all nicely the night before and then's double checking I've got everything have I got my number have I got my pins to put my race number on have I got my timing chip as well my Watch My Shoes my cap my singlet and my socks then there might be some other little bits and pieces that you going to need as well that you can take off your checklist things like headphones if you're going to be using those your gels how you carrying everything your pack or your waistband plasters body Glide your mobile phone just get all of this into your drop off bag that you're going to be taking to the store D line and also at this time of day you want to be thinking post race as well maybe a little snack for when you finish the race you can get something down quite quickly for me I like to put a recovery shake mix in there some powder that's ready to go also some flip-flops because my feet will probably swollen up a little bit during the race flip-flops are usually the most comfortable thing and then really the most important thing postr is some warm clothes your body is going to be pretty trashed after the marathon and keeping warm is just a little bit harder marathons tend to not be at the warmest time of year as well so nice big Puff jacket to put on after the race moving on about about 1 to 2 hours to go we're probably in a car we're on a train we're on a subway heading to the race village where the start of the marathon will be this really is now the time to focus on what is coming up think back over all the training that you've been doing reiterate your why what has got you to this moment why are you doing this we've all got our own personal reasons go through your a b and c goals as well be so proud of yourself you've made the start line that is a massive achievement to do two in long distance running now 1 hour to go we'll hopefully arrived at the race Village I personally like to get there a little bit earlier than that what I really like to do first is one find the toilets go to the loot and then find where I'm going to be dropping my bag off because that's a real stressor for me there'll be big bag drop places I just like to pinpoint where those two things are that's all I'm focused on for the next hour or so pre-ra make sure you've bought your own L roll as well join the back of the L queue or the Porta poty L as soon as you get there and come out the L and then maybe go straight to the back of the queue again because by the time you get to the front of it you're going to need to go a lot of pre-ra nerves a lot of people are going to be needing to go to the L more frequently than you might regularly be doing because you're going to be naturally quite nervous about what is coming up now is a good time to get the gels out of your bag get your pack on or your belt on get everything in there that you're going to be taking through the race for me I need to get my camera and my GoPro out and put that in my waistband as well then now it's time to go and check that bag in and make sure you've taken a nice warm item with you the sweater something you're going to discard on the start line just to keep you nice and warm most races will then donate these clothes so don't feel too guilty about chucking something away right the nerves are going to be rising about 30 minutes to go before they off for me carrying on sipping on my sports drink getting a banana down is something I really like to do just helps settle my stomach a little bit as well and also person in some Road Racers like to take a little em modium tablet again just to help s my stomach I do not want to be going to the L during the race that's not what I'd recommend everybody to do but it's just something that works for me and I've always done it it's also now time to start to think about having a little jog around and getting ourselves nice and warmed up dynamic stretches and going for a little jog this is a really good time to do this when we're our Corrals or our starting pens we're not going to be able to do that it's going be very busy in there for me it's usually about about 5 to 10 minutes of very slow jogging just getting everything moving and nicely warmed up and then lots of dynamic stretches my leg swings opening and closing the gate and also a good time to check while we're doing our warming up how are our shoes feeling are they too tight are they too loose hopefully they're just right but now is the time to readjust our lacing and making sure we've got a really good solid lockdown we don't want to be having uncomfortable slipping shoes just as the race starts the more important the race for me the more times I double knot or triple knot or quadruple knot my laces Valencia ran I think I did five different knots with my laces they were never coming undone so make sure your shoes feel nice and secure it's time to head to the start line and get yourself in that start line pen then around about 8 to 5 minutes to go I like to get my GPS watch locked on nice and early with the amount of people around looking for GPS you want to get that locked on nice and early I think the garments don't time out for about 10 minutes so got about 8 minutes to go I like to get that nicely locked on ready to go time to ditch that warm layer maybe have a chat to a few other people around you just keep your nerves in check and then before you know it's the race start thousands of people crossing the start line including you offer an amazing adventure for maybe the next two if you get dry three four five 6 7 hours whatever it's going to be wishing you the very best of luck now these are my top tips for what you should be doing during the race the first one as we start know your Paces be patient ignore what everyone else around you is doing everyone's going to have their own goals so many people go off far too fast at the start of the race and don't get sucking into their Pace or suddenly thinking you can go 30 minutes faster than you've actually prepared for if you do suddenly decide to go off way quicker those last 6 miles are going to be really really horrible around about 30 minutes into the race you should be nicely settled in and feeling quite relaxed hopefully the rad have got a little bit quieter because it can be pretty chaotic at the start of marathon races this is really when you're going to start to think about having your first gel we recommend taking something around about every 30 to 40 minutes during the marathon but whatever you've done in training whatever gels you've been using in your training for me it's normally a Morton gel or Precision hydration gel but only use what you've been practicing with in your training things are probably going to be hopefully feeling very comfortable at the stage as still don't be tempted to go any faster you really should be running it at your goal Pace or slightly slower than your goal Pace at this point don't get stressed out about it too much it's all part of the plan now in terms of water stations my goal is always little and often don't go try and gulping or glugging massive loads of water at each station that's going to slow you down it's going to really feel quite uncomfortable as well so to just sip little and often now one of the most important sections of the marathon is halfway to 20 mi keep ticking off those splits I like to focus on simply the particular K or the particular mile that I'm running in I just focus on that on my watch lap pace for the particular K or particular Mark and I'm now I'm starting to think about picking up the pace a little bit gradually as well and making back some of that deficit from the first half the race gels might have become a little bit harder to get down now but you really got to work on getting those down and no doubt by this stage of the race you'll have probably started to run in a little group of people around you maybe you're in a pacing group as well which we'd always really recommend just look around you take it all in what you're doing is absolutely amazing running a marathon and just give yourself a little mental pat on the back and just say you can do this push on and keep ticking off those smiles and now we've approached the hardest part what all of this is about what makes the marathon so amazingly special the final six miles but why it makes it special because it's so difficult but don't worry you done the training set won't be too bad some people say this is the real halfway point of the race and it really is in terms of effort the first 20 miles and the last six miles effort wise they're probably going to be around about the same think of your Mantra think of your why focus on the runners that are up ahead of you and if you paced your Marathon quite well you're going to start to pick those people off just keep trying to push the pace as much as you can and it really does feel very good when you start overtaking people towards the back end of a marathan one of the nicest feelings in the world but yeah sorry to those people they should have watched more of my videos and Pac it a little bit better some Runners like to think of their loved ones at this stage as well and dedicate one of the last six Mars to each one of those people just focusing on them in your mind and it really will just help to Spur you on but essentially you're trying to hold it together you can do this you've trained for it and you can get it done whatever you've got left in the tank now is the time to empty it take in the atmosphere and the crowds maybe it's time for a few high fives to pump yourself up and get that Marathon done and then before you know it you'll be crossing the finish line hands in the air you are now a marathon finisher or multile Marathon finisher get your medal get a bottle of water whatever else they're giving out to rehydrate start getting that recovery process done as soon as possible but really take a moment to recognize what you've just done what you've achiev you are amazing and now you're going to have an amazing story to tell all of those loved ones around you for the rest of your life about this incredible achievement you've just done then it's time to go and collect your bag put on those warm clothes meet your friends and family potentially go out for some food whatever you fancy it really doesn't matter and then finally take some photos remember this moment get your medal photos you may not feel like being up there smiling straight away but future you will really appreciate then of course finally get that run up on stra and show everybody how amazing you've been then in terms of the rest of the day and maybe the days after it's really important just to keep mobile keep walking around keep hydrating through the afternoon and the evening then yeah obviously you're going to travel back home to a hotel wherever you're staying get a good shower just chill and relax in the sofa you might not be feeling that hungry a lot of people don't it's amazing how much you think of having a massive pizza or bowl of pasta when you finish the race and then you actually finish it you lose all your appetite I'm not sure what that's all about but it's happened to me many times but probably by dinner you're going to have a pretty raging appetite and then get yourself some good sleep again it's really odd after a marathon for me I really don't sleep very well your body's just going through a massive recovery process You' probably got a bit of an elevated heart rate a little bit warm and things like that so you might not sleep very good straight after the race but don't worry your body will get back to normal pretty soon so yes you've been amazing but what could make you even more amazing uh is to have a much better stronger mental game which is so important with Marathon running so that video is coming up next all the mental tips and tricks to help you exceed it your marath that's just up here keep it working hard guys keep down we'll see you very soon in the next one",

  "text": "whether you want a bit of extra plushness for your recovery run or you want a bit more cushion for a long time on feet there are situations where the most important thing about a running shoe is how comfortable it is for those days I reach for my Max cushion shoes and these are my favorites of 2024 [Music] yo what's going on my name is kzi and I'm a non- elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys about my top five favorite Max cushion shoes of 2024 but but before I give you my thoughts on these shoes I do want to go over to some disclosures the fifth shoe on this list is a shoe that I purchased with my own money the rest of the shoes were sent to me by the manufacturers for the purpose of review however regardless of how a shoe gets on this list no one's paying me to make this video or to put their shoe on this list and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the best Max cushion shoes of 2024 and in the number five spot I'm putting in a shoe that there might be other shoes that I actually prefer running when it comes to Max cushion shoes but I'm going to put it in this five SWOT because of what it represents and that shoe is from New Balance it's the Fresh Foam X more version 5 this shoe gets the number five spot for me this year because it represents the best of what's available in what I would consider traditional Max cushion this is a very tall stack height shoe that is a bit on the kind of firm side it's not as soft and cushioned as it might appear but that all comes in handy because it's still giving you a good amount of stability there's a really nice wide footprint on it there's plenty of shoe for your foot to land on and that wide footprint prevents the shoe from kind of caving in one way or the other and so it kind of provides a little bit of stability to go with all that foam that's underfoot to provide a nice comfortable experience for a long period on feet the updates to the more for the version 5 this year I think make it much more comfortable as a run walk shoe or a shoe that you're just going to be in for several hours if you're going to be on your feet all day or running a longdistance PR and even though this shoe isn't my favorite style of Max cushion shoes in 2024 I think it deserves a spot on list cuz it is the best of what 2024 had to offer in terms terms of this classic Max cushioning now in the number four spot we're going to start to see some more modern adaptations some more updated takes on what Max cushion is and in the fourth spot for me is a shoe from a brand that hasn't really made it into a lot of my top five lists previously but it's making it this year with the infinite Elite this shoe is from Under Armour and it uses a foam that Under Armour isn't telling us exactly what's in here but it's a beaded foam that reminds me a lot of either either older boost kind of like remember the Pure Boost or Pure Boost HD days or a little bit more recently than that it kind of reminds me of the foam that was in the Triumph 20 or 21 it kind of has that power run plus feel not power R PB which is a pea based uh beaded foam which is more racing caliber but the power and plus which kind of had a little bit more of a pace versatility at the expense of that top end speed and I think that's kind of a lot of what we're getting with the Under Armour infinite Elite that beaded foam that's in here gives a good amount of cushioning but a really nice amount of responsiveness too and there's a lot of comfortable plush padding in the upper which is kind of a signature of a lot of these Max cushion shoes is that they go over the top in terms of padding so there is a lot of heft to this shoe so it's not exactly something that I'd want to try and run very fast or very long in but for those times where I want to have a little bit of extra Comfort but still want to have a little bit pep in there kind of have a cake and get to eat it too I feel like the under arour infinite is a pretty solid Max cushion shoe and a very promising entry from under arour in the performance running market now let's move to the number three spot and this is a shoe that I think has basically come back from the grave it's a shoe that I thought was discontinued but now we're seeing it resurrected as the Glide ride Max now this is a shoe that was the first shoe in the A6 lineup to give us a pre review of what FF blast Max that's one of the layers of foam that's on this shoe and it does it in a pretty familiar upper it's very Nimbus likee in the upper here but the reason why I prefer the Glide ride Max to the Nimbus and why I think the Glide ride Max makes it into the number three spot of the best Max cushion shoes of the year is because of the Foams that are in here you're getting a really nice amount of Squish that just feels so good if you've had a hard session the day before but the shoe also roll really well so if you do have a little bit of a longer easy run that you want to be a little extra comfortable on I feel like the Glide ride Max is going to be an easy decision for me to pick up now moving into the two spot is a shoe from puma and this shoe is brand new for this year in 2024 and that is the mag Max this is a shoe that is using Nitro Foams in a way that I think is very unique and Innovative compared to what I would normally think about nitrogen injected Foams typically I find that Nitro Foams can be a little bit firm for daily training or recovery running purposes but the way they've tinkered with the formulas on these Foams has made this shoe very soft but also still very bouncy it is I think a bit on the heavy side and there is a very wide footprint for you to land on here and so I think the width of the shoe makes it a little bit harder to Wrangle for if you wanted to pick up the pace that combined with the weight makes it not really fit in that long run sub genre of the max cushion category but I think it makes for an excellent modern Max cushion shoe where you are getting a really great amount of comfort it's a pleasure to step into on a recovery run day but it's got so much bounce that the shoe is very eager to run for miles and miles and miles so you don't really feel that traditional penalty that you might normally associate with Max cushion shoes it's been a real pleasure to run in this one and it I think it rounds out what has been a fantastic year from top to bottom from Puma now for the number one spot is a shoe that I instantly fell in love with the Brooks Glycerin Max this shoe has a very tall stack height of Brooks DNA tune foam which again is another way that a brand has taken nitrogen injected Foams and tinkered with them in a way that you get some softness and also peppiness at the same time now the way that Brooks does it is with two different densities of foam and those two Foams work together really nicely to again give you a really great amount of comfort while also giving you a little bit of Pep now I think that in terms of the Comfort versus bounciness I think that the Puma magmax kind of Balan the two things really well so you get a good amount of cushion and a good amount of Pep I think with the glycerin Max you're really amping up the cushion and you're losing a little bit on the pep but this is the max cushion category after all and so I feel like in this category I don't really penalize shoes for being a little bit on the unnecessarily heavy side a little bit on the unnecessarily plush side because this is a shoe that I want to be really comfortable in and when it comes to comfort for me the max amount of comfort you can get in the max cushion category for 2024 is from the glycerin Max and because it's so different from the traditional glycerin I'm really excited that Brooks has found this kind of like permission structure to really experiment with Foams and deliver experiences that are different than what Brooks typically has to offer so I'm very excited about what the future holds for Brooks based on what the glycerin Max is doing and so that's why it takes the number one spot for me those are my favorite Max cushion shoes for 2024 let me know what you've been reaching for on recovery run days or for those long slow distance days put them in the comments down below or better yet stop by the live streams that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel

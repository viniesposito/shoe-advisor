  "text": "this is the Adidas Evo SL inspired by the record-breaking Ultra lightweight Flagship racing shoe the pro Evo 1 which cost an eye watering \u00a3450 they look pretty much identical they've both got the same foam in them the same stack height and the same drop as well except this one here cost an amazing 130 A320 saving it exists as a more affordable daily and racing option and there's been a lot of hype around this shoe I'm sure you've seen it that's probably why you're watching this video with Adidas launching this shoe via a ballot a few months back and now it's finally on General sale we're going to see what all the fuss is about but as always I bought this shoe 100% with my own money to give you that a completely unbiased unsponsored unfiltered review Thanks so much to everybody that subscribes to the channel likes the videos share the videos as well and check out my website Ben parks com we've got the most amazing running hats and Technical gear and five-star rated training plans to help you on your journey right let's get stuck in starting out with the facts and figures the purpose of the Adidas Evo SL this is a lightweight daily shoe for Speed work threshold sessions and racing I'd say up to a half marathon some people have definitely run a marathon issue I think with my legs I'd rather have something a little bit more plated in there to get a little bit more assistance but you probably could run a marathon it if you really wanted to price-wise this set me back \u00a330 it was \u20ac150 50 Australia and Canada we're not sure when it's coming out in those countries yet stack cut at the back 39 mm stack 32 mil stack at the front and a 7 mm of course drop overall weightwise this is incredibly lightweight just 267 G for me in my UK size 12 it is a neutral shoe and with the upper of the shoe we have this wov mesh it's incredibly lightweight a little bit fragile potentially we'll come on to that a little bit later on the midsole of this shoe that's where all the fuss is about we have a complete fulllength midsole here of Adidas's light strip Pro their most premium foam that you get in their 200 plus Super Shoes and that's what everybody is raving about at this price point of \u00a3 130 you just don't see things like that there is no plate in this shoe or any carbon rods or anything like that there is a very small plastic shank in the middle of the shoe which is just there to help that stability given the amount of foam in the shoe but as far as I'm concerned that's not doing anything to Aid your speed or Aid your performance or help you run faster it's purely there for that stability then outso wise we've got Adidas's Continental grip on the bottom of the shoe their sort of winter version here the rubber at the back of Che is a slightly different compound but yeah so far I've been running it in UK winter and it's pretty good it's definitely on the thin side it might not really lasting that long it's not as good as say the grip that you get on the Boston we'll chat on that a little bit later on but it's okay there are no different widths available added shoes are generally on the narrow side but these shoes actually very accommodating a lot more accommodating than you might expect from an adash shoe people with very narrow or very wide feet probably wouldn't give this a Miss but if you're in that nice middle ground you're going to be absolutely fine in the shoe there are different men's and women's version available it was true to size for me right let's have a chat all about these likes and see how good this shoe really is my first like with this shoe is just the sheer Simplicity that it offers it's simple it's fast it's lightweight and it's fun I mean what a great combination that is being so lightweight with this super foam that you've got here as well it's a very very fast shoe for that non plated or nonassisted type of ride it's a great daily option and a great training shoe for those people that don't want to be using plates or don't want using plates too much in their training the Mido here is just fantastic the light strip Pro foam is just one of the best out there without a doubt it's bouncy and it's responsive it's just like that puppy that always wants to go out and play it's always saying run faster run faster moving on I want to have a quick chat about the value that this shoe is offering to get that 100% Light Strike Pro which this is that that 100% peber it's not a watered down version of their super foam this is the proper full blend that you're going to get on those high-end performance shoes and this foam is also renowned for its durability as well it lasts a long time you're going to get a lot of Mars out of this shoe the out soole I find is working pretty well as well as I just mentioned it's certainly on the thin side it is such a lightweight shoe so they have had to cut down you can't put a thick out soole here that's going to have the most amazing winter grip because then it's just going to add to the weight so know the limitations of this shoe but it's definitely one of the lightest shoes I've ever run in and I think this package for \u00a3130 is absolutely fantastic moving on I want to have a chat about the extreme versatility of the shoe I'm not sure you'd want to run a marathon I know plenty of people have for me I'm going to pick up something with a big carbon plate in there if you want to you definitely could do but where I think this shoe really shines in those slightly shorter distances those 5Ks 10ks and half marathons I've taken this shoe up to 3 minutes a kpace as you can see on the screen now not for very long at the moment but just doing some faster one minute reps there and then jogs right down to 5 minutes 30 a and it feels really comfortable at both speeds the upper is really breathable as well maybe a little bit too breathable potentially you want to make sure you've got your winter socks on at this time of year in this shoe and then my fourth and final like is just that fantastic cushioning and the energy return and fantastic cushioning that that this light stripe Pro is offering this shoe is fast it looks fast it feels fast and it is fast as well with this big rocker that you have at the front of the shoe combined with this foam and that lightweight nature of it it's a shoe that it really is happiest at speed covering the ground really quite smoothly it's such a Smooth Operator this shoe and this is where this shoe really comes alive for me I know I just said it's really versatile you can jog in it you can run easy in it but it's really best once you start to pick up the pace those tempos those thresholds that's where this shoe really starts to shine I think most people would want to use this as that daily sort of training shoe for Speed sessions potentially some log run sessions in there when you want to be running pretty fast right let's whip through those dislikes starting out when I have a chat about the laces and the tongue the tongue is just a little bit on the short side if you want to do some heel lock lacing you can just about but it's really not going to work out very well and it also so does move around it would have been nice to just add a little bit of material to make that tongue a gusseted tongue it would have just held it in place so much better the it just moves around and it's simply Too Short the laces on this shoe again they try to make them as lightweight and skinny as possible they just feel really cheaply B they just like the kind of laces you get in like a 10B sort of shoe in Primark or something absolutely nothing special at all and then moving on to this whole like draw thing and this hype thing these micro limited releases all to increase that hype the big social media Buzz all that sort of playing on that fomo youve got to get in now or you're going to miss out and then people do miss out and the next drop comes in a little bit bigger and then that all sells out but is it worth that hype well it's a nice shoe I've really enjoyed running it but the hype is absolutely crazy and of course some people are going to feel a little bit disappointed I think a lot of people are going into this thinking this is the best shoe of all time it's a good shoot it's just a running shoot though and then finally my fourth dislike with the shoe it's just a little nitpicky sort of thing about the upper it really doesn't give the best lock down compared to some of the other offerings out there again know what you're getting into with this shoe it's a very lightweight type of shoe there's not a lot of material up here in the upper if you're going to be doing some sharp Corners you're going to be racing at Park run and things like that you might find your foot is just sort of rolling across to the side a little bit other options around like the SL2 or the Boston they're a lot more sort of durable a lot more chunky keep a little bit heavier little bit more to them your foot is definitely being held in place a lot better with those shoes so let's have a little chat about those shoes now so I think a lot of people are potentially in the market for this but they might be thinking should I save even more money and get the SL2 or spend a bit more money and get the Boston let's have a chat about those two now so the SL2 20 cheaper than this shoe again fantastic value really all three of these shoes offer a fantastic value it's 20 G heavier but again still pretty light weight weight has a small layer of the premium foam the foam you're seeing in this shoe here but it's sandwiched between two layers of far more Durable foam so again should be very hard wearing and Lasting a little bit longer you're not getting the Continental outs soole and you're also slightly lower stack height there as well as we've just discussed the lockdown on the SL2 just holds your foot in place a lot better but the evos is a lot more responsive far better energy return you're getting in the shoe and that much more aggressive rocker at the front of the shoe as well really a lot smoother ride to run in I'd view the SL2 is a great daily Workhorse to do everything in pretty well it's just going to last and it's going to put up with good weather bad weather you just abuse it and get a lot of good value out of it the Evo SL here a great value shoe if you want to go fast and feel fast but it's probably not the kind of shoe you're going to reaching for every single day out there you're going to want to partner it up with something like the SL2 potentially and then have a quick chat about the Boston \u00a310 more expensive quite a bit heavier than the shoe although again pretty good Weight Wise 318 G for me in my UK size 12 again you've got two different types of foam in that shoe the Light Strike Pro and the 2.0 EVA foam again just for some durability with that one plus now you're getting those energy rods in there as well for a much more assisted ride and a really very hardwearing very grippy Continental rubber outso with that shoe the Boston is going to be a little bit better at those long distances it's a lot more durable should be a lot lot longer lasting as well very dependable shoe overall right let's have a chat about my conclusions and my final thoughts does it live up to the hype well the hype was absolutely insane let's be honest I don't think anything could live up to that amount of hype but it's a good shoe no doubt about it it's a good solid shoe definitely a lot better than some of the stuff we've seen this year would I recommend it very much so but be aware of those limitations it's a lightweight shoe it's got a lot of stuff stripped out of it but you can have a lot of fun in here the phone will look after you really well and it will really bring a smile to your face when you start to pick up the speed but you'll probably going to want to ideally pair it with something a little bit more durable as a daily option alongside it and then just put this one when you just want to go out and have some fun your legs are feeling fresh or you've got a really good speed session or a long run session or whatever type of session to do but that's where I'll be using the shoe when I want to have some fun and run fast in it so if you want to check out my full Adidas

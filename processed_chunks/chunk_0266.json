  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers welcome to a wet and windy and stormy UK there's been severe weather warnings not for London but all around it's pretty miserable I'm about to head out and do my first run though in the ASX Jael n 27 which arrived just now got to keep testing wead to bring you the videos can't stop for the weather so let's get out there in the mix and see how we get on so let's give you a really quick look at what's new and some of the key details with the aex Joe nimas 27 starting with the stack and that's where the biggest change happens the asex Joe Nimbus 27 stack height now comes in at an increased 43.5 m in the hill 35.5 m in the 4 foot for an 8 mil drop which is the same but that's 2 mm more midsole foam across the foot using the same flight foam blast Eco plus foam but with a tweak recipe that allows for more cushion without adding weight speaking of weight the nimbers 27 weighs in at 10.8 o or 307 G in my UK men's 8 A2 that's marginally light than the Nimbus 26 despite that extra stack which asex says will add even more softness and plushness to the cushioning for those longer easier runs which is what this shoe is primarily designed for now the ners 27 moves to a jackard mesh Upper from the knit uppers that we saw in the 26 a little more structure here to these new uppers which feels a bit more premium as well and like they won't hold as much water as the knit did on the 26 now the heel package and the tongues stay the same and they've got the details like the heel pool here and a heel pool and that's sorry the pull on the tongue they're all still here us price also stays the same at $165 we don't have the UK price at the time recording this but we'll add that to the caption as soon as we have it we'll bring it into the review when we do but this is the new ASX Jo nus 27 so I've just done my first run in the asex Joel Nimbus 27 now the major difference here obviously is that extra 2 Ms of Mile foam this tuned slightly softer and more cushion that's across the B some of that mids salt across the whole foot you do notice it they are softer I've also done like a side by side mile I've got them both on at the moment with the Nimbus 26 and you do feel the extra softness into the 27 it does make a difference I mean it's not like the limbus 26 wasn't cushioned and plush and brought that kind of Road eating impact protection anyway but the 27 are going to offer more of that crucially you know as says they've managed to add this extra stack Without Really adding too much extra weight and the feel on the foot is the same in terms of the weight these are both big kind of sort hulking heavy shoes big plush padded heel collars you know maximum kind of comfort for long miles that is still here in the 27 but you will notice just a bit more cushioning a bit more Road eating there's a little bit more sort of cushion protection overall I do find in that first run I'm think there's a little bit more return as well bit more spring back maybe a little bit more bounce into the 27 whereas you're going to get a little bit kind of more stiffness in the 26 I think if you like the 26 I don't I think you're not going to like the 27 there may be a little bit less stability it's not a huge amount but with that higher stack you do feel higher off the ground than you would with the 26 that might be a a point of difference here that will make a difference for some people I don't particularly find that there was too much to choose and I've just done a happy mile but with one sh on each foot and it didn't really notice difference too much I took the 27 through their Paces from on tried to do a six mile progression run uh where I sort of up paced if one of the miles I did was just faster than my Marathon Pac sort of 630 you know it's kind of place there there's a bit of Bounce a bit of energy they can do that but you wouldn't want to do too many miles like that the mile after that I was struggling and when I got up running that fast I certainly felt a little bit more of a hot spot under foot from you know on under the kind of main sort ball of my foot so that was something for the high pce obviously they're not really designed for that but I like to test them just to see overall I think you're getting more of the same here with the 27 nice new uppers I think they do add a little bit if you there a little bit less Flex maybe in the knit they're not tight or More Hugging this still plenty of room plenty spacious toe box here these are built to give you space to run long in Comfort there's a bit more structure I think to the jackard than you get in the knit minor differences here but overall I wouldn't say one is more comfortable than the other I do like the more premium feel of the jaak card I think it looks nicer I think it's a bit more protective in the wet won't hold as much water perhaps as the knit which is another point of difference but overall com comfort and hold all of those kind of things I think you're going to get a very similar ride here the main change as I said is down to that mid Sole and if you were looking for a little bit more softness then the 27's going to deliver it if you already own a pair of 26 I wouldn't massively quickly run out and go and get a 27 I think this is going to be one of those shoes that you're going to want to upgrade basically when it's time if you want to go from 26 to 27 yeah I I don't know if you really like the way the 26 is now and you didn't want more softness then I'd stick with 26 if you were looking for a little bit more softness even more cushion and more stack then the 27 is going to be the way to go so first impressions on the Nimbus 27 from the first 10K that I've just done there in about an hour it's more of the same for me I think you're getting a shoe that's very very similar there there are changes here aesthetically the shoes look very similar you've got a little bit more stack obviously got those changed uppers the heel package and everything Remains the Same you got that same Comfort got the same tongues so the main difference here is in that little bit of cushioning on the ride I I personally don't think it changes how I would use these shoes I would use the 27 and the 26 for the same kind of runs which is basically my easiest slowest runs where I want to have the most cushion protection the most kind of Road impact eating where I'm going nice and slow and I just want guaranteed super plushness super Comfort I think that is going to be exactly the same here for the 27 so yeah if you're only 26 I wouldn't rush out and upgrade if you're looking for a really sort of super cushioned plush long easy or just easy r run shoe and I think the Jo ners 27 is very competent very capable feels good on the foot it's sort of a happy slow and easy mile shoe it's also probably a positive that they've stuck at the same price at least in the US we will reserve the verdict for and the comparisons to the other shoes until we've done the full review the other run testers will have it and then we'll give you a little bit more about how this Stacks up against other kind of super plush chrisan shoes but my first run in it I think business as usual for the Nimbus and if you like the Nimbus range then you're going to like this as well let give you a quick word on fit then and I think this is pretty much more of the same as the asex Joe nimus 27 you've got really ample room at the end of the toe box nice amount of clearance across the top of the toes there's plenty of flex these jackard uppers are a bit more structured than you got with the knit from the 26 but this is still a really roomy happy shoe to run long distance in Oodles of space basically lots of Flex for the toes comes back up I get good lock down across the midfoot no problem there we've got these tongues that they're sort of quite loose they're sort of knitted they just take the edge off but they aren't maybe as padded as some you do have to make sure you get them in the right place into the heel collar I think you've got exactly the same heel package as you got in the 26 and they hold well there's lots of plush padding which creates Good Foot security little bit of a heel counter here that's not too stiff but very present holds you nicely I had no slipping no problems with lock down and I would recommend going true to size in these shoes that has been my first run in the aex Joe nimbus 7 we'll do loads of more testing the other guys will try and get these shoes on their feet to bring you the full multi- tester verdict in the full review that will be coming soon if you want to know something about the shoe hit us up in the comments below tell us what you'd like us to work out find out we'll go and see if we can answer those questions uh otherwise go check out loads of other shoe content on the channel we've got some really good top picks that we've done a series

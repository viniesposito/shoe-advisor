  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run I'm here with Nick founder and CEO of norda um if you're not familiar with norda there's you guys have created some sort of cult following for sure with your your first shoe the 01 sure and then brought in that a little bit with the 02 more technical option um and now you're here with the 05 the race Day Option first of all can you tell us a little bit about when you started with the 01 all the way to how we got this shoe here sure thanks D um look we're norta we're a canadian-based trail running company uh we're only three years young we launched on the market in 2021 our first shoe was the 001 it was our uh ultra distance uh High stack shoe then we introduced the 002 that was in 2023 it was our lower stack shoe so you can get a more technical closer to the ground feel we introduced the 003 uh just last year that was our laceless shoe I for when you're not running we call it the approach shoe but you you could run in it I've done some trail miles I actually have I want to see if it's possible it's yeah it's just a shoe we wanted to make for ourselves when we weren't running so exactly it's a it's a good fun one and um naturally we would have to come out with the 004 but if you notice we skipped the 004 we're coming straight to the 005 one of the reasons was that the 005 was so fast it skipped ahead of the number for okay okay so yeah here we are we're here with our 005 uh race day shoe and I mean you guys are also known to have the most beautiful trail shoes too like this one's no exception but when you have it in hand we have it on foot like yeah it's it's a true race day shoe cool and can you take us through the specs tell us more about it thanks I was hoping you would see that I was always envisioning that believe in the Run would be saying uh norta could make the most beautiful Super Shoe so thank you for saying that all right let's literally go from the bottom so here we are um basically from the bottom up uh our shoe features three gamechanging uh Technologies the bottom is meain with meag grip elite elite it is a brand new compound from Vibram we all know how good meag grip is um well they decided to try to make it better it's basically the tackiest rubber that uh vibrand has ever created um yeah it's a little bit lighter and it's just super tacky it's like a Formula 1 race day compound yeah so and in your I mean durability is something that's needed in the trail world has has that been any sacrifice going lighter great question um it is a softer rubber uh there is a possibility um that it could be less durable uh the truth is over the course of the last year all of our athletes that have been testing it we just haven't seen yeah exactly any reduction now could you use it on road for sure as we did this morning as yeah asphalt could tear it up maybe a little bit more but we just haven't seen any reduction okay that's awesome cool and then yeah let's go move up to the midsole here cool yeah so the midsole is made of arnitel uh it's 100% pure TP uh formulation 100% what does that mean look the truth is most brands they all want their own specific feel and ride Etc and durability so they do blends um we don't really believe in doing Blends we just want to make the finest and uh we asked the factory if we can make a 100% blend uh they told us theyve never done that and we said okay let's try and uh we succeeded at uh doing that and the shoes just exceptional um it's tested and worn by our team and we know Jason schlarb and has worn it to multiple podiums this year even Rich Lockwood uh won Run Rabbit Run with issue and actually tomorrow morning with the same exact shoe he's lining up at um uh UT uh utct in Cape Town Cape Town yeah yeah with the same shoe so super cool okay that's awesome and and tpe is known for being like even softer to the touch like yeah you get some of that bounciness but it's also it's super soft under fooot we've been in it all day on this concrete and it's really impressive absolutely yeah the comfort and performance cool okay how about to the upper yeah so here we are with the upper um as you guys probably know norda makes almost all of their shoes actually all of our shoes with biobased dyema uh biobased dyema is the lightest strongest fiber on Earth um yeah it's very hard to make shoes with biobased dynemo it took us two years to to figure it out um and we finally track the code so this shoe uh is almost 100% woven biobased dyema um it's extremely strong it's a wider weave um than some of the prior shoes so the water drainage breathability is excellent and just show you one other thing as you see on the back of our shoes there are no seams there are no cuts um cuts and seams can be points of friction or they can be points of weakness so yeah and I mean if any part of the shoe breaks down it's probably going to be the out sole which we've seen on some pairs but that took like 1,000 miles yeah or more on some of these shoes you guys know you've tested you've run in nordes for the last couple years and um we have this philosophy which is uh show me uh don't tell me I'm not going to tell you our shoes should last 1,000 miles just go see just go see the community just go see all the YouTube videos people who are so surprised at how long the shoes last and and Taylor that's really important to us because there's so many great Technologies from all the different brands uh today we just believe that we need to make shoes last longer um and not throw them away so that that's our real contribution to sustainability and responsibility yep yeah and and that's unique in this industry if you can get a shoe that truly lasts longer and you're going to have a similar experience and that so far that's what we've been able to have with any of the N of shoes that we have yeah so exactly that's sustainability so yeah could you tell us when when we can expect this and what's the weight on it yeah absolutely so uh the weight is only 214 G in a uh men's us 9.5 okay um it's about 70 G uh less expensive uh sorry 70 G less uh than uh the current Super Shoes from other brands I mean the Energy Efficiency that you're saving over the course of the race is is really a game changer and the MSRP it's going to retail for 325 uh us and it will release in March 2025 so not too long away a 7 and2 O Race shoe yeah actually it's sub7 sub seven 6.8 okay yeah it's crazy yeah cuz that was 9.5 okay awesome I was giving to you in metric you know I'm can I'm Canadian it's not my fault yeah so yeah cool yeah can you tell stack height and drop on this too sure it's a 28.5 at the back and 21.5 at the front and it has a 7 mm uh drop awesome it is that including out soole and okay awesome so really moderate stack you could use this for Ultra you it's that comfortable and it's light enough and low profile enough to be able to go on those more technical fast race St too Taylor it was very important for us that through Science and Tech technology with the foam we could actually get you closer to the ground but give you that that power that connection you know for the last few years because of the technology of the Foams that we had it's been taking us further away from the ground to get that pop but this foam is so special we can actually give you higher return but get you closer to the ground it's extremely important because the sensations that come from your feet send direct signals you know to your brain so it's very important y okay well thank you so much Nick this been a pleasure and we're excited to get this to the trail and on people's feet thank you thank youis yeah are there any more surprises yeah surprises we've got lots of surprises n look today we just released um the first ever uh stealth black toolbox our norta duffel bag so that just released today um we have skipped the 004 as I mentioned earlier 005 was too fast and next is going to be be the 008 so what is the 008 going to be um I'll just give you a hint it might be something very very important to go with the 005 so what would be the first thing that you would put on after you finished your race now what goes with the race shoot i' have to do something with a little bit of recovery post race so there's a little hint 008 I'm tracking I think I'm tracking on that one yeah okay thank you Nick really that's",

  "text": "[Music] hey this is Thomas with believe in the run and this is Robbie with believe the run and we're here with I waited I paused you're you're better than us we're we're I mean it's the third time I mean we're pavlovian response dogs me and Thomas but she I mean it's the third time so she's had practice Yeah it's true think she knows what's going on we're here with the today's guest Megan Murray Megan Murray also married to Thomas newberger I never actually know what your last name is it's like my wife when we got married she like she had two middle names and she dropped one and I never I I don't even know what her name is wait she started out with two middle names yeah oh and then she like dropped one and picked up I don't know she added your name some I had to ask her every time she hat she's going to hate me cheers anyways I I'm making this somehow about myself which I apologize Megan welcome to the show thanks guys thanks for having me I'm excited to hear your life story I feel like I know it's bits and pieces but but not the whole thing so what are we are we starting from the beginning I we started with the beginning with everyone else I think we have to all right so weren't you born in a car uh no wasn't a snowstorm I was born in a snowstorm nice um which I think my parents love that story for whatever reason I love that story I was the second kid so I feel like the first one they were like you know panicked got to get ready for you know the first one to be born and then I kind of was they were like ah she'll be born when she's born and then middle of a snowstorm I decided it was time why did I have the thought that your dad delivered you in the back seat of that car during the snowstorm well so because there was a snowstorm they couldn't get the doctors to the hospital is my understanding so I don't think like the proper people were in the hospital nice so but did your dad I was not born in a car I was born in a hospital but did your dad deliver you or something uh maybe he had something to do with it yeah oh okay so the way here's the how I pictur it the comic book version the car is on the side of the road the hazards are blinking in the snowstorm here Dad has got the back door open he's you know over Robin with her screaming through uh you know know pain and Megan is born I do know it was so sudden that um they didn't have time to give my mom any drugs so I was born like like a little house in the prairie style yeah so I think it's probably pretty memorable so basically the security guard at the hospital and your dad were just delivering you that's amazing yeah yeah so that was the start um where were you born what Annapolis oh really yeah see that never knew that so I was born in Annapolis and we we had a home there and I lived there I want to say until I was like three or four I don't have many memories of the anisis is in Maryland for those of you who don't know yes capital capital capital city um so I lived there when I was very young and then we moved to Phoenix Maryland which is 45 minutes north of Baltimore city where we all are now that's kind of in the middle of nowhere right it is but I lived in a neighborhood where I didn't feel like like some of my friends lived like what I called like cowland like where their home would be on like 15 acres and they would probably call Horseland up there but yeah yeah Horseland cowland whatever you want to call it it beautiful but where I lived I felt like we were slightly closer to civilization okay like I could walk to the Blockbuster on a Friday night oh really do you know where the Four Corners is I I actually don't think I do okay so if you go up to the county it's it's she's basically on the edge of Oblivion so it's like you go up there there's this place called for Corners it's like Jacksonville uh what I like how they just name their cities after not all all other Jacksonville Phoenix yeah um so it's like San Francisco's up there so like if you need to go to the grocery store and stuff yeah I could walk right okay but after that you're like in like rural so all the rural people come to for Corners to do the shopping and okay so I feel like I had the best of both worlds cuz it was like we were kind of out and had some little land like our house was on an acre I think and then but I could walk to all the cool places that I wanted to I mean walking to a blockbuster that's almost a that's a privilege that most people would never get to that was experience like Pinnacle Friday night order Domino's Pizza walk to Blockbuster go get the new release movie if it wasn't there you'd go to the uh checkout and be like did anyone just return one recently nice you smell weird popcorn in there yeah I'm surprised you didn't get a job there so it I think it closed down by the time I was ready to get a job yeah as Blockbuster did man you could talk about that with the record stores is a experience that I mean Blockbuster was kind of a pain in the butt because it was a responsibility you had the tape you had to get it back but going there and picking out the movie that was fun why are we why are we so nostalgic for something that was such a frustrating experience most of the time because when it worked out it was so good yeah it when it it was kind of like now you surf TV to see what's on and you can go through thousand you're like there's nothing you used to go to Blockbuster thousands of movies and you'd be like there's nothing here MH vers the the fact of the matter is though I think what we're nostalgic about is you used to have to be around people it was an experience yeah the smell as soon as you open that door oh yeah it had that like almost like the movie theater carpet popcorn smell the beaded curtain what's going on back there that that thing I also grew up in a house that was like very health conscious I would say and so Friday nights we would get like maybe it was like $5 maybe it was $10 I don't even know we would get a little bit of money we were allowed to go rent a movie and get candy ni so that was like a big to do and have pizza so so you were born I don't even know what year were you you were born oh okay yeah so 88 so you did get the experience you were still in the transition period between 90s were pre- internet and post yeah I feel like I lived like the perfect scenario of when the internet was introduced to my life if it was any earlier I think it would have been catastrophic yeah um but it it came into my life I feel like at a time that was okay because I grew up are you allowed to say tomboy anymore is that a bad word no you can say that okay I don't know anymore but so that's how I was growing up like we spent all of our time outside I was crawling in sewers most of the time there was a pond in our neighborhood where we would go fishing all the time we'd catch salamanders and frogs dude how did I ever know never know this you're closer to my DNA than I ever thought yeah like we used to catch all the tadpoles and then bring them home and then watch them turn into frogs and then like play with them jumping around everywhere like loved that would catch snakes yeah like never never scared of any reptiles loved reptiles really um yeah like very very much not a girly girl did you ever trick uh like scare your parents or anything like that no and also you couldn't scare my father he was ex-military so none of that was happening and no my mom wasn't she wasn't scared of animals either in any way H so yeah it wasn't even a possibility and I grew up with an older brother so you know right right he's what it is and so your parent so your mom is from the United States right is jersey she's from Jersey okay that's in the United States yeah there's a debate whether it should or shouldn't be but the drones are flying over right now yeah yeah those are weird maybe they'll secede and that's everything will be all right no um yeah if the drones if the drones took out the toll roads in New Jersey that would be awesome maybe we could make that happen just the toll boo that's it are is it is that a big concern for you yeah dude if you D have you ever driv to New York the turnpike but you end up paying a mortgage just to get there no you take the train and skip it all yeah but if you drive if you have to drive there don't um and so anyway so you uh so and your dad's from England right yes he grew up outside of London um ended up coming over to the state to my parents you sound like you're from London okay so funny thing about that is obviously my dad had an accent and growing up none of my friends understood what he was saying and I never understood why he his accent was different than I've heard people with British accent also he was he he kind of mumbled and he was like older and so I feel like all my friends were like what is he saying but I I never understood that he had an accent growing up that's like not until later in life where I was like oh yeah he does sound different I guess it makes sense if you grew up there then if you grew up in the house then it's just how it sounds yeah and so I will tell you this uh when I met Ian he was probably 7s 60s 7s late 6070s 70s okay and it took me a while to to understand what he was saying I I would translate for most people I me he he was very good at yelling sometimes and those words you understood quite well yeah you could pick those up pretty quick and he would call me the the p p word all the time yeah if I didn't smoke a cigar with him or drink rotten Scotch I mean Fair really bad Scotch yeah no I don't yeah I would I don't know if I would do that either um yeah so they they met over here obviously they met actually on the west coast and lived there for a while and then ended up over on the east coast for business and I thought that everyone's parents owned businesses together and that's just how life worked like that's you would own a business together and then get married cuz that's how my parents worked so I just assumed that was what everyone did worked out for me um it's pretty funny that that's not at all how normal people function I love your perception of reality yeah that your dad didn't have an ACC people don't have accents just living in my own world and but your dad was also in the Royal Air Force is that what it's called no the s SAS okay um is is that part of the is thatal is that Under the Umbrella of the Air Force or is that you know how like the N seals are under the Navy I don't know anyways but that's like a special like a legit yeah in fact after I wrote my post about how he was part of that so many people reached out that they were like oh my gosh that's like an insane position to be in and live through and like I think he lived more lives than I'll ever know oh for sure but yeah and he would always be the Storyteller anytime we were at a party like people would be up until 3:00 a.m. just listening to my dad tell insane stories damn I missed out yeah ah um that's because he how long was he in the military for a really well I want to say I don't know 10 15 years would be my guess okay and then and then he left uh or retired I guess from and then okay and then so my parents were in the orthopedic field um my dad actually ended up designing hip and knee Replacements he actually had patents on several different versions of them um it's funny cuz I was telling Thomas we were randomly talking about jobs this morning and when I was in elementary school um like during some of the Summers when my brother and I weren't in camper doing anything we would go to my parents office and they had us work and one of the things we did is they used to make these wax molds of these hip and knee Replacements and the wax would like get outside of the mold and so you'd have to take an X-Acto Knife and like Smooth it all out and so we spent like hours in this Warehouse doing that while we were younger and I remember thinking it was like so like monotonous and boring but we were with these men who were working back in this Factory that were so fun and funny and just wonderful to be around and so like it was just a fun experience that's cool and that was in Maryland yeah they they had a um office building in Hunt Valley whoa so were you basically creating for us like you were you were molding people's knees no so it was a it was like a a mold we were just we were just taking the scrap like the excess wax still that was like going in someone's leg right well so you'd have to put the material in the mold create the oh I feel you okay I got you I got you and also like we would hand it over to someone else who would like also inspect and before it went to another person who so yeah we were not they're like this one has uh someone's initials in the year written in I'm picturing like Tommy Boy when he like tries the the buffer for the filter and it shoots up flies on the window yeah and I'm also thinking like you know how the boys have helped like come and done like some grit packing before they did it like for maybe 10 minutes and they helped out I'm wondering how much actual work like no we would stay for if not a half day like a full day sometimes um that's a good work ethic right there but I remember there was a cafeteria in this office building that that was like the Highlight we were allowed to go get something out of the vending machine at lunchtime so like a candy bar or something and that was like epic what was it about cafeterias when you're a kid like in any workplace it's like a magic if you go to a break room in like the worst break room in any office or you think it's like the coolest place in smells like bad coffee right but that I I remember doing that when I went to visit my mom would go to like a vending machine and the vending machine like being able to pick out anything in a vending machine was like yeah pretty exciting they also so my parents worked a lot and traveled a lot um but so and so every once in a while we'd have to go into their office on a weekend but and so they owned this building and the front half of it was like office building like offices and then the back half was a factory and but it you could obviously get through the whole thing and so they would let us bring our roller blades and there was also a um like a a conferencing system throughout or speaker system yeah and so we were allowed to rollerblade from the front office Parts all the way around to the factory and so my brother and I would like race each other and then we get on the loudspeaker and be like and so like that was super fun yeah in a potentially not fun environment when my parents had to go into an office on a weekend oh that's pretty cool I like that they were all good memories so they have did they work a lot doing that then yeah um yeah my parents worked a lot okay but somehow my mom still managed to like come to all of my sports games and like pick me up from school and yeah I honestly and your school wasn't close by well so um growing up I went to a little private school called St James Academy in monton Maryland okay and so their offices were only 10 minutes from there um so that that drive wasn't bad um when you switched it's when I went to high school that I had quite a trek okay yeah um and then so were your parents well what sports so what sports were you playing when you were younger then um I primarily played soccer so like all year long indoor outdoor um growing up and then when I went to middle school that's when I did lacrosse field hockey and soccer now funny thing is she went to the soccer camp and you got to tell this story um she went to a soccer camp that I ended up sending the boys to okay saying same soccer camp dude's still there really yeah he was probably how old was he when he went there I don't know like he just retired from the Blast Soccer yeah he was a professional who was retired and when my boys went this dude looked like you know is like the [ __ ] keeper no if the [ __ ] keeper had like a giant belly like you know he he he was on a diet of but I remember thinking he was super cool um yeah but tell him about the field trips that you would take um so we would this Camp was you would play soccer all day in these fields but then also like no shade by the way one day a week or maybe half of a day you would go somewhere to like a a lake or a quarry and go swimming or a pool or something like that and I'll never forget this one time he was driving us in like this weird van like this creepy van um and he had like rigged a TV in the center console yeah and was driv Ding and watching this like very violent movie did you say he was also cracked a beer or something he opened something um and I just remember being like what why is he watching TV while we're driving to this place and so D he was ahead of his time yeah and so we go to this this Quarry and we're all like swimming or whatever and we get back in the car and we head back home um where all of our parents are there to pick us up and he realized he left one of the kids at the Quarry and everyone was like freaking out and I was like Mom I don't think this guy's very responsible like and I think I was telling her about the TV and then we never went back oh man and he's so meanwhile I send the kids there so my youngest is is kind of finicky anyway and he there's no shade like they're just in this field in the middle of Maryland summer which you know is like at best 80\u00b0 and 100% humidity yeah and I would get them home and they would just be covered in like dust and dirt and just wet and sweaty uh and he was like I can't go back he's like what I'm like what'd you do today he goes I sat under a tree for like three hours yeah that's I mean yeah that's kind of how it was I guess I mean back then it was like if you didn't get secondhand smokes something they weren't a good coach yeah that was kind of the deal at least in baseball I felt like if if you didn't step in tobacco spit on your way to the Batters box then you were on the wrong you weren't getting coached well I'm like thinking of all my coaches as you're saying that and yeah checks out especially when I was younger I don't feel like there's like athletes back then were really focused on nutrition yeah like being anything outside of playing the sport that was when athletes were just naturally good at stuff like you'd have a dude who was you know 20 like who's a golfer that is is really John yeah John like the John Daly athlete was every athlete like they just played until they got fat and then they stopped playing yeah theying they didn't even have weight rooms in Major League clubhouses till like the late 80s like they didn't work out they just kind of showed up yeah awesome I wish that's how everything was um but yeah anyway so you so that was a kind of your you played soccer a lot yeah and then did you did you do travel soccer or or was it just like indoor like whatever season was did they even have that yeah they had that right they did I don't think I ever joined a travel soccer team I did do some travel across stuff for a little bit um but yeah I think especially having two kids in with like owning a company and yeah having two kids in sports I don't know how we would travel right so then did your parents have to travel for work and stuff yeah okay they traveled quite a bit in fact I had a really good relationship with my grandparents because um that's where we would go and stay like when they would go to Japan or okay wherever um for for a week or so my mom would always try to stay with us so that it was only my dad traveling but there was just several times where they both had to go and so um I was very much a mama's girl growing up so those trips would devastate me um but when you were growing up well I still am so how did you deal with how did you deal with that when that happened uh uh I cry a lot and then my grandmother would tell me not to cry in front of my mom because then my mom would get upset and then she would be upset leaving and it would be a whole thing so I used to try really hard not to cry until she would leave oh man that um yeah I mean eventually I just got used to it and especially as you get older it's like you realize that they're coming back and it's not the end of the world and right it's just hard to imagine that when you're younger and it's the first few trips yeah yeah but also it helped that I had amazing grandparents who were like they they lived in Annapolis and they had a pool in their backyard so it was like a Haven and their basement had a pool table and so so far Robbie whose childhood is the best childhood out of these uh these epod yeah that's awesome I'm I'm really glad I did I I had a really good childhood I feel pretty lucky that's awesome and that it's I mean it's great because your parents you know they they still worked a lot but they were there for you which you I mean that's it's how every kid should have it yeah yeah I mean I think they I mean that's where my work ethic came from for sure was just watching them and it's I had this like Mom who was so loving and then this dad who was like very high expectations and I feel like that combination was yeah pretty good did you ever when your if your when your dad was like that did you ever feel like it was like did you ever hate did you hate it but then later in life you're like I'm glad that happened yeah in the moment I was like you know you don't you never want to be yelled at or you never want to be like I don't know told you can't or can do something or you're not working hard enough or something like that like no one wants to hear that in the moment yeah but I feel like that's you like you need that you need someone that's disciplinary you need someone who's going to challenge you know otherwise you're going to just Coast I feel like that's like 99% of people these days or parents even and myself included in a way you know oh I feel like you want to be you want your kids to be it's like a weird you know I don't know I feel like there's a more of an emphasis now on not do you know what I mean yeah not not push not being too hard in a way 100% is Megan obviously doesn't like yelling yeah uh for you know from childhood and stuff like that but when I am a little bit of a yeller when it comes to the boys yeah and as they grow up I've mellowed but there's still like if if I raise my voice I still see like the Flinch of of [ __ ] yeah and like even when I'm even when I raise my voice you recoil yeah I don't like yelling at all in general I mean I'm I feel you I I there's definitely a balance though like I feel like we've gone too far the other way where it's like everything's okay and everything you can do whatever you want and it's wonderful where like I obviously back in the day when people were like hitting kids and like that's that was not right but there's definitely something in the Middle where like if I see the boys doing something dumb like flat out dumb like trying to get into the toaster with a knife kind of dumb I'm going to yell like my instinct is stop what you're doing and I might throw in an an exploitive yeah and they freeze but that's the whole point I think that when they were growing up if they started riding their bike into the street yeah same thing yeah you yell and they freeze and you get the result you want you they need to remember something like or else you're just going to end up having a kid pancak out in the street sorry that probably too much but yeah um but but for real like I was like you need to know that I this is a serious business but anyways but in the same way also yeah pushing your kids like you don't want to I I feel like it did swing too far where especially in the club soccer travel team this kind of business where parents are like throwing their making their kids try to be professional athletes of the that doesn't help either that's yeah that's a little bit too crazy too and I feel like that's more of like a parent trying to live out some dream that they didn't there were your parents like that with sports uh no although so my dad um coached me for indoor soccer for a few years no one know how to play there everyone's like I don't know what he's saying yeah he made he made him practice with a tennis ball so the way that um they picked they did he did uh the way they picked soccer teams um in indoor is you would go to like these tryy outs and they'd like Mark you as a one two or three like in terms of skills and they try to even it out and how much like it's sounds like a code but if you're a kid in the three Zone like do you you self identify as a three or you like they tell you too like you know they probably don't do that anymore but so they wouldn't let multiple ones be on the same team okay and my friend my best friend of the time um she and I would always be ones and so we got our dads to coach together okay so that we could be on the same team oh it's like The Parent Trap for the coaching trap I like it yeah yeah um it it only worked for one year this was Carrie okay um but anyway I know Carrie was athletic yeah she was very very talented um sorry Carrie for listening she's not she's not um but so my dad coached us this this one year and we ended up with like the most rag tag team in the world like girls who could like this one girl I don't know where she came from she could barely speak English like this one girl was just like had never hadit a soccerball in her life like it was the most insane group of girls you've ever seen in your life and I was like what are we going to do and so my dad was like we're going to start with tennis balls if you can kick a tennis ball you can kick a regular soccer ball you can dodge a wrench I'm telling you he took this team of girls that I was like were there's no chance of anything happening into we like won the tournament that's awesome it was insane but my point of that story was he was very into yelling from the sidelines he got kicked out of multiple games but it wasn't like as the coach you got did the girls who didn't know your dad before they started did did they warm up to him or were they afraid of them uh probably a little bit of both also you have to understand a detail she's leaving out this is becoming the story Ian but his his hands his hands were the biggest hands you've ever seen and I don't mean size lengthwise I mean like each finger yeah I recall I actually do remember this yeah you could put a regular like a 32 in waist belt around his fingers I think I recall shaking his hand and being like I don't want to be on the receiving end of anything military wise I just always picture him grabbing someone's skull and just crushing it yeah oh yeah there's some craniums lying around yeah anyways sorry um I don't know what we talking about indoor soccer he coached it anyway yeah he was but he like he would get very into the games and be like yelling at like a ref not not like us not like and not me like I never felt pressure from either of my parents to like oh you got to practice more you got to do more it was like that all came from within okay okay interesting somewhat like you're running yeah yeah uh but but here's here's how I picture it it Ian went really quickly to Hot Zone and I can imagine a ref not seeing oh yeah something that should have been seen 12-year-old kid reing the game yeah and yeah probably like a 16-year-old and I can't like Ian I like I never his vocabulary for um curse words was extensive and I can't imagine he would be able to hold himself back so I I would love to have some he he he really did a lot but there was a few times where it just went by the wayside that's amazing all right so that's cool so then you in high school you went to I went to Garrison Forest um which I went from a school where I academically I did really well um and I worked hard but it it just wasn't that hard for me to go into a high school that it was very academically challenging and so that was tough for me yeah okay um it was it was definitely an adjustment period and now I was driving 45 minutes to school so I would be leaving the house at 7:00 a.m. and then I would have practice after school so I would get home around 6:45 7 have dinner do homework for two hours go to bed and do it all over again what was so academically tough about garon cuz we've talked about in the past and you've said that mhm your high school experience was was tougher and was tough enough that when you went to college College seemed easy yeah um it was it was just a really great like school so there was I think 38 girls in my graduating class so my classes some of them were seven people wow so the attention you got from the teacher was extensive and then the curriculum we were learning you can't take a nap in those classes no and the curriculum we were learning was just it seemed very Advanced um from what I was used to and a lot of the girls they were on academic scholarships I was not um and so it just and I think especially at that age like I was very interested in going to parties and stuff and so I like having to juggle that just it was really hard um but it was it like I I've told you before it's it's the best education I got in all of my life so wow so why U why there not were closer my parents really wanted me to go there um none of the private schools in Baltimore were very close to my house um but this one was 10 minutes further out than most of them um okay but they it just it had a really good reputation and they wanted me to go there oh yeah I mean even if it's called Garrison Forest I think I feel like that's somewhere where maybe Robin Hood would have went through or something it sounds it sounds like a British of Sherwood Force yeah yeah it sounds like a fancy like I just feel like anything with the word forest in in a school name I'm like that has to be a good school like Hogwarts yeah yeah Hogwarts is yeah they need to work Hogwarts Forest would have been a little bit better well it had a forest near it Forbidden Forest yeah did have that so um that'd be good name for school for bidden Forest yeah I'd go there but um and then that was so during high school did you you said you played lacrosse and things like that yep I stayed playing soccer lacrosse field hockey um I was just I was in a sport for every part of the Year pretty much um just always staying active but yeah and your parents didn't uh like slide into a deep depression from having to watch field hockey games over and over again no and that was that one faded out early in high school and it's literally the worst game ever to watch yeah I that's fair I don't know women's lacrosse they need to just let them put pads on and hit each other cuz I I went to go watch one of those and basically whoever picked up the ball was going to run to the uh oh there's no hitting or whatever no they're not they're only allowed to check the stick so a girl will pick up the ball run towards the goal shoot the ball if she misses the other team gets in runs back it's basically is that different than men's lacr yeah Men's Wear padding and helmets and you and crack each other why is that though seems a little sexist if you ask me well I think it is that that's why I'm saying they should just let them play but so in men's you wear pads like I had shoulder pads and a helmet and a helmet and gloves to protect your hands right the women have gloves I believe and they make them wear eye goggles that that was only implemented in my like last year of Lacrosse so and then the contact isn't that hard like I think at this point make it full contact like the men but yeah equal rights so I have a question for you so when I'm met your brother I instantly fell in love with him like you remember the first night confessions yeah the first night that I met him we him and I hit it off really well we had a great time and to this day we're still most people that meet love him you have what I would consider a very tight relationship with your brother more so than I think the average person why do you think that you guys are so um connected like did CU I would think that some sort of almost a trauma would bring two siblings together this tight but you know why are you so tight with Ryan well for starters we're 15 months apart so age-wise really close um growing up I mean he was like he and I were always together so he was like always there like I said I was a tomboy so I feel like we could hang out and go play in the yard and do like run around kick the soccer ball and we had like similar interests so I think that helped um and yeah he was just kind of like a built-in best friend that's interesting that's but that's interesting because I feel like that's not a lot of times it's complete opposite where it's they're like get like they don't yeah I mean dude my sister is not that much younger than me she's like two years and D couldn't stand like I think we were too much alike too maybe but I just cannot I mean Ryan are similar we we convinced uh we to this later cuz when college but Ryan and I used to convince everyone we were twins when we go out at places just as a joke cuz we thought that was funny um jokes on you yeah but like I would play like7 like shooting games like when I like nice like I was I fit in with the boys and I think that was also probably it is like his friends became my friends my friends became his friends like we were in the same circles especially throughout high school did you ever date any of his friends I did is that was that weird it wasn't okay at the time um I ended up dating one of his friends um who was like my first like real boyfriend for a couple years um but he was like just the sweetest nicest guy in the world I think if I had dated maybe any of the other friends that he had it would have been a problem but I picked the really nice one so it was it was okay so the very first time I met Ryan we were out at we were working at social toaster and uh we went to a happy hour and Ryan came to drop off a car for Megan cuz her car was dying and so they got her a car that ended up being a nightmare I'm not allowed to buy cars because I buy lemons and that is the end of it this car they couldn't find the electrical promp so the battery would die oh that's the every every two days had a car like that before so Ryan comes up and he drops off the car but he comes to the happy hour when I meet him um I start you know we're we're having fun so little game I'm like we start daring each other to do different things okay the next girl that comes in here you've got to exchange clothing with her and come out like the next girl that walks into this bar you have to convince her to take off her clothes and put on your clothes and you have to put on her clothes okay I was like this is never going to happen uhhuh this girl walks in with her boyfriend what Ryan goes up to her convinces her and did he tell her this is a bet no this is just like okay I don't know that he didn't he didn't okay um but he 10 minutes later he comes out of the bathroom wearing her clothes she comes out wearing his clothes oh like the whole thing yeah I thought you meant just like a glove no Michael Jackson dropped outfits yeah oh no way dude that's unbelievable yeah Ryan's that kind of guy though yeah he's a yeah he's just like he's like lovable and outgoing and yeah like people just they just I don't know that's cool go towards him but he and I did get in quite a bit of trouble in high school I mean I've heard you talk about these parties that you used to have at your house and they seem pretty pretty epic I know I feel like really bad for my parents and I'm sorry Mom because I know you're probably listening to this um you can yeah air it all out just you don't have to say it anymore after this like like I said my parents were working so hard and they would be taking like important doctors out to dinner right and that's when Ryan and I would be like oh let's throw this rager right now while they're gone for two hours oh oh they weren't gone for the weekend no and like it's just none of it makes sense kids are dumb but to but to to our defense we would try to have a party that was like 10 to 15 friends coming over but the word still substantial the word would get out yeah and 300 people would show up how do how how in 1990 wait no 2004 um when I was in high school I graduated guess people had cell phones at that point yeah we did we had cell phones okay so that makes more sense Sidekicks were awesome yeah AOL Messenger was was lit yeah and uh the razors um yeah they so it would be like how's that possible it would be like it would just be like a Snowball Effect like it would be like oh can this person bring this person be like okay yeah sure and then literally every private schools class was at our house so were you Legends we for not good reasons yeah we we the Murray house was known as The Party House in in every County north of Baltimore at every private school in Baltimore I mean that's something I guess you built your brand yeah real early um and I have like yeah there's just a million stories I could even tell from all those but the last party we had the cops not only showed up but they brought dogs oh like to sniff out all the kids or whatever uh wait kids sniffing dogs is what you're describing trained by Joe Biden and I'll I'll never forget this that was the last party we had by the way but I'll never forget some of the stories that came out of there it was like a freezing cold night and the cops show up and no one wants to get in trouble so everyone just like scatters and runs out of the house and runs to the front or whatever but there's dogs chasing people way so some of my friends were climbing up trees and hanging up like just standing in these trees huddled like freezing cold for hours waiting for the dogs to go away like M like Mountain like uh raccoons stuck in the trees with hunting dogs just at the base and like no one had jackets on cuz everyone just like sprinted out of the house and like yeah what a disaster dude there might be kids just is still up there that you never even knew about I remember when we moved out of the house and we were cleaning out the basement and I was like oh my gosh and I cuz like for years we were just like shoving beer cans into trash cans and putting them under the stairs in the basement cuz no one would go there and I remember just seeing like hundreds of trash bags with beer cans in them still like in like underneath the stairs of the basement and I was like oh wow it's like Harry Potters uh he was an alcoholic that's crazy yeah so we definitely got into some trouble in high school which I feel really bad about for my parents so this is interesting to me because you can have so like when I was talking about I like my parents didn't it was like literally the complete opposite where there is nothing like I feel like my sister did have a couple parties then when later on but uh but you had like ragers everyone's drinking everyone's hanging out and then you turned out totally normal like no problems but then there's other kids who will gr just like it's interesting not all of our friends made it out that's true I guess it just doesn't you never know no but the thing is like when I when I think about the story she tells or Ryan tells I literally think of like a National Lampoon Style movie like these guys were just nuts accurate and the fact is that I I I I almost feel bad for her parents because they're having this meeting and they're getting called by the cops during a a dinner out with with clients can you imagine like right now if you were say that we up at New York doing work right and you get a call that Ry and and Jonas were throwing a rager at your house and the cops were there yeah no I be lose my mind so what but you sound it sound like your dad was kind of so how did they respond to it like were you did you get in trouble or yeah okay um like grounded in fact I'll never forget one I think it was probably the same party with the dogs came um my brother had just gotten a snowboard for Christmas I love this one and um so the cops called and they asked my parents specifically do you want us to legally reprimand your kids or do you want to handle it my parents are like we handle it like thank you to those cops for allowing that um but my dad came home and like he didn't even say words to us mhm like was just it's that disappointment which is worse than yelling right but he takes my brother's snowboard that he had just gotten and he walks down into the basement and you hear the electric saw go on and then he cuts a piece of plywood in half but it in up upstairs where it sounds like he just cut the snowboard in half and my brother just his like whole body just like like just W like was so devastated and so upset and my dad just walks back upstairs and goes to bed and doesn't even say a word and we found out later that it was just a piece of plywood the snowboard was fine how long I think he let like let him think that for like a week okay but like here's here's the interesting thing though because Ian was uh from Europe drinking and being a minor wasn't exactly the same right like he didn't view it the same way no like they would be completely comfortable with us having a glass of wine at dinner yeah when we were 17 18 I think there's something to that in a way well I do I my thought on that is you look at like these people go off to college and like Megan kind of had her college parties early so like right she's in high schol contined through college yeah but well I guess yeah my point isn't going to make sense because I was going to say you learned how to manage alcohol without being like crazy about it um yes which I was yeah wrong about CU I forg about your blackout day I think I continued the the partying in college for sure um but so and but in my case I didn't drink until I really didn't drink until till I was 21 I was like uh really like in that way I didn't do it at all you know cuz I was scared of getting trouble and just I mean my friends didn't really either so but then afterwards I I like yeah I had live those days in my 20s you know where I you were already normal had a normal life I think it also helped for me being in nework New York like I was telling you that I was drinking at clubs and bars in New York City from 16 at 16 years old so that when I went to college it wasn't like oh wow I can get like liquor so I wasn't like yeah out of control it wasn't a forbidden for you didn't go to the Forbidden Forest to get your yeah so so when you went you went to University of Charleston then College of Charleston or college yeah um and then what's the difference between a university and college uh a price tag is that what it is well College of Charleston's a public school okay yeah but I think University of Talon's public yes it was we need to we need to investigate that not right now I think you have to have certain certain uh curriculum to be University College so Megan you you were playing sports you were good at sports you a natural athlete both you and Ryan are a pretty decent athletes although I've beaten him at several Sports um including two triathlons and cornhole cornhole too or no uh I don't know I don't know I I know yeah I don't I don't know if we've gone down that we have to have a cornhole tournament but definitely miniature golf and uh stuff like that yeah so you were an athlete you get to Charleston so I'm guessing you signed up for all the sports no that's when I decided I would just focus on academics and not play any sports cuzz in my mind you either had to like be a professional or you didn't play sports I don't think I realized that there was like a club aspect in college like inter murals or whatever okay um so I didn't join any and I but that's weird cuz you hung out with one of the clubs down there quite a bit I mean like soccer or the sports that I was interested in I did think the rugby team yeah I know what you're referring to um so my brother went to college on the west coast for a year and really didn't like it at all and I went to college with Charleston and I was like this is the coolest this is the most amazing place in the whole world and so he ended up transferring to col of Charleston as well and we ended up being roommates um oh wow so yeah we're just we've lived together for you guys really were best friends yeah um there was a year where I was living with just me and I think three rugby guys um okay and the weird thing was you know how Ian scared people with his yelling mhm apparently Megan was the scary person in that house from the stories that I've heard like they were all afraid of Megan well well when I got to a point where I was like the partying is fun to an extent and then when it's like 3:00 a.m. and you have class the next day it's like it's not fun like it's different on the weekends but yeah but there so there was times where they would have like a rugby game on a Sunday and then be partying and I would have class the next day and so I would say in strong words yeah get your life together I have to get up at 6:00 a.m. um but no we yeah College was some of the most fun years ever and at that that was a period of time so you weren't playing organized sport no but you started using running as a way to just stay active yeah so my the roommate who I was paired up with um for my freshman year in the dorm was a runner like she ran and so I was like oh that's kind of cool um and she would always invite me on like these three mile runs and I was like absolutely not but I was like I'll go around the block so I started doing that every once in a while and then I think I got up to like a mile and that felt like an accomplishment so then I just got into a habit of doing like a mile every day or every other day and that was like my workout my like gym fitness stuff and I would feel good about myself for doing that right um but that was primarily all I did in terms of Athletics all through college so what was your major at uh College of Charleston I started out as a Comm major and then I switched to business with the concentration and marketing um I actually did the hard the hardest classes of communications public speaking which I think were probably some of the best courses I ever took because I was so nervous and so uncomfortable that I would spend like hours preparing and I remember my last speech I had to give I ended up doing it on um sharks because they said pick a topic that you're like really interested in and so it started out with like this giant great white shark behind me and like the teacher was like that was the best presentation from the entire class that's awesome and so then I had like a bunch of confidence but at the same time I was like this is also I don't know that what I'm going to do with this afterwards so I was like become a shark expert so and and the actually weirdly Finance was one of my favorite classes and so I was like I'm just going to go business but I also think marketing is important I didn't know what I wanted to do and I was like I feel like these are two skill sets that I can do anything with yeah so I that's that's what I ended up finishing with with a ba and okay so let's let's dive into running a little bit so when did like explain to cuz I know that even moving to Baltimore you ran when you got here yeah um not like what people would consider like what like running like you do now but I think I started running just maybe a little bit more after I graduated maybe like I was up to like 2 miles maybe I did like a three mile run at one point um and I really didn't want to leave Charleston but the when I graduated in 2010 there was like no businesses outside of hospitality in the city Boeing had just gotten there but outside of that there was there was no big corporations and so um I had gotten an internship during college um at the spa at Charleston Place which is basically like the Ritz it was amazing and they weren't allowed to pay us but she would give me um like free massages because she was allowed to do that anyway that's where I like fell in love with social media and that side of the marketing and I learned so much from this woman who worked there and I was like this is what I want to do like this is a Avenue of marketing where I feel like it's going to explode yeah and there was no there was no jobs like that in Charleston and what what year what year was that 2009 okay so yeah that was like right when like Twitter was starting to be believe in the r was starting to become thing I know of this website I feel like it's going to really do stuff um but and then was Instagram a thing yet or is that 2010 or Instagram was 2012 12 okay but so um I ended up the person who I was dating at the time wanted to move back to New Jersey where he lived and we compromised on like DC area um and so I started applying for a bunch of jobs up here in in DC Baltimore more and I remember I I flew to DC to interview I had like six interviews lined up okay and I stayed at Rob James who was like living there at the time his like little house and I think I borrowed his car and the traffic was so bad that I made two out of the six interviews man and I remember being devastated cuz I like planned all this stuff and and so I flew back presentation and I was like um DC is crazy I don't think I can do it um and then this opportunity came up at Social toaster that a friend of a friend sent to me okay and I flew up I think I stayed at oh was that car's Dad yeah okay all right um my best friend Carrie who I mentioned earlier who played soccer with her dad was working with this company social toaster so he did this introduction okay and I flew up to do an interview and I remember I was staying at the I think it's a hill that overlooked the orial stadium yeah mhm and I got up in the morning to go for a run on the treadmill and that's I was just like looking at orial Stadium while I was running in the morning and I was like this is cool like what a cool way to start my day and then I went into the interview and I loved the people and I was like man like I really hope this works out and I flew back home and like a week later they offered me the job and I was like okay this is I got to go um and that's how I ended up back here and I was running still like every morning I think just you know because I wanted to and then at Social toaster is when I met Thomas and he had convinced me to run the 10mile one of my favorite things and I think we skipped this though is Megan you know like here I was I was doing leaving the Run admin for at this point tell the Sho story yeah um so we we're working together and I see that she has like a website up on her looking at shoes and I'm like oh you you don't want to get those and and they were pair of under armoured trail shoes they looked great and I said uh no you you don't want to get those for running and she goes no these look red or whatever you said yeah he's like no no he's like that's not for the road that's for trail you don't want those and I was like what do you mean I was like it doesn't matter if there's extra rubber on the bottom I was like I'm going to get these they look great so I was like Megan no don't do it I remember they even had like they were kind of outlandish for you like like now that I look back and I'm like how did she ever I need to see if I can find a photo of them we do it they almost had like leopard spots on them or something I forget what it was but so she's she's GNA get I'm trying to talk her out of it I think I have talked her out but she did that thing where she let me think that I had done it so that I would go away and she got him and I remember her getting him I was like really disappointed she went for a run and this was one of my happiest moments she came back she's like they gave me blisters everywhere my feet are all messed up and I'm like yeah s them right back at this time she was doing like three mile run so this shoe chewed her up like within three miles and just destroyed her feet and then uh I I convinced her at that time to go get fit properly for uh running shoes MH and she came back with a pair that was like not greatl looking but they they put me in like the ghost or something or that's that's what's going to happen or the launch what I don't think it was a launch I think you the ghost you either got the ghost or the glycerin yeah might have been the glycerin and you weren't ecstatic about it but then you're like oh these actually work the Pure Flow remember those yeah that was I think the first time when I went to Charm City run it was like the Brooks Pure Flow I'm pretty sure they were just trying to get rid of inventory probably but those that actually was one of Brooks I they had some fun stuff come out of that project yeah because they had these guy it was like a dude from Apple came and helped them design okay those ones but anyways I also just realized I skipped over you know you said you had some crazy jobs um when I first graduated and I didn't want to leave Charleston but there was no jobs that I wanted um I so I was super Lucky in that my parents paid for my um School MH but as soon as it was over I was like okay I need to be financially independent like I just need to find a job where I can live here and pay for everything that I need and so I basically took the first job that I could get that would check that box which said it was a customer service position and I had worked at um a jewelry store throughout College it was kind of a customer service yeah um and this was another jewelry store customer service position they the way that they talked about it was like it would be a growing position you could you know get to the top top fast whatever right the top wasn't that high I should have the first red flag was I was getting paid under the table nice but so it ended up that it was a do you know what Pandora Jewelry is like the charms it was a knockoff basically company of Pandora fandora yeah yeah I forget what it's called do you know what's actually interesting about charms that I just found out in Charm City and why we're called Charm City it was a marketing campaign uhhuh where you for Pandora no you basically they get a charm bracelet and if you went to certain places in the city you could collect the little charm for the charm bracelet oh really and it and it was funded by the city and of course after a few months they decided to not do it right but the name stuck so it's not just because it's Charming no yeah I saw that's saw a whole thing sounds like a Baltimore thing anyway I know if you hear the whole story like that they cut funding for it and it just died out and they're like nobody will ever call a Charm City anyway so back to your shop yeah um so I take this job and they give me the address to go to the office for the first day and I realized it's This Woman's house and they put me in this room that is like how we have shoes lined up all up and down the Walls it's just beads and there's little numbers on all of them and I have to fulfill these orders and find the beads like and put them into packaging and send them off all day long like drawers with beads in them basically okay yeah and so like an order would come in it would be like A2 and then you'd go find a12 and then put that bead with this bead and then put the whole thing together into an order okay and then while I was doing that all day I was also the customer service person so people would call but the people that were calling were like 85-year-old women who were so angry that it wasn't real Pandora and then I had to be like no it's it's um like real silver and all this and like talk about the most insane conversations ever so then at the end of the day I'd take all these packages it's ironic now that we have grit I take all these packages haul them into my car drive to USPS up to the back and toss them all into this big barrel and then do it all over again the next day and was this um did they just like how did the old ladies find this stuff was it did they advertise they had a website okay um and then just post it on Craigslist or something yeah I think Facebook was like pretty big then like the social media marketing was happening um all right and so yeah I think people were just finding it organically like if you would I think maybe they had I mean this company is no longer in existence it went bankrupt like three years later but um I think they were probably doing like the paid um SEO where if you were searching for pendora show up so you know all these ladies are okay so they had some some skills maybe yeah and and then so that's where you basically got your customer service chops so yeah it's really funny if you looked at my resume cuz I was trying to find another job while I was at this job realizing this was not at all what I wanted and like if you looked at my resume it was like customer support for you know you make it look all and like I was packing beads all day but you're like you're like managing inventory for a fortune 1000 company yeah exactly um fulfillment fulfillment Services yeah yeah this this is the Amazon before Amazon all right I decided I decided to stop looking at like the customer support and maybe there was more like business because I couldn't find anything in marketing so I was like looking at like business opportunities like I don't even know what that means but this position at a um Construction Company okay came up and I just like applied and then they were like can you come in and I was like well I have to be at my job at 9:00 a.m.",

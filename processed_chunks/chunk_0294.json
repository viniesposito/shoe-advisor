  "text": "hi people welcome to the Run testers now we waited very patiently for the adios Pro 4 to arrive and now that it's finally here one of the big questions is whether it's better than the adios Pro 3 and if you like the Pro 3 will you still like the Pro 4 now the shoes might look similar but there are some important changes that switch up the ride so in this video we're going to whip you through what's changed how that affects the ride and whether the New Gen of Adidas's fast Marathon racer is an improvement on the old so let's get into it in our Adidas adios 4 versus Adidas adios Pro 3 head to head first up some quick details then and the adios Pro 4 remains among the lowest stack carbon races it packs 39 Ms in the hill and 33 Ms in the 4 foot for a six mil drop so according to the official figures that we had that's half a millimeter shaved off the 4f foot stack compared to the Pro 3 for a slightly lower drop though the designers at Addy have told me that the change in the quota stack depends a lot on how you round up those kind of or round down those half millimeters so in reality the difference here might be negligible and actually I think it comes in at the same stack height the adios Pro 4 comes in at 202 G or 7.1 o in my men's UK 8 and 1 half test shoe that's 14 G or 0.6 o lighter than the adios Pro 3 it's now much closer to the Nike vaporfly NEX 3 and the aex metas speed Sky Paris on weight but still a shade heavier than those rival carbon plate shoes which come in under 200 g now price stays the same at 22 20 in the UK or $250 in the US let's get into the shoe comparison then the adios Pro 4 has been given a complete overhaul the black and white design and new rocker geometry riff off those rare expensive Elite friendly Adi Zero Pro EVO One the midsole features a new formula Light Strike Pro that's tuned to provide a little extra softness compared to the Pro free the 4 foot rocker has been moved back to boost efficiency it's now positioned at 60% Cent the length of the shoe that makes it a little bit faster to engage the carbon element is the same here the adios Pro 4 also carries the full length carbon energy rods 2.0 just the same as we had in the Pro 3 up top is perhaps where the most impactful change happens with brand new light loock uppers on here to fix some of the issues that some of the runners had with Comfort these oneway stretch woven mesh uppers aim to address one of the biggest gripes with the adios Pro 3 that some Runners found the fit wasn't quite as disappearing and comfortable as other cars races Runners me included also experienced some discomfort particularly around the toen knuckle from the eyelets those have changed two on the Pro 4 the thin wrapping tongues in the Pro 4 are also now stitched in to prevent them moving around having a little bit more lace pinch busting padding as well and there's a simplified lacing structure that hopes to make it easier to get a good fit and reduce some of those pressure points boosting Comfort there also some new locking bands inside the shoe that wrap the foot for a snug and secure fit providing some additional support now the RAC and minimal heel package stays largely the same with just the two small side pads for holding Comfort there's only a little bit more extra padding right behind the heel presumably to address some of the heel rubbing issues that some Runners also suffered in the Pro 3 if you flip them over there are changes to the outsole the Pro 4 now has a textured data mapped light traction outsole and the pad of the Continental grip on the key Landing Point has been tweaked and moved you can see there's a bigger sort of central Channel as well cut to the midsole of the Pro 4 to save weight the heel geometry has also been altered dropping the cut away there as well now when it comes to fit in testing I ran in my regular Adidas running shoe size in both the Pro 3 and the Pro 4 which is a UK and a half and on the whole I found the fit much improved on the four versus the three it's much easier to get the pro four on and positioned and locked down than the fiddle adios Pro 3 I think the improved stitched in tongues really help and the modified lace eyelets kind of remove any of that lace pinching or rubbing around the toe Knuckles however you've still got a narrow toe box that tapers quite abruptly if that was a problem with the pro fre it still lik to be a problem here I did a marathon test of the Pro 4 and once I'd gone beyond two and a half hours either the length or the narrowness of the toebox or a combination of both caused quite a lot of discomfort in my toenails I don't remember ever having that as badly while racing in the Pro 3 but some others have reported it and that's definitely a factor here so while I prefer the fit of the Pro 4 to the pro three I wish the Pro 4 was quarter of a size bigger I think half a size might be too much but I definitely factor in that when sizing for both of these shoes onto the run test then and in testing I covered more than 50 miles in the Adas adzo adios Pro 4 and put it through some tough tests that includes an allout 5K lots of progression stuff and a solo Marathon test there's a video on the channel for that already I ran a great deal more miles in the adios Pro 3 which included a few marathons actual races but all of that was quite a while back so for this head-to-head I also popped these back on for a refresher and did a sidebyside mile with some intervals in the mix but more on that in a mo now I was a fan of the ride of the adios Pro 3 it wasn't perhaps as energetic as shoes like the alphafly 2 or not as Punchy as the aex metas speed Sky Paris but it was still fun Lively a good Marathon raayo that offered enough oomph for runners to chase PBS over distances up to the marathon it perhaps was a bit more capable around my mid pace so I could do faster training in it too what I wasn't keen on was the fit and the biggest problem was the eyelets on the toen knuckle the adios Pro 4 has fixed that fussy fit bug bear for me but it's also changed the ride quite a lot now the Pro 4 is lighter and that's always a good thing big tick in the box but for me the Pro 3 feels more immediate I get less compression in the denser midsole on touchdown and engages faster with a bit more stiffness coming from that combination of the energy rods and the foam I find I feel more connected to the ground and I quite like that kind of ride but it sounds obvious to say and it's true of all shoes but I also think how you run makes a big difference here in how you experience these shoes some Runners seem to find the pro three milder less aggressive and the pro four bouncier and more aggressive with snappier transitions I personally don't find the pro for more aggressive necessarily it's definitely softer and bouncier and now a punchier carbon shoe that's close to the rivals but a little bit of the Pro 3 stiffness has gone there's a bit more of the vapor fly 3 softness just with more bounce but that said I didn't necessarily get a sense that the updates would change the kind of runs that I'd used the Pro 4 4 versus the Pro 3 as I said I think they just get you there in a slightly different way but more on that in this side by side test I've just done my side by side mile I've got the adios Pro 4 on the left foot I've got the adios Pro 3 on the right foot I did a one mile kind of easy warmup around here and then I did three sets of all out 400 meter intervals it just to see and I think the big difference here when you're going a bit slower the softness of the adios Pro really comes through the adios Pro 3 is much more firm it's much more immediate that that midsole foam doesn't sink down as much it holds firmer and like a ball under the foot fires you off much quicker but you do I want say you sort of feel more of the ground but it's just compact quicker and goes quicker so in that sense it kind of feels more firm bit more connected to the ground slower Paces the adios Pro 3 is a much kind of softer shoe creates a bit more wobble I think the difference comes when you start to push up and punch at The All Out pace and then they feel more similar in terms of the ride that really activates the foam in the adios Pro 4 and it really comes to life a lot more a lot of that softness goes it's still not quite as immediate as the Pro 3 and actually I think that's how it's going to differentiate one of the likenesses I would say about this is I feel like it's a little bit like the shift from a vaporfly 2 to a vaporfly 3 there isn't that extreme of the softness but the four is softer and I think you're going to have to like a softer profile shoe to get on with the four if you bought the three because it had that kind of immediacy and that kind of stiffening of the foam that happens quickly that kind of Punchy roll through bit of that has gone I think from the Pro 4 I don't think it makes the pro four a slower shoe just tweaks the ride slightly differently Comfort wise the Pro 4 is the most comfortable shoe out of the two the uppers hold better they hug without restricting you can still feel the eyelets on the Pro 3 and it's just a bit more fussy some people asked when I did the review about the heel package of these two they are very similar there's a few changes into the Pro 4 but I honestly don't notice any difference in the slipping in their heels I haven't had any problems from ail's rub or anything from both issues in the test that I've just done they both feel secure right now I I don't think there's anything to distinguish between the two of them the way they hold for me anyway that's the way my feet feel and I think when it comes to and you've got them side by side like this the the major difference here is just going to come down to that ride feel and how you prefer your shoes if you want something that's a bit softer and you thought the adios Pro 3 was a little bit too aggressive I think you're going to like the Pro 4 if you don't if you wanted that kind of aggression I think the Pro 4 may come up a little bit soft for you um but anyway more more on that back in the office verdict then and the adios Pro 3 and the Pro 4 are both very capable carbon shoes I think a lot of Runners will enjoy for faster miles up to the Marathon distance they both offer Speed but get you there in slightly different ways the change between the ride is noticeable the Pro 4 is softer and bouncier the Pro 3 is stiffer and more immediate the Upp is on the Pro 4 better I think but if you didn't have any issues with a Pro 3 and you really like the ride you might be better off sticking with a pro three and hunting deals on those shoes if you found the Pro 3 too harsh and wanted more bounce and energy and softness from the ride then I definitely look at the pro four first for me personally I think on balance the pro four is the better shoe but a lot of that to me is down to the ERS I just wanted a quarter of a size more room in the toe box to avoid the toenail WS that I got that's a big deal for me on the Pro 4 and I know some toenail bashing is part of the marathon experience but this was some of the worst that I've had and it somewhat limits how far I'd really want to run in the adios Pro 4 going true to size regardless right now as it is if I'm picking one shoe to go and race a marathon it's still the Pro 4 so there you have it that's our head-to-head between the new adios Pro 4 and the adios Pro 3 I hope you found it useful drop us a like like if you did if you're not subscribed to the channel we'd love you to do us the honor and hit that button if you want deeper dives into the adios Pro 3 and the Pro 4 I've got the reviews up on the channel Now get stuck into those otherwise thank you very much for stopping by and until next time happy running people",

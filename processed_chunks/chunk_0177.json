  "text": "[Music] this is Robbie with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and this is Thomas with believe in the Run no you again you just introduced oh I don't get to do it it's all right we're there I can't stop that's all right today is another fun episode where we're interviewing each other and Thomas is in the hot seat yeah right origin stories I wish it was a hotter seat it's a little chilly it's very cold yeah what you get when you when you have an office in a building that's a former slaughter house or whatever it is Butchery not great meat render yeah the ghosts of hogs live in we're back to scrapple again wow um anyways but yeah this is a therapy session for Thomas newberger founder a believe in the Run I think we'll we'll see how deep we get into the the the depths of your mind let's let's I'm excited let's go so this is so I guess the last I did the first one which we're recording this before that comes out so I don't know how the response will be it's GNA be great okay I felt like it was a little rambly because I was just kind of going through the timeline of my life I I felt like it fit your personality okay so I don't know how you want to start out but I I think think we should start out from the beginning okay in the beginning the very beginning is I was an unplanned child were you I see look we're already discovering things I never knew I was uh my parents were in St Thomas Virgin Islands and uh that's actually how I got my name okay uh are you are you kidding me no I would have been Virginia for Virgin Island if I was a girl so I ended up with Thomas St Thomas it's funny because the Virgin Island's kind of like a oxymoron there it is [ __ ] Island oh Wowway sorry Mom yeah uh I my mom and dad had already had their two kids and um they had a boy and a girl perfect little family and then uh yeah you came along yeah red Havoc lady pack ladies pack your uh birth control yeah unplanned um so you were number three how old are how much older were your other siblings three and four years older that's not that crazy no it's not crazy at all not like 10 year Gap yeah and so honestly I never can figure out where either of you are from I always feel like I know and then I'm like I guess that's not right so I was born in Los Angeles okay really yeah Anaheim didn't know that yeah uh you don't actually know Thomas at all yeah the uh my parents moved to the Bay Area shortly after that my dad took a job with a bank in San Francisco okay and uh we moved to the Bay Area uh Lafayette to be specific and uh we were there for a few years but like growing up at that time was like different and since I was kind of like the last kid there was no no adult supervision at all yeah because you grew up in uh you could just say the decades I don't want to age you this was it when we moved to lafette it was like I was a year old and it was 1970 okay so um oh man you were born in the Summer of Love 72 I you weren't born until 71 so this is checking out 72 all right how old are you in a month I'm going to be older oh I sold someone I was 43 yesterday which wasn't true I'm 42 so I get it you just forget at this point you but you should be aging up always down I know yeah um yeah so they moved to in the 70s and uh it was a fantastic time to grow up uh my childhood was a little different I'd say than normal though so my parents uh we they split um when I was around seven okay so and I was already kind of like I didn't have Hands-On parents before then right but after that it was like so did it feel traumatic to you um I don't think I understood what was going on you know I I remember them sitting us down they say hey we're not going to live together anymore and I was just like okay and the first time I realized that my mom wasn't coming home at night like after I was in bed or something was I had a nightmare and I went to their room to like get soothed oh and when I knocked on the door and it was just my dad I was like he's like go away pretty much yeah he wasn't he wasn't uh he wasn't cut out like to be like a dad I don't think yeah he didn't have that paternal Instinct he didn't have the skills and was he uh still in the banking industry at this time yeah yeah he was he was actually a realtor for the bank so what he did was he found like locations to put branches so when they were opening up a new Branch they'd say okay this town where should we put it he would help negotiate the deal okay for for putting that so was that a busy was that timec consuming job or was it just like he had his own life kind of thing you you know at this point he's single he's Works in San Francisco it's about a 30 to 40 minute commute by train every day okay so when you say San Francisco were you guys living in the city no I lived in Lafayette he live his office was in Embarcadero okay which was fun later on when I would got into skateboarding to be able to go down there and that's where a lot of like you I would see like pro pro skaters yeah that was like a space that right you would see that but um yeah so he that that happened and uh my mom left and she moved to Berkeley okay which how far away was that uh it's on the other side of the tunnel so you have to go that again is probably 30 40 minutes at least um I remember when we were in Oakland you were Oakland and Berkeley are right next to each other uh right so I was trying to get in grip miles and so we had a layover and I just took the BART BART yeah that's when we were coming back from uh that was the world world champion yeah and uh and I took a picture of some building or I think it was by Lake Meritt or on the way and you you were like yeah I lived in that apartment I didn't live there mom your mom did so it was kind of opposite when they got split up it I the odd thing was I stayed with my dad mhm so my dad ended up not knowing how to raise kids so he my your siblings and you were all in the same house for this moment so there was a short period of time we were all together um and my dad brought in this lady named Natalie to be our person and she had two kids of her own so he move we're I'm in a divorce situation just adjusting to that my dad doesn't know what to do so he hires this lady who looked like the witch from Bugs Bunny what which W which witch you know the one like when she scrambles like stuff flies out of her hair yeah and then Bugs Bunny looks to the Cameron and says I know but aren't they all inside yeah um but he hires her and she comes in with a family and her son is a special needs kid who uh can't use his lower leg so he's strapped into a skateboard basically no way yeah it it was he was actually it amazing on this thing it had two wheels that would go and then the back wheels were actually the other way so that they would lay flat and it could break oh but there's something wrong with his sockets so that he was strapped into this thing like a v-shaped thing and he's on the skateboard thing but the dude could get around like you wouldn't believe um do you ever know what happened to him no he wasn't the guy at the New York city was he yeah maybe he I'm saying I'll tell you this he could probably skate like insane I don't know if his legs ever healed up but they moved in and uh it was a circus like she had a pitol that stank they had like one of those groovy Vans with the bubble on the side oh yeah and uh she was a nightmare and she basically started homesteading like my dad wanted to get rid of her but she wouldn't leave so she was a squatter before it was cool yeah so yeah my dad ended up marrying this woman named Sally Oh I thought you were GNA say her no so she didn't he didn't marry her she she was just like taking care he gets this lady in Sally who this should have been the first warning that lady came in and immediately got into a fight with Natalie who was the other person and dude this is W like a physical fight where cops came really this sounds like exactly how I imagined California to be in the 1970s so this is I'm imagining Charles Manson was involved at some point prior to prior to all this so they get an altercation and it was kind of reminds me of that story the old lady with a mouse and then she gets a cat to get rid of The Mouse and the dog to get rid that's what my dad did was like he got a shittier thing like when you give a mouse a cookie type thing yeah to get rid of Natalie brought in Sally I guess that's like an invasive species really yeah so Sally took care of that but Sally was like by bipolar okay and immediately my brother checked out at this point so my brother went to go live with my mom which I thought was kind of messed up it's like they started taking yeah individual kids right right like I'll take that one getting for for Dodgeball yeah yeah so my brother went with uh my mom and I stayed with Sally and my sister and my dad what age is this I am now probably eight or nine okay that's a lot to happen in a year or so also my school closed down my public school and I should have gone they like reallocated kids to different schools but because of the divorce my parents thought that it was better that I stayed at the school that I was at which actually got turned into a Muslim school for sufis I I don't even know what that is that a certain sect yeah oh wow so they leave me in this school my sister goes to a regular school my brother's off with my mom at a regular school I'm in third grade and they're teaching me math by counting beads like oh like an abacus like yeah like an abacus but also like there's strands of beads and the blue ones were worth this much and this one it basically almost like a money system who and so they're they're teaching me all this stuff and I'm like coming home and I'm like I don't know what's going on so they finally figure out that I'm getting taught more about religion than like actual skills no way so they pulled me out of school and put me into a regular school but by that time all my friends were gone right and I had to make all new friends and I'm in I'm at school and the teacher hands me a math sheet and she's like here fill this out you know it's a test I'm like where's where's my bees where the bees yeah oh geez yeah so it was pretty bad but then the worst part was as soon as my dad actually got married to Sally she lost her mind and she started abusing both my sister and myself no way yeah and it was it was it was pretty hardcore geez and uh yeah and and did that did he know what was going on or like that was the upsetting thing cuz at this point I felt like I said my dad didn't really know how to raise kids and at this point he was like I don't want like I'm already I lost this I I don't know I can't I don't know how to handle the situation he didn't know how to reprimand Sally okay so he kind of was like letting stuff happen right and uh to the point where like I mean I don't want to get into like all the abuse stuff but it was bad yeah so how many years did this last I'm trying to think when so I ended up getting on a Greyhound bus and my mom had moved to like the country in Northern California so I got there and when I got there I said I can't go back didn't you say you took the bus just by yourself but yeah it was from Oakland too and it was the sketchiest like we're talking like sketchy bus station like people doing stuff like in the coin operated like toilet stalls oh man like crazy crazy situation 4 Hour uh bus ride up to where my M lip mhm and uh she ended up taking me to a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist said I don't care what you do don't like go back or whatever okay that's good and then sorry dude all right so you go and you live with your mom Y and that's where um I end end up meeting at that time my best friend Ryan Davidson who is still I think he's up in Seattle now but um we kind of through Facebook and stuff we're able to stay in touch a little bit but the distance has been a little too far and and I pretty much never stayed in any school more than two years so it was really tough was he at your school yeah he was at my school and he he had like a he was a kid that loved to get into trouble so we hit it off real well real fast and uh what kind of trouble well let's my first experience with weed was was with Ry but besides that like my mom was uh poor like it like when I live with my mom we lived in a trailer for a little while and then uh she actually built her own house so she bought like a house kit and what she yeah she she built her house what do you mean built her house that's like before tiny houses were cool too yeah she B basically there's this lumber yard called 84 Lumber and you could buy a house all the materials so she laid a foundation she all herself well her and this guy Al okay and they built the house from the ground up but while they were building it we lived in the trailer she bought six acres of land and that was it but there wasn't really any money so my one big treat a week was I was given like $4 to go skating at the skate rink and Ryan was usually Ryan and this guy David were the two of the three of us pretty much hung out pretty tight and Ryan was really into art my mom was an artist so we kind of bonded on that stuff and uh we because we didn't have a lot of money I started making skateboards out of like we would make it out of like plywood and stuff like that so we're putting that stuff together way building little ramps and like Towing ourselves with motorcycles to get over the ramps stuff like that awesome but we you we were kind of like at that point he was living in the country and you kind of got into it but it seemed like you had more supervision for me it was like how do we not be bored right so we were we were pretty much getting into trouble all the time but uh like some of the great things were that we had like this bridge near that went over this it was called Cow Creek and there Silver Bridge went over it it was about 30 40 feet over the water but you could jump into it if you landed in the right spot nice so we used to uh do that a lot um just that kind of like board yeah kids getting into stuff a lot of BMX biking a lot of skateboarding a lot of just let's like when you we were talking about like a tree was like the closest gas station store oh yeah was like five miles away yeah but we make a trek of it the whole day like what would you go get uh you know whatever is like uh if like I remember getting you know the cheap candy because we didn't have much money so we would get like Wafers or something or the Taffy you know oh yeah the Taffy stuff but like we make a it was like kind of like when I see the movie um what's the movie where they go to see the dead body Stand By Me Oh Stand By Me yeah that we make days of it like that where to get to the store and back you know you're you go swimming in the creek for a little while you get there and uh you know that was a start of stuff like one of my friends had Atari that we'd get to his house was like a you know an hour walk we'd all Trek over there oh yeah but we got real into that kind of stuff and I think you know similar to Robbie where I didn't have access to things and so I went from the Sally that was with my dad she wouldn't let us watch TV at all so we were like blanked out of Pop Culture there and I remember like going to school and kids would be talking about a show and you'd be like yeah trying to interject but there's nothing to say it kind of does like for all the parents who think they're doing their kids a favor by keeping them away from pop culture you're not you're ostracizing them it's one of those weird things though where I you hate it as a kid and then you're like well would I have been so into things appreciated it more later in life yeah like it's like a weird necessary evil to appreciate culture I think it I think it it keeps you from being able to there's a balance there surely yeah so we got up there and and when I was with my mom since again there's no money there's no cable TV or anything I had a 13-inch black and white TV and you had to like aim it at a certain direction get fuzzy things put the put the tin foil on antennas first time I saw the shining it was on like that black and white TV you remember having to hit the top of a TV to get it in the right the frequency but uh yeah always be hitting the TV Saturday morning that but I went from the opposite thing so since I didn't have any TV like Saturday morning cartoons like I watched everything until those went off the air yeah um and yeah so there you know it was a again my mom worked she was an artist so again we're pretty much left our um at that in that situation and you know we got got into some trouble with doing stuff like you know little light vandalism and stuff like that um were you inspired by Mom the artist I was you know I got positive feedback uh for my artwork and one of the things my brother used to draw and um he said he stopped drawing when he saw that I was better than him nice like is like I ran him out of the market he's like as soon as I saw you he's like I was like damn what am I even doing he's better than I am and so it was a point of like that was one thing that I always held on through throughout my childhood was like creativity artistic and drawing and stuff was always a strong suit and it got me attention with adults it got me attention with kids like every all the kids would be like hey can you can you draw this for me can you you do this so it was always something did you draw like dirty pictures like to get to kids pay you to do that I mean there is a certain phase where you go through where you're like yeah I can especially back draw not like you had access to anything you're just imagining stuff oh jeez yeah selling illustrations again Ryan and I Ryan introduced so Ryan had his house he had a satellite oh and had access to VHS and all that stuff so like I would starting to get exposed to like horror movies like it was almost scary to go to his house because I didn't want to watch him but I also didn't have a color TV so going over to his house you had he had a big screen TV with a satellite and you could watch it all um yeah so uh Ryan was also like kind of he was into music he started playing instruments um you just he was just one of those kids that like he could ride a dirt bike he could yeah take all the cool he could do everything and he was he seemed good at everything and he he was grown up in Hawaii and then moved uh over to the state Soh uh you know we just had you know tons of fun hanging out and doing that kind of stuff and uh when I left it was it was sad because we didn't really stay in touch when I went I ended up my dad ended up sallying him she on the side of a highway threw a boulder at him and then just left um they uh but so when she left I decided hey you know kind of sucks being poor i' rather go back my dad wasn't rich but he was like middle class and I was like I think I'd like to go back to Lafayette and go to high school there and it was in that transition year going to high school okay so I went back to and I was it in my school in mville I was fairly popular like I that I was a big fish in a small pond there I was like somebody yeah and I had friends I had girlfriends I had you know the whole works and I went to back to school and aalan had like 3,000 kids in it and I was nobody 3,00 kids yeah like uh when I would go to lunch I dreaded lunch because I had no one to sit with or talk to that's the worst that sounds awful I was like please just let this be over and luckily it was a school that but you know it's in California mhm most of the year you can sit outside and eat oh yeah so I started just like finding a quiet spot ended up making friends with another guy that liked to skate and it kind of unraveled there it was kind of weird though because when I came back some of my friends from elementary school were going to ocalan but at that point their clicks are all made and they were like right you can't come back plus I look like Ralph Macho and I had my hair parted in the middle probably country Pumpkin Style so they were probably like n nerd wearing suspenders in a check checkered hey guys can we hang out um I think I was still wearing braces oh man that rough so did you have glasses too uh no I think my dad was kind enough to let me get contact oh well that's good um and then when I couldn't afford them at my mom's house I just was blind yeah like I'd rather I wouldn't wear the glasses and just be like I can't see anything but this I had to wear the glasses but that was that was the worst too yeah and uh you know so got back in skating kind of became my thing and as soon as I got back with my dad about a year into it he decided um he was going to marry this woman back in Baltimore oh wow and so that's the Baltimore connection all right he again left M but this time instead of me going back to my mom's house they just left me in Lafayette and I ended up living with um one of my dad's friends okay so he left we still had the house there my brother was living in the house mhm and how old's your brother at this point 16 okay okay or no at that time I think maybe he was like 17 or 18 that's a interesting time to leave a person that age in a house yeah well my brother got in trouble he got he yeah he he was you don't need to go into it it's fine my brother had been living by himself since he was 16 like he got uh kicked out of my mom's house and my dad and so he my dad got got him an apartment at 16 whoa that's wild so yeah um so my dad moves back to the east coast and the woman he marries uh it she didn't want kids okay so nice when it was time for me to join them it was boarding school like you're going to go Plus at the time like once he left and I didn't have any parents yeah I was skateboarding became everything to me right and so I was going to school like half day okay and yeah cuz why not yeah we kick out of school right go to Taco Bell seems Seems more important well which at that point Taco Bell might be more the house I was staying at had a pool oh so we would ditch school yeah get Taco Bell skatee for a while right hang out by the pool they had an 18-year-old daughter that had all her friends over all the time so yeah ditch school as well I'm like 16 and there's 18-year-old yeah you can't you School cannot compete with that there's no way and that was a time that I really got into again into kind of like started doing maybe a little more graffiti yeah and uh other vandalism that I don't really want to get into but um that's that's fine yeah they so I was kind of like you weren't carjacking people I was on my not quite um I was on my way to being to needing to go to boarding school yeah yeah you're on your way to Skid R via like they just left me on that trajectory it would be a different uh story um so yeah so they sent me to boarding school and it was funny I checked out all these different boarding schools and um the one that I chose first off I went I was from California and I went to the east coast in the summer to look at boarding schools in the upper east coast perfect it looked beautiful there's like green grass there's Breeze there's leaves on trees it I'm like wow this is gorgeous I went to this one school and it was in a Shaker Village like that's where pilgrims are not pilgrims but Shaker was a religious SE for some reason I Quakers there's shakers too shakers so just so you know what a shakers Quakers baby shakers don't believe in um yeah I reproducing I I remember that okay I saw something on Instagram that was super weird about it so they don't reproduce how does that even how does that work how is there they take in children oh and it pretty much is a it's I don't yeah it's I mean we the School purchased it I think I remember seeing there's like one left or something like yeah one lady probably yeah she's like 160 so what was kind of crazy though is they did work on some of our buildings on campus that were Shaker buildings and they found like fetuses wrapped in corn husks and stuff that were walled in so like use them as insulation well what had probably happened was people were probably having sex and then somebody would get pregnant and then they'd have to figure out what to do with and they hid them in the walls that feels like the weirdest spot might I'm not sure if God approves of that I don't think that I don't think so um that's insane there's another story about how wait is this like a wies tail or no no there was another this when they were redoing some of the building they okay found it there was another story of um they were hunting a rabid dog and one of the Shakers got shot in the head because they thought the dog was coming around the corner and it was the person I think it was just murder and they tried to make up a story but uh all kinds of stuff went on back then nobody there was nobody knew is that like the plot of The Village basically ight shyan's like Village I don't know but it it seemed lot like that but the other thing was it's snowed October 4th and it didn't come off the ground till April so yeah like I I went through this total shock of like sounds horrible but so in high school I made friends with this kid named Nemo Nemo uh dad was an art dealer in in New York um you know yeah but anyway yeah uh Nemo was real big into graffiti and was a really good artist and so we became friends and like back then in school like if I was in class I was just drawing all the time like I was not like even my college my college notebooks are just illustrations yeah but you went to Art School in college yeah I went yeah but also I went to liberal arts school too right so um yeah so Nemo and I become friends he's got a house his family lives in New York City so he's got that so on the weekends we started going to New York City and this is in the 80s right yeah okay that's like dude it was nuts grimy New York city so when we would go to New York uh it we were pretty much again unsupervised yeah and I didn't know this at the time but when I got out there you find out really quickly that you can go anywhere you want at 16 so we were going to clubs all the time we were going to like at that time the tunnel Limelight Palladium uh Mars all these different clubs yeah and you can drink there was any kind of substance around that you'd want I was meeting all sorts of colorful people yeah um at the time when we were there like the standard thing to carry around was a box cutter so that like if you got in a fight you just slice somebody or something like that that counted as CU is that not illegal to carry on you I think it was just cheap and easy and if you open up someone's face it bleeds real fast so that like yeah it's SC it's scary to people um got one on me right now but uh so we started doing like that stuff and and a lot of like going into the city was you know at that time it was a wild wild west New York City and there was definitely times where is this this is Manhattan though yeah yeah and like there was a couple times where we escaped pretty hard you know close to Danger yeah and you know we're starting to tag stuff and and uh Nemo had already been part of like the graffiti scene but you know we started getting into that stuff but it it got weird when people started carrying guns in that scene yeah so um that's when I was kind of like I don't want to do this anymore yeah yeah and uh wait people were carrying guns when they were going and doing graffiti so at that time like graffiti was kind of like territorial so you would tag up and if someone right over your tag or disrespect you fights would usually ensue so when I imagine New York City in the 80s I think the Warriors is that kind of of what it was like so one I'll give you one example we I went to a party and um and I was like I was California in New York City you know I was like I was in the group of people I was hanging out with there I'm thinking maybe maybe there's a couple other white people but it was it was more mixed in our group and we went to a house party and uh I was at the house party and I started talking to this girl and I'm out out in front of the building MH and uh this guy named Jerry Dean Jerry Jr is what he wrote and one of the common ways to get into a fight back then someone said you know what do you write meaning what's your tag or whatever so this guy Jerry Dean who's twice as big as me looks like the Hulk like he's just jacked he just gotten out of prison he was like prison yard yeah jacked yeah like there's a certain way you can look only from lifting weights and guess so he he comes up to me because he sees me talking to this girl and he goes hey what do you write I'm like Ferris and he's like I don't know you he goes I write Jr you know me I was like no I don't know you and so I just noticed this Shadow over my shoulder there's another dude about the same size as him and I'm surrounded Now by four dudes that are the same size as him and they start like pushing me around they're like ah is he fear in his eyes I see fear in his eyes and they start pushing me around and they they're like like somebody goes oh wait you right Ferris I'm like he goes oh man sorry I didn't know who you were and he like I like kind of pushed my way out of the little circle and I go lean up against this car so I'm in between the car and the the curb and uh he comes back over and goes hey man I didn't know who you were and he puts out his hand like he to like shake and when I go to shake his hand he grabbed me by the top of my head threw me down between between the two cars and him and his four friends with Timberlands on just started stomping on me and my head's hitting the curb I had just gotten this new vision skateboard shirt that I loved you know it was like a white shirt with a vision skate you know and uh I'm getting stomped on in front of this girl that I thought was cute and I was felt like I was making not cute anymore Making Waves um she was gone at this weren anymore yeah she was gone at this point so I'm getting stomped on him and like skin is getting broken blood is coming out and then Nemo comes over and he's like yo yo yo what are you doing and they're like this guy you know and he's like no he's with us and I when I heard he's with us uhuh I just realized oh crap this dude now is with us oh so they picked me up from the street my shirt is R oh he was with you guys yeah no way so my shirt is ripped and you got to see me in high school at this time I'm probably 160 mhm like Skin and Bones yeah like I looked I had the morisy haircut you know it was like I get up it's my shirt's ripped I'm like bleeding there's blood on my shirt like just scuffed up and then they're like oh cool all right whatever man let's go to this club and I have to go with this guy spend the rest of the night with this guy nice and I'm like I would have just left and been like I'm out I'm in New York City like I'm hanging with Nemo there's nowhere to go so I'm sitting at the tunnel all like jacked up just drinking beers looking like I got rolled well I did get rolled oh man yeah that sucks so yeah New York was fun um there was another time where we almost got murdered by a gang of kids on the subway but we got away yeah and like I'm shaking and uh I'm like dude like next stop let's just get out of here and um my friend Nemo was like why are you being such a puss you know this he goes but let's get a cab but like we almost got like these guys were going to kill us like it was like it was bad um but anyway so that was New York and I was ready I was ready to leave yeah once high school was done I actually came home and begged my dad like please don't send me back M I'll I'll be good yeah and uh they're like it's too late um so I finished up my time in boarding school and uh that I I ended up com down here and wanted to go to art school and so I ended up at Maryland College of Art and I loved the idea of being at art school but once I was there I just I didn't really love it I felt like it was kind of antiquated at the time and most of the kids that were graduating I saw working at the restaurants we went to oh yeah so we'd be like you don't say I'm like wait I'm going to finish this degree and my options are going to be working at the pizza place or while I have a loft that I'm sharing with three other dudes and we're painting right you know hopefully it's similar to your band life yeah but I knew immediately that wasn't going to be for me oh when I first moved to Baltimore I looked at one place that was I think three Micah guys and I dodged a bullet on that one for sure you did they were like I think they were talking he's like yeah the one guy kind of likes to just do his art sometimes he hangs out naked I'm like probably good yeah I see that's a thing like that was the thing about art school that I thought there's doing art and I felt like half the kids there were really good at Art the other half were really good at pretending to be artists and having their parents pay for it yeah was like smoking cigarettes naked it's like or just trying to do weird like I'm I just want to try to do and that's why how many how many clove cigarettes did you go through during that time CL SAS were probably more in the New York days okay um camels were the cigaretta choice at uh at art school and parli parliaments parliaments parliaments were there but that's when my grandma smoked so okay I think they were cooler later on maybe like then later 90s probably it kind of was like it became like the what's that beer that everybody started drinking the um PBR yeah PBR um so there's a lot of kids that are there just there that are like think it's fun to try to be like they're the art project I'm going to be weird and and do that but like when you're like okay well let's see your portfolio you're like this [ __ ] sucks right right not even like in the good way that it sucks like it's so bad like sometimes it's ironic yeah but um so I was at our school I was like my brother at that time had moved from California to the east coast here and he was at talson University and I saw him going to parties and there was girls there and there was looked fun and everything so I was like well maybe I'll get another degree while I'm getting this art degree I'll get a psychology degree and maybe do art therapy for kids uhhuh and you know try to help okay help kids I wonder why I would want to do that but um so I I go to I went to talson and as soon as I get there my brother basically finds a girlfriend and he's nowhere to be seen right okay and so I'm like ah great um but I I enjoyed the the tal and stuff and um I ended up getting the double degree and obviously Next Step would be to go to grad school M but I was like at this point I was like 24 and I was like I'm done with school I want to I want to start life yeah I want to do that right so I ended up um getting a job at Nordstrom okay which actually was like a continuation of high school or college yeah because it it was a playground for me like it was like it had all the stuff you know the the gear and the clothing and all that stuff yeah I guess that's true but it also had a lot of female employees right and yeah we could skip over that part um no but so you did yeah I remember man that's like that's a lot of hard left turns that wait so I know I know you played Sports of some kind so when were did any of that come in well when I got to I I skied my whole life and when we went to um when I went to boarding school they had skiing there okay because there's a mountain called Jiminy Peak nearby so that was you would think it would be fun but when you have to go skiing every day whether you want to or not or whether the weather's good or bad yeah it and like they made you go skiing yeah like it was like a almost like a cross country team like was a team yeah so you're like practicing yeah so you you go out and and the I also found lacrosse I came so my first year I played lacrosse I was the most improved player okay because I didn't have in California at the time um and then the second year I was team captain and most valuable player but it wasn't because I was good I think it was because I just was enthusiastic and I worked hard okay and I and I was kind of voted by my teammates they were like nice yeah so it was a nice it was a nice affirmation wasn't skill based I didn't know you were a LAX bro H I'm not but my we had one kid at the school Rich whose dad was a corporate lawyer uhhuh now this school was like all income levels like we had Puerto Rican kids that were on scholarship all the way to corporate lawyer Sons okay so his dad had a helicopter and for One lacrosse game he got fully suited up his dad landed him on the field well the pilot landed him on the field and he came out of the helicopter what like while the other team was doing calisthenics and fully draft feel like he had a Target on his back for that game for sure no I mean and we crushed that year that that was we were I think we might have been undefeated my first year that we did it but and then I also played basketball uh I actually got to play against the school that Mike Tyson went to really they had a chain link fence around the court and you still got hit with rocks but um that's crazy yeah yeah um but never running there was no running in your life I mean lacrosse had like we did running like a mile warm up or whatever like that but yeah no no running never thought about running uh the only time I ran was when I would come home from school I just kind of felt like doing something so I would do like a mile loop around the house just to just to run but I think I probably did it in like basketball shoes or something yeah um really wasn't on the radar and then uh when finished up it being a manager at Nordstrom which was it was it was a great job at the time yeah um it taught me a lot and especially back then it was customer service oriented and it was a civil place to be and dealing with the public seem a lot more civil than it is today and uh one of my friends was working in the mortgage industry he's like hey come work in the mortgage you can make a lot of money so I quit there and went to work there and you can make a lot of money and yeah but it sounds terrible I did but it was the worst lowest I've ever felt about myself oh just like you're it was just a scummy what did you do all day make calls yeah they would give you a stack of people who need to refinancing what year is this you would call them uh this probably would have been around 96 okay okay yeah so doing doing calling these people and the worst part about it I just felt like you were people needed money so you were helping them refinance their house and stuff like that and sometimes you were lowering their interest rate but most of the time you were doing things to to um screw their situation right like increase their interest rate get money out of their house so that you can get paid your fees and stuff like that it was just the grossest thing so I immediately like didn't enjoy the work and started not like I was employed there but I wasn't working because I was like this is the worst as a matter of fact it was really sad a friend of a friend was refinancing their house and I saw their name on the paperwork and I was like I heard the loan officer talking about how they were his last name was Hall and they're like we're hauling this guy and it became the word for really screwing someone over oh my gosh and I I tried to call the guy he said and I was like dude do not sign this paperwork don't sign the paperwork because they're so is the idea is that they lower the interest rate but put a ton of points on it or like so here's the thing you could like say that you qualified for like a % interest rate yeah they can sell you a 7% interest rate and then The Brokerage makes that money that extra money on that so first off oh I got I got you first off you think so say that your interest rate was 10 but I could get you three yeah but instead you make it to seven and and I collect a fat check from that then on top of it there's fees that I can build into your loan right so then they were building fees into the loan so that they were getting it on both sides so they were getting a paycheck from right hiking the interest rate on you and they were getting a paycheck from the the built-in fees that they were putting in and so I called the guy and I was like hey don't do this he's like I don't have a choice I need this money I was like dude like you're not just go someplace else don't do this loan because was it a was it a short and was it a fixed rate or was it like variable so did they get like a shortterm I don't even remember it was it was going to he was going to lose his house like and I was just like don't do this and that's that's the mentality of the top producers where all that kind of like screw the how you go home and sleep at night well I ended up calling my uncle I was like look I don't think I can do this and I was like I was like I need some ethical advice he's like if you think it's unethical quit and then the housing bubble well sooner or later crashes and then nobody gets has held responsible and everybody walks away yeah I mean there's hate it I mean I do know somebody who went to jail for some stuff uh but even then it probably not that long and not it's just crazy yeah tons of people's lives yeah it was it was just a really shady business and um I remember I I I ended up just quitting and I got a job uh at another place doing in marketing and I kept it was was first sales and I was like kept edging I would go to the marketing department all the time be like hey openings and like and finally work my way over then that company went out of business they they went through $30 million and nice bellied up and at this time I was like okay what am I going to do I I went back to my art background I was like I need to learn computer skills I have zero computer skills for art I'll I'll take anything so like you I was on like unemployment for a little while when they cut the when they let everybody go like we showed up to work and there was guards at the door and basically boxes and they're like take your stuff and yeah and go um I ended up getting a job at a screen printer and designing t-shirts and I went in and I said to the guy said hey um I I have no skills on the computer but I I tell you what I promise you I'll be your top Performing Artist if you give me a shot yeah so I took a 50% pay cut like just almost dropped like dropped my pants for it I was just like consider this getting paid to go to school yeah and um I went and I got got really good at it and I was doing designs for the US Open and different you know some fun stuff that was a schol pretty cool and really start big Johnson t-shirts yeah some of that um and I really H my skills and and the thing was it it also like the pressure I was able to turn things over quickly yeah like like that was I think the biggest skill I Learned was not only to design quickly but execute quickly and work and that plays into like when I ended up meeting Megan um but I got really good there and I started doing freelance and I was getting enough freelance I started getting into arguments with the ownership because he didn't want me doing freelance ended up just quitting and opening my first business which was new designs and um I was really good at the creative and marketing side uhuh not so good at the business side shocking so uh you probably didn't note at the time but um a local uh PR Company that didn't have a creative department they were looking for someone to start their creative Department my work was really good and they saw that yeah and they were like ah this guy would be great so they offered me a job to start their creative Department be the creative director at um this company and they didn't know it but like I was probably a month out of like probably crashing and burning so I was like yeah I'll do that well I I have my hands tied right now really really have some options that are more enticing but zero options like the that sound of the plane crashing was was they couldn't hear it but so I went there and um again that was a great experience I'd learned a ton about uh branding and marketing and that and while I was there I you know I started getting into running I'd gone to a 5k okay and 5K marathon right yeah yeah as they all are it was actually the Baltimore marathons 5K and so it kind of was in a way yeah well it was funny I I there was a couple women at the the marketing agency that were Runners and so they asked me if I wanted to go for a run so I started doing like little two M three mile runs and you know how it is it hurts oh yeah um but then I signed up for the 5K and when I saw like the people at a running event I was like oh this is amazing like I want to be a part of this this seems cool because up until then the only way I saw people in public was probably at a bar right right you know it was like that's how I thought people met and I went to the running event and it's like wow there's people that are full of positive energy life and looking healthy yeah I did the 5K smoking Sig yeah well I did I I may have been at the but um uh the I went afterwards I went to a bar and we were waiting for one of my friends who doing the marathon and there's dude who looked totally out of shape walked up and he's got the Half Marathon medal on I I just look at I'm like if that guy like congratulations man dude I thought he was like a superhero I was but I was like if that guy can run a half marathon I can run a half marathon yeah so I actually the guy it's funny because the guy is a faster bastard now but this guy Paul sorry I feel like whenever I think of that what you're talking about I feel like in elf when he uh when it was like number best coffee in the world and he's just like congratulations I feel the same way whenever I would see someone with a marathon metal I'm like you you did it yeah you are a superhero so Paul I said to Paul I go oh gez I think I want to run a a half marathon he goes that just sign up for a marathon training you'll run a half while you're doing and then you can run a marathon so I went from 5K to signing up for a marathon how long do you know how long the training was um you did a program right yeah I went I went to weeks same as Robbie I went to Charm City and signed up for the thing and there was a free one at Falls Road but I was like I I need to I need to put some skin in the game I need to yeah and I remember telling my friends and family that I was going to run a marathon and one of my family members laughed in my face like there's no effing way you're running a marathon which was at the time really hurtful but it lit a fire in me to be like yeah F you I'm I'm going to do this was it your brother no okay my brother's actually really supportive yeah okay it was kind of funny he was like all right because I what I did was when I signed up I knew I I wanted all the motivation to finish that's possible so I told everybody that I could and my family friends hey I'm signing up for a marathon I'm going to run a marathon this spring yeah just put it out there like I'll be humiliated if I don't do it yeah it's good so I ended up um running my first marathon and it like some was it the Baltimore marath no it's the DC I was going to say you said spring yeah I did it in DC um I don't know it was it the time the Sun Trust I don't know what it is now okay but now it's rock and roll is it rock and roll yeah I think so so I ended up doing it but as soon as I cross the finish line like a little switch clicked off my brain and I was like oh if you plan man and follow the steps you can do anything and I don't know why I thought this at the time but I was like I could write a book like that was like the aut Apex of if you're disciplined you can get things done yeah well before that it's like you're like a there's no way I can do that because you don't see the steps yeah I get it I actually know exactly what you're talking about yeah so I don't know why I thought I could write a book because I'm not a very good writer but at the time I was like I could even write a book yeah um but I I was just like oh you can do anything and then one of our clients at the agency was gortex mhm so I went to a meeting at gortex and you know I'm feeling pretty good now I'm a marathon guy you know that place is full of athletes yeah and uh Cynthia M was there and she was giving us uh all this in you remember Cynthia she was the one when we did the North base um she starts telling me Oh we sponsor a race out in uh Colorado called the trans Rockies oh nice she's like it's a six day uh 130 mile race Over the Rockies right and I was kind of like this is after right after your first marathon maybe I had done two at this point I think maybe I had done okay two I I think I followed that followed that up with um like the Baltimore Marathon or something I forget which one um but I was like huh that seems like a scary challenge I I think I could do it and it's actually how uh believe in the Run started so again again like setting myself up so that I wouldn't you know bail out on it I uh decided hey I'll I'll raise money for a charity for Trans Rockies and uh I need a website so I put together the website believe in the run first off where'd you get the name from well there was okay at that time there was an ad campaign going on uh I think Nike had it and um I was obviously in the marketing and I was like okay I went and looked I was like that's a good I like I like that sentiment and the whole thing was like it wasn't just believe in the r believe in the run you R running never get takes more than it gives or something like that uhhuh and I was like ah believe in the run I said ah let me let me get that URL if it's available and it was yeah and then I looked at the agency that was doing the work and it it's like brickfish or something like that I was like oh they're probably going to lose their job so I got the URL and I started using it to uh raise money for the Baltimore child abuse center and why did you pick that well just okay yeah never mind yeah so uh you know it was something that I thought had meaning for me for um you know earlier in my childhood mhm so uh I decided to raise money for them and uh since I had PR marketing company that I worked with I was able pull some strange get on some like at that time radio shows and promote what what I was doing and uh it's I started like putting my training on there as I was asking on the website for donations and this is probably before everyone in their 2009 everyone in their cousin was asking for a race donation so probably wasn't as like well I also said I'm going to do this one time okay and I'm not I'm not I'm never going to ask for for this again so I cuz I did I still feel that there's I do get annoyed because like we all run we all do it and sometimes when people are like hey help me raise money for this because I'm running yeah you're like yeah we're all running um and you do it whether or not we give a donation yeah it's nice that you are but um it I was like this is the only time I'll do it big event 30 Mi um so I started raising money and I had to do posts on the website so I started talking about my training what I was wearing what gear I had that stuff and people were more interested in like what gear I was using and they wanted to know because at that time there was nothing you couldn't go anywhere to find out okay you're going to be running in the mountains for 20 miles what gear do you need right what what uh you know polls or what's good out there for for for this I by the way I think you can still look back and find those unbel I think I've archived some some of the worst ones but I think uh but I think you can I think you might be able to go back and find some of those posts well the the funny thing the first ones anyway at that time Byron um what's his name from iRun far he was the only person that he was in DC and he had run trans Rockies so I was like um let me check in with this guy and see what he knows like if you know if he knows any tips or anything like that and I just remember him writing back to me real quick about something and whatever but it kind of gave me I was like I think he was probably the only other person doing kind of like Gear reviews at all yeah probably I can't imagine too many people back there were doing it I remember when I first started writing there was [Music] um going to forget his name now uh he doesn't review anymore oh you're talking about Pete lson Run blogger Pete Larson was my kind of like my mentor in a way once I started doing like at first it was a charity and training site but then when I started talking about gear that's where the interest go that's people started interested so I started talking more about gear and that's when Pete kind of was like hey you can do this you should you know do this or do that and he also was the first person like he put me in touch with like saky and stuff and was like hey you should give this guy shoes and Sketchers and sket yeah and Sketchers um so he kind of made some introductions to some Brands and it kind of snowballed like once you start reviewing some of that stuff the other brands are like hey do you want you want me to send you some stuff we'll let you do it so I was like oh look at this I'm and at this point I'm like two three years into running yeah and I'm getting you know stuff sent to me like a free pair of shoes I'm like this is the greatest thing ever oh for sure by the way I'm can see your weekly trans Rockies run training week seven your weekly updates yeah you've really kept a good run Journal I got to say really I mean you literally put every day of your training on there oh wow nerd well there was nothing back there was no like Strava didn't exist I was using daily mile um I oh here we can I read one and yeah go ahead this is your long run for week seven I thought this 22 M run was going to be a big struggle I was achy and tired I downloaded Dean kass's 50/50 book on the iPhone last night remember this and started listening as I began to run and uh that was on the NCR oh yeah and you uh listen to that while running felt good you have to understand like back then nobody was doing Ultras right I know like it was it like it was really like now I I I feel like I don't know what you'd have to do to impress somebody cuz like back running across the country know yeah uh well at Megan when I met Megan I was training for a 50 mile and you thought I was insane I thought you were absolutely nuts um but yeah so I started getting free gear and stuff and so the site started shifting to more of a gear site MH which played into I've always loved like I I played um I I during skateboarding I was all into the gear and and everything like that and then later on I dabbled in golf and I got real into like that gear and clubs and everywhere I went I collected the little golf balls from the course and stuff like that so I've always been like a gear nerd and running just was like an explosion yeah for me it was like oh you need all this stuff like I remember my first pair of tights and like do I need shorts over these or do you you just kind of like go out with just tights on yeah can't do that not when you first start out build that confidence level dude I ran a 10-mile with a hydration pack um the Baltimore 10er oh 10er okay I got you yeah yeah there's a there's a race photo of me with a camel back on it running like with 7inch shorts Corney dwalter style yeah a matter of fact I would look just like it but um yeah so it got started getting real into running because the gear was coming and I just fell in love with the sport I loved being around the people um like everything it just I fell in love with like just talking about it all the time I was probably completely annoying oh yeah um I mean I know I feel like everyone is when you first start now it's almost I try to avoid it cuz I know people are trying talk about anything but people were trying to avoid me so I get it yeah I I I mean I I remember I went to a wedding and I was going to have a six mile run the next day so I didn't drink you are that is nerd Lev there like well it was the longest run I'd ever done at the time it was when I was like training for my first marathon I was like I don't know if I can do six miles you know I won't drink at this wedding turns out you can drink as much as you want knock out six miles yeah but um yeah uh so yeah we got into that and um finished the trans Rockies I donated I think I think it was a total of like near 5,000 bucks or something to the Baltimore child AB center did you well you had a goal did you reach the goal or you got as much as you could cuz you had a on the post it said goal it post had a goal of like 11,000 or 12 I I didn't reach that goal okay I got I think I think I got to around five all right still valuable yeah so did that and uh it gave me a lot of confidence being able to do that I remember before I went for the run I just went to Breen Ridge to go skiing with my brother and stuff and and I remember being up in those mountains being like what did I do yeah why did I sign up for this I was like how am I going to run over one of these things yeah like this is ridiculous right and I I was like almost terrified but it was good it made me take the training seriously MH and I just followed that they had training on the trans Rockies website so I was like just following what they recommended as like here's this will get you through and at the time was it sponsored by Under Armour was no gortex oh okay yeah gortex was there the first time and then when we ran it together what who was the sponsor it switch Solomon who was it I don't recall yeah I forget it wasn't Under Armour yet no I guess it didn't I guess their investment was not worth it sorry well we got kitted out by um oh Newton yeah oh wow but they didn't sponsor the event I don't think oh okay no but we got some shade from were being like where cuz like we were decked out in head to toe every day and there's this one Le one Trail dudes that were like here comes those Newton people and that was like before like people were doing stuff like that like getting sponsorship so I'll get into how that happened but so I end up um again at the time when I was at the agency that I was at I started just feeling feeling like one I didn't like the rules of the agency like we were supposed to track every minute every day that we were there like it had to be buildable hours and stuff and it just I felt stifled creativity and stuff like that and then I also was very much into uh social media and stuff and I saw that as an emerging place to be and the owner of the company wasn't really buying into it he thought it was going to be more of a fad and that like our clients didn't need to be on social media I was like I think you're wrong um so I ended up quitting and again started another company called Wonder Dojo okay um with another guy and he was the developer I was the designer and we were going to do website design stuff like that and this guy only liked to work at night I'm like dude how are we supposed to start a business something I kind of do yeah it literally like I was like and he was doing like a free website for a coffee place because they gave him free coffee I'm like dude I can't be doing websites for free coffee I need money was his name Cosmo Kramer pretty much it was it was funny so like one day I just went up to him I said hey this isn't this this isn't going to work uhuh I go uh he goes is it is it me yeah I'm like no no I just think I want to go a different direction so I ended up he was like can I keep the name and the logo I'm like you got it m I'm just out and uh I ended up going to do Consulting work for uh social toaster so social toaster is one of the companies and so I was working for a couple of different companies doing like Consulting you're doing sales yeah sales and consulting stuff um uh not at Social toaster was I I was doing sales doing sales huh that's weird I don't remember that switched you out of that cuz they were like nope not this guy yeah you were exchanging their work for free coffee yeah that's right they push him straight into marketing they're like this guy likes to paint stuff yeah um which was great so I started uh like I wasn't full-time there I was just consult I was working for a couple other um entities too but I like social toaster and uh the people like I really enjoyed working with the people there it was a lot of fun um we had a ton of fun there and it was like exciting when we were there it was like growing it was it's like that that startup that you envision that's like 10 people it's really young they have investors so there's a bunch of money you're trying to figure out how to make stuff work but you're with a team that's like super young super smart and very smart so you're like it's like the very Work Hard Play Hard mentality right lots of lots of happy hours lots of like I and I started doing stuff like exploding pumpkins at work it's I can't even expl the Golden Age of startups when everything everything was getting money and yeah everyone's happy there was invest C of beer in the office all that stuff so um at that time I am sitting in this area where they let the intern sit basically because I would come in with my computer and just work there for a little bit and then head out and one day I come in and this lady mhm is and at this point I'm at I'm doing like three marathons a at least a year maybe four four to five marathons and an ultra every year yeah and uh I come in one day and at the desk we normally intern sit is Megan and so I'm like being friendly uhhuh hi I'm Thomas are you the new intern uhhuh I had just moved from Charleston to Baltimore and got my like first real big job as a marketing uh okay like uh or I guess I was technically an account rep at that point anyway I was very excited about this big new job and he looks right at me and goes so you're the new intern and I was like she heard you're who is this dick wad so we get immediately go into get pulled into a meeting where I'm in a meeting and I'm looking over and I'm getting like like mean daggers yeah mean looks I'm like what the it's just short with me like the r like like I got nothing uhhuh uh from from it but like I was like whatever um but then we started working together and when we got projects and Megan and I did him like we crushed them like we worked faster and put stuff together to the point where I felt like everything got just shoveled to us yeah we were very efficient and even my I think we've said this before but they called us the GSD team oh yeah and um get [ __ ] done yeah cuz we could just they'd hand us these like projects that they give us like a week timeline and we could get everything done in a day nice and so we were just like knocking out work and it was and it was fun and so then we had time to also go to happy hours and goof around yeah it was just a fun fun time of life but like uh well they had this tool that nobody knew how to use so we ended up like building campaigns for people like and like big like quick and Loans like the Marvel movies like we did a Spider-Man movie we did The Hobbit movie but we had to come up with like the whole idea for the campaign how it was going to go out like do all the planning for it did you ever do at arb's texting text campaign no no we did Sony phones like giveway but surprised I didn't find those and somehow well there was a group of people that we hadn't gotten into text yet ours was mostly email and social based okay all of the like push notifications and such but um so we got really good at that and uh Megan and I just I I think that was a start of like a deeper friendship like we just relied on each other so much to get stuff done that it just felt fun and easy to work together and and she was that missing part of me that like that business side the details and the stuff Megan was was that and I started like I don't know if like on straa or something but I started seeing her runs and I was like hey you actually you've run pretty well like have you ever thought about doing a race and so Megan started running I'll let you tell that story your episode but at that time I was training for a 50 mile and uh but then I realized he also had this believe in the Run website on the side and I was like well you should probably have a female perspective too and so he's like yeah actually that's a really good idea that would grow the audience and then I was like well can you give me access to the back end and maybe I can set up advertising and he was like if you want to do this on your own time that's fine and I was like absolutely and so I start well not only that you were like it what really started you was you were like you get shoes for free yeah yeah I mean I feel like that's yeah and she's like can I get shoes for free yeah if you want to reach out go ahead yeah so he basically gave me an email address and then I started just reaching out to all these Brands and it like snowballed from there but I think you probably realized before me that we were spending so much time creating this content for other brands that we didn't care about it was like why don't we do this that's exactly what I had care about like in my head I was like why am I like this isn't really my job my job was to design the interface and just do the graphics MH for for these campaigns yeah which was fun I even got to do a logo for Shakira which was we were on the phone with her yeah really that's hilarious yeah um we've been on the phone with some crazy people Rose Macwan who was the guy who the guy had the triple filtered VA the rap guy oh um shoot we were on with a lot of musicians yeah a lot of rappers and H Triple filtered yeah anyway who was that and so we we were doing all that kind of stuff and I was like Megan we're pretty much the marketing department for this company why don't we just go do it for ourselves yeah I mean that makes sense so I like the thoughtful stuff that I always do just quit CU I'm like I'm done you quit but you stayed on one day a week well that was the thing no I quit so they said to me if you'll stay on one day a week we'll pay you this much okay which was probably more than Megan was Mak it was so I had to come in one day a week that's insane stupid yeah and but I was they weren't using me so like it I actually ended up quitting quitting because you would sit and I could have sat there and just collected money every Friday but I was like I want to concentrate on what I'm trying to build here can I ask you about the Boda real quick yeah I was thinking 50 Cent it wasn't 50 cent no was it oh it was P Diddy then no well tell me the parties you guys have been to uh it was it pitol no no interesting those are the those are like the main ones coming up yeah I don't think it got off the ground oh okay but um yeah so we I ended up quitting and starting big run media and Meg was in the background and she was like it wasn't never like Megan wasn't working on Big Run media but I quit and I was working on that and even to the point where I decided I didn't even want the money from um the one day week and I looked into the situation where uh a person Laura panny uh i' done a Twitter thing about running in social media and she worked at athlinks and she's like do you think he could write a guide to social media for race directors okay I'm like yeah I could do that yeah so I made a a guide to social media and as bad as my writing can be this actually came out pretty well in my head well if you remember I like we said yes and then you're like you can you you work with all these social media people you can you can figure this out and I was literally Googling stuff as I was writing stuff into this document like it was insane that we said we could do that no I I didn't think it was because I felt like we were doing all that stuff it we were not okay anyway so we we designed this beautiful guy it looked great yeah and uh she's like look I'll give you the leads anybody who downloads this I'll give you their email address okay and at this time I'm thinking I'm going to be working with Brands doing marketing for like a new balance an as6 an Adidas like brand campaigns like social media campaigns for him I'd never ever thought of races or race directors or anything like that but I was like okay I've got time right now starting the business we put it out we got all the leads back I started sending like in the back of the booklet it also said if you don't want to do this big run media can do it for you yeah and so we started getting all these leads and within three months of me leaving full-time social toaster uh I called Megan I said hey if you want to come over we have enough money now to support you and and which was crazy if you think about it now that that was the case yeah so Megan Megan came over and we started uh big run media and I was still doing believe in the run on the side and I started doing like YouTube videos just because I was like well it's Google if I put those videos on the site maybe I'll get better SEO yeah and I had decent SEO because I like at that time again there weren't a ton of right competition it wasn't that hard I just used like yast SEO to figure out the keywords and all that stuff yeah and um it was the site was doing well and at the same time we were going to a business advisor we pay I paid a guy to kind of like coach Us in starting the business and he's like what's this believe in the run and I'm like well that's actually and I start getting all excited and talking about cuz that's where my passion was mhm and me was like yeah yeah and the guy was like no how many people he's like this website traffic's pretty good he's like you guys have something here and we're like well I'm like well what do we have and he's like I don't know but like this is good and then I actually had a guy come to do the um big run media website help and he's like uh we want to work on believe in the Run not uh big run media and he's like this site's actually this is your site we're like no no no we need to focus over here still uhhuh so we kept like avoiding cuz we couldn't see a clear path to believe the Run being a revenue generator that could sustain two people or one yeah or any human being so it was great yeah we got free gear we got free stuff but it it I just didn't see we couldn't do that leap um and you know so we continue doing it always a passion project I probably spent 50% of my time on believe in the Run 50% of my time on on Big Run media uh clients and stuff like that mag was still doing reviews and stuff but I think you were definitely hyperfocused on big run at that time yeah I mean if you remember we took on way more clients than we could possibly retain and most of the people that that we worked with thought we were a team of 12 yeah everybody thought they're like how big is your team we're like ah we just would avoid that question all the time and be like yeah our team back home is great and yeah it was just us for several years and Yeah we actually had to hire our first employee because we were going to a wedding my brother's wedding in Ireland and we couldn't possibly maintain the work while we were away that was Rachel yeah um who you know cuz she was there when you got there and then uh we got fortunate enough that we every time something that was bad happened it was a good thing yeah so we ended up um moving out of the office that we were in and Robbie came on board and we talked about in Robbie's podcast how the magnetism of working on believe in the Run kind of led to that and uh like I was like oh this is fun we got I got a partner who also wants to be doing this yeah to Megan I Megan and I probably had a couple arguments about how much time that we were spending on uh believe it or not well it's hard when you're the person working on the side that creates the revenue versus the side that doesn't which is more fun yeah yeah no it makes sense I'm not judging but um yeah and you know it's been it it is also strange like the pandemic it really did change the dynamic of believe in the run it's the reason what it is today yeah I I think there's yeah certain pieces came together I think that you know certainly Robbie you coming on and and being uh a driving force in in some of the things that we're doing the fact that like we talked about that the brands didn't know really what to do during the pandemic and we were an outlet for for them uh is and I I have to say like even M Baker is I think a huge reason that you know I he took a chance on us kind of put us in a spotlight where then other people saw us and they were like hey if they're doing it with you we want to do it with you and it kind of landslide and that's even in the reviews like if we you know like if we do a a shoe review we we get all the shoes but if we do like a poll review for hiking MH 20 other poll companies will call us sunglasses yeah right yeah like we're like hey we don't nobody ever sends us sunglasses we do one sunglass review it's like Landslide of sunglasses comeing I also think though like even in earlier when we were talking about when you first started there was no one else like no other Sho reviewers no one putting out that type of content and the ones that were around at that time aren't necessarily around now and I think part of the reason believeing the run is so successful is because you've kept it alive the whole time it's been so consistent I was thinking of Robbie's um he ended his podcast with kind of like his advice which was like manifesting sort of like what you want and I I was thinking my biggest thing that I would recommend to people like this this wasn't a linear I want to do believe in the Run we do believe in the Run kind of thing it kind of hopped all over the place and we just kind of stuck with it but the main thing that I think is a value over almost everything else is consistency and like staying and true to yourself and doing the things over and over and I I especially when we started the business and there's those days where you wake up and you're like I don't know what I'm doing and I was just like just do one thing that will move the company forward just do one thing today that will move things forward and now I have a team so I forget how much like there's I think one advantage we have and this is why I love having a team so much and I I the people who are Solo doing something like what we do I don't get it because one having a team uh like Robbie's creativity and genius when it comes to writing you're like a genius when it comes to organization and business and then I feel like on the creative side I think I bring a lot of skills that way but we can flux so like if one of us is off or having a bad day or a bad week even like you are right now the other people can carry the water and it's like I feel so fortunate that we've built a team and we're expanding it even with Taylor that we have a team of people that each one is really valuable in my opinion and I look at it and I feel so fortunate to be surrounded by people that are we're all on the same Mission like sometimes I I know that we'll get irritated with each other from time to time but it's usually about something that is like a difference of opinion on how to grow believe in the run or how to solve a problem that solves a problem for beli in the Run yeah and stuff like that so like for me while yes I get you know this is like where we're getting to for me is definitely like a dream come true and to live a life that we get to live and travel and do this stuff is insane is pretty insane and like we made this there there's this job didn't exist I know that's when some people ask kind of what I do hard to describe but I do say it's like could never exist outside of whatever time frame this is right like it's impossible yeah you could CU 10 years ago you couldn't I couldn't even predict this even 10 years ago even though you had Believe it or on you couldn't actually I don't think there was a way to really make money off it at the time like even if you wanted to like I don't even if you did the same steps and everything it condensed it I don't know if you could really maybe 10 or 15 years ago but that there wasn't enough social media there wasn't enough instagam wasn't even around yeah like that wasn't a real thing that is the crazy thing about like money was never the goal yeah and I think that's the other thing that when we look at the environment and the space that we're in M with money not being the goal I see a lot of people coming into it now that money is the goal yeah and like oh for sure even if even if we didn't even if for some reason the revenue went away it'd be tough for us to pay salaries but if it went away I think in some format or another we'd still be doing what we did well that's why and I'm not like obviously we're not going to give away all the business Secrets but I would say there's plenty of times where we'll work with Brands who Runner world isn't going to work with outside isn't going to work with because they just started and they don't have a way to get in or well like if we think of Brands cool like smaller Brands I mean path projects is we've been work you've worked with them before I was there when they first started I don't think I've there's been a day that has gone by in the last year where I'm not wearing one piece of path projects between their underwear no I'm wearing them right now i' that's why I'm not so quiet the bass layer on the yeah um but they but for and there's there's just been other brands who will reach out and I'm like yeah I want to help you I don't we don't get a kickback for stuff like even the satisfy podcast that we did in uh at TR it was like yeah we just like we we that'd be cool to talk to Scott plenty of plenty of other outlets would charge whatever yeah there's a difference between I mean obviously it's a business and we have to that that but no I don't think think I don't think that's wrong I think that that we still are fans of the sport and fans of the space yeah so if there's an opportunity that arises that you know maybe it's it's with a a partner that isn't you know nor a normal person we'd work with that being a fan we're not going to turn something down if we think it's worthwhile and benefits it but it's it's both yeah obviously in a lot of cases I'd say there's certain that are paid for but it's kind of like what feels the you know I mean yeah what feels authentic what feels like the right way to approach it or the right thing to do instead of always being like certain Outlets that are milking every single drop out of something that they can yeah I don't know we don't have to talk about that yeah I guess I I say we but we do things because we like to do it and we work with people because we like to work with them it's not because you're trying to hit a revenue Mark and we don't have any investors and we don't have any uh we're not under the gun you at least not right now I mean how many things have we have you turned down we turned down that because it just didn't fit right or it wasn't uh it felt too disingenuous yeah too dising exactly well that's the thing people don't know that they don't know it but that's the the thing like we are not going to take every opportunity we're not going to take every sponsor and we're in a luxury spot that we're able to do that uh so I'm not hating on people that don't do that but but I feel like if you're in the space like right now you're saying like if you have if it's just you and your own Instagram that's a hard uh Rock it's a hard thing to draw water from and so you're you have to take things that you don't believe in to make money on there I'm sorry but you do like you just do and that I I really do feel like one of my proudest things about um believe or well there's a couple things uh and I'll wrap up because we'll probably need to wrap up but I already canceled my 1 pm because pass it I was going to say the things that I'm proud of one is that we've built a a strong team and I think that to me it's exciting that this this idea this concept was able to grow into something that could support a team of people to live and and that we're able to grow and even have like I mean we're up to seven people now that we have on payroll and not just like support them to live but like create these experiences that you'll remember forever yeah like going to the Olympics right going to Tokyo going to Paris going to Venice like those are things that I mean I never dreamed we'd ever do yeah and not not just that but obviously from the and this is something I meant to say in my podcast which I might bring up again cuz I still I felt bad about once I left because you asked me which I'll ask you too what's your favorite memory memory or if you could point to one thing what's your favorite thing about believe in the run and in my mind I was thinking business or just running experience but it's for me it's definitely the community or people because when you show up to an event and there's like 500 people there or whatever who listen a lot of people who listen to this podcast honestly it's like crazy and it's awesome meeting them running them with them just doing stuff like that but I don't for you I mean guessing I know for you it's kind of the same but well yeah before I get there the other thing that I think that I'm really proud of uh as far as what we do and I and I believe that it's again goes back to the team but we've we keep ourselves in check about our values of being authentic and there is there's nothing that's come out of here where I'm like oh that that that was gross like we we fudged a little bit or we lied yeah or we Mis like misrepresented uh to our audience like the fact that we've maintained an whether people like it our opinion or not it is our opinion we don't we've never there's no grayline in what we do I feel like to our audience we've always been honest and true and I don't think that's as easy as people especially when you're building a business I don't think it's as easy or you can say emphatically the way that I feel that we can that we have stayed true to our values to be honest and and you see us work with Brands and one of the first things we talk to the brands about is reviews aren't paid we can't accept money for reviews MH they and even if it's a shoe that you want us to be promoting with an event we're still going to write the review or talk about the shoe in the way that's authentic to us which you know it was a little nerve-wracking at first but the companies seem to understand that that's we lose our audience if we lose that Honesty with them right yeah okay so favorite memory or experience or whatever it is I I will go it might be recency bias but Robbie brought it up my head like every time that we travel I think it's even it's one thing when we go to like Boston New York or Chicago and we see a large group of people who feel like they're part of our community come out that's that's an amazing feeling um but when we've gone abroad to Tokyo or to Germany or to London and people come out because they feel connected to us that to me is super special that we're able to reach people that I never even imagined that would want to be part of our community um the other thing I love is that we rarely ask our audience for anything there's no patreon account there's no yeah uh paid subscription to our website there's no we we I think what we do is we give like we we give the reviews we give the the entertainment the podcast we don't ask you for it we'll get sponsors to help cover the cost but even when we do an event like we always want to have a piece of Swag for you or have something a thank you for being you know a for being part of our our whatever it is we're doing I feel like even our parties is like we want to give and I think that we tend to give more than we take yeah I mean it's comes out of a budget somewhere but that you know I I don't know when I look at and try to see the difference or if there's somebody that I think is a competitor and stuff I'm like are they doing what we do are they giving back to people are they providing right you know what we provide to people yeah and I don't think there is a lot lot of that out there well no I mean certainly with different places they have investors that they need to hit a bottom line or everything else and I mean not saying that the employees there don't want to do the best that they can and but you they have to work within a certain set of boundaries they only have can only do so much yeah but that's the nice thing about being completely independent by the way having a website is like a huge part of that because you get the control like that's the one thing yeah we talk about that all the time yeah I just like there's I think any other platform it's like you're really beholden to the shifting stands of whatever that Instagram's algorithm yeah if YouTube recommends your video uh I mean there's so many different factors when you don't own the platform but I also you know like I always even just forget like our emails like how much value is in that's the thing is like people don't it's just in the now nowadays people don't think about email and website but they're still the two most valuable things you have 15,000 people opening an email every week that's insane value yeah it's like straight up yeah but people don't get that and you know not sexy we took we took a risk on getting purchasing this building yeah but I you did yeah I mean you're part of the company so if I go down but uh the but this has turned out like we built a community here with the B the believe run club that meets here every Thursday which I have to say again the team carries the water on that one that's Helen and and you know Ryan to a certain degree are are pretty much you know the stewards of the Thursday night run group and keep that Community going but then when we have an event where uh sponsors wants to do something from our headquarters all those people show up because they're used to you know having that support and being part of this community so I mean it's just it to me I feel like we we are living a completely Charmed existence right now so yeah absolutely okay and future future looking what are you most excited about for 2025 oh just 2025 I thought you were going to go even deeper than that I mean if you want to I mean longterm the next 30 Years what does that look like long term I want us to to build something that there can be f us is taken care of yeah like I would love like I don't want believe in run to necessarily be just the three of us and the extended family but like I want us to bring in talent and cultivate people that are passionate about what we are and can continue and grow the business in ways that we haven't imagined the ways like if you look back from when Robbie first started with us we couldn't imagine where we are now right I mean it's insane just the difference between when you started and now um so like that's the the goal is to figure out how this grows and continues into the future so that's that's one thing that I'm excited about for the future but 2025 I am possibly committed to to a 35 mile run through the Alps and uh you know I haven't been a little scared in a while and the idea of training for a mountain uh run 35 miles after travel and all that stuff it's kind of got me excited about running again like not that I'm not excited but like I know good or bad I can run a marathon yeah uh which how many marthon have you run uh I'm I'm not exact the exact number but it's over 40 okay that's insane yeah so I kind of stopped counting I thought I was closer to 50 I think I thought so too I thought like 48 or something I think you're at 50 I I don't think so I don't know um but yeah so I want to run London well if London happens to be the marathon something ring still yeah still unsure about that but um and then uh going to shamani and uh doing the OCC race yeah it it's got me it's got me like okay I'm excited to I'm gon to have to start running the hills running the trails yeah and uh I'm like this is this will be a good uh challenge for me and then you know if that goes well I know that I'll come off the that mountain and run a fall Marathon really well yeah um that'd be awesome but uh yeah and that I guess I'm excited about even the weightlifting Journey that we're doing like to see how that affects everything did you do before picture I did all right I it's it's horrendous it's so scary um but then there's you know the personal stuff like Megan and the boys and all that stuff that you know I hope I'm hoping that 2025 is a great year for us so yeah you know definitely Theo I'll will be doing his first uh Spring Track yeah so awesome yeah cool all right all right another really long podcast for everyone hopefully you enjoyed it yep yeah I like it that's good all right thanks for coming on I blacked out during part of it I don't know I don't know what happened all right bye bye [Music] [Applause]",

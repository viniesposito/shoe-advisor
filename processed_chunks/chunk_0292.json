  "text": "good morning from Paris I am here to race the hoker city center Paris 10K heading down to start line shortly we've got the whole race is right in the Heart of the City really winding around some of the most Central parts of Paris which be very interesting it's quite a twisty course so it might not necessarily be the fastest but it should be very fun and it should be you know a really good chance to see a bit of Paris while it's running hard I had a pretty big week of marathon training with Valencia two weeks away so going to go out run as fast as I can no real expectations on time but hoping to put in a for half decent performance have a bit of fun I am testing a few bits out as always so I've got on my feet the hoker rocket X2 been a long time since I racing these shoes I've used them for some hard training runs recently and obiously they came out last year now so thought it' be the fun to put those on again as the races with hoker and try out you know what is still probably the carbon shoe I'd recommend most from their range just cuz cell X1 as much as I love it is quite a big heavy shoe and this is a bit more lightweight and racy and then on the watch front I've got the new coros Pace Pro which I am putting up against the Garment 4 a 265 the big new mid-range battle we have of AMOLED watches so going to be testing those both on what will be a very tricky course for GPS twisting around right in the Heart of the City Center and I will have the 4 a 965 in a pocket linked to a polar VAR sensor heart rate monitor so I can look at the heart rate readings on the watches as well so yeah a few to test looking forward to the race should be good fun good hit out two weeks will Valencia see where the legs are at they're quite tired is my guess but I'm hoping to have a good run and it should be really fun so all done I that went really well in the end I think I ran something like 3225 30 30 something like that like faster than I expected just first half was great controlled running on field trying not to slip over it was very wet today and um and I went through I think in around 1615 and then I thought oh I can I can give it a go here I felt quite good and I think I ran second half in not too far over 16 so I'm not sure the exact time will be but is probably my second fastest 10k so I'm very pleased cuz obviously pretty tired legs marathon training it's a pretty twisty course it was wet so it rained on the way to the course there a lot of cobbles in the first half and I'll say the poker rocket X2 as fast and great as they were today they are not the best at gripping on that kind of surface so I have to be quite careful I don't tend to slip very much because I have such a short stride but yeah it looks a bit dodgy at times so that was a bit risky and the course was really cool though it was like you're right in the center of Paris you're just winding around you're seeing lots of cool stuff quite a lot of good Runners out today so I was able to run with people the whole way pretty much and really long home straight which is kind of good and bad it's um it's just demoralizing in the first kind of like 45 seconds of a straight like that you don't look like you're getting any closer but then start to pick it up felt nice and good and um yeah delighted with that time if it is around there I'll be really pleased with that it's probably my like I say second fastest 10k fastest was recently in the river Nest 10K which has a nice downhill stretch in it which you don't get here so yeah good run around watches it's a hard course to watches so I think even probably from about second or third okay they were you know I was a few probably 50 m ahead on GPS that kind of things they were beeping early before the lap markers but not too bad overall results so I'll have a look at them in a minute and then go back and look at the GPS Trace later wasn't really using the watch as much today cuz it was it was meant to be just you know like a nice relaxing hit out kind of thing nice and controlled rocket X2 like yeah it's a shoe I've come back to a few times recently underrated a little bit probably CU it is light it's fast it's doesn't have the bouncy feeling of some of the shoes I like and I think the problem I have with it generally is that like it feels it does a similar job for me in being a lightweight pretty firm but you know responsive shoe similar to the aex Mets P like Sky Paris which I always bang on about my favorite shoe and that's just a fair bit lighter so but yeah I ran really well today and really enjoyed the shoe everything felt in good working order for Valencia put it that way but I'll go back and check heart rate and GPS on the watches I think they're both I think the choros was actually closer to the lap markers for sure than the Garmin so throughout the race that was probably the one that was definitely close then gin ended up probably 100 me further over 10K than the chorus but on try course it's hard to exactly know but all around really enjoy myself it's quite cold now I'm going to go warm up and we go from [Music] there so just back at the hotel now couple of hours after the race uh still very pleased really delighted of how that went all around like just didn't have too many expectations heading into today was careful and trying to be nice and conservative and actually was just running fast and I thought I'd be the whole way and you know picked up pretty well in the second half there I think I ran a negative split uh something like I think I think I was about 1615 1616 at the halfway mark and then did around 16 you know1 or so in the second half so yeah really pleased with that all around massive confidence boost head of Valencia in a couple of weeks to be running that kind of pace on a pretty big week all good on that front and really yeah did enjoy the race like it is a twisty course but it was probably a bit quicker than I expected there were only a couple of real dead turnarounds and the rest of the time there were some decent long straights there were lots of fast Runners there today so was able to run in pretty good groups and all that I think I was finished 11th in the end uh again very pleased with that as well picking up people in the second half I think I did quite well in moving through the field there it was probably less the course and more the slippery conditions that made it a little bit slower I think in the first half there where it was lots of Cobble stuff like I say which is just not great in Super Shoes if you're on um slippery cobal they just none of them grip that well I'd say some do better than this hoker though which is not got that like I say the best grip but performance of the shoe yeah can't really argue with it like the rocket X2 read has put H you in line with most Super Shoes out there now I think after a few years it was only kind of one or two big players now most brands have very good Super Shoes and you're kind of picking between them more on personal preference rather than anything rocket X2 is certainly really strong option I do think it is the faster shoe from hoker if you're looking between the cell and the rocket X2 like I love the cell I've done more miles in the cell than any other shoe this year I think and just using it for lots of Long training runs I have racing it as well but it's big it's bouncy but you just got a little bit more kind of rev from the rocket X2 it's lighter it feels racer and especially someone like myself I'm like a high Cadence Runner I probably don't put get as much Bounce from the Yow as some people so I prefer the lighter feel of the rocket X2 which just gives you that faster turnover and that get slightly more you fast feel especially over something like a 10K uh so yeah enjoyed that just been checking out the GPS tracks from the watches and the heart rate I do the heart rate first both do kind of okay both were kind of out by a similar amount in different directions the 4265 was quite low for lots of the race it looks like on the heart rate and then the choros pce pro a good stretch where it was in line with the heart rate monitor but then did jump quite high at the end had a little jump at the beginning really cold conditions It's just tough for optical heart rate monitoring like I would always prefer to use an armband or a chest sensor myself you see the nice steady progression in heart rate you get from that the polar sense which just a little bit more accurate but both watches were kind of okay they were you ballpark okay some dives off the Garmin and yeah like I said the big jump on the corus at the start and at the end but overall they were kind of fine I think the averages isn't that far out from overall average and they probably performed fairly similar to each other I think probably the page Pro slightly more accurate in the middle there but overall yeah similar performance on those front and then on the GPS like it's interesting that they are quite different so the choros was closer to distance of 10K you know that's good I think that you know wins out on that front for sure because I wasn't running very tight lines I was running a bit further than 10K I think that's probably the more accurate overall distance from choros there and it was certainly closer to the markers each kilometer than the Gin throughout the race look at the actual track though I don't know where Garmin has picked up so much more than the corus they do look pretty similar throughout the race like both of them have little wobbles where they go quite wide outside of a street and the Finish Line they each have you on different sides of the roads entirely which is interesting because I don't think that fairly open bit of the course so I thought they'd be quite accurate there but then they really dial in on Long stretches where clearly the GPS conditions were a bit better but for a city center race I would say pretty impressive GPS from both those watches like was following the right areas most of the time was on the road not running through too many buildings and it just looks you given the twisty nature of the course in amongst high buildings I think they both did a pretty good job overall distance corus was closer and it was certainly better for pacing I wasn't really pacing with the watching the race I will say that so although I did notice you know every lap split and then looking at the markers and seeing how close they were they were both obviously coming up a bit before the marker came around because they end up with reading a bit long but if I was going to be pacing using the watch the chorus would have be more accurate on the day between the two of them so that's a win for the chorus as well so i' say overall and accuracy they're both pretty similar but you got to give the aage to the chorus I'd say on both of those fronts uh in that race I think the heart rate was a little bit more dialed in for the middle part of the race in particular and then the overall distance and pacing the GPS was probably slightly better as well but both performed really very well I think on the accuracy front now like this mult this mid-range band of watches is kind of my favorite band of watches now we've also got the sunto races and the polar Vantage G3 where you're getting the accuracy that You' get from the top end watch is now and it's really whether you want the other features from most and watch is like the you know more rugged designs or the maps which you don't get on the Garmin but you do actually get on the coros that was interesting and it was useful for me while I was here in Paris my first run in the city I did a long run using the navigation on both watches Maps was certainly A Plus on the pace Pro here so it's had a good weekend around it's also doing very well on battery life that was the other thing so I because this was a weekend away both of these AMOLED watches it's interesting to see if they could last the full weekend away and both of them have done but the chus has lasted longer on batter life i' would say so I charged these fully on Thursday afternoon I came over Friday morning did a long run and then ran on Saturday as well have done the race now and the choros is at 58% so very good really you know looking at that kind of period like it was you know over an hour and a half of running on Friday know the hour Rod yesterday and today and the Garmin has dropped to 29% so big disparity on the battery life there so the pace bro if you're looking at kind of an AMOLED watch you go for a weekend away without taking a charger doing a lot of running it would have the edge like it was only a 10K today I was looking at something like a half marathon start to be thinking about having to charge the Garment potentially but you know it would be fine until tomorrow but yeah I'm going back today if I was going back on Monday then the extra bat life from the choros would certainly been a bit of a boon so all around a good weekend for the coros pace Pro when looking at it in comparison to the uh the biggest name in that mid-range watchfield which is the 496 265 but certainly some of other advantages to the 265 will go into in more detail when we get round to more of a comparison video but all around really enjoyable out really fun race massive field out there loads of people out there like really was quite a good atmosphere throughout the race spite the fact it was quite damp and cold at the start everyone having a good time surprisingly fast course I would say given that I thought it wasn't going to be very fast at all but you know it was quick enough I'd say you go and run hard on that like I said great atmosphere I had a really good time out there and delighted with my result on the day",

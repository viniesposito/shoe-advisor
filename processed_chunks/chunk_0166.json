  "text": "hi this is thomps with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the Run Megan is a mystery uh it used to be a mystery it's not a mystery anymore it's not a mystery anymore what is it this is the mauno Neo [Music] Zen and when we were handed this they were like hey it's a mystery shoe but even then we kind of knew what it was I don't know I kind of thought it was the Neo Vista V2 I was knew it didn't have that like Valley with a plate so and I mean we'll get into what's in there but let's start up like we normally do from the top let's talk about this upper this upper so knit uppers are always a little tricky cuz I feel like if you don't get it just right it's usually really bad but the good news is I feel like they nailed it with this one they did they got it right with a caveat so normally I'm a size 10 and a half but this time when this shoe came I got a 10 and 1/2 I felt like I had too much room up front and kind of felt a little sloppy which also affected the fit of the upper for my foot it's already a narrow foot and so when it was a little too big I had a lot of puckery and a lot of stuff going on so I asked them to send me a size down so I got a size 10 and once I did that perfect yeah so I didn't have the sizing issue that Thomas did but I'm someone who prefers a little bit more of a roomy toe box and I'd rather size up than down so I was actually okay with my true to size women 7 and A2 so this isn't a small small stack and this upper even though there's not a ton of structure to the knit it was able to hold my foot in place over the midsole just fine it has a really nice feeling around the collar there's not a ton of padding but it doesn't really need it the one thing I did notice is I much preferred when I wore a sock that was like uh higher than just a no show or ankle sock cuz I feel like this while this is soft it if it rubs you while you're out there running it can kind of create some some hot spots so I always wore a taller sock with these as far as breathability goes we have been running in cooler temps but I didn't feel like this was a upper that was too warm no I agree with you it was nice and breathable um it stretches really well I feel like overall it's very comfortable sometimes with these these knit um uppers you can get some issues with the lacing feeling like it's like cutting off the circulation on the top of your foot I had no issues with that yeah but speaking of lacing not much favorite type of lacing this ribbon lacing just doesn't feel like it holds very well it's it's light it's I I don't know I don't love the laces on this I probably would go with something I would love this if this had like that saw tooth lacing of like more of like the race day feel but this one has that slippery like not great and also lengthwise I felt like it was a little short when I was just trying to do my uh regular lace bow that I do to keep it from un tying your shoes that's it when I do do that and uh this didn't have a lot of extra room for the way I like to tie my shoes but overall very nice upper very comfortable breathable does the job fine okay so let's talk about this midsole what do we got nerz NXT or energy next all right so this is a nitrogen infused super critical TPU you sure about that I feel like that's what it said in the next sheet yeah and I don't know you can call it whatever you want it's bouncy it's soft it's fun like that's this has that F factor that we like the fun Factor the fun Factor yeah so this was actually a big surprise for me I really liked the Neo Vista but I didn't love it like a lot of people I really loved this shoe uh specifically for the midsole and how it fell out on the roads I feel like this was a bit more stable than the Neo Vista you have this wider platform um the cushioning is really soft but it also feels kind of resilient and bouncy so it was just a really nice ride very smooth transition and great for just easy Miles when you say it's more stable I think what you're hinting at is the deep valley that was in the Neo Vista kind of had you going on two rails over here and you can sometimes feel that so with this having less of that Valley it did feel a little more stable but this shoe when I tried it I was like oh Megan's going to love this because you love the soft cush this one it's it's right there at almost being too soft like it's bouncy it still feels like it gives you that energy back it doesn't feel sluggish with its softness but it is a very cushion Sous so if you like a firmer ride this isn't going to be the one for you yeah no this definitely falls into that like Max cush category where you think of that plush soft really nice um ride great for easy miles recovery days that kind of running not for your fast tempo days um maybe some long runs that are easy but I wouldn't I wouldn't be using this for Marathon specific work yeah on the long run that's where I kind of found a little flaw on it for me but before we get there we're talking about a 6 mm drop we got 40 in the heel 34 in the 4 foot plenty of cushioning plenty of protection your feet are going to feel really well protected in this shoe and when me was talking about the long run stuff when I was doing my eight mile runs in this the shoe felt fine felt great I love the way my legs fell afterwards I came back from runs and I would basically run up to Megan be like hey you got to try the shoe this is amazing it feels so good my legs feel great I really dig it the closest shoe that I can say that's kind of close to it with foam would be the Adidas Evo SL that a lot of people haven't gotten a chance to try yet but that one also has a very nice soft Landing but still with that energy return the difference one this one's slightly softer and gives a little bit more so when I was on a long run my legs were a little fatigued I was coming in it wasn't the best of runs anyway so I don't want to dock the shoe too much about it might have been more me but I just felt like that give started to like give my foot a little bit of fatigue but the traction on the bottom of the shoe yeah so there's plenty of rubber coverage on the bottom of the shoe as you can see here and they're calling it XT or X10 rubber I'm not really sure I guess it's mizuno's rubber but what's nice about this is it fully covers the bottom of the shoe but it's pretty thin in in design so you don't feel like you have this clunky rubber under foot and it just it adds nicely to this squishy softer midsole foam without taking away from it yeah I actually think it was good on the bottom of the shoe to give it a little bit of that stiffening so without the full coverage I think it would almost be a little too loose so this does a really good job there as far as confidence ran it in the rain ran it uh icy conditions wasn't like amazing in the icing conditions but it handled it as good as any rubber is going to handle that situation one other added nice feature is the sort of like it reminds me of an ortholite it's not branded ortholite but it's that kind of spongy insole we don't give enough attention to the insoles of the some of these shoes yeah so this guy is coming in at $150 and this colorway we have here is the quote mystery version so it will be coming out in more I guess standard less dots less craziness uh in the midsole ver some people are going to be upset about that they probably want the mystery look you could purchase this so it was a limited time it's I think it's still available right now for 150 bucks so you can actually get this exact one if you want it at 150 bucks this shoe fits into some of my top shoes at that price point we didn't talk about the weight my size 10 came in at 9 oz or 250 grams cheat codes over there uh my women's 7 and a half came in at 6.7 Oz or 198 G and honestly that's really nice and like for a daily trainer with all this deack yeah it definitely fits in that range under 10 oz is always what I like to see in a daily trainer if they can do it so let's get into ranking it me start off with form form out of five I'm giving this one a four um it's a good looking shoe the weight is really nice um it's not perfect you know I feel like it could the lacing could be updated and just the design is it's a little crazy all right I'm going to give it a three on form just because I think that there's some things that could be tweaked I still get some puckering in the upper I didn't love the laces and just in general I thought there's a little bit of fit issues that we could get into in the next category so let's hit fit all right I'm going to also give this one a four I know you had issues with it but I kept my original size so it it fit pretty well I feel like it's really nice wide and accommodating um my issue with fit was really around the collar and heel here where I felt like maybe there was some rubbing and a little issues there all right now this one's getting docked mostly because I had to go from my normal size 10 and 1 12 to a size 10 that's going to affect the way I feel about the shoe but going down a size to that it did fit really well so I'm not going to dock it too hard it's going to get a three still had that puckering I talked about earlier and just some general like not a as snug as I'd like around around the sides here all right the last one is function I'm going to give this one a four I'm only really knocking it because it's not the most versatile shoe in the world it's pretty soft I think it does great for Recovery runs easyday runs but if you feel like picking it up in this shoe it's not the best option I'm going to give it a four as well and it's pretty much the same reason I just fell on that longer run when I started to feel a little fatigue in the shoe I think from the way that the cushion is it made it feel like maybe the shoe should be more in the recovery shoe the daily trainer for maybe you know miles under 10 miles I don't know some people probably get it and be happy with it well over that the cushioning is there you certainly probably would take it further than I would want to take it but I just thought a little bit I want that a little maybe just a tweak more firm in the midsole than uh I was getting so that's where I'm going to give it there now with all that said I still think this is a great shoe and one of the best shoes at the price point so you're 10 out of 15 I'm 12 out of 15 but I think we'd both agree at $150 this is a really solid daily trainer and it's really nice to see this coming from mauno because I haven't been super excited about the brand in a long time and this is getting me there yeah it's definitely a shoe that you got to try if you haven't yet

  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers I am Dan Brighton today and I've just done the Brighton 10K wearing the Hilo x1's uh so I'm going to go back now to my house and I will record the rest there cuz it's a bit windy it's a bit loud um and I'll get in people's way so I will see you in bit [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I am back now and I had a Fant fantastic day out at the Brighton 10K I've done it probably I think I've done it four times now um and I really like this race it's just positioned right the perfect point of the year because a lot of people have finished the marathons that they've been training for so you have this down period where maybe you're not training for your spring Marathon yet and you don't want to do loads of long distance because you've got Bor of that by training for the Autumn marathons um it's a bit of a mix bag when it comes to weather because sometimes on the coast if you've ever been running down on the coast you'll know that uh if the weather is bad then it really affects um the time and the speed that you can run um and I've done quite a few 10K races uh around the same area as this and sometimes I get nowhere near my PB because the wind and the the rain is is just making it impossible uh but today was absolutely perfect there's a little bit of a breeze but nothing that would affect um winning a fast time and a lot of people I know who ran the race got PBS so uh it was a really good day for it um and I always think that it's a good position in the year as well because a lot of people have trained for marathons over uh the Autumn and now they still have that Fitness um but they're not tired from doing all of the longdistance training so it's a really nice opportunity to sort of use all that training that you've done um with fresh legs and start looking at some short distance PBS the course is really nice it starts at HOV Lawns you do a little Loop um the other way uh towards like shorum way um but that's only like 1 km so you do 2 km around and then it goes all the way down to Madera Drive you turn around down there and you come back dead simple it does have closed roads on some sections which is really good cuz it means you've got a lot of space sometimes when you do the races on the coast there can be sections where it's quite congested and there are a lot of people doing the race today um so with these closed Road sections it makes it really good you can go fast you can overtake people and there's not really a lot of congestion at any point um of the race it's organized by Brighton hve AC which is a great Renning Club down here in Brighton and it's really well organized so there are the the start area is fantastic you can very easily get into the area that you want to start running in there's loads of Pacers uh it's really well organized really well planned very easy to get to um and just a really well pulled together start area um there's plenty of marshals on the course but it doesn't really need that many because it's such a simple course um and it's pretty hard to go the wrong way or uh need any assistance along the way so uh well worth checking out if you're coming down to the coast or you live down here uh definitely one of my favorite short distance races um around the Brighton area just because some of them are a bit more expensive this is uh the 2024 edition cost uh 20 about \u00a325 which is really good considering you get a medal um you get to run around the central pit of Brighton that's got closed off sections you get Flap Jack water bananas other food and stuff afterwards so it's a really nice uh large scale feeling event that isn't as expensive some of the other events that you can find um in the UK um which are quite high profile so it's good event um today was I said really good weather for it sometimes you can get really lucky in Brighton and the weather conditions are absolutely perfect this is one of those days there were loads of PBS um from people who are running the race in fact I think most of the people I know that that that took part ended up getting a PB so well done to all of you guys it's also a race that attracts a lot of quite high level Runners so a lot of the running clubs take part in this it's organized by Brighton ho Athletics Club so it's uh a bit of a meeting of a lot of the running clubs in the area but also outside the area as well there were so many fast Runners at the start um but also more General Runners as well because it's a nice place to go to if you're looking to do 10K and you want to spend the rest of the day in a nice city um and see some of the sites going to have an ice cream that sort of thing so all in all it was a really good race so my performance today was actually really really good I was I was quite surprised because I went out last night uh to a gig and um I've also not done a 10k race for quite a long time so um I have no idea what my speed would be like of a 10K distance I actually expected to struggle to get um under 40 minutes for the 10K but uh I started off and I basically just went all out from from the start I almost ran a 5k PB at the 5K Mark and I just held on for the rest of the race so I ended up getting a 37 uh 45 which is um 10 seconds off my PB from last year which is on a similar course so really pleased with that because I was not expecting to have that level of speed um at the moment I actually felt pretty good by the end of it so that bodess pretty well for for Valencia uh next week um but hopefully I've got the the stamina as well as the speed as well so that I think it's going to be the stamina that lets me down during Valencia but all in all it's a really good race well worth doing uh if you're looking for a race around that time of year but also if you're just looking for a nice 10k race that um is in a location that you can come and visit and um you can spend the day there so the kit that I was testing today um I'm a bit of a late coming to this but uh recently I've been testing the Hawker cellow X1 now the reason I've been testing these is because we're doing the awards in the next few weeks and this is a shoe that um I wanted to test in order to make sure that when we did the voting on the shoes I had a good understanding of the shoe because everything I've heard about it from the rest of the testers and other people is that it's a very very good shoe and a sort of shoe that I uh would probably like um so I've used this for about 40K now um I've done a longer run in it I've done an interval session in it and now I've done a race in it and I really really liked it for the interval session and for that race um what I would say about the shoe is that it is for me it's a bit of a mix um of something like the so endorphin Elite and something a little bit um more relaxed like the most comfortable um bouncy shoe around like something like so endorphin Pro 3 which is a very natural feeling shoe very comfortable to run in uh very unobtrusive I do think this is a slightly more Awkward shoe you can really feel it pushing your foot into position it does feel a little bit more aggressive when you're running in it um but I found it absolutely fantastic on that run today uh I wasn't expecting to enjoy it that much cuz I haven't really tried that many race shoes this year that I've been really impressed with things like the Ali 3 I didn't really like and at the moment I'm trying to choose my shoe for Valencia so it's a bit of tossup at the moment but I think this is probably one of the options that I'm going to go for um for Valencia um just because I think it works very well with my running style I like the level of foam that's in here um I like the aggressiveness in it it's not too aggressive so the Endorphin Elite that shoe I got my half marathon PB in it is very aggressive it makes me run very fast but there's no way I can run a marathon in that shoe it's just too uncomfortable for my feet it just feels like it's pushing my foot into a position that I don't want it to be in um but it it does feel propulsive this feels like a slightly less versions of that so I didn't feel uncomfortable at all on the run that I did today um and I've done a longer run in it and it absolutely fine um so I think this may be the shoe for Valencia but I'm still still deciding if that's going to be the case um but over the course of that run the first 5k I did I did pretty much at my 5K pace so um I was going all out on it it felt very quick on that at that pace um really helped me pick up the pace nicely um and just felt very efficient the kind of feeling that I associate with shoes like the vaporfly 2 things like that that really just make that that fast pace feel easier and you can maintain it for long um the second half of the race which the bit I was struggling a little bit out I still managed to maintain it under 4 minute kmers um but still felt very good at that as well I definitely didn't feel like um it was a problem as I slowed down a little bit it definitely felt like I had a bit consistent propulsion in it and it was helping me just tick over U at that pace Up Until the End uh and then in the last kilometer I picked it up again and it felt really good for that as well so really impressed with this shoe off of that race um I was already quite impressed impress of it from the interval session I did it the other day but I think for race for race there I think this is a really really good option at the moment and definitely good for this the sort of running that I like to do uh when I'm racing um because I just I don't want it too aggressive but I do want to have a little bit of proportion in there that sort of forces me to to speed up as well um the other thing I'd say as well is that um it it's not unstable uh I wouldn't say it's the most stable shoe around but I didn't feel like it was necessarily unstable uh there's certain shoes like the A6 met speed Sky Paris which um I really like that shoe I was it's the other shoe that I might choose for Valencia I'm still deciding between these two um but I really like the shoe uh but it's probably a little bit more unstable feel is a little bit thinner on the feet than this shoe so there's a bit more to this shoe and if feels a little bit wider so um big fan of this shoe from that from that run looking forward to doing some more runs in it and then maybe using it for blena the other thing I tested today which uh I really liked is these monkey socks now we talked about monkey socks on the channel before um and they're in um some of the guides that we've done over the past few months um and I've I've only just got around to to giving them a test uh and they're really really nice they just have a really um a good level of padding in them they do feel quite padded uh but when you're wearing them with a race shoe they don't feel really thick so I do have some running socks that I would never wear with a shoe like the uh cellow X1 because it's really hard to get the clo X1 on it's a very tight fitting shoe um so it once you've got it on but it's hard to get it on um and if I was wearing really really thick padded socks I think I'd struggle even more um so this these socks are they just a really good balance really uh I know these haven't been opened yet I I put my other ones in the wash um but these they just a really good balance they they've got padding in them they feel very comfortable to wear but they also feel lean enough to wear with with ra shoes and things like that as well uh they also I like the design of them don't normally talk about the design of things but I do like the design of these quite a lot so um yeah big fan of these monkey socks um and looking forward to using them more okay so that's it from me from the Brighton 10K thanks a lot for watching don't forget to like subscribe click that little bell and big thanks to all the people that came up to me and talked about the channel uh it was really nice to meet you all and talk about your race I think some of you did quite good times today as well so congratulations to all of you who who came to speak to me um right I will catch you later [Music]",

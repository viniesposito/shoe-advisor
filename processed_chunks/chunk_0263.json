  "text": "hey Tommy from the r testers in this video we are going to be reviewing the aex Nova blast 5 let's take a [Music] look the aex Nova blast 5 cost \u00a3 135 or $140 it weighs 256 G or 9 oz for men in a size 8 and the drop is 8 mm the as6 NOA blast 5 continues the popular daily shoe line with the new FF blast Max Midol foam designed to be softer and bouncier while still retaining the same weight as the Nova blast 4 the shoe features a new jacked mesh upper instead of the previous woven material used in the Nova blast 4 the aim being to improve the fit and ensure a good level of breathability there's a similar trampoline inspired outsole to previous versions to improve comfort and covering that is a healthy layer of rubber for grip and protection it comes the fit of the ASX nose blast 5 as I've had no problems at all with my normal running shoe size got a uk9 here which is a us10 that's the size I've used across asx's range for many years and I've used for every single version of the over blast and yeah no problems at all fits me very well enough room in the toe box good hold around the heeler midfoot nice comfortable heel design that doesn't irritate my achilles and holds the heal in place so yeah no problems at all with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size in testing I ran in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half in the ax no blast 5 and I found the fit nice and secure in the heel but very roomy with decent wiggle in the toe box this is an area fit I think in the no blast 4 but there is good hold across the midfoot i' largely a secure heel and unless you like your shoes very snug I'd recommend going true to size I personally like the room that you get up into this kind of for foot in the toe boox it opens up the potential to use this shoe for longer haul mileage Ultras that kind of thing so I really like a spacious toe box so fit for me has been spot on in the Nova blast 5 no issues report in my running time I would say there's very much hallmarked of the previous over blast shoes here I think particularly in the toebox where it's kind of you know roomy without feeling overly generous not too short similar level of padding in the hill collar the kind of you know similar tongue the lacing is all very kind of close to the previous Nova blast shoes I think the biggest takeaway for me is that the the way the upper feels around your feet I think on the NOA blast 5 it definitely is gear to feeling a little bit more snug and a little bit more comfortable and you know compared to the overlast 4 which I think you know sits a little bit closer particularly the middle section of that shoe and I think that's something that I've noticed has it kind of radically changed my experience of the shoe not necessarily but I do think if you are looking for a more comfortable feeling upper and fit and I think that's what the no blast 5 is going to get you my biggest takeaway though is that for me it does feel like a true to size shoe and it has felt like you know going the same size as previous shoes has worked well for me in the Nova blast 5 fit for me in the Nova blast 5 I'm a size8 in the UK this is a size eight uh found you you're very comfortable um it's plenty of width to it um didn't find it in any way restrictive um I've got fairly average width foot so I don't tend to have problems with the width of shoes but there definitely felt a little bit more on the forgiving side uh there's plenty of space in the forefoot um for me it's probably a little bit too much space I like it to be a little bit more restrictive in the forefoot um but for most people it's probably that sort of thumbs width that you want um before the big toe so I would stay to my size in these shoes there's also plenty of padding I like the upper it's quite comfortable quite forgiving there's a bit Flex to it all in all a very comfortable solid shoe that I would stay to my size in now I've run a good 50 km in the ASX Nova blast 5 in testing and I've used them for all kinds of runs from the slowest easiest of recovery miles up to faster pce efforts basically I've tested the full gamut from easy to close to top speed in the shoe I've also been using it a lot alongside the ax super blast two which has been a really interesting comparison to put these two side by side because it's an argument to say can this be a cheaper super blast now I've had a flip-flopping relationship with the ASX NOA blast over the generations as it's moved from soft to firmer I like the Nova blast 4 snappier ride that was slightly more dense underf foot than the softer cushioned NOA blast 3s which felt a bit sluggish to me at times now the changes to the four gave the Nova blast some faster Pace potential I think with the new flight foam blast Max phone you're getting in the Nova blast 5 I think we're back to being slightly softer again though with a touch more bounc and I think that depends really on when you're Landing with the shoe as well now I'm a bit torn with the Nova blast 5 because it offers a nice smooth ride that responds well on toe off and feels springy but controlled when you're feeling good running with good form and pushing the pace I think the no blast 5 feels energetic but it's also cushioned enough to accommodate slower Paces though sometimes on heavier legs I think it can feel a bit soggy I've had slow runs or at least runs where I felt tired where the softness certainly in a sort of slower Pace form makes it feel like the shoe is working against me somewhat and then I've had these runs where I'm full of energy running in good form you know I'm on it really working off the forefoot where the over blast 5 has felt more smooth and energetic and not a million miles off the performance of the super Blast 2 that's kind of cruising Pace particularly now I want to say that it works better when I'm moving at faster Pace but the reality is I think it kind of feeds back better underf foot when you're running well so not just fast but moving with kind of good form and good energy on runs where I've been heavy and sluggish it almost amplifies that kind of heavy and sluggish feel as well now those where I felt light and Lively it kind of gives that back on the foot I think you get a familiar overlast feel overall there's still a lot of shoe though it does run quite light for the heft that you're getting for that big stack that you've got here it's a bit roomier than NOA blast 4 up front but I like that the protection and cushioning is great there's a wide reliable platform to run off and loads of comfort and though I sometimes feel like I have to work harder I think is a very capable cushioned option I can happily long call easy paac and overlast 5 I also plan to Marathon test T it at some point to see if this would make a good reliable race day shoe for people who just want to get round a marathon with guaranteed comfort and just a little bit of energy so in terms of my running time with the NOA blast 5 I've done well over 50k in this shoe and it definitely has been a very easy shoe to take over the running mileage and that's really what the NOA blast is about it's a daily trainer you know a shoe for kind of really getting through that kind of weekly mileage and I definitely would say that this is a shoe that is capable still of doing that I think my biggest question mark definitely from my first run in this shoe is well my experience would be replicated throughout my running time in that first run it was a really bouncy Lively enjoyable shoe something that I saw in the Nova Blast 3 but wasn't really replicated throughout my running time in the no Blast 3 I think the no blast 4 was a very different proposition to the three I really like that shoe I thought it was a very versatile shoe particularly had a more uptempo Edge to it compared to previous Nova blast shoes now with the Nova blast 5 there definitely is a radical change here particularly with that midsole from the nol 4 the 5 it's just a lot and you get a little bit more resistance from the mids overlast 5 I think that really kind of Echoes what I've seen in my running time now after that first run I did a longer run in this shoe and I didn't have that same kind of bouncy Lively feeling from that midso was definitely soft definitely comfortable I definitely felt like I could roll through very nicely in this shoe it's been a shoe it's been a long time since I've had a shoe where I've had such an IND different experience from you know a run to run and that's definitely been what I've seen in the Nova blast 5 what I really wanted to see was how it would handle some kind of faster running TI actually took this to the track I used it with the Nova blast 4 I um had a kind of a longer session I kind of spit the session half was in the Nova blast 5 the second half was in the no blast 4 now these you know the biggest thing to takeway for me is that it could handle some kind of more uptempo time it definitely felt a lot softer under the foot compared to the Nova blast 5 which I kind of like that kind of slightly firmer feel to it where you know it's not overly firmed it does feel a little bit more responsive and that's kind of what I in that track session it felt a little bit more at home you know at that kind of slightly faster Pace would it be something that I use out for all out running absolutely not that's really not what the Nova blast is about but I do feel like maybe it's lost something from that kind of more temper ede that we got in the Nova blast 4 but has it got that same versatility about it compared to the previous you I'm not entirely sure it's maybe kind of moved slightly close to things like the GEL Nimbus I think from a kind of durability point of view I still think it's going to be a very doable shoe I think probably more so than previous shoes there's a lot of rubber here you know it might not be in in the center of the shoe but on the outside the shoe there's a lot of rubber and I'm not seeing a whole lot of wear I said over 50k in this shoe there's no real kind of signs of kind of wear and that's kind of what you'd expect to see from an over blast is it a better shoe than the no blast what I think it's a different shoe and that's kind of been my experience but it is a good shoe and I do think it's another kind of NOA blast that is going to sit well on that kind of daily trainer range is it the best one out there I'll get into that in my verdict so the Nova blast is a really interesting line of shoes it it changes quite a lot with each version of the shoe uh and sometimes I really like it sometimes I'm not a fan of it um I was a pretty big fan of the no blast 4 I think it's a really good versatile shoe I think it's really good for going to those faster sessions uh but also you can do easier stuff in it as well but really the midle in the no blast 4 I just thought was very good at being a little bit more responsive uh and it was a great all around shoe if you're looking to buy one shoe and you want to do training in it you can racing it if you wanted to if you weren't going for like a sub three marathon time or something like that it's a really good solid allr rounder shoe NOA blast 5 um when I first put it on I really like this shoe um I like soft shoes I like bouncy shoes if you know watch the channel you know that I talk about that quite a lot um and this midsole this this new um FF blast Max midsole that you get in it it's definitely softer than the Nova blast 4 when I put them on I really thought wow this is great this is reminded me of the Nova Blast One no blast mod is probably my favorite of the Nova blasts because it just got the right balance between softness and bounce um with this shoe definitely sof in the no blast 4 and the first run I did in it I thought I got a lot of bounce off of it I was really enjoying that run since then I've done another four runs in this shoe and that's varied between faster efforts um couple of easy runs and an interval session um in in it and it's been a bit hit and miss for me this shoe really um I think it really comes down to the fact that I'm it it by making it softer uh it does make it better for easy runs um if you're not really trying to pick up a pace or anything like that um but it's also lost a bit of that faster training as well so the Nova blast 4 really did a good job at that it wasn't the the fastest training shoe out there but it's really good sort of balance if you're looking for a one shoe that fits all sort of running shoe um but the no blast 5 sort of loses that a bit um what I found on some of the runs especially when I was trying to maintain a faster pace uh in it is that it felt a little bit sluggish for me on a couple of the runs not a bad shoe for those for for those sorts of sessions um but it definitely just didn't feel like a shoe that I wanted to pick the pace up in it felt like it was more designed for the easier sessions than picking up the pace um and as a result I've not really enjoyed it as much as I did the Nova blast 4 um just because I think it's not quite it's a difficult shoe to really really work out what the the benefits are um when you pick up the pace in the shoe you do get nice bit of softness in it but it seems to to dull the effect for me a little bit you're not really getting the the pickup that you're getting in the Nova blast 4 uh because that us is a little bit more responsive it's a bit firmer in the midsole but it's still got a big stack of midsole in so it's still relatively um you still got a good level of cushioning in it but with this CU that that move towards a softer foam um it does feel like you you lose a bit of energy um when when you're running in it easy sessions absolutely fine no issues at all you don't really get the Bounce from it but it's a very comfortable shoe so um it's not it's not giving you lots back but it is very comfortable to wear for those sessions faster sessions as I say it really saps your energy a little bit and you don't get loads back um when you really want it so I have enjoyed testing this shoe um I think uh it's a tricky shoe up when it's up against other trainers of a similar style because as an allrounder sort of daily trainer um it's now for me sits more into that cushion daily trainer realm where it's just a little bit more comfortable a little bit softer to tick off the miles in whereas the No 4 was a lot more versatile so you could do a lot more in it um I do think the Mido is um very comfortable uh definitely feels nice on certain types of runs um and overall I would say that it's a solid oround um daily shoe I just I just think that it's it's minimized its um selling points based on how good the four was running at faster pace so I've done around 55 60k in the aex no blast 5 using it for a nice mix of General daily training runs you know one slightly faster run but mostly pretty easy runs progression runs that kind of thing and it's done a really good job I've enjoyed running in it pretty much every time I have I do think it's a really strong option as a daily trainer for me the no blast 5 is kind of the equivalent for aex to shoes like the Nike Pegasus the scky ride the H of Clifton pum velocity Nitro shoes that are designed to appeal to a really broad range of Runners be pretty versatile shoes add a pretty good price and I think it does that job really well all of all those shoes I just mentioned I think the Nova blast 5 is probably the standout one I'd recommend to lots of people as a shoe that's unlikely to offend them in any way and actually probably a shoe that most people will enjoy quite a lot you got a lot of cushioning here you know as much as any real max cushion shoe and it does protect the legs really nicely but it doesn't really give you that big clunky feeling that you get with some very cushion shoes like it feels protective but it still feels quite Nimble lightweight like it's got enough width there to be quite stable I've really noticed how stable the shoe is actually CU it's a shoe I've been using whilst recovering from a twisted ankle a sprained ankle so I've been a bit worried about stability and it has felt you know nice and secure under the foot yeah protective level of foam there but it's got a really smooth ride I think with the redesign heel on the latest version I have noticed that as a heel Striker it just Smooths out the ride a little bit and just means you can tick over really nicely and get all that enjoyable cushioning underfoot without it feeling too big or stodgy on the foot I've mostly been using it for easy mileage like I say I do think that's where it excels like it is a reasonably versatile shoe I did like kind of a steady 10K in it and that kind of thing but I'd prefer personally to be like a lighter shoe or more purpose built fast shoe myself at any kind of fast runs but you know it has a little bit of Versatility there but I don't think you're getting a really responsive ride from this midell like the foam is you know quite well balanced it's not giving you a load of sinking and bounce or you really fiery poppy feeling off the foref foot there you know just feels like a more of a comfort Focus shoe which is how I would use it myself but the ride is certainly quite smooth and you can up the pace in it a little bit it's quite similar to the aex nose blast 4 in that regards and I think where the Pham isn't necessarily giving you a whole load of kind of response but you are getting a nice smooth ride and you know a platform you can push against and run a bit quicker if you like I think the ride is a bit smoother than on the over blast 4 myself just because of that redesign heel like that's probably the main change I've noticed between them I don't don't think it's a huge step up really overall in performance or anything like that but do think you get a slightly smoother feeling from the heel and it does I think disappear on the foot as a result of that so like I say it's got loads of cushioning here as much as Max cushion shoes but it doesn't feel like a big shoe or a block at the end of your foot there it just feels you know quite natural and it does tick over quite nicely what it doesn't do though I think and this is relates to versatility is compete with the you know really impressive kind of lightweight daily trainers that are on the market at the moment things like the New Balance Rebel V4 the Hoka Max 6 maybe this new Addis Adis ZL we haven't tested yet but yeah it's not really built for that those are probably purpose built to be a bit faster and they end up being very good daily Trainers for someone like myself who likes that more lightweight feeling that they have there still quite a lot of cushioning there I do think they're greaters the no blast is more at the very cushion daily trainer end of things I would say but it certainly has more versatility than a lot of the max cushion shoes out there while still providing a lot of protection on the foot as well so my v on the ASX NOA blast 5 is that this feels like another good installment for the Nova blast range it still is for me a very good kind of daily training shoe a shoe that you definitely can spend a lot of time in it's going to feel very comfortable very solid very consistent um is it going to be that you know the same shoes in no Blast for I don't think it is I think if you like the idea of a softer feeling more comfortable feeling Nova blast and that's what you're going to get here if you're looking for That Bouncy livelier kind of more excitable feeling of those early Nova blast shoes I think there's aspects of it but I don't quite feel like it for me it's delivered that um and I feel it's somewhere between the kind of Nova Blast 3 and the Nova blast 4 um and yeah I think it is a good daily training shoe a good shoe for kind of ticking off that mileage is it the my favorite Nova blast shoe I still think I would prefer getting the Nova Blast for if I wanted a shoe that could do a little bit more um so yeah I think you know the Nova blast 5 a different Nova blast I think maybe Nova blast that a lot more people are going to appreciate so I think about the other shoes that I probably put or sit in the same category as the asex Nova blast 5 I think you've got things like the Brooks Max the Haw Max 6 you got the new B reble V4 the cheaper pum ly Nitro 3 you could probably put the N convincible 3 in there as well I think compared to the Gin Max I really like the Mido on the Gin Max I you know I think it's a bouncier feeling to me I prefer the ride in general but is it as versatile as the NOA blast 5 possibly not I think the Max 6 is probably the shoe I probably Veer to which I think you know works at kind of easier more Tempo Paces can work really well for longer runs Maybe isn't as plush as the NOA blast 5 but I think that's a very solid shoe at a slightly similar price the new B Ro 4 definitely feels better at faster Paces is it a better longer run shoe than the Nova blast 5 possibly not the P velocity Nitro 3 is a very versatile shoe again not as plush as the Nova blast 5 but really feels good across a mixture of Paces has a really good outsole as well on that shoe and the night convincible 3 not a shoe that I've absolutely love but it has that kind of bouncy Lively ride made not as stable as the Nova blast 5 can be a good long run shoe and the the zumex midell fs you know very Lively probably a lot more lively than the one for me personally compared to the Nova blast 5 so I do think it sits well with those shoes they are definitely shoes that I've mentioned that I'd probably pick the Nova blast 5 over is it the kind of Stand Out option at that price point and for that similar kind of category of cushion daily trainer um possibly not but I do think it's you know in good company with those other shoes so my verdict I think you probably guessed from what I said in the run test uh I I like the no blast 5 I think it is a solid all round shoe that veers towards the easier sessions the midell fo is much more conducive to easier runs com comfortable daily runs that sort of thing than the faster efforts now uh I don't think it's a shoe that is really particularly well designed for faster sessions Tempo efforts interval sessions things like that it's more like the Nova Blast 3 for me it's a bit of a balance between the Nova Blast 3 and the Nova blast 4 I think it's it's trying to do the Comfort side it's trying to do the softer side but it's also trying to be versatile as well and I don't think it does the versatility that well I think it's it's more of a daily cushion shoe now um problem is that no blast 4 was a very versatile shoe and um you could buy it and do a lot of your training in it with this I think it's now going up against easy day shoes and there are lots of really good easy day shoes out there I think it is a very good easyday shoe but um I don't think it's one of the best out there for the price it's actually still pretty good if you compare it with some some of the other um easy day shoes out there things like the ax gel nimbers maxed stack shoes like the Brooks L Max things like that those are shoes that are firmly designed for comfort and cushioning and they do it very well they probably do it a bit better than this because they're not trying to be really versatile they're trying to do cushioning and comfort really well whereas this is trying to do a bit of both and I don't think it quite gets the um The Versatile faster side of the training but I do think it's a solid comfortable shoe I think most people will be happy with this as their sort of recovery easy run shoe daily shoe K ticking off the miles it's very comfortable to run in I've had no issues in it I just think that the Nova blast 4 just had a little bit more to it and that responsive mid cell phone just meant that you could use it a lot more um than this shoe cuz I'm I'm unlikely to take this shoe out a lot if I'm doing faster sessions intervals tempos things like that so I think the aex no blast 5 is a really good shoe and a standout in its category like I say of those generalist daily trainers that every brand has in their lineup I think this is the one that stands out the most for me it's good value it's comfortable it's got a little bit of versatility it ticks over nicely I think it will suit a lot of Runners really well and it's one that I imagine I'll be recommending to lots of Runners going forward and know if they're looking for just a new Runner looking for a shoe to do everything in or a runner who just wants to add a pretty cushioned but not too heavy shoe to their rotation I think the NOA blast 5 fits the bill really well and does it at a pretty good price I think terms of value you can certainly look at the aex no blast 4 like I slightly prefer the ride of the five myself because of that slightly more smooth feeling I get from the Hillel but even if you are a hill Striker the no blast 4 is a really good shoe one I enjoyed running in I think it's available in sales quite a lot at the moment with the five coming out so I think I'd probably look at that first I don't think the change in foam here has given you a huge new feeling under foot it's still a pretty similar shoe and a really good shoe but nobl 4 is also a really good shoe and does the same kind of job and then comparing it to some of the shoes I've mentioned already I think you've got a couple of higher drop options if you prefer that in a shoe things like the Puma velocity Nitro 3 in particular which is also a fair bit cheaper really good daily trainer it's got a narrower design and you know has that more traditional snap through ride with a higher drop you got a slightly more rocket feeling with the nose Blast for sure but the Nitro 3 is a really good shoe Pegasus 41 is similar I think of those I'd get the pum I think it's better than the Pegasus myself it's just lighter and has a bit more kind of response but the Pegasus is maybe a bit more stable I think no blast 5 would be my pick of those shoes myself because I like the slightly more rocked ride you have here which is probably a bit more similar to something like the sakon ride but I prefer the feeling of the aex no blast 5 to the sakon ride 17 you've got denser feeling foam with the rid a heavier shoe I don't find it as versatile as the no blast and I like the slightly lighter livelier feel I get from the no blast comparing it to that shoe if you want a lower drop shoe with a more of a rocker in this category the hoker Clifton 9 is a really good shoe it's again not the most exciting shoe in the world but it does a really nice job of rolling you through your stride and is reasonably versatile as a daily trainer as well it's quite similar I think to the New Balance 1080 v14 a shoe I did really enjoy testing this year I felt like they performed quite similarly for me and having quite fairly rocked and soft but not overly soft or rocked rid you know nice well balanced ride and both shoes disappeared on the foot quite well while still being really cushioned no blast 5 is a bit cheaper though so I go for that ahead of the New Balance myself I don't think there's I don't really think there's a compelling reason to pay the extra money to get the New Balance 1080 v14 myself and then the aexs lineup you've got a couple of shoes you can compare it to like there is the GEL Nimbus line the GEL Nimbus 26 which is pitched more as the premium cushion shoe but I would always get the nose blast over the Gel Nimbus it's lighter it feels just as cushioned and comfortable to me it's easier to run in at any Pace just it ticks over a bit more smoothly so yeah I prefer it to the gel nimas for sure you know that and the Kano have wider bases they're maybe a bit more stable and protective if you are a newer Runner or heavier Runner than me maybe but no blast 5 I think does a really good job for the same kind of runs it's cheaper lighter bit more fun to run in there is the atic super Blast 2 as well which is a big step up in price and you are getting a step up in performance if you look at the super Blast 2 which is certainly a more versatile shoe a better shoe when you're running fast much livelier ride but you're paying a lot more money for that shoe you know if you're getting one shoe to do everything in the super blast is probably worth paying the extra for but if you're looking to add like you know a fairly lightweight and verstile daily trainer to your lineup and already have maybe a more speed Focus shoe to use with it the no blast 5 is better Val and it's probably the one I'd get there but yeah super blast is a great shoe but maybe a slight different category for me to the NOA blast so overall did really enjoy running the NOA blast 5 I think it's a really solid shoe one that will work for lots of Runners it's not necessarily one that's going to blow you away when you're run in it it's probably not as exciting a ride even as the original Nova blast but it's one that now is very well balanced and will work for lots of Runners verdict then and for me there's still classic Nova blast DNA here though the new softer phone means that you've maybe lost a bit of that very top speed potential that made the over Blast for arguably a better all round that said I still think this is a very competent utility shoe that can eat a lot of training miles even with the extra softness as a versatility here that puts an overlast five into a group of excellent allr rounders that can cope with most of your daily training needs particularly when you're out there feeling strong I think now it's not a million miles off the super Blast 2 in those conditions and for some people it may well suffice as a more affordable alternative to Super Blast 2 what you getting now is a daily trainer that's super comfortable super plush Super controlled nice and roomy that has a mid PAC sweet spot with some potential for cruising a little bit faster but only when you're feeling at it it's not as good as the super last 2 it's not quite packing The Punchy ride but at $140 \u00a3 135 I think it represents pretty good value this is another of those shoes I think you could buy to cover a lot of your marathon training runs that's it from us on this review of the Nova blast 5 thanks a lot for

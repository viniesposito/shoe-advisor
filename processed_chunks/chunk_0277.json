  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers and to our multi-tester review of the new polar Vantage M3 this is the latest mid-range running watch to get a smartwatch style AMOLED touchcreen it packs dual frequency GPS you've got offline maps an ECG sensor and a comprehensive Suite of polar's training performance and health tools we've had the Vantage M3 on test for a while now and in this video we're ready to give you our verdict so in the next 15 minutes we'll share what we love what's not so good where this watch fits into the busy running watch landscape and give our thoughts on whether it's worth 349 of your hard earned pounds so let's get into it things have moved on a lot since the launch of the original M400 about 10 years ago polar has improved the design of its watches beyond recognition now the polar Vantage M3 follows the Vantage V3 as a good-look polar watch with more subtle styling that fits better into daily life the features in the polar Vantage M3 are exactly the same as you'll get on the Advantage V3 and the polar grit X2 Pro so if you're choosing between these watches from Polar it's now going to come down to a few factors design so size looks and styling durability battery life plus how they perform the hero on the Polar Vantage M3 is the new bright color Smartwatch style 1.28 in Amal display that brings a nicely responsive touchcreen to the m models for the first time the Gorilla Glass 3 display is slightly smaller than you'll get on the grit X2 Pro and the Vantage V3 and doesn't offer the scratch resist istance of the sapphire crystal screens that you'll get on pricey watches like the grit X2 Pro however that screen here on the M3 is brighter it's 1,500 nits compared to the 150 that you get on the X2 Pro and the V3 now the Vantage M3 comes in at 12 mm thick 44 Ms in diameter weighs in at 53 G that's smaller thinner and lighter than the Vantage M2 and the Vantage V3 with plastic front and back casings and a steel bezel those are pretty standard materials on mid-range watch but it comes with two sizes of standard 22 mil silicone swappable bands Hardware wise you get the same sensor Suite is the Vantage V3 in the grit X2 Pro that includes dual frequency GPS and the latest polar Elixir bio sensing Tech which combines polar's Gen 4 Optical heart rate sensors with wrist ECG there's also a skin temperature sensor and spo2 blood oxygen sensor on battery life the polar Vantage M3 offers 30 hours in performance mode 70 hours in eco mode and 7 Days in Smartwatch mode that's slightly shorter than the gr X2 Pro and Advantage V3 but the same as you'll find on the Polar Pacer Pro and the older polar Vantage M2 now the M3 also has a bigger memory and faster processor it's waterproof to 50 m which is the same as the V3 but the G X2 Pro is good to 100 m price-wise at launch and based on RP the polar Vantage M3 lands at \u00a3349 or just shy $400 in the US in polar's lineup it drops in between the polar P pro at 299 pound or 32995 in the US and the polar Vantage V3 at 519 or \u00a3599 in the US in the increasingly fiercely contested AMOLED packing mid-range it's up against simly priced watches like the coros pace pro at 349 in both us and pounds and the sunto race s at 325 in the UK or 449 in the US but it undercuts the price your gin 4 and a 265 which has a RRP of 4299 99 in the UK and $449 in the US though that has been on deal for Black Friday recently polar Vantage M3 offers 150 sport modes including multiport mode and all the familiar training and health tools that you'll get on the grit X2 Pro and the V3 that includes training load Pro nightly recharge recovery sleep tracking Boost from sleep score fit spark workout recommendations that are BAS on your recovery fuel-wise fueling support there are also at rest Fitness tests and performance testing for running cycling and walking now the M3 is built on the same software platform as the Vantage V3 and the gr X2 Pro so there's the capability to roll all new features across all three watches and new features that come down in high watches to this maps and navigation smarts are also the same as the G X2 Pro and the V3 including full color offline maps with pre-installed maps for the US and Europe with other regions available to download for free there's commute compatible routing plus rout guidance back to start and trackback features beline navigation to points of interest is coming in an update down the line not there yet when it comes to Smartwatch smarts the polar Advantage M3 is more limited than the Garmin 4 a 265 there's basic notifications but no contactless payments you've got music controls but no offline music or streaming support for Spotify [Music] Etc comes to my likes for the polar Advantage M3 uh the first one is definitely the design I think it's a really nice screen this watch I do like polar's AMOLED they feel very close to the top of the glass there and they really pop and they're very bright and engaging and I think that's the same with the Vantage M3 as it was with the Vantage V3 or the git X2 Pro it's just yeah it's a really nice screen it's very clear to read in all conditions bright sunlight or tree cover or inside and yeah it's done really well I think the design overall is pretty nice as well it's got that nice kind of metal bezel to it it feels fairly premium for a mid-range watch and what I don't love about how thick it is compared to other watches in this area like the Cor Pace Pro or the Garmin 4 and a 265 like it was a comfortable watch for me to wear for the most part occasionally it stuck out a little bit too much at night but overall yeah really nice design all around I'd say I also a big fan of the fact that polar brought maps to this watch like that is a key selling point and a mid-range watch these days with the choros pace Pro offering it the sunto race s and it's kind of a differentiator with the Garmin 4 a265 the maps are easy to get onto the watch they're easy to follow and just makes life a bit easier to follow routes on a map I find compared to using a break crumb Trail and yeah they're nicely done on the Polar Vantage M3 the GPS is has also been a plus point for me so po had some teething difficulties with its dual band watches and like the ignite series when it got the Dual Band GPS but it's really sort it out with the Vantage V3 the grid X2 Pro and now the Vantage M3 I've been testing it against the chorus Pace Pro the Garmin for 265 the GMA 4 and a 955 throughout testing and in jaw band mode yeah the polar has been very close to all those watches they've all been delivering really reliable tracks no concerns at all about the GPS accuracy on this watch and the pacing has been nice and consistent on the runs for me as well so yeah all around you know lots of key areas very well executed on this watch I would say so in terms of things I've liked about the polar Vantage M I think the first thing I'll start about with is obviously the screen and I think that's a really obviously the big deal here is an AMOLED display that we're getting on the advantage M3 which is a big upgrade from the memory and pixel display that we got on Advantage M2 now it's not just about having the Amo display I think it's also having about a screen that really kind of fills that case as well too that was really my kind of major issue from a design point of view with the Vantage M2 is that you had that screen and while could you know generally be forgiving about having a memory pixel display because they're still good displays ultimately I just felt that it was more bezel than there was screen and that definitely has been addressed on the Vantage M3 what you get is a very nice bright vibrant Amo display one that you can keep on at all times as well too I think the other thing obviously very important is that kind of core kind of tracking experience and I'm mainly talking about the GPS performance obvious you're getting that dual frequency GPS um support here which polar has kind of rolled out on its watches already if you're looking for a polar watch that has that kind of strong GPS performance that's kind of what I've seen in my tests and I've been using them against other kind of dual bands kind of um watches from Garmin and from tto and from corus as well too and it's very much held up very well in those tests and I think if you're looking for strong GPS performance that's kind of what I've seen here from my time with Advantage M3 I think another thing obviously is battery life and that is a big kind of consideration here when you are having an AMOLED display the AMOLED display is going to drain a battery life quicker than a memory and pixel display that's to be you know expected um I think for me I think I've had this is the best experience I've had from a battery life point of view from a polar watch with an amalo display I think that has been with the alwayson display with the kind of raise to wake and I've used a mixture of both I think from a GPS um tracking point of view and obviously in that mode you even when you're using that best best accuracy mode you can also you know keep the screen on all times so you can choose to use a race tow in that kind of tracking mode and for me in general it's been a lot better than my experience with other polar watches I haven't seen the drain in the same way I've seen on other polar AMOLED display watches I definitely found it's been a lot more reliable and consistent a bit more in keeping with the numbers that kind of polar recommends basically and you know while I have probably been charging it more than other watches in and around this price range I think ultimately I've been very happy with the performance that I've got from The Polar varm 3 another thing for me would be the mapping you know it's not the most detailed Rich kind of offline mapping But ultimately is there it's there there on a cheaper Polar watch I think that's really important again this is really to do with the fact that what else is happening around the Vantage M3 you know and all those other watches are getting that kind of free offline mapping support at this price and now polar has it as well too and it's a good experience overall maybe isn't the most detailed level of mapping and navigation support but the maps are pretty easy to kind of view you can see that kind of detail you can differentiate different elements in maps and ultimately it's a good addition to the vage empath 3 so a lot of positives there with my time the Vantage M3 definitely a lot of things I think that are a big upgrade from the Vantage M2 um and almost feels like a different watch ultimately so kicking off with the first of my likes then and the first thing is the screen I found the AMOLED bright and Punchy a definite upgrade on the M2 easy to read in all conditions the touch screen is Snappy and responsive I really like the fact that rais to wake was also quick to respond which meant I could switch off the always on making it easier to eek out more staying power out of the battery life now the Vantage M3 isn't as good looking as the aluminium Vantage V 3 but it avoids feeling or looking too cheap I think the Vantage M3 beats the more plastic choros Pace proon looks and I found the Vantage M3 light and Compact and comfortable on the wrist this is a pretty easy watch to wear 247 though I desperately want Polar to offer a nylon strap to really boost that comfort and second for me is the GPS when it comes to GPS the polar avantage M3 dual frequency performed really well for me it struggled a little bit in tree cover but at times it handled tricky under passes here in London better than the Garmin Fe Phoenix 8 and I saw nothing that troubled me in my tests and one of my regular 10 km runs that mix London streets with River paths and its most accurate mode up against the Dual frequency packing Garmin Phoenix a AMOLED a much pricier watch and the Apple watch Ultra T watch that actually is really well known for being good on the GPS accuracy the Vantage M3 was really good on the overall distance the Phoenix 8 loged 6.4 miles the Apple watch Ultra 2 logged 6.36 mil in Advantage M3 came in at 6.39 mil and my final like and I'm going to put this in the pros column even though the battery life performance was a bit mixed at times but in my tests I ran through two full to dead Cycles with one the always on screen on one using the raise to wake with always on I got around five days usage on a single charge that included just half an hour of GPS training in that test and hours max accuracy performance mode with always on used around 4% with the screen on the Polar Vantage M3 is a thirsty beast overnight though it watched at an average of 11% whilst I slept that's not far off the burn rate of the Apple Watch series 10 and it does let it down a bit with rais to wake that dropped to 7% or less and I got around six days of General usage with 6 hours of GPS training and four hours of heart rate cardio training thrown which is pretty good A 4-Hour marathon in Max accuracy performance mode raise to wake and using Maps burn 20% the upshot for hourong GPS training efforts the polar Advantage M3 is not quite as good but for me is a fair close match on battery life for the coros pace Pro and the sunto race s and generally speaking I think you're getting good battery life here for an AMOLED watch moving on to the things that weren't so good Nao Vantage g3's Optical heart rate performance was a bit more hit and miss for me on one 2 and a half mile easy run the M3 went High early and stayed High I had some easy runs where it was a good match for the chest trap during another interval session it registered all the efforts quite a lot higher than the chest strap it was better on the progression run with just the odd Spike so what you're getting here from the optical is a bit of a mixed bag but you know I think that's pretty standard for me when it comes to Optical performance maybe it was just slightly worse than some of the other watches now another thing that I'm not keen on at all is the low battery life shut down one important thing to note is that polar's devices start to lock certain features where the battery drops below 10% for example you can't start a workout at 9% so in reality you're only accessing around 90% of the battery capacity that's not the case on other watches that let you risk it when the battery drops low I get why po might be doing this but it does cut short the time you've got until you have to charge again now when it comes to Smart Watch tools polar is also a Stell a long way behind Garmin and nowhere near sport capable dedicated SmartWatches like the Apple Watch series 10 the polar Vantage M3 smarts are limited to notifications from a connected phone and music controls there's no offline music storage or Spotify dieser uh support like you'll find on the Garmin 4 265 and the choros pace Pro there's also no no NFC payments or app store if you're looking for a more complete balance of sports tracking and Smartwatch capability the Gin 4 and a 265 is maybe a better bet and for more Smartwatch smarts with your running tools the Apple Watch series 10 is worth a consideration if that's something that you're prioritizing it's all of dislikes and the heart rate monitoring for me has just not been very good like it's been notably worse than other watches even at this time of year it's a bit cold and you know lots of watches start to struggle with an optical heart rate when it gets a bit cold but the polar has been worse for me than the other watches I've been wearing at a similar time like cor Pace bro and those Gins I mentioned it just just tends to go on a little W normally if a watch goes wrong for me it's cuz it's locking onto my Cadence but the Vantage M3 just seems to go quite high but not too high occasionally it will do really well on heart rate but yeah for a lot of the time it's been a bit sporadic on heart rate and I would definitely pair an external sensor with this watch like different people will have different results with Optical heart rate moners and watches but yeah for me it has been notably wrong on most of my runs which is not something I experien so much these days like not generally a huge fan of optical heart rate tracking but actually lots of the watches I've been testing recently been pretty good for most of my runs but that hasn't been the case for me with the Fant gem 3 next dislike is kind of General usability I think polar needs to improve its user interface a little bit there's lots of just mild annoyances there's not that many nice watch faces there's lots of little things I find that make it a slightly more annoying or tricky watch to use day to-day than the other watches in its area things like the Garmin and the chorus which have I think slightly better user interfaces obviously you get used to it but there are things that are just quite annoying so on some menus you can go up to go all the way to the bottom of the list again but then you click through to another menu and you can't do that and if I change from miles to kilometers which I do quite a lot I then have to go into the app to change the automatic lap distance for runs and yeah things like that it's a bit disconnected and it's something that's been you know a bit of a problem for a long time but po hasn't really gone out of its way to fix any of those kind of minor issues and you can only have four data fields on a on a run as well again like everyone will offer at least five or six these days so yeah there's a few things that PO could I think solve quite quickly with like a small software update but they haven't done it for a long time and you know I think other brands can release more software updates quicker than polar and fix a lot of these little minor things that people complain about so I'm hoping that is something they will get to sorting out also say the training analysis is a bit limited on the watch again just looking at the other brands in this area a lot of the negatives with this watch are not really that negative it's just that other brands are offering a bit more at the same price or less you're getting a lot more detailed kind of training analysis graphs over the last week and you do get the information on the polo you can obviously dive into more detail on the web app or the phone app but you know could all be on the watch again it's some where the polar has had it the same way for a very long time and I think they could probably push it on a bit and improve the experience on the watch a little bit also had some issues with sleep tracking on the watch I find with polar if I wake up for any length of time in the night you know even if it's just like 20 or 30 minutes it will only track one period of sleep so if I go to sleep and then at 1:00 a.m.",

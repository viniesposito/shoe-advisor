  "text": "this is the Nike zoomfly version 6 Nike's latest hybrid training and racing shoe there's so much hype around the shoe with some bold claims about the substantial improvements versus the outgoing version 5 version 5 was a flop for so many Runners overweight bulky and slow and Nike have really been losing the ground in this super trainer segment with other brands really upping their game recently but in comes the zoomfly version 6 at a competitive price big updates and a bold redesign as well so is it a return to form for zoomfly or are Nike going to miss the Mark again well I'm really excited to bring you this video now before we start I bought this shoe 100% with my own money as we do with everything here on the channel to give you my completely unbiased and honest review thank you so much to everyone that likes and shares our videos and also check out my website benp parks.com where you can find awesome training plans new technical te's the best running hats anywhere

Zoom Flight version 6 going through all the differences between this and the outgoing version 5 we'll put up what the version 5 looks like up on the screen now as you can see there's been some big design changes here version 5 had that recycled Zoom X foam and an Eva blend in there but now we've got a ful length slab of Nike's Flagship Zoom X foam with an EVA foam underneath it a really nice update we've got a completely redesign upper to the shoe here as well it's now 10% lighter the version 5 was so overweight it really was quite a heavy shoe and we've now also got a slightly higher stack height a little bit more foam underneath the shoe to increase that puppiness that responsiveness but it's also unfortunately 10 SS more expensive right let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like this this is your everyday race shoe there a Shoe that is designed to get your key Training workouts in and also that one that you can rock up to a race and feel like you've got a really good shoe on the bottom of your feet pricewise this shoe sent me back \u00a355 ordering off the Nike website here in the UK 42 mm tack height so just above that legal limit not that that worries the vast majority of Runners they've got an 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise this is coming for me at 322 G in my UK size 12 the zoomfly 5 was 359 G per meter 37 G decrease around about 10% lighter the upper of the shoe we've got two layers of a woven mesh really hugs the top of the foot really nicely it's partly gusseted and the tongue is stitched slightly into the upper but it really does hold in place really quite nicely ly midsole wise on top here we've got a layer of Nike's Zoom X Flagship peber based midsole stupidly not where it says zoomx where it says zoomx on the shoe that is where we have Nike's sro2 EVA foam which is a lot more hardwearing a lot more durable not quite as bouncy and Poppy so we got the poppy responsiveness in the zoomx on the top and then that durability with the EVA foam on the bottom there a really nice mix of the two we've got Nike's carbon fiber fly plate sandwich between those two Foams outsole wise we've got a rubber waffle type outsole here a big chunk of rubber at the front of the shoe here and also two sections at the back of the shoe there for the heel Strikers really great for some winter grip there are no different widths available at the moment but there's a surprising amount of width in this shoe so if you are a runner with slightly wider feet you don't need to worry about this one there are different men's and women's versions available personally I quite like this black colorway and really nice pairing it with my all new longsleeve technical running tea available on Ben parks.com perfect for that autum and winter training as I said feel free to use code YouTube 10 I went for the exactly the same size as I've going in for the alphafly and also the Pegasus turbo and the regular Pegasus all fitting very very similarly right let's get stck into all of my likes my first like with this shoe it has a brilliant comfort and speed ratio the heel counter at the back of the shoe it's got a good amount of padding for that really nice lockdown no issues at all with any slippage no blisters no hot spots the foot felt really secure and there's no need for any heel lock lacing or anything like that the plate that you get in the Zoom Flight isn't super stiff like the plate you get in the vapor or the Ally the zoomly is a lot softer and a lot bouncier but not quite all out as fast and stiff as you get in the VAP and the alphafly the plate gives a lot of stability with the shoe but also a good amount of speed in there as well I've been really surprised at the relative effort levels versus the pace I'm getting out of the shoe it's just going a lot faster than the effort I'm putting in so I've been really pleasantly surprised and also think with the Comfort levels that this shoe is delivering it's also going to be a really good option for those long runs picking up the pace marathon pace blocks some easy Pace blocks or just a shoe that you can wear for a very long time during your marathon training coming on to my second Point here I did allude to it a little bit in the first one but it's just a surprisingly quick shoe the weight decrease here has been significant and it's very much welcomed it's always a big tick in my book the weight feels now right for this type of shoe The Rocker gives a lovely feeling through the footstrike and leads to a super smooth turnover as well here and I actually found myself looking forward to the next rep some of these reps I'm doing on the screen these were around about 3 mid 325 km pace so quite fast reps here and I was like bring on the next one I've really been enjoying picking up the pace in the shoe the midsole mashup is really responsive and you can cruise for a long time whatever Pace you want to go at you can just dial it in and the shoe just goes out there and it gets it done my final like with the shoe is the value not only the price but it appears to be very wellb built it doesn't necessarily look like the best quality shoe in the world but so far it looks really durable really feel like it's been put together very well I'm just not sure I love the upper material here but it works well it just doesn't look quite right to me but it's performing really quite nicely it may get a little bit hot in the summer but how we are here in the winter the air flow through is actually quite nice carbon plates at this price point are really quite hard to find but at this sort of price point Nike have delivered a really competitively priced shoe and it's 1010 cheaper than the Pegasus plus and that doesn't have a plate and for the vast majority of people they're going to get a lot more value out of this cheaper zoomfly version 6 it's a lot more versatile pick up the paast a little bit better it's going to look after your legs a little bit better as well and all right it's a lot faster shoe but it's not all smiles here as always on the channel a couple of dislikes to take you through here the first one being in typical Nike sort of style it's a little bit noisy a lot of you have commented on my Instagram when I put some shorter form content up about the shoe so far it's just something to note this waffle outsole grip is really good when I've been testing it out in slightly wet conditions with some some leaves and things around to have absolutely no issues with any sort of slippage or anything like that so a great winter training option but just to note it is a little bit on the noisy side it's not very necessarily Slappy at all just a little bit loud and my second dislike with this shoe again it hasn't really affected me but the rear stability of the shoe might put off some heel Strikers if you are striking at the back of the shoe it's just going to be a little bit unstable through the foot strike again I'm a midfoot striker so it's been absolutely fine for me but maybe something to consider right let's bring this all together with some conclusions and my final thoughts do I recommend the Nike Zoom 5 version 6 very much so it's been a really good update so well done from Nike finally delivering a shoe that's nice and lightweight it's responsive it's affordable and it's comfortable as well and it'll be really good for a lot of Runners so is it worth the upgrade a million times yes this is light and day better than the outgoing model still if you really like the outgoing model you're like should I buy this it's all quite different I really think you would one thing that was quite good on the outgoing model is it was particularly good Sho for some heavier Runners there's a lot of protection Beneath Your Feet here you've still got that here but it's just a nice lighter weight package but it's not going to bottom out so it's going to be a really good option if you were someone that liked the version 5 and it can also Cruise along at that Tempo that nice steady Pace as well so who should be buying a shoe like this anyone really looking for that Do-it all shoe with a car carbon plate that wants and also longlasting highly durable race shoe that doesn't want to go out there completely breaking the bank I think a lot of people will get some serious value out of a shoe like this people might think of themselves as maybe more of a mid Packer running isn't their entire life they don't want to spend \u00a3280 buying an alphafly only then have to pair it with another shoe before they know it they're spending \u00a3500 thinking this running sport is really not as cheap as it could be they could get something like this it's not going to have that all out performance of an alpha fly or vapor fly but it's going to do pretty damn well and at this price point this could be a really good one doit all shoe that can really pick up the pace next week we've got a video coming up all about the best race day shoes for regular Runners and I'm sure this is going to fit you in there so get subscribed for that that is coming up very soon so check out this video up here for our full 2024 Nike lineup and check out this video down here if you want to see the full review of the Pegasus plus thanks so much guys for following along let me know

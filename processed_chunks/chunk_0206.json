  "text": "hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the Run we got a treat for you today today we are talking about the Nike vomero [Music] 18 what's interesting about this shoe is that now the vomero just isn't the vomero it's going to be the vomo the Vero plus and the vomero premium we've gotten a chance to look at the other two we can't show them to you but you should be excited and what I find really interesting about this shoe lineup now is that the vomero kind of waffled sometimes sometimes it felt like the Pegasus plus where it was like a builtup pegasus and other times it seemed like they were trying to go for the max cushion and kind of missing the mark but now they've like dialed it in Megan and what is the vomero going to be it is now the max cushion shoe of the lineup which is very exciting for me cuz I love a Max cushion shoe and it it feels like the Romero finally found its place in the world it did and I actually appreciate what Nike's doing with the three columns it'll be interesting to see how those shoes not only line up but how consumers respond to it yeah so Within These lineups which is the vomero the Pegasus and the structure this they're calling it The Icon the vomero 18 is the one we're going to talk about today let's go through like we normally do and break it down from top to bottom and let's start with this upper yeah so you have a new engineered mesh here and they've added a bit bit more padding to all of the right places so the tongue the collar all around here so the steping feel of this shoe just feels really nice and plush I mean that's it it's you're going for comfort and cushion this upper has it I felt it was true to size I had plenty of room for my toes my feet I didn't have the problem that I've been having in a lot of shoes lately where the volume is too much in the shoe this one feels like it's accommodating but also didn't feel baggy on the foot I think that's cuz there's lots of padding in the tongue padding in the heel counter and around the collar it just gave a really nice fit true to size yeah and I typically find that Nikes run a little bit narrow but for this model I felt like it accommodated my wide foot fine and even in the forf foot I felt like there was plenty of room for my toes display so fit really well for me as well I mean that's impressive when it can fit your foot and my foot and we both like it just fine so let's move down to the secret sauce M what do we got here in this midsole so a couple different Foams here and for starters we said max cushion shoe because it got more foam Under Foot so 6 mm more overall so you've got 46 millim in the heel now we're talking real max Kush and is a 10mm drop so 36 in the 4 foot yep so right beneath the foot you have a layer of zoomx which is as we all know the stuff they put in their race day shoes the most bouncy most responsive and then beneath that you have the react X foam which I really enjoyed in this model we had a kushlan I think in the previous version and I feel like now you really get that softer but responsive ride that I was craving from the last version it's kind of interesting because you can look it on the back it indicates where the react X is and where the uh zoomx is zoomx really does give you that nice plush Landing it's normally like what we expect from it in the shoe is to give you that bounce and that Airy pop coming through your stride and then the nice thing about the react X is it does provide a pretty stable ride yeah below that on this outsole you have plenty of of rubber coverage and they have this very iconic to Nike waffle lug pattern here and so I was a little worried that maybe there was so much rubber it would feel a little bit blocky a little bit clunky but out on the roads I felt like transition wise it was really nice and smooth yeah I would agree it's a smooth feeling underfoot I'd give that back to the foam again that feeling that you have when you land with that zoomx just kind of softens the blow and then it just rolls and the shape is held by the react X the heel I don't heel strike but I did find that it it almost feels a little bit like a stability shoe where I felt like I was getting guidance through my uh stride so I do think this could be for somebody who wants light stability this could be a shoe that they could turn to yeah and I feel that way sort of about most Nike shoes while this is considered a neutral daily trainer I feel like there's just more structure and support in general to the shoe whether that's in the upper or beneath the foot it just feels more like a quote stability shoe does rather than a than a neutral shoe even though it is for the neutral Runner now Meg one thing that's kind of crazy about this and I don't know if I'm taking crazy pills or if it's just happening that all the shoe companies are just saying screw it when it comes to weight this isn't a light fella and the thing about it is normally like a year ago or so maybe it's the Foams I'm thinking maybe it's the you know the energy return you get from the Foams but up until now like if a shoe was over 11 oz I was just like not even going to consider it I didn't weigh this before I ran in it because I'm trying to get used to the fact like what does the shoe feel like rather than the you know going right off of the weight this one weighs 11.7 o or 332 G for my size 10 and 1 12 yeah so uh mine was also heavy uh it weighed 8.65 o for my women's 7 and A2 which again I think because we are getting used to these Brands making these super trainers where there's a lot of tech there's plates there's overlays there's all sorts of stuff going on that we're just maybe getting used to a bit of a heavier shoe I also think the weight distribution has a lot to do with it so because this shoe doesn't feel super bottom heavy because some of the weight is coming from the structure and support in the upper it feels like it's well distributed so I don't feel like the weight really like you feel it out on the roads I don't think you do but here's where I did feel it when I took the shoe off and went to uh like a uptempo shoe or a lighter shoe I was like wow this feels a lot faster that may be a good or bad thing maybe you train in a shoe like this and then race a feel so fast that you get that extra boost it's almost like holding back on the caffeine and then taking caffeine you like Skyrocket through the sky yeah but I have to say it does affect the way that I'm going to rank the shoe for function just because as a heavier shoe I wouldn't use it for as many things as I would a shoe that was like a little more middle weight I think this achieves what they're trying to do with the max cushion comfort feel it does feel great on the runs most of my runs were around eight miles in this shoe and I didn't have any wasn't like at the end of the run I was like ah I feel this like weight at the bottom of my shoe the shoe still feels great I'm going to again attribute that maybe to the uh energy return from the Foams yeah um I think my longest run in this was probably 10 maybe 12 miles and I thought it felt great throughout I do feel like this is one of those shoes that you can probably do some longer runs and then all of your easy day training definitely this would be a great shoe for I don't know that I would pick this for going out for a tempo run or any sort of speed work but everything else I think this does a pretty good job of covering but you brought up the function so let's go ahead and give our point system so out of five for form fit and function okay form what do you give it three and a half I'm going to give it a 3.52 I think that the weight plays into that a little bit kind of knocking it down I think the look of the shoe is great everything else is pretty dialed in and intended for what they're looking for all right fit out of five uh it's a really good fit I'm going to give it a four on fit yeah I went 4.5 I feel like it's it's one of the more accommodating Nikes I've ever put on my feet and I just think this addition of the padding around the collar and tongue just it's a nice feeling shoe yeah I mean this is one of those shoes if I was just going to wear around casually it just feels good it's everything's right about the upper there's no puckering it's good all right and function out of five I'm going to give it this where I'm going to dock it a little bit I'm going to give it a three on function just because I don't think it's a versatile shoe I think that it functions for what they wanted to which is a well cushion so it's not like a bad shoe but if I was looking for one shoe that I could do all my training in this wouldn't be it yeah I'm going to go with a four because I do feel like I could do the long runs the easy runs most of most of my runs except for the speed work in it so yeah I'm going to give this one four out of five all right so that gives me a 10 and 1 half and me a 12 all right so that's it for the vomero 18 Megan anything else you want to add um yeah so this is actually coming out in February of 2025 and it will be $150

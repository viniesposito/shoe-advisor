  "text": "hey this is Taylor with cing the run and I'm here with Nick product line manager at Brooks trail running um I do want to say we're getting to the end of the year 2024 was a big year for Brooks lot of great product and we're seeing an update to some of the favorites um already so this is exciting like Brooks getting on a roll it's going to keep on rolling what do you have for us well I'm glad that you said that because we're definitely seeing a lot of changes in our Trail line we're going to continue to push continue to to to really push the throttle we want to keep innovating we want to keep bringing our best Technologies best midso Foams into the shoes and you're definitely seeing that in 25 you're going to keep seeing it in 26 so we want to make sure that people are going out having a really really great time on the trail staying out longer better cushion more protection under feet great stability great all the things that Runner Runners need so they're not thinking about the shoes they're kind of thinking about the Run Okay so the first really really fun one that we have is the Catamount 4 this is a big update to the three so the three used DNA flash V1 with a sky Vault plate that was co- molded which means it's a very thin and flexible plate for rock protection that's inside the midso foam but we wanted to do was maintain all that really responsive py uphill drive all the stability and that stable ride going downhill but we wanted to push the turbo button on Flats so we took a little inspiration from our our road Elite carbon shoes this is a full length inject Ed pack renew plate that is curved so it starts in the middle and then it curves down with DNA flash V2 which is super light super fast super responsive and that is going to give more propulsion more Speedy more py faster but maintaining the same weight and maintains the same price which is going to be really really great for a lot of runers so what is the price what is the we can you give us all the specs on it yeah the weight is 9 uh 6 oz you're going to get a stack of 3428 total we're adding 2 mm of extra cushion underfoot and the price is and exactly and then you're also uh see be 170 so keeping in a really really accessible fun price range for a lot of people to really enjoy but our athletes have been running in it they've been racing in it they ran CCC at UTMB we've had athletes at uh across the globe great results and they've been loving it well and and this one is Market as racer we talk about it as a racer but for us we with V3 and V2 we found that it was a great allaround shoe too do what you recommend it for that just like daily training even but if you want that faster clip lighter feel this is great it to us it resembles the Hyperion line on the road side correct and so obvious inspiration but it's the same last same fit as a Hyperion same offset as many of our Hyperion mainly the same foam is our hyperian but we're building it strictly for trail and so when we kind of work these things out for trail one of the cool things about Sky plate is that it's three pronged in the back here and then it's two pronged so that's going to offer more adaptability more flexibility it's going to maintain that really stable ride on trail awesome and and what's the lug depth on these this is 3.5 mm lug depth of Trail TCH green which is our branded outs soole rubber super super sticky traction on wet Rock particularly but really works amazing on dry dirt and all terrains yeah I mean I can't think of a more exciting update so far and like maintaining some of the things we loved about it so awesome yeah so Catamount four what's next four so I want to talk about the Caldera next because this is our Max Kush Max Comfort shoe is from the Calera 7 to the 8 we're maintaining the same midsole so the stack height is going to be 38.5 32.5 this is for DNA Loft version 3 plush soft Comfort adaptable grippy traction and on the upper we're using this really really cool materialization called tpe so we use TPU these thermoplastic unit kind of um protection toe guards right it's for durability it's for protection A supplier found a way to weave it into fiber form and so we had it in the Catamount 2 3 the Caldera 7 we love this materialization so we're just evolving it making it better and better it is hydrophobic it's abrasion resistant it's super high durable High protection but you're maintaining all that breathability all the comfort that you need in exactly and from a technical standpoint of like that's what's providing a lot of the next to skin comfort and we know in trail we need that durability to hold that fo a lot more soly you're going to a lot of really rugged places you don't want the shoe to break down in 100 miles we want to increase that durability and that materialization is going to be in the Calera and the catam sweet that's awesome and does the weight anything change weight stack anything on this one maintains the same also yeah awesome okay thank you and what's Price Point again 150 okay very reasonable for sure okay so this is our spring 25 line so really amazing update that we are going to on the Cascadian 19 this has been around 19 years yeah 19 years and I mean we just talked about it on a podcast but like this is the shoe that kind of set the landscape for modern day trail rad If we're honest and so like what's similar from the first days what's different from the first days what's the update all about this is I will say quantifiably subjectively objectively from testing from perception from our athletes from Runners it's the best cascading we've ever done so this is the fastest we've pushed an innovation into this shoe it's $150 Workhorse all Trail shoe all we've tested in every region that we can possibly think of in the world to really maintain it's stability it's protection it's grip traction but you're getting all the Comfort all the all the the fun goodies of a work course Trail shoe so big changes is we're finally bringing DNA Loft version three midsole uh nitrogen injected midsole compound we're going to a 6mm offset so we're adding 4 mm of cushion in the forefoot 2 mm of cushion in the heel you're getting a soft smooth super comfortable ride but we have this trail adap system technology this was in the Cascadia 17 and 18 and we're improving this in a drastic way so previous cascadas you had to kind of glue two pieces of midsole foam together you have a plate in between we found a way to co- mold the plate into the foaming process so no more Glu no more stiffness it's super flexible but you still have that that prong flexible ballistic Rock Shield that's going to protect you in all the areas that you needed underneath the shoe so that trail adap system what that is is a middle loaded plate it is a widen base and it's all these really great Flex Groves that's going to adapt and morph to all different Trail terrains man Cascadia get new life this it's a big one goes from like this has been doing really well in lifestyle you guys have been doing really well doing really great with hikers recently through hikers but to see like it's getting the Run treatment for sure that's exciting you're going to immediately notice the comfort that stable ride all the really goodies right when you put your foot in cool thanks I mean this is exciting for 2025 for Brooks keeping the pedal going oh yeah that's awesome thank just wait until 2026 too here we go yeah first h",

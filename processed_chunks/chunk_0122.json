  "text": "the running shoe market is packed with options these days the shoes for every different type of run Racing shoes long run shoes speed session shoes recovery Run shoes you name it the manufacturers are making it and while the manufacturers are loving all of these different types of shoes because they're persuading us to go out there and buy these massive shoe rotations for some people it's just not possible or even necessary they just want that one shoe to do it all so if that's you you're after a single pair of running shoes that can handle just about everything pretty well then you're in the right place I'm going be breaking down my top picks for those daily running shoes shoes that are reliable versatile comfortable shoes that you can go for an easy jogging pick up the pacing and even get on the start line of a race if you want to I've got eight shoes to take you through here across four different price categories there's going to be something here for everybody and I'll give you my favorite one at the end of the video so stay tuned for that as always here on the channel I bought all of these shoes 100% with my own money to give you that completely honest

be completely unbiased and unsponsored right let's get stuck into all of the shoes now we're going to be starting out with the cheapest going to the most expensive the first one being that sub 120 category starting out with the Adidas SL 2 priz VI the Adidas SL2 sent me back \u00a310 stack kite 36 mil and a 9 mm drop Weight Wise a lovely 287 G for me in my UK size 12 which was a little bit too small so I'd recommend if you're looking at this shoe going half a size up the midso we've got a layer of that lovely Light Strike Pro which is aded as most premium foam and that's sandwiched between two layers of the Light Strike 2.0 for that durability to make the shoe last that little bit longer and there's no plate of any description in this shoe as I said sizing wise these do run a little bit small so I'd say go half a size up I got my normal size and they were kind of okay but if I was going back for another pair I would go half a size up right let's start out with my lights with the shoe it's super lightweight it's Snappy and it's fun as well the midsole offers a really engaging ride in the shoe it's got a really good turn of speed for something at this price point that's pretty much unheard of of course it's not as fast as a shoe with the plates and the rods and things like that in but it really does well regardless of that and at this price point it's fantastic I really like the Foams they've used in the shoe as well sandwiching that Durable foam in between a layer of that really nice lightweight engaging soft springy responsive foam in there as well I'm not quite sure why Adidas have done this because one of their very cheapest shoes really is one of their absolute standout successes of the year in my opinion he've also got really good durability with the shoe and it's also been really versatile the outso grip was fantastic when I tested this so a good winter running option with my dislikes to the shoe as always it's not all smiles if you do have wide feet this is probably going to be one to miss Adidas shoes generally are on the narrow side and this one is especially narrow unfortunately also on the dislikes it might be just a little bit too soft for some people and it's not the best in the corners a little bit unstable because it's so narrow there but overall a really fantastic value show out there one I'd wholeheartedly recommend for getting the majority of your runs done really well but price is a really big factor in your buying decisions and I've got another one coming up now which is the Puma velocity Nitro 3 price-wise this sent me back \u00a3110 now you can usually find this one a little bit cheaper stack outut of the back 36 mil 10 mm drop overall Weight Wise a little bit heavier than the ads one there 336 G for me in my UK size 12 which was true to size here midso wise we've got pummer standard entry level foam they're Nitro foam and there's no carbon plate in this shoe and underneath we've got the pummer grip which is fantastic one of the best grip out SES in the running shoe market out there brilliant in the winter especially as conditions turn a little bit wet likes wise with this shoe it's really comfortable the Nitro foam is fun and bouncy really versatile and feels happy at all different paces and different distances as well especially in the long run as I said great grip in all weathers with this shoe one of the best out there regardless of the price so a good solid winter option dislikes wise with this shoe again like the ad shoe it's a little bit on the narrow side not as bad as the adash Sho so it will be okay for the majority of people they did used to make a wide version maybe you can find it but I can't find it out there for sale anywhere at the moment but overall it's a shoe that is massively underpriced in my opinion if you can pick up a pair at RP or even cheaper ideally then you're going to be getting a really good solid daily shoe it's just a little bit firmer than the Adidas shoe so some people might like that so if you like a soft squishy shoe at this price point go for the Adidas if you like your ride a little bit firmer feel a little bit more of the ground then go for the pumer right let's move up a little bit in price now \u00a310 to150 at this point we're going to be getting some higher quality Foams durability is going to be a little bit better and we're going to start to see some rods and plates appear in some of these more expensive shoes but not with the first one which is the aex Nova blast version 4 no plates and rods in this shoe just a classic all round training shoe price-wise this sent me back \u00a3135 stack cut at the back 41 mm a lot more foam underneath our feet here at this price point 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise 300 G not too bad for that amount of foam Mido wise we've got the FF plus Ecco plus cushioning sizing wise I'd recommend just going half a size down in the shoe from your regular one right let's start out with my lights it's a great balance of light cushioned and also responsive while being super comfortable as well just a lovely allaround package good width in the shoe as well and you can also pick up the pace really nicely in the shoe and run a long way in it it's good for those marathon training long runs it's a perfect shoe for anyone that's just starting to take their running a little bit more seriously and you don't have any of the fancy Tech the rods and the plates and that all of that stuff in there you're not sure how that's going to go and this is a really good option and get a nice standard training shoe dislikes wise the wet grip isn't fantastic in this shoe now they do make a TR or a trail version of this shoe for very light Trail runs it's exactly the same shoe just a different grip on the bottom but overall the Nova blast 4 is a super versatile shoe at a really great price point probably the most comfortable shoe here on the whole list and it's probably the shoe I find myself recommending more than any other to new Runners people getting into the sport just looking for a nice standard daily shoe to get a lot of their runs done well now I said at this price point we're going to start to get some rods and plates and that's what we're getting with the Adidas Boston 12 using Adidas's energy rod technology these glass fiber infus energy rods that run throughout the shoe this shoe sent me back \u00a340 stack out at the back 38 mm for a 7 mm drop overall Weight Wise a little bit more than the Nova blast probably because of those rods inside the shoe there 318 G for me in my UK size 12 sizing wise the shoe was a little bit too big for me I wish I'd gone half a size down I did order my usual size 12 it's strange with with the first adid Das shoe it was a little bit too small then this one's a little bit too big I wish manufactur would get this right across their whole range but just with the lack of padding at the back of the shoe just had a little bit too much space around my ankle anyway let's start out with the likes here it's a really grippy shoe we've now seeing Adidas's Continental grip out so Continental they do make car ties but they also make the grip on the bottom of a lot of Adidas shoes as well fantastic for wet weather probably the best option out there for grip on the bottom of their shoe maybe there s the pummer grip I know it's a real tossup between them but they're both fan fantastic it really delivers a fun and engaging ride and really happy to be picking up the pace feels like you spent a lot more than 140 lb the stability is much improved versus the outgoing model and you really notice it especially in the cornering just got that nice slightly wider base and you can feel this in the upper as well it's a really accommodating upper amazing for Adidas which always do tend to run a little bit on the narrow side this shoe has got a good amount of space this is a shoe that I could really see someone standing up to the S line of a 5K 10K right up to a marathon at distance in this shoe and feel like they've got a good shoe on their feet for running this race they don't need a full out Flagship carbon racing shoe it also feels really nice and lightweight on the foot as well really helps to get that leg turnover going really nicely but also a good amount of cushioning that will help you in those longer runs dislikes wise for me it's all about the back of the shoe here just minimal padding for me it didn't really give me any issues I didn't get any heel slip but I have been reading about a few people having some heel step issues you can always go for that heel lock lacing get a better lock down with the shoe as well but it's just something to be aware of for me I just like a little bit more padding at the back of the shoe but verdict overall if you someone that likes a little bit more of an assisted feeling a little bit more Tech in their shoe wants to pick up the pace a little bit more than something like the Boston 12 would be a really good option it's not as comfortable as the Nova blast but it can go a little bit faster than the Nova blast now interestingly Adidas are about to drop the Adidas Evo SL the much more afford able option of their Flagship Pro Evo which was way over \u00a3400 now they're dropping this new this lightweight daily speed shoe for round about that \u00a3130 price point I'm going to get my order in at the end of this week so get subscribed on the channel really interesting shoe review coming up there in a few weeks right we're going to be spending a little bit more money now in the \u00a3 150 to2 200 price bracket we're getting some even more premium materials and generally a better quality of product that should last a little bit longer starting out we're going to be having chat about this the Nike Pegasus plus this set me back \u00a365 stack cut at the back 36 mil 10 mm drop overall Weight Wise 3133 G for me in my UK size 12 which was true to size for me mid wise we've got a full length of Nike's Flagship Zoom X foam here their premium foam which we see in the likes of the vaporfly and the apperly they're all out super shoes and there's no plate in this shoe likes wise it's just a really versatile fun foam a lot of people me included just absolutely love Nike zoomx foam and it delivers a really fun engaging bouncy soft ride here and this shoe can do all of those runs pretty well those easy runs speed work Tempo longer runs it looks good too I've been wearing this shoe casually on my travels recently as well it's kind of shoe you can go around the shops go to the gym go for running and it's also Head and Shoulders much much better than Nike's standard Pegasus shoe so it's really definitely worth paying that a little bit more to get the Pegasus plus dislikes wise it is a little bit on the firm side it's a little bit more of the kind of ride would be expected from a few years ago I quite like it but not everybody will you've got that lower stack height more of a traditional feeling on the road as well but for some people they're not going to be fans of all this Mac stck height shoe with the plates and the rods in there this is a nice traditional type feeling shoe bit of a more old school running shoe with that very high quality foam but if if you'd like a plate in your shoe at this price point then have a look at the socony speed version 4 very nice lightweight speed SL daily shoe option out there stack C at the back 36 mm for an 8 mm drop overall just 285 G for me in my UK size 12 midso wise we've got the power run PB foam a nylon plate in the shoe but it's not too aggressive so it's the kind of shoe you can be using for those daily training Mars sizewise this was good this was true to size for me starting out with the lights with the shoe it works so well at all different Paces it's really good at those short Snappy workouts as well as that cruising marathon pace soin have called this their speed shoe which is what it's really designed specifically for those faster workouts those 5Ks 10ks and half marathons but it's the type of shoe that you can get a lot of your easy miles at died in as well if you want a bit more of an engaging ride where you're going to feel a little bit more of the ground again with that lower stack height the plate in the shoe not only gives it a good Snappy speed but it also gives it a good amount of stability in the corners this is a kind of shoe that's really good for something like a park run at 5K all out you some fantastic grip on the bottom of the shoe as well and also it's just nice and lightweight and it's fast and it's super Snappy perfect for that 5K distance it's also pretty comfortable as well as soon as you put the shoe on it feels really nice get a good lock down really like this breathable upper as well although it really has started to Bunch quite a lot for me we'll come on to that a little bit in the dislike so let's start there it does bunch a little bit for me here so I'm always having to slightly adjust it and it as I say it's is a little bit on the firmer side so if you're someone that likes a lot of ground contact feel then you're going to like this shoe some people like this some people won't it's probably going to be a little bit firm for those marathon training runs you might be getting done or even potentially raceing up in a marathon although it's a lot softer than what I used to run a marathon in about five or 6 years ago but with the way frames are the these days this is now considered a low stack height quite firm shoe it's amazing how times change and Technology improves but verdict overall it's a great lightweight option for someone that likes doing a lot of speed work in their training they like doing those tempos those thresholds looking for a lightweight shoe and they aren't too much into their Marathon racing so they're going to be favoring the 5Ks 10ks and half marathons and not doing too much of those super long runs right we've got two shoes left to go this is now in the \u00a3200 plus price point getting some big money these next two shoes aren't going to be to everyone's taste both quite High stack height shoes but personally I really love these two starting out with what will probably be my favorite shoe of the year which is the aex super blast version 2 this sent me back 200 here in the UK if you can find it it's really hard to find these shoes they in such high demand stack C at the back 45 mm stack height 8 mm drop overall and weighing in it just 288 G which is a lovely lightweight feel midso wise we've got asx's FF turbo foam which is their most premium foam that you're going to see in their high-end Ray shoes as well and there's no plate in the shoe but it is definitely on the firm side one of those shoes it doesn't need a plate not everybody loves a plate I don't like to do a lot of my easy Mars and training Mars in a plated shoe and this one just works really well getting that stiffness from the foam sizing wise I went half a size down and what I really like about this shoe is it's just super super versatile this is the shoe whenever we've been traveling I can only take one shoe with me this is definitely the shoe I'm wearing you can wear this through the airport go and get your marathon training long run even do races I have done races in this shoe it can do everything super well it's also extremely comfortable and the shoe as I say that I reach for 90% of my training R when I'm not testing out other shoes it's so lightweight and allows you to pick up the pace really effortlessly as well it's also held up pretty well for the amount of money you're spending on the shoe you want it to last a long time I really think you can get a good 800 solid training marks out of this shoe for me I did my review I can't remember how many mils I done in my first first pair but it was holding up really really well we'll link to that video up here if you want to check out my full super blast review but dislikes wise as I said at the start it's really difficult to get a hold of a pair it sells out pretty much on the day it comes out and yes it's really quite an expensive shoe but the versatility and the durability really make up for that my verdict over with a shoe a lightweight Max cushion shoe can handle every type of run and Pace absolutely brilliantly expensive but it does last a long time right our final shoe of the day \u00a3230 here in the UK for the new Balan SC Trainer version 3 now it's a really weird thing with a shoe in some countries it's a lot cheaper than that in America it's just $180 Us in Australia $330 Australian doar so UK Australia really expensive Canada USA this shoe is probably one of the categories below it's just a really OD one but I'm in the UK so it's going in this price category here stack kite at the back 40 mm stack kite 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise not too bad a little bit on the heavier side 325 G the midsole we've got a mix of that Eva and peber midsole which is a really good compromise for that softness that responsive and that durability then a carbon plate in the shoe as well for just that extra amount of rigidity and stability in the cornering likes wise with this shoe it's super comfortable straight out the box comfortable for those long runs and this is what this shoe is this is what New Balance pitch this is this is their training shoe to complement their high-end racer this is the one they want you to do all those speed sessions those easy miles in then picking out the SC Elite for when you're going racing and yeah as I said it's great value if you do live in the USA or Canada and a good option if you prefer that softer feeling with a shoe this firm is really really soft it's going to look after your legs really fantastically well on those long runs the plate here is not for that allout speed it's adding a good amount of stability it's okay if you want to pick up the pace but for me this is a perfect shoe for people training for half marathons and Marathon you're doing those long runs and picking up the paast of marathon pace up to half marathon pace it's not the kind of shoe you want to be going for your five in 10ks you'll be much better off getting something like the socony this is your allout Cruiser to really perfect those long runs dislikes as I keep saying the price is just crazy outside of the US and it's really as I say not the best option here for that speed work it feels really good at marathon pace and half marathon pace or slower recovery jogs and easy Pace as well so if you live in the USA definitely pick up this shoe it's a really fantastic option to get a lot of your daily training runs in so let's have a chat all about my final thoughts here my favorite shoe on the list it has to be the aex super blast it's just been an absolute Joy I'm going to carry on doing my training miles in that but if you can't get the super blast and something like the Nova blast 4 in fact all of these shoes are good that's why they're on the list but the Nova blast 4 as say is there an option that I do end up recommending the most for that good mix of that cushion responsiveness speed workor and a good solid price point as well next up I've got my video All About specific long run shoes we'll link to that one up here and if you want to look at my super blast review and super last Alternatives that video is coming up down there that's it guys keep on working hard keep on done let me know what what your favorite daily training shoers out there and we see you very soon in the next one",

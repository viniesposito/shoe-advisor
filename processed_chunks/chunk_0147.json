  "text": "the Nike Pegasus has always been a firm favorite of long Runners for such a long time but over the last four years as running shoe technology has advanced so quickly that Pegasus has really started to lag behind its competitors big fans of the historic Nike Pegasus have been crying out for updates especially to the outdated midsole and Nike have finally given us that in the shoe but not without a considerable hike in price so Nike now finally caught up and produced a 10 out of 10 daily trainer and if so is it going to be worth that extra hike in price so I'm three runs in to the Pegasus 41 now thought what better time to put my thoughts down on paper and bring you this video right let's start out chatting about all of the differences between this version 41 and the outgoing version 40 but before we do of course as I do with all the reviews on the channel I bought this shoe 100% with my own money to give you that completely impartial 100% honest review as I would always do so thank you to everybody liking commenting and sharing this video it really helps support the channel and allows us to keep on doing that all right let's talk about the changes the first one is this updated mesh upper it's now a slightly lighter weight and a little bit more breathable as well little bit more cushioning around the ankle and through the tongue as well a really nice update the second one the all important one with this update Nike's new react X foam which now runs the whole length of the shoe we were stuck with Nike's very outdated react foam in versions 37 to 40 so a fantastic update there we've got an extra 4 mm stack height in the shoe and it's now \u00a315 more expensive here in the UK right let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so purpose of the shoe like this this is your daily trainer suitable for all different types of runs I'd say up to around about the Half Marathon distance in terms of price I showed out 130 of my hard-earned British pounds 10 mm drop here with a 37 mil stack at the back of the shoe giving a 27 mil stack at the front of the shoe in terms of Weight Wise I measured this exactly the same as my outgo model 347 G for me in my UK size 12 it's a neutral shoe and it has this lovely engineered mesh upper as I say really nice and breathable getting good air flow through there as well the midsole as we've just discussed now ful length react X foam here and Nike have kept their two Air Zoom units just g a little bit of extra bounciness in the shoe one at the front of the shoe and one at the back of the shoe there's no carbon plate in this shoe and it has this lovely waffle outs soole rubber in this shoe lovely and grippy and super super durable as well there's no different width options available certainly not at launch anyway maybe that will come in time terms of colorways we've got two at launch in the UK USA you're very lucky you got six to choose from and as a side note you can get this in the Nikes by you choose your own colorway options and that is now 155 here in the UK and this was true to size for me right let's get stck into the likes right we've got three likes to get through my first one is this updated react X phone it is so much more improved from the outgoing version Nike say it's 13% more responsive and it's also helped to reduce Nike's carbon Foo Pit by 43% when producing the mid Sal of this shoe yes it's just a lot more springy lot more responsive with those Air Zoom pods in there as well and finally a Nike P shoe has got a bit more life about it it's a little bit more fun to run in it's a little bit more engaging to run in and you don't feel like you're running around with two big blocks of lead on your feet my second like with the shoe is the allaround Comfort fantastic amount of padding in the tongue and the ankle getting a really good lock down fit in the shoe and a nice even amount of pressure all over the front of the foot here really like what they've done with this lacing lock down system here it works really well if you're someone that likes to heal lace lock I didn't get any sort of ankle stip in this shoe but if you do the laces are long enough for that if you are someone that runs in some hotter climates I would worry a little bit about some potential overheating this shoe but for me in the UK even in the summer here it's been absolutely fine and my third like with the shoe is this wider toe box combined with this waffle outsole provides a really solid nice platform your feet have got a lot of space in the front of the shoe here really good footplay and really good support as you run along now of course I'd love to see Nike offer this shoe in a wider option but for me I do have quite narrow feet but they had plenty of space up the front here and I know this shoe will last a long time Pegasus is always due this hasn't changed this will be good for 5 600 miles and I've also spent quite a lot of time in the gym with this shoe as well and he's got really good stability that wider platform with that outsole really good stability for doing weights and I've really enjoyed it using the shoe for that stability and you can really feel that in cornering but let's move on to chat about the dislikes my first one here is this really is not a far shoe if you're looking for something to do some speed workor some races this really is not the one to be going for this shoe really is built for all around comfort and all all around durability as well there really are a lot better options out there if you're looking for that allout speed shoe we'll come on to that later and the second disc like with the shoe is it's had a pretty significant price hike and it now takes it from that sort of lower range more Budgy shoe I hate to say1 shoe was a budget is shoe but in today's modern world that kind of is takes it from that up until that mid tier shoes and it's now really competing with the Max 6 is with the Nova blast of this world and it's just a lot better com competition around at this price point Nike always had that thing with the Pegasus it always really undercut everybody and it's now really slap bang in the middle of a super competitive daily shoe market right so let's bring this all together my conclusion who is this shoe for do I recommend it is it going into my rotation well if you're the type of Runner that runs maybe two to three times a week wears the same shoe at the gym maybe play some other sports in your shoes as well travel in it go shopping in it then this is a really good solid 7 out of 10 for all of those different options if you like the previous versions you're going to like this one as well it's a perfectly fine okay shoe to get your basic runs done in is it worth going to buy the discounted outgoing version 40 or this one I'd really say try and find this one if you want to buy the Pegasus this one is a massive step up on that outgoing version 40 the new foam is so much more fun and engaging to run in and it really is just that classic Pegasus do- it- all type shoe it's a perfectly fine okay acceptable shoe to run in but if you're looking for a more of a dead ated running shoe you're a bit more serious Runner out there the Nike Zone Vero 17 is a lot livelier it's a lot faster and it's a lot more engaging ride with that shoe because it's got Nike's zoomx in there built into the midsole which is just a lot more fun and reactive to run in and it has all the durability of the Pegasus line as well and then look at some other brands Hoka Max 6 ax Nova blast now these are at the same sort of price point as the shoes we've got to talk about them in this debate they've got far superior Foams in there compared to the react X much lighter much more responsive and a lot more cushioning in the shoe as well and personally that's where I'd be choosing to spend my money if I just had around that 13540 to spend on a shoe I really do feel Nike can't win with the Pegasus line it's got millions of big fans all over the world that will not want this recipe to change they've tweaked the phone for the better no doubt but it's still the same fundamental shoe perfect for that beginner novice or casual Runner or the more advanced Runner that's looking to get away from all the Mac stack height shoes out there and just wants a little bit more feel at 27 mil that's now quite a minimal shoe out there as crazy that is and it's really quite nice be able to feel that ground a little bit more of an old school ride yes I'll be keeping the shoe without a doubt I've really enjoyed using at the gym just casually out and about as well but for me I'm super excited about the supposed upcoming I'm sure it is coming Nike Pegasus turbo when we're going to get a lot more zoom X foam in here f cross that is coming soon and when Nike will hopefully finally deliver a fantastic allaround daily shoe which is so badly missing from their lineup at the moment to rival or potentially better the likes of the as6 NOA blast and the hoker Clifton and the hoker Max 6 as well and of course I'll be getting that shoe as soon as it drops I'm so excited for it the most exciting shoe I've got this year or maybe the super Blast 2 I don't know so that's it guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments are you going to be getting the version 41 what do you think about it what do you think about this crazy colorway I love this I've love wearing it casually I've love running it videos coming up next you can check out the hoko Max 6 review up here or down here you can check out my aex Nova blast 4 review keep on working hard guys keep my done let me know your thoughts down below and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

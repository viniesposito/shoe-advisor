  "text": "I've had the aex super Blast 2 for just over 2 and 1/2 months now and I've thrown so much at them speed sessions easy runs races and I've clocked up over 350 testing miles in this shoe so I'm sure you really want to know how they are holding up I gave this shoe a pretty glowing review when it first came out but a lot can change did I maybe get it a bit wrong because I've tested a lot of other shoes things so maybe I found something better because today we're not only going to talk about the super blast but also four Alternatives if you are struggling to buy this shoe at the moment so let me know have you managed to get a hold of a pair of the coveted super Blast 2 and what do you think of it let me know down in the comments for now I'm going to get stuck in to the review and starting out as always with the facts and figures so the purpose of the super Blast 2 this is a long distance mileage monster of a shoe a non-plated racing shoe potential perfect for 10ks half marathons marathons and even longer but definitely the kind of shoe you're going to want to keep on the road pricewise coming in around about \u00a3200 stack height we're talking about 45 mil stack at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall this shoe is coming in at 288 G 10.2 o for me in my UK size 11 1/2 in this shoe that is super lightweight just holding it here in the hand you almost can't believe a shoe of this amount of volume with this much stack height weighs so little this is a neutral shoe midso wise we've got the FF turbo plus this is the same foam that asex put in their highest end races and at the bottom of the shoe it has a layer of the FF blast Eco midso just for a little bit of extra wear and tear ability just to prolong the life of the shoe outside wise on the bottom we've got aex grip here this is the same type of material that they put on some of their trailer shoes as well so a really good update was one of the big updates for version two different widths available sadly not just the one here but it's pretty good on the width side there are no dedicated men's and women's versions and finally this was not true to size for me I had to go half a size down exactly the same thing as I did in version one of the super blast right let's get stuck into my likes so my first like with the super Blast 2 is the sheer versatility it really is the type of shoe you could take away on holiday or traveling and you could just take one shoe with you I've done speed sessions when I've been away I've done easy runs just when I've only been able to take one shoe I also ran erasing it the big half handled it so well picking up the pace in the second half cruising along at around about 345 350 a pace handles that kind of pace so so well and it's also really stable at all different Paces as well the updated phone they've got here is just a little bit more Poppy and responsive than the outgoing one and it's just that perfect balance from a shoe that can Cruise along so nicely and then give you that sudden turn of speed it's just a real sleeper shoe that you don't expect to be able to go so fast my second like is the comfort of the shoe this is the shoe I've been reaching about about 90% of the time when I haven't been testing out other shoes I've done loads of long runs 32 34 and 36k long runs in this very shoe here getting ready for my next marathon it's felt super strong all the way through those runs the shoe really looks after those legs so nicely on those long runs and the foam has really felt good from the start of the run the middle of the run and the end of the Run haven't felt it sort of wearing and tearing and feeling different as the runs have gone on my third like is this shoe is just a little bit faster than it really deserves to be mainly because it is so lightweight it's amazing how light this shoe is for that 44 mil stack heide in the shoe when you really want to pick up the pace you can as I said I ran the big half in the shoe and it just coped with it so so well I was just dealing with a few little issues at the time I just wanted to put something that was Dependable going to get me through have a really good solid run this shoe really delivered there for sure a carbon plated racing shoe is going to be faster than this but there's nothing that's quite as comfortable for around about 85 90% of the speed that the shoe can produce and then finally I want to have a chat all about the durability of the shoe what it's been like over the 350 miles we've put in it it's probably around about halfway through its really good life now I think you can get about 700 mil of good solid training in the shoe before you're really going to start to see it tear off the wear on the new out soole is really impressive I land slightly on the outside of my foot and roll in which is fairly standard yes of course it's wearing down a little a little bit there but it's holding up a lot better than I expect again for something that is super lightweight and here in the footage you can see I've got a brand new shoe on my left foot and my used and abused shoe on my right foot and I really I can tell the difference between the two but it is very very minimal over the course of these 350 Mi this phone really has not degraded an awful lot at all and yeah as I say it's got plenty of life left in it as you would hope it would do for a 200b shoe but of course it's not all smiles with a super L lo as you guys know here on the channel I'll give you my likes and all of my dislikes as well because we buy all these shoes 100% with my own money to give you those completely honest impartial reviews so the first dislike it's just still really hard to get a hold of they have just dropped a new colorway that sold out pretty much in the first day it came out I did manage to get hold repair so thank you to a lot of you guys that sent me messages saying going buy a pair now and yeah it went very very quickly my second dislike it is just a little bit on the firm side for me I quite like that but it's not really great at that sort of recovery or lower end of your easy Paces here if you're going out for that second run of the day or you just want to go out and let the legs recover you might want to get something a little bit softer for your recovery runs and some people also might want something a little bit softer for those super long runs if you're going out for three or 4 hours maybe training for Ultras and things like that you might just want something a little bit softer a little bit more forgiving for me I quite like the firm side so it's not really negative for me but it's something I want to let you guys guys know and then finally the price yes this is a super expensive shoe but with the supply and demand they could probably charge \u00a3300 for the shoe and it would still sell out it is just that good it's just one of those unfortunate things high price point and scarcity as well if you can't get hold of the shoe you are struggling but you'd like a really good shoe for your long run SP now we're going to have a chat about all of the best Alternatives so because the super blast shoe is so hard to get hold of people are always sending me messages saying well what else can I buy because I can't find it but I've just got to be honest with you guys there is nothing quite like the super blast this really is a unicorn shoe it's very very unique no one makes anything quite like it which is probably why it's been so successful so I've put together a list of four shoes none of these are that similar to this I've got to be honest but they're all really good long run shoes which is where this superl 2 really excels so starting out we want to have a chat about the mauno Neo Vista shoe here now the Neo Vista is a little bit softer and a little less reactive than the super blast and it has a very different upper to the shoe this booty upper giving you a nice snug lock down plus it does use a little bit more of a basic EVA foam whereas the super blast has that peber based foam and it also has at the bottom of the shoe this nylon plate of repello along so as you're seeing I have quite a few differences between this and the super blast but the Comfort levels are high on the super blast the Comfort levels also very high on the Neo Vista as well and it's significantly cheaper this shoe com com in around about \u00a3 150 so a really good saving there both very good long run options but for me you can just Cruise along a little bit better in the super blast it's just much nicer through the footstrike No Doubt the near Vista is going to be one of the Highlight shoes of the year it's very very good and at this price point it's absolutely fantastic as well so a really good solid long run option to consider moving on we're going to have a chat about the hoker skywood X now I've only just got this shoe in started to do some early testing the shoe again we'll put all the facts and figures up on the screen the hooker shoe is absolutely crazy 48 mm stack height I've never run in a shoe quite like that this is a lot more cushioned softer bouncier just incredibly bouncy in fact the super blast is a lot stiffer firmer and it really does pick up the pace a little bit better as well there's a big weight difference the trouble with the skyex it is incredibly heavy and because of that it just doesn't have that pace range that the super blast does there is a carbon plate in the bottom of the skyex as well and so many shoes have these carbon plates they're putting carbon plates in shoes like this not for all out speed but for stability because these Foams are so soft and squidgy so really like this shoe is really quite firm so if you like potentially like the ride of the super blast and that sort of firmness you're going to get some good firm stiffness here but then this sort of this direction the shock absorption this is where the skyex really comes into its own at your easy pace and recovery Pace the Skyward X is a really great option I'm going to have my full review coming soon so if you want to go and do some really nice recovery runs something to really look after your legs on very very long runs I'll say this shoe is going to be better than the super blast but the super blast is just far excels at those faster Paces something like the Skyward really just for those easy recovery run Paces it's going to look after your legs very very well right moving on to a shoe I don't actually have anymore so I'm going to pretend I'm holding it here but it's a shoe I had earlier in this year which is the super blast is baby brother the Nova blast 4 which yeah you can save a significant amount of money going for something like the Nova blast 4 it doesn't have the carbon plate in the shoe doesn't have any plates in the shoe just a nice good stack of foam it's it's aix's all around shoe just a good daily option for sure the super blast is going to be a lot quicker it's a lot more responsive less bouncy better suited for those longer runs as well but if you're happier with a slightly softer ride that the Nova blast gives and you're not going super long or not going on too many long runs then the Nova blast would work just as well for a lot of you guys out there if the super blast wasn't around I would definitely be spending a lot more time or I'd have bought another pair of the Nova blast 4 after I wore my pair out earlier on this year finally the final show I want to have a chat about is the New Balance SC Trainer version 3 which I've really been enjoying putting some miles here the S trainer version 3 it's such a different feeling a different ride compared to the superlast the foam is so sof and you really sort of sink into it it doesn't have the most poppy doesn't have the best energy return in the shoe again you've got a carbon plate running throughout the shoe here similar to the skywood x that plate is more for stability rather than speed and the super blast as I say it's a lot firmer a lot more responsive and that foam is so firm it doesn't need a plate in there so the SC Trainer is far more suited for those easy runs those recovery runs that slower Pace running again to really look after your legs with all that squish that plushness on those long runs whereas the firmness in the super blast just me it has more Pace uses really you can just pick up the pace a little bit better in a few weeks time hopefully if the rumors are true Nike will be releasing the Invincible version 4 we will get that in to review and that is going to be another big potential competitor so to bring that to a conclusion a lot of you guys probably think well what should I buy if I can't get this and it's really hard for me to sit here and say this one is the most similar because they're really not that similar there is nothing quite like the ride and the fear and the lightness and the nimbleness and responsive of the superl if it was me and this didn't exist this wasn't in the world I'd probably be running most of my runs in something like the Nova blast 4 combining that with a carbon plated ratio for my speed session something like the vaporfly which is what I've been doing a lot of my speed session in this summer and then yeah some of my easier longer runs in this you know the the SC Trainer that's probably the one I would be going for out of all of these so far I have to be building a bit of a rotation because this just covers so many different types of runs and that's why it's that beautiful doit all training shoe that you can travel with put in your bag and just do so much in it it's an amazing shoe probably the best shoe I've ever run in quite frankly so there are my final thoughts let me know your thoughts down in the comments below I hope you've enjoyed this video that's it guys keep on working hard keep done and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

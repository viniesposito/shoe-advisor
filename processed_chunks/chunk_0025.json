  "text": "this is the novablast 5 and once again they're changing the midsole foam this year the Nova blast will feature FF blast Max a foam that is lighter than the foam in a last year's Nova blast but with the trend of super Foams making their way into daily trainers will FF blast Max be enough for as6 to keep up it's time to lace up the no blast 5 and take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm a non Elite Runner reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the A6 Nova blast 5 but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that is accent to me for the purpose of revie so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage of my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the Nova blast 5 and let's start with the specs this is a 41.5 MM stack heite shoot with an 8 mm drop giving us 33.5 mm of Stack height in the for foot I believe those are the same specs as last year as far as stack height and drop now the women do get a different stack height the drop stays the same but they're a millimeter lower in the heel and in the forfoot and the big story for this year is the upgrade of the Nova blast to FF blast Max this is a brand new foam that is supposed to provide a more responsive bounce according to A6 and it's also supposed to be lighter so even though these two shoes the Nova blast 4 and the Nova blast 5 look very similar and if anything it looks to me like the novast 5 has a little bit more foam to it the Nova blast 5 does come in a little bit lighter now on the outsole on this shoe there is a very familiar kind of pattern of rubber that's on here it is slightly different than what we saw in last year's version 4 but we're getting the same rubber compound and we're basically getting it in the same areas and to the same depth so the rubber is still a little bit on the thick side if you ask me moving to the upper we have a brand new upper material as well this year the Nova BL goes to a jaquard mesh it's a double layer mesh that is very stretchy and also very breathable it also feels a little bit thinner than the material that we saw in the Nova blast 4 something that isn't thinner though and something that I think unfortunately isn't thinner is that the tongue is still kind of on the puffy side and I feel like as the years have gone on the tongue on the Nova Blast has gotten puffier and puffier even though I'm really wishing they would just take the knit tongue from the Nimbus series and put that into NOA blast I think that would be really fun to run in and in the heel cup of this shoe we're still seeing that same overly padded puffy foam it makes for a very comfortable slip-in experience when your foot goes into the shoe and wearing it around casually it is really nice but I feel like for running especially in hot days it's not really that hot here in Crystal Lake anymore but on hot days that's definitely going to be a bit of a sweat collector as the Nova Blast has been pretty consistently in the heel for the past couple of years we do still retain the pull tab though for easy on in the shoes and overall this shoe comes in at an updated weight of 255 G or just at 9 [Music] oz now that we talked about what this shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on the road the Nova blast 5 is a faithful successor to the Nova blast lineage there's a great amount of cushion in this shoe and there's a great amount of Bounce I feel like it also picks up the pace as well so not only can it do your daily training run and handle those run-of-the-mill everyday runs that you're doing most of the week most of the time but if you've got a light workout like a fart lick or an uptempo run or maybe you just got an easy run with them strides in it the Nova blast 5 is going to be really fun and really comfortable for you to be able to put those miles in now I think that the word that a lot of you guys who have been watching me review the Nova Blast for the last five iterations are probably looking for is whether it's chaotic and I will say that the Nova blast 5 isn't chaotic it's more like the Nova blast 4 than it is like the Nova Blast 3 but I do think that the FF blast Max foam is doing a really good job of kind of giving me more Nova blast 3ish sensation without it feeling chaotic so I feel like it kind of splits the difference between the Nova Blast 3 and the Nova blast 4 fans and so it's not as potentially unstable to as many people but it's still a lot of fun to be able to run in the upper on the shoe is is really comfortable even more comfortable than the Nova blast was last year and I think because the material is thinner I does feel like there's a little bit more room and it's a little bit more forgiving in terms of fit in the forfoot so those of you who are kind of on the bubble between sizes last year because it might have been a little bit too snug for you I think you might be able to stay at your regular size for the Nova blast 5 I do feel like overall the upper is a big improvement over last year although I would love to see the tongue stop being so overbuilt and the Heel Cup being so overly padded as far as the outo goes I feel like we have a very similar setup it's the same compound and arranged in pretty much the same pattern and thickness as it was last year so if you've been able to run in the Nova blast 4 without any traction or grip issues you should be definitely fine in the Nova blast 5 personally I feel like I could go with a little bit less rubber cuz I feel like it would further enhance the experience you're getting from the FF blast Max I think as it is the amount of rubber that's on the outsole is muting The Experience just a little bit that being said I think the Nova blast 5 is a set it and forget it kind of shoe I'm having a lot of fun with it I can run in it all day long and it's an excellent example of a daily [Music] trainer before we close out the video Let's zoom out and see where the noble S5 sits within a broader A6 lineup now whenever I take a look at a running shoe brand I like to start with the daily trainer and that's exactly what a Nova blast is it's the shoe that sits in the middle of your running shoe rotation it's kind of the base of it all the shoe that you're running in most often it's built to be comfortable enough to be used multiple times per week and also be durable enough to handle that kind of mileage and then for racing the carbon plated shoe that I like from A6 is the meta speed sky and this is the meta speed Sky Paris that's going to go over here now in between these two shoes for something that is maybe a little bit faster than you might want for every day but maybe not quite as special that you'd have to break out your erasing shoes that's where a training companion or session shoe like the magic speed 4 comes into play it's got a little bit of daily training features it's got a little bit of race day features built in now for days where you're going to be spending a lot of time on feet maybe it's a recovery run you want to be a little bit nicer to your body that's where a shoe like the Glide ride Max comes into play it's a little bit more cushioned a little bit more chill and has a lot more comfort features built into it it's also the first shoe that we saw that introduced at least a little bit of FF blast Max foam in here and then from as6 there's also a fifth shoe that kind of is a category straddler but this is the super Blast 2 this has racing foam in it FF turbo plus the same turbo plus that's in the race sto but it's in a really tall sack heite and it has no carbon fiber plate it also has a little bit of daily training film on the bottom to help with longevity and also to stabilize this foam this is a shoe that some people use as a kind of long slow distance kind of shoe or recovery day shoe and it does a good job of that but I kind of like it for longer runs where I might have to pick up the pace a little bit and having that super foam is a nice little touch so this is like a five shoe rotation from as6 that I think could be really fun but I I'm not recommending that people go out and buy all five of these shoes in fact there's a lot of ways that I think that kind of like this can be paired down so the first thing I'm going do is I'm going to remove two shoes from this and I feel like if I wanted to go with a three shoe rotation from A6 I'd get rid of the glid ride Max and the magic speed 4 not that they're not good shoes but I just feel like if we're trying to consolidate a little bit this is a really good way to consolidate here use your Nova Blast for your everyday your super Blast 2 for your long runs and long run workouts and then for your fastest stuff that's where you reach for the race day shoot now if I were to really push it and force myself to have only two a six shoes in a rotation I think the shoe that I would remove would be the Nova blast 5 not that I don't love that shoe but I feel like the super Blast 2 is pretty versatile it can handle everyday running and it can also do some workouts as well and then you've got the meta speed Sky Paris as your race Day Option and I feel like this could be an expensive but doable two shoe rotation cuz keep in mind the super Blast 2 is $200 now you might be asking well what about the other Marathon racing shoe that A6 has and that is the meta speed Edge Paris and I feel like this is an either or whether you're using a two shoe three shoe five shoe rotation you're probably either going to like the metaed edge Paris or The Meta speed Sky Paris I kind of use them in the same rotation because I happen to have both of them but realistically for most Runners it's going to be an either or and I prefer the metas speed [Music] Sky now let's wrap up the video by going over the binding guide and we'll talk about some Alternatives that you want to consider the Nova blast 5 is an excellent example of a daily trainer it can do a little bit of everything from recovery runs your everyday runs to moderate workouts and strides this shoe goes on sale soon December 1st at a price of $140 so inflation has not hit the Nova blast series yet but because the Nova Blast has been around for a while there are also some other options to consider in the Nova blast family for example you can get $10 discount right now on the Nova blast 4 and in some very select sizes you can find the Nova Blast 3 still around for $100 so those are some other options that you might want to also consider because while there are some differences between these shoes amongst the Nova blast Fanatics for most people getting an earlier version of novablast to save you a couple of bucks is definitely something that is a viable option but there's also a lot of heat coming from other brands in 24 and into 5 so let's take a look at some of those I think the biggest competition that the novablast 5 faces is from Adidas and that's going to be the Evo SL this is a shoe that has all racing super foam in the midlle the same Light Strike Pro that was in the adios Pro 3 but it doesn't have a carbon fiber plate or those energy rods that the adios Pro Series has had the upper is built more for daily training but it doesn't have a super puffy tongue or heel cup and I feel like this shoe is an excellent daily as well and it does a very good job of even moderate to hard workouts it'll be interesting to see how this shoe holds up as a daily trainer as we don't typically associate Light Strike Pro with longevity and durability that you'll need for daily training but if it could even come kind of close to the kinds of numbers in terms of miles that you can run in this shoe before it uses its usable life I think this is going to be an incredibly difficult shoot for any brand to compete against in 202 5 and it's only $10 more than the Nova blast 5 the Evo SL comes out at $150 which I believe is a very aggressive price now there are trickle drops here and there where you might be able to get this shoe now but supplies are very limited in each of those little mini drops the broader release doesn't happen until March of 2025 which for me or depending on how much you run might be plenty of time to pick up a NOA blast 5 and then pick up an Evo SL if you're only going to get one of those two shoes and I feel like people watching this channel regularly are probably not going to only get one of these two shoes but if you're only going to get one and you're deciding between the Evo SL and the Nova blast 5 and you can wait till March of 2025 and probably pick the Evo SL now the other shoe that I want to take a look at is another shoe that uses super foam and I'll use super foam in air quotes here because it's zumex in the Pegasus plus and I'm using air quotes with this because I don't really think and I haven't heard officially from Nike one way or the other but I don't think that the zoomx foam that's in the Pegasus plus is the same zoomx foam that we're seeing in the actual race product like in the alphafly 3 or in the vapor fly but it is a really good daily training foam and a lot of the same things that I would say nicely about the Nova blast 5 I can kind of copy paste and put onto the Pegasus plus as well it's a really great daily trainer you could take it for some moderate workouts I do feel though that the Pegasus plus has a little bit more of an aggressive geometry with a 10 mm drop versus no Nova blast 8 and I do feel like there is slightly less foam that you're standing on in the shoe in terms of what it feels like underfoot so it feels like it's a little bit less cushioned and it is a little bit more snug in the forefoot and the Pegasus plus comes in at a substantial premium of $180 so while the Pegasus plus is one of my favorite daily Trainers for 2024 I definitely would pick the Nova blast 5 so do I think that going into 2025 that daily trainers absolutely have to have super Foams as table stakes in in order to be competitive I think the answer is no and I think that the FF blast Max and the Nova blast 5 are really good examples of that but I do think that as we go and as that trend of putting super Foams into daily trainers continues what you're doing with those Foams is going to have to be pretty special in order to keep up if you have any other questions about this shoe or any of the shoes that I mentioned today feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet stop by the last thing I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I'll see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

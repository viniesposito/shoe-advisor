  "text": "hey people welcome to the run test it's Kieran here now this year I've tested close to 50 pairs of running shoes maybe even more I mean I did a rough count anyway we've tested a lot of shoes done a lot of miles and in the next 10 minutes or so I'm going to whip you through some of my top shoes of 2024 it's always a tough job to whittle down all those shoes into a list of just five and this year the quality I think has been higher even higher than most many of the brands have put out strong lineups every brand has at least one standout shoe even the shoes I personally don't get on with the best have been of a very high standard but then there are running shoes that really stand out that really fit the way that I run and the types of runs that I tend to take on in training and in racing this year that's been everything from running a sub three at the Manchester Marathon to my fastest 5Ks I've raced Trail marathons and Ultras I've run a 100 mile ultra on mixed terrain I ran the comrades Marathon a 55 M Road Ultra so there's lots of variety there in the runs that I've been doing and in this video mainly though with going to be focusing on the road shoes now in general I tend to prefer firmer more immediate responsive rides rather than the biggest most pillowy soft sinky shoes I lean to towards shoes that feel more compact that don't feel like too much shoe on the foot so the more precise strip back shoes those kind of things rather than the big hulking great shoes that's changed a little this year as we've seen good bigger stack shoes that manage to kind of balance offering big cushion but also feeling light and avoid being too cumbersome I enjoy shoes that protect my feet and legs on longer miles but don't try to make the ground disappear altogether I still like to feel connected to the ground with shoes that kind of let you know what's going on Under Foot but kind of encourage a fast foot turnover as well I don't mind shoes that still require you to do some of the work and I prefer shoes that I control where I'm kind of controlling the Run rather than those shoes that sort of control you and try and fire you too much the other thing I'm always on the hunt for is maximum versatility If a shoe can coope with a wide range of runs then it really scores highly for me because it represents good value so with that in mind I've tried to come up with a fistful of shoes that I've really loved this year these are the shoes that have really struck a cord with the way that I run and the way that I race there is one caveat here I've not run in many shoes from pummer and none from Muno so if they're not mentioned here that's why there obviously other shoes that I haven't tested as well so this is a pick of the shoes that I've had on my feet anyway let's get into it first on the list then is the aex metas speed Sky Paris now this is one of 2024's standout shoes it has all the ingredients you look for in a good carbon ratio at a pretty competitive price you've got light racy Airy uppers a big stack of really bouncy energetic midsole foam and a stiffness from the carbon plate that adds plenty of extra pop to your runs I use the metas speed Sky Paris to set marathon and 5K PBS this year and I think it delivers everything that you really want in a speedy shoe for going Allin trying to chase those PBS I really like the stiffness in the midsole unit along with the just right cushioning I think it dampens the road impact without leaving you feeling completely disconnected from the road in some ways it kind of reminds me a little bit of the vaporfly next perent too it has that kind of direct ride for me there's a really good Precision to The Landings as well it's quite a narrow profile on this it's wonderfully agile and if you're confident you're in good racing shape I'd certainly say that this is one of if not the best shoe that you can lace up right now to go and Chase those fastest times aex has made its best carbon plate shoe yet if it's got one drawback though I think if you're not sure you're going to hold your form deep into a race particularly over the marathon it might not be the most protective if you get heavy and ragged this shoe might hang you out to dry a little more than some other carbon races so if you're hedging your bets where you know you're starting a race well below par I think there are better shoes to choose for garanteed Comfort they'll look after you a little bit more if you do drop off but I've Loved all my runs in the aex metas speed SC by Paris and yeah it's been a standout shoe topnotch now regular viewers here won't be at all surprised to see my next shoe I've run thousands of miles in the sakon Endorphin speed I ran across Europe in the last generation Speed 3 I've done hundreds of miles in the Endorphin speed 4 as well and it's every bit has accomplished in my opinion the speed 4 feels immediately natural on the foot it delivers a lively Snappy cushion ride it's light it's full of energy there's no harshness here I think anyway no fussy business with the way it feels on the foot and for me this is a genuine allrounder you can lace up for almost any run it really successfully sort of straddles the world of comfort and speed though fans of bigger softer cushioning might want more protection for their very easiest runs but for me the Endorphin speed 4 offers just enough protection just enough Road impact for the easy cruising miles you know I can do that casual two mile around the blocking them but it really comes to life when you start kicking up through the gears there's enough response to eat tempos top Pace intervals that's where the combination of the responsive Midol foam The Rocker and the nylon plate really kick in for a fast energetic and fun feel underf foot if you only want to buy one shoe I think the Endorphin speed 4 is a great utility shoe it's got your back for almost any run and if someone told me I was only allowed to have one shoe to do all of my training and Racing for a marathon I think the speed 4 would be somewhere very high on my short list another shoe that's really stood out for me this year is the Hoka Mac X2 I've raised half marathons in it I've used it for a lot of faster training runs some easy while I don't think it's quite as capable as an allrounder as the Endorphin speed for it's another pretty versatile option that's at its best when you're running from or moving from your middle to those kind of upper Paces the higher Stack The Tweak plate have breathed some fire into the midsole ride and there's now clear daylight between the energy of this and the Hoka Max 6 this Speedy daily trainer is really really high quality the midsole changes add up to an improved energy and ride versus the first gen hok macx as well it's a real gear change so if you felt that wasn't quite Punchy enough this one definitely delivers I wasn't 100% convinced by the upper Comfort or 100% in love with the fit and the heel color package and I think that limits the amount of time that I really want to spend in the macx 2 though I know a beginner Runner who logged a 2hour half marathon in them for their first half marathon in fact and absolutely loved it so it might just be me on that and the fit definitely doesn't undermine the performance of what is a brilliant shoe for those shorter faster runs I think for me racing a half marathon in this would be it sweet spot for attacking runs like up to 90 minutes on feet it's excellent you get a bucket load of fun and energy and a speed focused daily trainer that's peier and puntier I think than the sck indor and speed 4 but not quite as disappearing on the foot and for that reason I just think they're not quite as versatile as the speed 4 but still an excellent allrounder with a really sort of faster Edge so it took me longer than the rest of the team to get my feet into a pair of these the super Blast 2 but once I did I logged loads of Miles very quickly and that is a compliment to this shoe I ran a full 4our solo Marathon around London in a test I've done intervals Tempo runs and easy plots and it performed well across all of that this shoe has been a surprise one for me because it is a bigger shoe than I'd normally go for it's kind of a whacking great beast but it's surprisingly light for a whopping great shoe you get big cushion comfort that's soft but not too soggy got a nice roomy toe box you've got balanced heel collar padding here to boost the Comfort there's good leg sparing energy from the bouncy but controlled mids for me it's perhaps not quite there for my top Pace runs there's still just a bit too much shoe that for me to do those kind of really fastest runs and I'd reach for a speed 4 or a Hoka max2 before I chose this one for that kind of top end Pace it can also feel a little soggy at my very slowest Pace but I'm talking about the ends of the spectrum here in both cases of that but for me where the shoe really excels is kind of in the cruising pace and just a little bit either side of that and that covers the majority of my runs I think that also makes this a potential Marathon shoe for many Runners if the aex metas speed Sky Paris is the kind of shoe that you lace up when you know that you can run well and hold form and really go all out then the super Blast 2 could be a shoe that you could lace up if you're looking for something that's more like a safety net sure that you can run long in safe in the knowledge that it will feed back the energy that you put in but also it will look after you if everything does go wrong if you just want to run a marathon in Comfort this shoe is going to do a job or even it will go Ultra I think it is pricey but it's another shoe that could cover an entire training and racing block for a marathon if you can get hold of it my final pick then might be a surprise entry and it's not a shoe that scored a lot of headlines but I absolutely love the Hyperion Max 2 from Brooks for the way I run I think it's a cracking first so shoe up to a point I ran 40 miles of the Berlin w 100 mile ultra in this shoe at an easy Pace but equally it's light Nimble and works for faster Tempo runs too it's not the fastest springiest bounciest daily trainer you're going to find the ride I think is more subtle than that but there is response when you push the pace it kind of requires you to do some of the work first though you have to run this shoe it doesn't run you and that's something that I really quite like it's also one of those shoes that quickly vanishes into the background when you put it on and lets you go about your business you've got like a tone down aggression here and the extra cushion makes this sort of adaptable enough to accommodate faster and slower miles but the fit and foot feel is really excellent I think that's where it really excels it's light it's roomy it's disappearing without feeling loose it somehow sort of strikes a really happy balance between feelings that racy and feeling roomy now I don't think it's got the top speed of shoes like the sock and dwarf and speed forward the Mac X2 it certainly doesn't have the cushioning of the super Blast 2 but I'm going to give this Hyperion Max 2 very high praise because I think it's a really competent easy to run in reliable shoe that does a lot and the cheaper price tag I think only adds to the [Music] appeal so that's my top five of 2024 but there are so many shoes I could have put on that list some other standouts for me include the adios Pro 4 from Adidas for racing marathons the socer r 17 for affordable versatile easy Comfort gear to the slowen the Brooks Glycerin Max for that Max cushioned kind of Excellence the oncloud Monster hyper I think is also good for Reliable lightweight cushioning and comfort and particularly over the ultra distance though it is pricey the new balanced SC Trainer V3 very priced in the UK is a good shoe the HX 6 as well are both these are both good allr rounders that I would have in the mix as well so there you have it that's been my top shoe picks of 2024 hit me up in the comments and tell me what you think what shoes have I missed what shoes have I included where you think I've got it completely wrong are there any that you've not liked that I've put on the list what have been your top picks let's hear them in the comments if you're interested in good all around versatile shoes I'm going to pop a video up on the channel now you should definitely go and check out otherwise thanks for stopping by and until next time happy running people",

  "text": "2024 has been a really strong year for running shoes I've Loved buying and testing the latest offerings from all of the big Brands and I've seen some really great shoes that have really surprised me with what they were offering the bar gets higher and higher each year and the ability to stand out gets that little bit harder well today I've got my top three shoes that have really surprised me and overd delivered on what I was expecting them to do and of course as always here on the channel I've got a couple of other options that I was really pumped up and really excited for their latest updates and then were just a bit of a let down so definitely worth avoiding as with everything we do here on the channel I bought all of these shoes 100% with my own money to give you that completely honest and biased review if you're watching this video in the first few days then it will be our Black Friday weekend we're having a big Black Friday sale a sale we like to do every

partial reviews it means so much to myself and Sarah right let's start out with a couple of the bad ones the first one being the Nike Pegasus version 41 41 years to hopefully get this right but it's still not quite there I super pumped what I heard this new version was coming out with an updated foone a better upper and I thought finally Nike going to release a daily shoe that is going to be a fantastic running shoe that we can recommend but sadly it really did fall short as I say this is Nike's classic daily trainer at what they deem is more of that affordable price point stack out of the back 37 mil 10 mm drop overall they whacked up the price unfortunately as well now costing \u00a31 130 definitely not that entrylevel budget sh anymore but in that sort of Middle Ground here with some really stiff competition Weight Wise a little bit on the chunky side 340 7 G mesh this engineered mesh upper which to be fair was actually not too bad the updated midso which is really what I was hoping to get a little bit of Zoom X in here would have been nice but no it was just the react X midsole keeping those airpods in there the ride is still pretty harsh and firm what is really good is the outsole really good waffle outsole very hardwearing and it was true to scis of me and it was really good to see they offered it in a wide fit as well now there's no doubt about it the react X foam update here was a a lot better than version 40 we've got a bit of extra stack in this shoe as well it's a slightly softer ride but it's still pretty harsh out there upper really really good good lock down really good Comfort shoe nice wide toe box and a stable ride with the shoe as well and as I just mentioned fantastic durability with this shoe but kind of where this really fell short for me was just that big price hike there just much better competitors out there at this price the Nova blast the Mac Nike's very own Vero a much better running shoe and only a smidge more in price here and they're just far better running shoes overall better Foams far more responsive this is just really quite slow these airpods in this foam is just doing just very little work for me and I'd much rather be out there in one of those other offerings just minimal energy return not much bounce with this one and it just has that feeling of feeling quite dead underfoot for me it quickly became a gym and Casual shoe only and I spent a lot of time in casually really comfortable going to the gym walking around town whatever traveling around really good shoe for that sort of thing and of course you can go for a running if you have to but it's definitely not the one I would be picking it's going to be really interesting to see what happens next year with the shoe can Nike really call this a running shoe anymore the vomero that Nike offer is just so much better yes it's a little bit more expensive it's a real sleeper of the range V get version 18 here on the channel hopefully come around about January time in for a review so get subscribed for that but that's where I'll be putting money for a Nike daily shoe the Pegasus plus is a little bit more expensive yes it has that full zoomx midso which is really good also fantastic Comfort option and I sure I'd recommend it has that good ground feel that you get with this but it's got that responsiveness and that Popp so again a much better option but I fully admit Nike can't really win with a shoe I don't know what Nike's bestselling shoe is but it could well be this one so many people just want a Dependable shoe they can work casually go to the gym go to the shops do a couple of runs in a weekend and it would be fine and they're not that worried about how far fast they go and it does that but in 2024 for me this just does not cut it as a running shoe anymore and definitely not since the price T at least when it was around about100 you can say well it's really not too bad at that price point but now it's up here go verom Mero go M go Nova blast in this price range or if you really do want to get this then just know that it has its drawbacks with it's running you can't really pick up the pace you certain want to be racing it the thought of racing a marathon something like this would be absolutely crazy but yeah good looking shoe for the gym and that occasional runin if you really want to you can get it done I've just purchased the gortex version of this Sarah's just kindly passed to me you give me the wrong side I like to hold it here we'll hold it that way around the gortex version which I'm not expecting much from but yeah it could be a good winter daily training shoe some really good Nike storm tread on the bottom there right coming in from the side the next one here which is a lovely lightweight shoe and I really wanted to like this this is the Hoka ringcon version 4 I was a big fan of the first three versions of Hoka ringcon again a really good budget offering in one two and three something I'd really like to recommend to people getting into the sport or someone that wanted that uptempo lightweight trainer to do some sessions in a ringcom was a really good bet at a fantastic price point but for me version 4 just has not delivered a spectacular fail when you're comparing it to the earlier three versions how hooker really Market the ringcon it's just that entry level beginner daily trainer or for more of an advanced Runner that's going to build a big rotation or something something you can can definitely do a lot of speed working and things like that shorter distances 5Ks 10ks and half marathons at most stack cut at the back 33 mil with a 5 mm drop set me back around about 100\u00a3 110 for this super lightweight that is one thing that's definitely going for this shoe just 280 G for me in my UK size 12 we've got this jackard mesh upper here really not too bad but not too great we'll come on to that in a bit the midsole with this shoe this is really where it's starting to let the side down this injection molded Eva mids sole yeah it's hard to get an exciting midsole definitely at this price point but unfortunately it has a real dead feeling out soole it kind of doesn't really have a rubber out soole it's this purple section at the bottom of shoe here it's just this mix of this rubberized Eva blend sizing was Dreadful in the shoe definitely it runs very very small go at least half a size up I think I'd probably go a whole size up in the shoe it comes in much shorter than my other hookah shoes and other brands as well so as I said I was really excited when version for was coming out that wallet friendly price it was a shoe I'd always find myself recommending to other people anyone getting into the sport or just someone looking for that lightweight Speedy simple shoe without a plate just wanted that more traditional ride and that's what it offered that lightweight engaging ride decent size toe box at the front of the shoe as well and it meant you could run longer in the shoe and it had a good sort of that spacious upper unfortunately that's kind of all gone with version 4 so where does version 4 fall short for me well the foam is now very stiff and very firm as well the sizing as I say just way off you need at least to go half a size up maybe even a full size and the fit is definitely a lot narrower than version 3 and it's really on the narrow side hooker shoes tend to be a little bit on the narrow side and there's just not enough room in the tow box here there's just not enough height in the toe box there's not enough width in the toe box it's just a very narrow fit I know this shoe came in small even if it was exactly the right size and I had gone half a size or full size I still just feel this is a very compact space so getting some heel slip in the shoe the lock down just is just not great as standard you can actually just slide them off completely easily when they are well I could and I tied them up quite tight and you can just take them straight off whenever I do get some heel sh with a shoe I'd always try that heel lock lacing that you can do if you see me doing on the screen here just to get a much better lock down but the tongue is just so weirdly short on this shoe that you can't really you can just about do it it did cure the heel slip so it does work but I say the tongue is just so short the ring con has never been a shoe that has been now for durability they've never had a rubber out so on here they get rid of it to make it nice and lightweight and I do appreciate that it's really good to have that nice lightweight feel but just know with something like this you're not going to get very good durability which I think a lot of beginner Runners and people at this sort of price point they're just looking for that good value for money just unfortunately don't expect this to last very long but it's not all bad there are a couple of good things with this shoe to have a chat about it is lightweight and when you get up to speed as you can see here here I'm running around about 320 A K Pace it does feel really nice and smooth some people are going to like that extra stiffness and firmness and it does really work at speed but just other Paces easy Pace recovery Pace slower Pace running it's just a bit clunky just a bit wearing just a bit grating just with How firm it is but when you really want to engage it and pick up the speed it actually is quite Pleasant to run in dare I say so who could this type of shoe work for as say if you're an experienced Runner you're building up a big shoe rotation this could work it's a nice Tempo shoe it's light and it's smooth at speed but as an entry level all round shoe it's really really misses the mark for me if you want to stick in the hoker range you much better looking at the Mac which is so much better at all Paces much better out soole so much more comfortable or even the Clifton which isn't the best shoe in the world but it's got fantastic durability with that shoe as well there are much better options if you only got around1 to spend try and get a Mac or a Clifton on discount or something like that that's going to serve you much better but I'm not just criticizing it because the price point it's cheap and H have to have some cheap materials at this price point because Adidas delivered an absolutely stunning shoe this year when they bought out the SL2 it was so good when I had it earlier in this year just that classic daily trainer from Adidas much more of affordable price point than the Boston 36 mil stack height 9 mm drop overall I think I paid just High 90s for this shoe against an RP of around about 110 super lightweight 287 G for me and really enjoyed picking up the Pace in the shoe because of that lightweightness lovely engineered mesh upper pretty breathable there as well midso this is where the shoe really starts to come alive you got a lovely layer of the Light Strike Pro Adidas's premium foam here for that responsiveness that bounciness that Popp and it's sandwiched together between two layers of the Light Strike 2.0 for added durability to make sure it lasts outs soole we haven't got Adidas's famous Continental grip here but you've just got Adidas's standard rubber out soole and it was pretty damn good good and very good at this price point sizing rise it did run a little bit small as well if you're un sure go that half a size up for me my UK size 12 it was just about okay but I'd really Rec going half a size up so what I was genuinely so surprised about this shoe is I sort of get the impression a lot of Manufacturers just don't really care about their entry level shoes anymore they just want every spending as much as possible going for that mid-range that \u00a3 150 for that doit all type of running shoe but Adidas s of ripped up the rule book there and they gave us really \u00a3150 ver of value for \u00a3100 in my opinion Adidas are really quite renowned for delivering some good value out there and this one is an absolute Blinder the version before this the SL1 was just what you'd expect for an entry-level running shoe hard foam cheap materials and just a bit boring and Bland so I really was not expecting much when we got the SL2 in but it was a huge Improvement pretty much exactly the same at Price Point as well and when I was testing the shoe and running along in it I just had to keep reframing my reference point of I bought this shoe for less than 100 00 that's absolutely crazy so the standout features of this shoe that layer of that all premium foam in here at this price point just does not happen usually Foams in this price point are so dull and unresponsive but what added us have done with sandwiching it together between that Durable foam and then that Poppy foam in the middle it's just a combination that works so well and the fact they've managed to do all that and still really decrease the weight of the shoe now for me at 287 G again really surprising but really good to see as well also what I was really surprised about was just how good that added ass grip was oh it would be nice to see the content of grip you can't have everything for \u00a398 just in the cornering felt really nice and I could really trust it and also the versatility of this shoe you can do everything in this shoe I'd happily race in this shoe I'd have to use some reps in the shoe I'd have to use some thresholds some tempos some easy runs some recovery runs it will do it all pretty well I personally wouldn't want to run a marathon I'd rather have some plates in there and spend a little bit more money and have a shoe that's going to look after my legs a little bit better and be a little bit more responsive in those very long runs but yeah you really can't go wrong I really think for a lot of people this is a really good daily shoe without breaking the bank yes if you want to spend a bit more and have the tech and some of the things like the Boston has then yeah no problem doing that at all but if you're just looking for that daily non nonsense shoe this is where the SL2 comes in so who is the SL2 best for well someone looking for that budget friendly shoe they can wear on their shorish runs in their training 5K 10ks half marathons training for those distances racing those distances you'll be absolutely fine if you got a particularly wider foot it's probably going to be one to avoid right we're back to hoker they did provide a really good shoe this year so we better get stuck into that now it's the skywood X we got the skywood X in earlier on this year and I really was not expecting much versus the ringcon for example when I super hyped for it because the version before have been really good and that was a bit of a let down this one the shoe that came before the Bondi X it now got renamed to Skyward X was so bad one of the worst shoes I've ever reviewed here on the channel this thing came in and absolutely delivered a fantastic shoe really enjoyed running it really surprised with how good it is and I've just kept going out in it for those easy those recovery runs or those long runs when I just want to look after my legs so this set me back \u00a3185 so yeah a little bit on the expensive side the purpose of shoe like this long runs easy runs and Recovery runs stack kite an absolute whopping 48 mm stack kite 5 mm drop overall the high stack height shoe I've ever reviewed here on the channel Weight Wise yeah it's a big shoe no doubt 378 G for me in my UK size 12 the upper of the shoe we've got this flat knit sort of a bit of a sock likee upper at the front pretty breathable not too bad midso wise we've got this Jewel layer of peba and Eva Eva for that durability peba for that responsiveness that Poppin that bounciness there's a lot of bounciness in this shoe outsole wise these yellow pads here on the bottom of the shoe that high abasan Rubber outsole and it's it's wearing pretty good so far I'm up to about 80 mil in this shoe 0 very happy miles I must say and the sizing was true to size for me so why was this shoe a big surprise well I say it replaced the Bondi X which was just a really bad shoe in my opinion one of my personal worst the bonday X was such a weird combination of out ofd Foams with a carbon plate on a shoe that was just renowned for very very easy days really had some bad heel slipping issues as well and he just felt really dead and so really no purpose for anyone and then in comes the Skyward X this whole new complete redesign with the shoe massive stack kite which is absolutely crazy and despite the waking bulk it's really fun to run in it's also super soft and plush as well there's a lot of travel in the foam here thank goodness they put that carbon plate in there that's not really for allout Speed it's adding a lot of stability in the shoe which is definitely what it needs with this amount of foam and it otherwise you'd just be wallowing all over the place so just a combination that holds it all together really quite well and this shoe is supremely comfortable as well had absolutely no issues in this shoe definitely been using it for my second run of the day or some like a Monday shoe when I've had a Sunday long run and when I go on a Monday and just look after my legs this is the shoe I've been reaching for legs feeling like they're recovering as they're going along with all of that foam absorbing the impact just looking after them really really well so who is the Hocus skyex best for it's definitely great for heavier Runners anyone that's worried about bottoming out foam and things like that you're really not going to do that in their shoe good for those slower runs anyone wanting to run a very long way at a nice casual easy run pace and just wants that super comfortable soft shoe to look after their legs for a very long time I really think there's not much better out there at the moment than the sky deex massively surprised me bought a smile to my face and really delivered and finally here on the list we have the Nike zoomfly 6 another really surprising shoe replacing the zoomfly 5 which I really did not rate zoomly 6 came out and I was like oh do I have to but this has been an absolute Joy I've just put my 100 M review up of this shoe and yeah gave it a lot of High Praise as well so the purpose of the zoomfly 6 this is your everyday race shoe a training shoe to their top end racer like the training version of the alphafly for Speed runs for long runs you do some sessions your Tempo your thresholds you can even go for an easy jog in it it's not the best shoe for that easy and Recovery jog it's really one you want to put on your feet to go fast to get your workouts done in and you can rock up on race day and have a really good time as well stack cut at the back 42 mil and an 8 mm drop overall price-wise \u00a3 1555 pretty damn good Nike offering some good value here weightwise 322 G not heavy but not light either just sort of nicely in the middle upper we've got this two layer wov mesh upper midsole wise we've got a zoom X layer of midsole which is exactly the same foam they put in their high-end ratio shoes the VAP flies and the outfly that layer of zoomx Mile for that responsive that Popp then a carbon plate and then an Eva layer underneath that again Eva for that durability and the carbon plate in there which you can't feel too much but it's definitely providing a lot of Popp as you run along outso wise again really good a nice solid layer of waffle here which I really appreciate they could have definitely skimped on this and made the shoe a bit lighter but this is a training shoe it's not all about that lightweightness with your training fantastic grip really good durability after 100 miles in their shoe and the sizing was true to size for me so why was this a big surprise but I say the zoomfly 5 was just a bit of a flop shoe for me and I'm guessing for Nike as well because I didn't see any positive reviews really about it maybe one or two people it kind of worked for some heavier Runners out there because there wasn't much choice but it was just so dead I had a lot of foam in it and I had a carbon plate in it but incredibly heavy as well I really feel like they listened to a lot of the feedback with what people are wanting on a shoe like this they've got rid of that hard D recycled foam and replaced it with a huge slab of the Nike's premium zoomx and the Eva for that training durability as well made it 10% lighter so I was really surprised when I unboxed this shoe despite not thinking it was the prettiest shoe in the world I was really excited to get on my feet and it really delivered the standout features for me really good value \u00a3 155 for a shoe this good is fantastic to have that premium foam and the carbon plate at at this price point is pretty rare and then when you compare it to something like the Pegasus plus which is even more expensive this without that carbon plate it really is that training shoe for the type of people want a bit more ground contact feel and don't want that plated ride in there but again it's a lot more expensive than this this is why this is delivering so much value for me speed-wise incredibly fast I've been wearing this for most of my interval sessions and my long run sessions I've really been surprised at the pace I'm getting versus the effort that I'm putting in of course the alphafly is going to be a little bit faster but I don't feel like oh I wish I was out here my Ally because I'm saving a lot of money by not wearing out the alha Flies but this shoe's just been super comfortable as well I'd happily run a marathon in this shoe and you don't want to spend the big money on those V flies Al flies you can happily get a marathon done in their shoe in comfort knowing that you've got something that's just 90% as good as something like the vfly airly and save that 100 plus pounds so who is the Doom fly 6 best for anyone looking for that durable comfortable shoe they can wear for their speed work those longer runs and also races when they don't want to break the bank with something like the super shoes that we do see nowadays or if you do have a pair of those Super Shoes and you don't want to wear them out too much in your training this is a great trainer option you can save those very best ones for race day so that's my list of my most surprising shoes of 2024 the good and the bad let me know your ones down in the comments below we've got our complete biggest

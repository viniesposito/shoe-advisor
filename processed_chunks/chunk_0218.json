and this is Megan with believe in the Run Robbie I love the way your hat almost matches your pants it's a beautiful did you plan it or was it just like I I didn't really plan it what it really matches is your ver 18 teens it does we talk about pallette of the year or something yeah Pet's always a word that I have trouble spelling cuz you have a cleft pallet yeah you're an artist aren you like that should be one that you know I know and that's to get the Emoji I like had to keep retyping it there it is it's confusing cuz there's the wooden palette is spelled different than a color palette right that's dumb it should just be p a l e tte but it's not and then there's pallative care if someone's dying and that has an i and an a in it does so Pala of care means that you're going to go yeah I think it's like hospice pretty much but maybe a little bit longer isn't hospice like you got a couple weeks the Robbie I if I have to go to hospice or Pala of care I give you permission written note that you can smother me with a lagoon pillow okay wow wow I'll do that is that a is that an ad spot they're hoping not let me fill out a questionnaire to see Ryan let me fill out a questionnaire to see which one will smother you the fastest yeah we could do that I think hospice sounds like a nice actually it sounds like something you put on pumpkin pie little bit H I was going to say the exact same thing can we move on from this not really making his back um and pal well palad sounds like your Pal's hanging out with you just sounds both both sound good to it's like palr Ralphie's on UNP palatable yeah dude's got he's very ill diara oh really do we need to get a lugon pillow over here stat no sorry Ralphie roll roll of did he contract a little uh dog Co when he was at the kennel I don't know but we had a night last night oh up every couple hours yeah he didn't take his chair Bundy he didn't chair Bundy sleep I don't think chair Bundy helps with that the dog Co yeah okay we'll test it out later um yeah anyway this is our TR recap episode okay did let's just start off with the fact people you don't understand the running event one day is equivalent to a regular week yeah that's actually true here's how I know because my kids were asking me about these Pok\u00e9mon cards that they had bought the day before we left the running event like they bought them online I was like they should be here today or tomorrow and it was like the next day I thought it was a week late I thought it had already been most of the week had passed and it was I think it's just we start early in the morning and then we have appointments that are like back to back to back until what 4:00 or was it 3:00 9 to 4 pretty much 4:30 and then there's get togethers afterward mhm where you you shoo and hang out it's act it's just actually a day that goes on forever like and there's just stuff the whole time actually I think Aaron our friend from Solomon described it well cuz she said one of her co-workers was going for the first time and she was like it's basically Las Vegas you're in this room where there's no windows you don't know what time it is I actually said that to someone and then they randomly just start shoving boo in your hands yeah and and they don't unfortunately there's no smoking sex there um but yeah they they have all that stuff time disappears or stays the same whatever yeah it's a basically in a casino yeah yeah except a lose except you're losing would I feel winning would I feel sorry for I I feel like no I'm just kidding but what I feel sorry for like our feet by the end of the day are trash because we've been walking around it's a cement floor for hours we're going place to place to place but I actually feel worse for the people that have to stand in the booth for that entire time like can you imagine having to stand there and you don't really go anywhere you're just kind of like yeah it's like you're in Guantanamo Bay getting you might as well add a waterboarding booth next to the pickle ball cords speaking of things that were missing that would be fun there's a staple of every running event that I've been to it's the uh untapped Maple ice cream wait before we go hard in the paint with TR okay I was not on the podcast last week oh yeah because the lovely team of Adidas invited me to the dream Retreat ladies for the ladies yeah sorry you guys weren't invited it's not like a P Diddy party or anything that's like something else yeah how much baby oil was there oh jeez there was Zero um they invited us there to try out the new Supernova rise 2 uhhuh which it turns out it's very similar to the Supernova rise one but it has a it has a nice new upper I still don't know what this super NOA is I I'm pretty sure we've reviewed it I've come to the retreat and we learn about the whole line it's a basic trainer okay it is all right um so yeah they took us out to this really nice um resort spa hotel what's it called I don't know how to pronounce it I think it might be maraval no it's m i r i v okay marival is that it it sounds like it okay I feel they were saying it differently I feel like there's place is just like to put a lot of consonants together and throw a couple vowels in and say it's a place it was pretty funny though because sa wait were you at maral Lago no this is right outside of Austin wait which one's marag like they're really trying to get those tffs taken off huh yeah right when when we checked in this was like um like a wellness Resort if you will Island I was going to say it earlier sorry they handed us a little like sleeping bag pillow for our phones as if we were going to put them away for the whole time it was a p didy party what are you kidding me no it was supposed I saw videos of him making people do that none of us use them okay okay but it's supposed to be like this I want to know the time out spot Robbie's watching P Diddy videos no I'm watching videos of him of things that happened do you know who didn't know anything about it I I told Megan no I knew about it you knew that something you wouldn't watch the videos if it came out there's oh dude I'm watching I would watch it 24/7 I'd watch the like if they had the real world P Diddy Mansion yeah I'm in yeah I mean God with with yeah but M didn't know half the stuff that was going on she was like uh yeah I guess I didn't do a deep dive on you were still doing his songs at karaoke thinking it was okay she thought she thought it was a lot of uh normal stuff going on there just maybe and I'm oh like he just had like stolen goods or something he just had too many drugs anyways all I'm going to let you talk I'm sorry Meg I it's okay it's I it's a Hot Topic I get it top of mind I'm talking about sleeping bag things for your phone which I didn't realize was triggering but apparently it is yeah anyway we had a lovely time there we we ran the shoe um Ashley Mato was there and so was Jen ader and which I told her I've been calling is it genor I've been calling her genitor forever and and she introduced herself and I was like just so you know I've said your last name wrong this entire time sounds like a Transformer something I gotta I gotta tell her Jor is so much cooler than jater that's no it actually does s it sounds like a Pokemon character really genitor yeah how many how many hit points do she have so it was lovely hanging out with them and meeting a bunch of people um your elevation on your runs were in insane yeah so it was an interesting spot for a run Retreat cuz there wasn't really anywhere to run there there's no way this is a run retreat was like a a quarter mile Trail is like half mile I think Max okay so we did some Loops um and it was up basically up on a big hill so there was quite a bit of elevation dud it was like three miles and it was like 500 ft of elevation so that's so they try to keep you from escaping is that the idea well they already took it already put her phone in a sleeping bag yeah okay uh we did some yoga we tested the shoes we learned about the whole Adidas lineup it was it was fun so do you do yoga in normal life no the last 15 minutes of the class I just laid on the I was going to say what do you how do you pretend to do that I I tried and then I gave up are you I and I should maybe know this but are you flexible no I am not okay cuz like that's the worst part about they started out with us like doing toe yoga and okay try lifting up your big toe and not all your other toes oh I did it it's really hard is that like that was like the beginning of our toe yoga session so is the idea that you're just concentrating on one toe like directing all your energy towards one toe I'm you know I don't know how this stuff works I was able to do this with the toe and this I don't I don't even know if I can move my toes I might be paralyzed yeah I I'm not sure what's happening it seems to be the whole foot that's basically what kept happening to me so that was why I ended up laying on the mat and taking a quick nap but it was lovely we did it um in front of an infinity pool overlooking Austin in its Glory so wow it's nice okay yeah it was a good time all right and then the boys arrived the boys arrived into the City and oh wait I thought you were talking about the party my bad I know we were still talking about the ddy party yeah shoot all right yeah so then me and you really want this to happen I thought I was doing now um so yeah the last week's podcast showed up uh yes and plus Jared and Taylor no Jared didn't come until later Taylor didn't getent you guys all showed up eventually we all assembled Megan featherston joined us as well and um yeah we kicked it off with a fun party with our friends at as6 and then we went straight into it yeah uh woke up Wednesday morning well I went for a run right when I we landed I said I need to get well basically I procrastinated Tuesday and yeah that was silly well but we usually run when we get there but I didn't realize how late we were getting there we didn't leave until like 11:30 well that's what I was saying I don't didn't realize how late we were getting there and so I did go on a run it was pretty nice Carl and I were so happy that we had already run though I like running when you get somewhere though it just I get it like the plane and stuff travel rust cobwebs in your mind and stuff anyway so your mind we did do the do a run and then did you run Wednesday morning I did run Wednesday morning too yeah I ran that with Flores gearan from path projects and Billy Yang I was supposed to do a workout but kind of just abandoned to have a good run and uh Billy Yang had those Rayband s those Rayband recording glasses on that's not creepy yeah I know it's like I can't you can never tell like are you just are you asking me questions to have a conversation or are you trying to interview me did you ask him if you were being recorded uh I think it shows like a light on the front if you're being record I remember you got them yeah I I had them for a little bit I I tried them out one the style that I purchased I felt was a little bit feminine for my face two okay it took really bad photos yeah the quality of the stuff was just crap but the was the video bad yeah oh I I think I think and also like why like why do you need that why do you need to video record someone with your face I actually think they'll be fantastic in a couple years and I do think you're going to want to do it just cuz like right now you pull out your phone but the glasses you could talk to so you could be like you just double tap the thing and the video comes on so your hands are free so say that you're holding a shoe that's the only case I see it working is you're doing like an unboxing or eating a sandwich you're saying it'll show things in the in the lenses no it doesn't show will your eyeballs see the things in the lenses like you are using your eyes it's got cameras on the temples yeah but I'm saying I thought you were saying it was like a what do you call it VR type thing where it show I think you're thinking AR or augmented reality yeah where it shows the directions or whatever I do think that'll happen what I did like about it though you could connect it to your phone and stuff so I was able to ask for directions and Google stuff and and uh also siries stuff so you could be like hey what's the closest taco place and it would be like okay and it would give you left left right left walk 200 feet this direction I think the one thing that he said was interesting is that if you record on it kind of all day and then make it real people people who you know who are with you they're like when did you take all that video cuzz they just people are so used to having an obtrusive camera so it's kind of unobtrusive you can it's a more natural thing than having a camera front of yeah but you especially if you just color a Sharpie over the light yeah no knows just disable light I wouldn't do that at all yeah at all Meg would be like why are you wearing glasses in the bathroom glasses um but yeah so then we what' you guys do you went on a run too went we went on a run and T backtracked before I did and ran into Connor for running a warehouse and film some content yeah jar you know that guy can't not film content yeah I mean he has the hair for it so Jared was like running with me and we were trying to get back cuz we had to get to the Nike thing oh right so they were I didn't realize that I was going to be or or was supposed to be doing any content with them so we're running back and I get a text message I'm like if you guys want to do it we got to do it now so they're out on the trail setting up the thing so right where that spiral thing is the bridge we sat at the bottom of that and we did like the shoe spotting thing that you and I did yeah but honestly I just went off the rails and just talked yeah that's the way I said I'm cranky guys I'm really tired I didn't know that we were doing this whatever then this one guy who I I don't know what the guy was doing he can see that we're filming we've got mics on there's camera up the guy just sits there and starts talking us and Connor was just too nice was he a runner guy or is he just it's it's the running event so was somebody that like knew Connor well I mean it's Austin so Austin could have been a crazy person that's true true but yeah this guy just rolled up and sat down next to us he's like he's talking I'm like you're not on mic nobody's gonna be able to hear you and Conor's let you should have just gave him your mic I know and just left yeah said you're this tapped in seems to be working out because we are doing shoe spot and he was wearing super blast too okay yeah in that nice offwhite that's a good color and then I came running by I did make sure that I wore cuz that ladybird Trail destroys your shoes yeah it does I wore those um zoomfly uh six six but the ilad kip chogi color because it already looks like it's got dirt on it so I was like okay that works it's like authentic and just going to throw this out there uh ladybird Trail so much better than PR Trail doesn't even come close I think that you could name a lot of trails and be like that's better than PR I think that's my goal is to just name every Trail that's better than priest tril that would be a good map for people like like a map of the US trails that are better than most of America it's be green over here n you GNA say you ran by uh yeah when you were filming in the vomero 18 no I didn't have it at that point I was also wearing the zoom F six I wore the zoomfly 6 that day too wow what do you think yeah I like it a lot it's gr grown me the more I wear it right I agree yeah it's the best zoom fly there's ever been oh for sure that's not even close and I know we don't want to jump too far ahead but Nike right now I don't care what you think about the brand they're really starting to kill it in the daily stuff there's like three or four shoes now that I'm like it's about time honestly these are really good okay I'm interested to I haven't run the vomo vomero 18 which we then got that about 30 minutes after that run M's already got 20 miles in it I ran in this morning okay it's a it's definitely the best vomero all right and it should have been and now it's got 46 mm in the heel you know I'm like that is it really 46 yeah that's what they said good Jo for the video people yeah I got it you got it yep that's this one 46 in the heel that's what they said from 40 to 46 that seems wild what do you think how would you describe the ride M um like a neutral daily trainer it's not super light it's going to have a little bit of structure and support to it um I did think it was pretty stable yeah I mean it's got a pretty wide platform so definitely nice and stable it's it's like a Workhorse it's not like um a light fun bouncy ride but it's it's funny it's funny you said Workhorse cuz this should have been the Pegasus that's what I also I think that's what we said about the last fero too I think sure what they're doing with the peg right now like this has really nice 4 foot cushioning I do like this the layer of zoomx they I don't think they should it's misleading to put the giant zoomx here because I did think that was interesting they do that with all their shoes I know it's really a thin layer of zoomx underneath your foot oh really this isn't the zoomx react x no not at all nice you can see the line where it zoomx it actually on the back it has an arrow that says zoomx and then react oh the zoomx is the top layer I got you yeah okay but this feels really good the upper fits great the lock down is nice I even dig like you don't see this tongue around that much anymore but it's nice padded tongue it's gusseted on the sides yeah it's it's pretty sweet I think you'll dig it I haven't put it on the scale is that the scale Under Computer yeah we can try it I feel like it's away something something so yeah we're supposed to go do a run with Nike but they plan their run a little late we had a 9:30 appointment so we uh it's almost 12 ounces that's a big boy they said a game that's a chunky but they also said it's like this isn't a shoe that necessarily needs to be super light so yeah right about that um yeah so shees keep getting heavier Robbie yeah I think they people were fed up with the lightweights you know what else no go ahead oh no go ahead I was going to say but the but the ratios are getting even ligher so it's true so you take these off and like but it is interesting going to the running event we'll talk about we'll just we'll walk through some of the highlights that we saw but one of the interesting things is how messaging changes from year to year so remember two or three years ago sustainability was like everybody was talking about it and there was green shoes and Eco shoes and this and that everybody was like here's our carbon footprint do you hear anybody mention it this not a not a word once not once yeah I mean it's still like on on their Pages they'll say uh this is biodegradable this is whatever even as6 is putting their carbon footprint in the Shoe Right does anyone even know what that number means that means nothing no and the thing is it just goes to prove the point like we had said before like if the shoe feels good and will help you run miles and do that people are willing to be like maybe be sustainable in other areas of their life but you're you're making a product that you're making thousands of that is made of rubber and different materials and yeah I ride my bike to work every day so I can wear whatever shoe I want yeah that is true that's how that works even in the cold yeah it's even nicer in the cold I feel like I don't I don't know depends depends what you're wearing anyways but yeah um the so Ralphie shut the do you need me get the Lagoon pillow get the lagon Carl get the lagon pillow it's okay buddy all right um so highlights of highlights of the we doing it by day or just in general we can it honestly doesn't matter because no one knows what I don't know what day it was but let's start with the low light the low light I start to mention oh yeah every year they have an ice cream truck that we get so jazzed about soft serf maple syrup flavored ice cream it's like the most lovely treat in the middle of a Las Vegas day yeah and they showed up this year s's truck no truck I it's funny that we both went with s's truck that's how it works uh it was it it was disappointing for a couple reasons one I love that ice cream yeah and two I mean what's going on with them that they can't afford the ice cream truck anymore I don't know I guess it should be a sponsor of this podcast that will sell more maple syrup or maybe we need to do free spots for them so that we can get the truck ice cre truck we could just have a get the ice cream truck for every episode leading up to tr we'll give you free year-long sponsorship if you just bring the ice cream truck back yeah that's the deal I mean I'm in and I finally figured out that hack last year where I took the the honey Stinger waffle or the unta waffle and dipped it into the ice cream and then chunk it up and put it in man that was nice it's basically like a DQ Blizzard but handmade all right first check in man this is going to be a long podcast so buckle up anyway we're covering all the stuff from Trey and one of my favorite things to do is it like think about this you're out there running right now doesn't always feel the best but sometimes it does and the times that I really like having that Fitness is when we go on these trips so I can run with friends and get together with people so if you don't are lacking a little motivation right now think about just staying in shape so that if something fun pops up I don't know could be a turkey Tru could be a holiday 5K who knows what's happening but just uh stay fit over the winter here and uh you'll be in good shape to run with friends and have a good time all right guys element is still a sponsor of this podcast but for a limited time they're offering their chocolate medley oo that sounds pretty delicious you know it's not like the you're not going to put that in your bubbly water no you could could you you could uh you want it heated up I think yeah some hot water with either the chocolate mint the chocolate chai or the chocolate raspberry I've heard it's pretty good in coffee too you could also put it in your coffee okay would you do it before your run yeah okay some hot coffee some chocolate medley I do like a mocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also our offer is still available so you can go to element.",

that's where we're going Adventure day monk day all right let's figure this out woohoo I got to think for 2 minutes give me 2 minutes I'll check back in on the distance I'm going to make some guesses see if we're see if we're accurate [Music] we're going 29 miles 2800 vertical feet that's the guest for today oh Nelly let's just say not ready for this not the fitness level is quite low right now it's almost Christmas we're just enjoying pumpkin pie but that's okay we got an [Music] adventure 5 and 1/2 miles in woo get a little get a little AA one second here M okay hey Loops patience give yourself a little Grace 3 years we've been in the new house I'm believe I you know 3 years that's seems like seems like yesterday well really the only concern about moving from the little Peno house to the bigger house for the family was that I lost access no at the old house we had lived there true love and I for 9 years 9 years at the old house and I had the loops dialed in as a runner so I was a little concerned moving to the new house because it's like all right I got to go discover a whole new neighborhood a whole new Bear Creek State Park where I'm at right now and figure out what is the exact mileage kilometers miles however you want to track it for all of these Loops all right and then about a week ago right around Thanksgiving it dawned on me wait a minute what if I connected that loop with that Loop with that Loop how and that's what I made the guess a minute ago how big is this Loop going to be let's go on an adventure and find out and so that's what we're doing today but I just want to little tip of the day give yourself a year two years I I always say two years to figure out how big or sorry how how are my Loops going to develop from my front door all right so you will know here's my 5 m Loop here's my 10m Loop here's my 23 Mile Loop and today I'm guessing guessing about 29 mies I really don't know that's my guess so we'll see I'll tell you at the end and remember the 20m fkt I did about 6 weeks ago just about a mile back as I was reflecting on what I was going to share with you right now I was like wait a minute oh my my depending on what today's Loop is I could connect the 20m fkt that I snagged the mini Falcon Punch to this Loop that I'm on today and then are we looking at a are we looking at a 50 m loop from my front door on this is where it gets exciting everybody on I'm going to say today is going to be about 70% on dirt and we live in the city and so if you can you know for me I love running on dirt I love the trails I love the vert if you can find those Loops that have some dirt even better all right [Music] Ice Ice Baby [Music] woo I wonder how many mountain lions cross through here this feels like mountain lion territory right through here keep your eyes up everybody haven't said that in a while eyes up pum boms quick feet you can't really see it but there's the mile high city way out there Denver Colorado this is definitely the best view of Denver in the city up here on Green Mountain all right time for a little little snack [Music] [Music] let's see your uh hoodie Joseph yeah guys enjoying a snack y nice there it is come on good job what do you see more more more okay okay did he finish it no h fin it me Michael we his dogs oh all right you guys enjoying your snack oh yeah all right beautiful day for a snack on the patio you want to see it Henry [Music] yeah [Music] crazy you little monkeys they're hungry after school I love you called sweet home or to to practice home home a little heavy whipping cream little honey little Irish Breakfast Don't Mind If I Do shout out to uh Duncan over on the Emerald Isle miss you Duncan hope you're doing well over there all right you see my gut reaction I was a little off on the mileage I have a feeling I was quite off on the vertical gain all right let me pull up straa here so uh question of the day what um when was the last time you connected a couple of your Loops to make a bigger Loop and what was that experience like today was three of my Loops into one all right and what did I say this morning 29 miles 2800 vertical feet I believe all right so it ended up at not bad not bad 30 all right EX exactly 30.5 mil 30.5 so I was a mile and a half off so basically a 50k you know not too shabby and what did I say 2,800 vertical feet oh my my that's pretty good 3150 3143 so 3,143 vertical feet for the uh for the 30m loop that was awesome and again oh I just I bring up today's Vlog and the topic because you wherever you live in the world whether it's Singapore or Ecuador or Chile or uh Northern Canada wherever you're at you're at it's going to take time to discover your loops and today I found my 50k Loop like there it is and a lot of vert you know a decent amount of vertical gain but it's just fun to build upon what you've are upon the foundation of okay that was a that was my 13 Mile Loop my uh uh let's see 23 Mile Loop and then also a 26 M basically I combined three Loops together is what happened today and it turned out to be right at 50k 30.5 miles very cool all right love you all cheers have a great day and onward and upward all right we'll toss it to uh I don't know I guess another long run somewhere somewhere in the archive right there right there seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

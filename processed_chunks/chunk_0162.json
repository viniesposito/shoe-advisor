  "text": "hi this Thomas with believe in the run this is Robbie with believe in the r Robbie you having an incred day incred incred you'll see why this is confusing in a [Music] second so we're taking a look here at the Endorphin trainer which looks a lot like the uh Kara Pro so in fact it's pretty much the replacement for the sakon Kara Pro shoe that came out in 2023 that was an interesting shoe I didn't like it yeah it seemed to fall a little bit flat with us a lot of bit flat it was like this trying to do a bunch of things in a shoe that was maybe a super trainer but maybe not it kind of replaces the shift right so then there is the Endorphin shift no more so that SHO gone this is this one is now here that kind of combines both the cavar pro and endorfin shift into this allnew model there's kind of a lot to talk about and then and yet there isn't in a way let's start what we normally do let's let's break down the upper right yeah so the upper on the shoe is an engineered mesh upper it's kind of not that I don't know not Innova it's an it's an upper yeah yeah it's pretty standard is what Robbie's trying to get at there's not a lot of overlays the mesh itself is what's going to make that structure to this upper you get in it has a nice puffy tongue that is paded enough but not overly paded it's gusseted you've got your basic laces on here Robbie I'm I'm getting spoiled with laces though are you I I guess so these are these floppy style laces like ribbon laces it's like annoying to tie I know it's a petty thing to say but I'm just there's certain laces that drive me crazy and I feel like these are one of those yeah all right Robbie so the ER for me fits fairly nicely true to size size 10 and 1 half no issues with the fit it's not the most exciting the padding in the collar works there's no heel lift but there's something about it maybe it's cuz it's white when I tow down look at this kind of looks like a nurse shoe yeah I could see that um I mine was I feel like I'm always floating between two different sizes these days I felt like there was a little I mean this is a size I always wear in salony I felt like it was a little roomy for me um did you experience that at all no my felt true to size I didn't have any issues with that it reminded me of the Endor fit speed fit so whatever if you have the Endor speed if you've experience that reminds me very similar to that the newer one anyways um yeah it has that I guess that's the PB power on PB midsole material that I do like that Sak has been putting this in as their uh foot insole yeah like you do get some nice bounce off of this it does feel good it adds a little extra Comfort but the real secret to this thing is is moving down a step yeah so you have the incred Run top layer foam this is an all new foam from sakon that uh it's their high performance soft bouncy energetic peba style foam if you will I love it in the elite it feels amazing it's bouncy it kind of tunes up as you pick up the pace it kind of firms it changes characteristics depending on how you're running on it and in this case it might get killed a little bit yeah and this is I don't know if he said the name this is called incred run mhm which is uh incredibly maybe the worst foone name I've ever heard in my entire existence as a shoe riewer I it might be out there there's there's bound to be some worse worse ones but it doesn't make sense cuz you would think in credit run maybe that rhymes with something or it's a play on words but it's just a combination of two words that don't incredible run doesn't even but saying it doesn't go together there's no I don't know anyways um it's English major over here yeah it's just it's phonetically farce far vericle vericle vericle foam so it is soft though for sure it is and it is an improvement over the kimara pro of the last one this feeling does have a nice step bounce to it initially and if anything I feel like you're going to find out the plates in here but what really kills the shoe is this power run there is a 3/4 length carbon fiber plate inside the shoe uh it utilizes their what they call you got it uh speedroll speedroll technology which you know is to make your foot roll through the stride 8 mm drop uh yeah 42 mm in the heel 34 in the 4 foot so pretty pretty high stack shoe so you would think okay High stack shoe it's going to feel like a maybe Max cushion shoe or something like the super blast in that vein and then you get down to this bottom layer power on foam which is basically the same thing as the convar pro in fact this shoe is almost everything's almost exactly the same as the canar pro except they swapped out they swapped out the power on PB with a layer of inceton the result is pretty much the same this is a case where I feel like the juice isn't worth the squeeze you have all these components in there you have this incred Ron foam you have a three4 plate you have this power run underneath of it they're trying to make this a super trainer and what it ends up feeling like is a basic trainer like I I've been running in the sakon ride and honestly I think it actually has a better underfoot feel than this year and what's interesting about this is that the S markets this or places this as an uptempo shoe and I don't know where that's coming from at least in the bar prod it I think it weigh under 10 oz this one weighs 11 oz for your for size 10 and 12 which is pretty 310 gram for those of you on the metric system yeah so that's in a lot of daily even just for a daily trainers on the heav side so I'm not sure where they're getting the uptempo part of this because the other thing about the power run is it's super dense like you can't squeeze that at all this reminds me like when I pull up old shoes and I'm like I can't believe we ran in this and then I feel this foam I'm like I can't believe they're still making a foam like this right so it's clearly uh different drometer than a lot of the power own we've seen in past shoes like the ride or the guide things like that and I will say it does feel on Landing a little bit softer because of the syred run as opposed to the power run PB from last year's from the kar Pro but it's not enough to mitigate the thick slab of power run underneath it just starts to feel kind of clunky Under Foot and any I think when I first started going out the door you get that incred run feel and you're like okay this could this could be a nice Improvement by mile three or four that's kind of worn off that's exactly and then you just feel like you're running in a regular yeah almost firm trainer and this to me if you're going to be at the price point they're at which is what 160 180 180 even higher than I was thinking then you're up against other super trainers and while this has super trainer features like the plate two different Foams the sandwich situation going on down there you're like okay but for 180 mm- they're trying to throw in all these ingredients from different shoes that they're trying to streamline and it comes together in this shoe that has no real purpose like I feel like there's a lot of super trainers that do take the premium top layer of foam and then the more standard Eva layer and do it right I mean we talked about the Mach X2 the Boston 12 um what was the from aidos verbero just did it yeah you got there's a bunch of shoes that combine Foams to give you stability underneath a really soft foam and light in a lighter package in a lighter well not always the vomo is a little bit heavier but this one it it is it's baffling to me because you have in this line the Endorphin speed is what people are using what I think the shoes intended to be right so that I don't know how and it's $10 cheaper so I'm not sure how you can W it's $10 cheaper than this yeah so I'm not sure how you could pick this over the speed I know this is supposed to be more uptempo than the speed because the speed kind of over the last couple years has gotten more of daily trainer is but I would take the speed over this for sure any day as6 has something like the magic speed 4 which is a PL it Tempo shoe and it's not the best shoe like the ride is a little bit firm underneath some people love it some people don't I actually kind of liked it and that's not the best shoe but it fits right where it's supposed to like it does what it's supposed to do it's a budget like racer and then I don't know I just don't even know where to put this shoe well it feels like they're trying to wedge this in they had the convar they were calling it kvar pro but the kar was a low stack fast uptempo shoe when they made the kar Pro it's like all of a sudden it's got this High stack it's got a plate in it it's like why is that a Kar I think they were like heard the feedback from reviewers and from other people testing it like how is this even related to a convar so now they're like okay we'll drop it into the Endorphin line which makes sense and keep it going but this shoe could have been something I think yeah I mean that's what it's hard for me to figure out because socony does have all the ingredients to make a really nice super trainer this power run isn't one of the ingredients incred run incred run is great and in the elite it sings Yeah and maybe maybe that's something coming next year I don't know where it's something like this super blast that has a that premium foam in it where it's you know maybe it's even plateless but it still has that nice light ride to it I don't know maybe that's coming but I don't really know I just don't know what to do with this what's crazy is that I can't believe this is being made after the kar Pro it wasn't like that was a popular Sho but they probably already had this in production when when that guy started there is something about this shoe that I feel like you know when there's like a you feel a shoe and you're like I bet I could like this like I bet if I I could like find I like this shoe and there is something about it where I do I felt that about the kar Pro even but it's not enough to get me like past the the down the negatives of it okay I kind of get what you're saying last year I did the kar Pro and then I saw some other reviewers review it and they're like oh no they liked it and I was like well maybe I you know maybe I just need to try it on this was like months after the review I'll try it on again to see maybe if I got it wrong or something yeah and I put it on I went for a run I was like nah I shouldn't have put I shouldn't have put it back on this shoe just isn't working right now with what they have going my biggest complaint is going to be this power run foam is just dense there's no life to it it sucks the life out of the incred run it's just not a fun shoe to really run in it becomes what I would expect from your 130 120 daily trainer feel underfoot and then even the out soole it has they added some bits of rubber here uh Max track I think it was Max track to the outsole to give it some a little bit of grip that the last one didn't have but it's still most exposed carbon rubber which I mean I don't know it's probably fine but it's not you're not getting a ton of rubberized Eva there yeah you're not getting a ton of grip out of it um so yeah I guess we can get to the should we shall we score oh and by the way this comes out March uh 1st 2025 shall we get to we've given it a GL review I bet you can't wait to pick it up so yeah I guess we can get to our scoring of this for form I'm going to give it a two I think the especially for the price for 180 the upper seems kind of pedestrian this power run if you couldn't tell already through the review just sucks the life out of the shoe for me so I'm going to on that also didn't like the laces um same thing going to give it to too uh let's go to the fit so how the shoe fit overall on the foot everything else for me it fits fine true to size I didn't have any issues so I'm going to give it a little step up there with a three yeah I'm going to give it a two I thought it was a little roomy didn't didn't love the overall fit of it um it was okay and that's a two so and then we'll go for last one functions so that's the overall ride performance if this was a 120 shoe in the $120 price range shoe I would say oh it's pretty decent for a daily trainer kind of feel but knowing this supposed to go in the super trainer category up against shoes that we really love up in in those like you're getting close to super blast price you're getting close to a lot of the shoes that have the high-tech that they're using in their race day shoes this one just Falls flat for me on that so I'm I'm going to give it a one yeah same thing going to give it a one I just don't think that this shoe needs to exist U that's kind of harsh but I don't I know I just saw tear roll out of it in the world of the Endorphin speed which does probably pretty much what this is supposed to do in most scenarios and then you have the ride and I mean I don't know that you really need this shoe so I didn't love it thought was blocky and bricky so for the score I mean Carl Sal with put it up there so red mine would be red your yours would be barely yellow so is it even barely yellow six six is technically yellow still if you were them and clearly they want three shoes in the Endorphin line MH you've got well actually you've got four now because you have the elite you have the pro you have the speed what's your fores shoe what what would you put there I mean I'm wondering it's it's interesting that they just did away with the power on PB altogether I wonder if you did the power on PB with that plate to stabilize it a little bit full length plate maybe and then the incred run on top so you still get fully bouncy don't you think that would be the speed though pretty much like you're tuning the speed that's the power that's still is the new the new speed's getting all I I think the pro and the speed are going to still be on the um Power on PB yeah here's what I'm thinking if I had the fores shoe in there let's do one without a plate let's put a really nice foam in there maybe it is a tuned up sandwich of incred run top layer and like you were going for power run PB underneath of it to kind of give it a little more stability and you could tune that power run PB to be a little F I mean even if you just use a different drometer for the power run because I know the past versions of shoes did not have this dense of power run like the ride and some some of the other models so if you could like I said there are other brands who have done the Eva bottom layer fine and it actually creates a great ride so I don't think you have to necessarily uh go away from that but in the same way in a year from now you might we might have moved on from the Eva since hardly anyone's using it anyways so yeah check out all the rest of our sing videos make sure you subscribe and like this video If you disagree feel free to leave a comment and make sure you will you read it yeah that we're going to make Carl read back to us yeah and uh check us out on Instagram sign up for the weekly email anything else I'm forgetting no you pretty much nailed merry happy holidays yep see [Music] you yours will be barely yellow so is it even barely yellow six six is technically yellow still yeah okay well I'll take it down it's all right anyway found it down yellow",

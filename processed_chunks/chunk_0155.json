  "text": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel and welcome to Boston I'm here for the 128th Boston Marathon in a couple of days I am beyond excited potentially hopefully I'm sure we will be completing my fifth ever major on Monday my first Boston the nerves and the excitement are building so so much just absolutely pumped we taking part in this legendary race one of the most famous running races anywhere in the world here we've got a actionpack video for you coming up today we're going to be going to the Expo talking about my kit got a big ShakeOut run to go to and of course all my goals and expectations for the race but for now it's Saturday morning I've just keyed in a 10k run into my watch and we heading out for a little ShakeOut jog we got here quite late last night I'm a little bit jetlagged but overall super excited for this and thank you guys you make this all possible for me to come and run races like this but thank you so much we'll catch up out on the Run [Music] that is the Run done 10K 44 minutes a little bit faster we did have a few GPS issues with all the to building TR here so probably more like 45 minutes let's uh have a quick shower and get up to the Expo really enjoyed that what a lovely place to [Music] run right guys here we go we made it down to the Expo super excited we pick it right now I've been treat me of this for so many years taking my running seriously for I don't know about 10 years or so and yeah I've run quite a few big qes over the years but it's never really panned out to actually get here and come and pick up my number and run the race I just get my phone out and just see what number I am we are 1,8 right oh we're right here let's go have a look hi afternoon how you doing good here's your runner's bag thank you all right congratulations for your first marathon thanks very much thank you thank you [Music] just heading through all the merch area now at the moment it's just absolutely crazy uh but a little bit overpriced for us the jackets are $120 oh we don't want to go in the checkout we're not buying a thing if you don't know about Boston to get into the marathon I I actually don't even know what race are you to get in but you have to run qualifying time so about four fths about sort of 80% of the field will have run that qualifying time to get into the race for people in like 18 to 35 men you've got to run a sub three hour and then go a little bit faster than that as well because it's just the fastest around about 30 35,000 people that do the race that actually sort of get in and uh yeah the other sort of fifth of people are all sorts of like sponsor places or people doing International tour operating places that sort of things so you don't have to technically run the bigy but Myers you kind of should do really kind of it's what it's all about running your BQ and coming here to [Music] celebrate Sarah now you're on this side of me you can speak into the microphone how excited are you for the London Marathon exp spr next weekend yes I'm very excited I know that doesn't sound like I am but I am excited you've got the contrast of me and Sarah but uh yeah we'll be at London Marathon Expo next weekend uh we've got a stand there so be week next whole week Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday we've got a stand there with all of our running hats and our tops and our gear and all of that sort of stuff loads of you guys are going to come down hopefully and say hello let us know if you're going to be there uh stand f82 I think we're really nervous about it never done anything like this before I've only ever sold online this our first ever like inperson thing really looking forward to it and uh yeah can't wait to see you guys there [Music] so on this massive board behind me is the list of six star finishes I'll hopefully be joining them soon um if I finish Boston I don't to keep saying that I'm sure we'll finish Boston on Monday but uh you never know with me let's be honest um then I'll only have Tokyo to do which we may try and do next year I have got in touch with a couple of the travel companies I've tried to get in so many times just one of those things it's all a bit complicated I don't really know but I am hopefully going to be trying my ab to get into Tokyo Marathon next year so we can finish it off and get my six star finish probably before it goes to Seven Stars um and then we'll have to go to Sydney to finish that one off everyone getting their norm tech legs done getting nice and recovered before Monday it's keeps see so weird to say the RAC is on Monday but yeah Patriots Day in Boston um the I think it's always the third week end in April it's always on the Monday it's always on the special day well guys we're heading away from the Expo that it's all done and then we're just going to head out up the road here so you might see behind me because that is the Finish Line Of The B marathon where we will be on uh Monday so yeah really excited for that anyway awesome I'm sorry I messed up your recording there no worries good luck take we've got the uh cyber truck just on display just over here actually saw one this morning on my on my run haven't seen any of those in the UK they're not coming to the UK anyway but uh as a car fanatic probably one of my biggest Hobbies it's uh quite nice to see my first cyber [Music] Tru right walking back through the Finish Line what is going to be on the clock when we cross that well I don't know I have I get my excuses out the way first but I had about 5 weeks off running in February with a hamstring like strain which was really rubbish so I haven't really done any workouts this year my mileage has been all right but right here right now apart from Rolling my ankle a bit this morning on this morning's run um we're kind of okay so I'll take anything on a sub 250 will be a really good run I'm here just to have a laugh make a good video experience Heartbreak Hill and just experience the mass magic of the race all my big training will be focused on Valencia at the end of the year just want to have an amazing experience out there so yeah sub 250 Happy Days with that I'll set off a little bit faster and just see see how we go but I've really got no idea to be honest cuz I haven't been done any proper long workouts my longest run so far this year is about 25k so yeah we'll [Music] [Music] see so we're going to go and grab some lunch and we'll see you in the morning for the ShakeOut run really looking forward to that but yeah need to get some uh good fuel inside those Newton Hills Heartbreak Hill I'm not going to get up that alone so we need to get some good fuel into these legs for the next couple of days so I hope you follow enjoyed for along today and we'll see you bright and early in the morning for the ShakeOut [Applause] [Music] thank you so much for coming down and joining me and Eric thanks everybody for coming out today I don't know how many people

the Nike vaporfly version 3 my old trusty ones now I have got the new new aex meta speed Sky p and Edge Sky Edition in now so we test those out next week I really want to use that shoe for some of my upcoming races but I hav't just haven't had enough time to put enough miles in that so maybe using that in London next week depends how much training I can do next week we' got so much uh just going using the source Inlet finally I get to race in this version of The Source Inlet we've sold out of it twice now and I haven't even managed to run in it myself yet so uh yeah really cool new design uh check it out but there won't be much left on the website soon just managed to go and pick up some bagels and jam for my breakfast no toaster though in the hotel so you're going to be just a bit odd

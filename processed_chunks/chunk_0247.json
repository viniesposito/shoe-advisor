  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 which is not this shoe it's this shoe and the New Balance SC Trainer V3 which is this [Music] shoe so the Nike zoomfly 6 and the New Balance SC Trainer V3 are both plated training shoes or super trainers they're designed to be partner shoes to the top Racing shoes in the new balance and Nike ranges or shoes can indeed stand in for Racing shoes whilst also being very versatile daily trainers as well zoomfly is the cheaper shoe especially in the UK it's 155 or $170 whereas the SC Trainer V3 is $180 in the US and a pretty wild \u00a3230 in the UK the zoomfly 6 is the lighter shoe is 266 G or 9.4 o whereas the New Balance SC Trainer V3 is 278 G or 9.8 o the Nike has an 8 mm drop and a stack height of 42 mm at the heel 34 at the 4T and New Balance has a 6 mm drop and a stack height of 40 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the forefoot comes to the design of the shoes with a Nike you've got a two-layer woven mesh uper quite a bit of padding around the heel of the collar of the shoe there and a fairly significant internal heel counter as well to add some support you have a dual density midsole the top layer is Nike's bouncy zumax foam which is you the best foam in its range the stuff using its Racing shoes and then you have an sr2 carrier Pham beneath that to add a slightly more durable and stable material beneath the zoomx and then between those two B you've got a full length carbon plate and then you have a waffled tread out soole good coverage on the foref foot little bit at the heel there as well and a big cutout in the middle that reduces the weight and shows off the carbon plate and then with the New Balance you've got a phantom fit engineered mesh upper and then you've got a fuel cell midso which is all made from the same material it's not a dual density Mell or anything like that it is the 20% peber 80% Eva blend of fuel cell I believe you balance tweaks the makeup of fuel cell quite a lot so it's Racing shoes it's full peber and that kind of thing but it's still a pretty light weight and bouncy foam you've got a carbon plate that's forked under the for foot to reduce a little bit of weight there like the Nike you've got a big cutout on the bottom of the shoe that shows off the carbon plate and brings the weight down and then similar rubber coverage to the Nike shoe as well with good for foot coverage couple of strips at the back there so all the key impact areas are covered and both shoes have been pretty good for me in terms of grip and I've seen no signs of wear and tear on that out soole after over 100k of use in [Music] both come to the fit of the two shoes I've got a uk9 in both shoes which is my normal size with a Nike that's a US1 and that's the size I've used across Nike shoes for many years got no concerns at all with the fit of the Nike zoomly 6 really comfortable shoe it's maybe a little bit closer around the toe than some of Nike's more cushioned training shoes but I've got enough room there for long runs and yeah all around a really comfortable fit with a new balance it's a US 9.5 so it is a little bit smaller in than the Nike in terms of us sizing and I think you do have a little bit less room around the toes as a result but the fit is still really good for me got less padding around the back of the shoe but it's still comfortable there holds the foot well I've not had any he heel rub which has been a problem on some New Balance shoes that have launched this year and overall the fit's been pretty comfortable even if the Nike I think has a slightly more accommodating and you know padded upper for daily [Music] training onto run test then and these are both shoes that I've enjoyed using a lot during my marathon training in particular for the Valencia Marathon which I didn't end up running but I did a lot of training for and these two shoes were really enjoyable for it after over 100k in each of them because they are ideal for kind of longer sessions easy to steady long runs progression runs that kind of thing they really tick off all those runs really well and I think they do pretty much an equally good job of it they're both fantastic shoes that have a really nice relaxed side to them so they feel comfortable at easier paces and on long runs but they do have a lot of pace there if you do start to push the pace in them which you need to in those long sessions so they New Balance with the shoe I tested first and it was a pleasant surprise actually I wasn't a huge fan of the first two versions of the shoe the first one was just bit too big it was bouncy but it was just a bit too big I think to really enjoy for anything fast at all and then the second version was a bit lifeless and I do really like the foam in this third version of the shoe I think it has a nice responsive Edge whil it's being comfortable obviously it's not a full peber midsole and stuff like that and you can get hung up on the details a bit too much I think because just based on how it feels it feels really nice on the run you do get a nice bit of energy return when you are going to run faster but it is also a very comfortable shoe for more relaxed runs I did do you know several sessions in the shoe including like sessions on Double Days and I think it excels up until about my marathon pace so I think the fastest session I did was probably something like 10 * 1K at around marathon pace and it you know feels really good for that I did a four time 4K session in it as well and a 15 M progression run and all those runs felt really good once you push past to kind of faster race Paces you know Flatout efforts doesn't feel as Lively and Nimble and as exciting as some of the shoes on the market and that's actually the case to be fair with the Nike as well but I do think it's probably got a little bit more punch and push when you are at those fast Paces just like the New Balance I found the Nike and a really big step up on past versions of the shoe like the last two couple of zoomfly shoes I think have been really heavy and just not at all what I'd consider a super trainer they were kind of you fairly okay easy and Long Run shoes but you know you're paying a lot of money for a shoe that didn't really do much when it came to trying to run fast and the new version is a fast shoe I've done similar sessions actually to the New Balance but I've probably pushed the Nike a bit harder and done some faster sessions did a 10 times one mile in it I've done a hard 45 minute progression run you know pretty solid steady 15 Mile as well and just have really enjoyed it at all times you have that really comfortable upper and relaxed feel underf foot at easy Paces you really notice actually when warming up and coing down in this shoe but then it has the punch and the propulsion you're looking for when it comes to those far sessions in between those warm-ups and cool downs and fast sessions in general again I think it excels right up to those Marathon paced efforts and sessions when you start to look at faster sessions there are super trainers I'd rather be in things like the hok max to the Endorphin speed 4 but you can do them in a Nike and you can to be fair also do them in New Balance they they're bigger shoes they feel Cruiser they don't really feel like super aggressive shoes for those fast sessions but you know you can run fast in them they are good enough for those sessions and then they have that really nice comfortable feel that cruisy feel when you're not going flat out and want a shoe to kind of run at controlled paces and longer session or just run easy in fact also I'd say that both have felt pretty stable to me you know for high stack shoes with soft Foams in them and that kind of thing I haven't really had any concerns about stability when running on of you know standard Pavements with things like cambers and broken up bits and stuff like that so that's a plus point I think for both shoes because they've achieved that stability without going for a really heavy design with a really wide base or anything like that so yeah all round just really good shoes you can use for a mix of everything did do a short run where both shes at the same time the Nike did feel a little bit softer than New Balance for me especially at the heel I also think you get a slightly more punch feel from it when you come off the toes you think the plate in the shoe maybe just delivers a little bit more punch off the toes and you get from the balance but it is pretty close to call all around also has that really nice padded upper which it's not something I really look out for in super trainers and that kind of thing as long as it's comfortable enough then that's fine but this is a shoe a super trainer that excels on Comfort the balance is comfortable but actually the Nike does feel very good to slip on each and every day for daily training when I was running aoes at the same time I did also noticed that the extra foam you get in the New Balance under the for foot there so like I said I think you get a little bit more kind of lift and push from the Nike when you roll through onto that 4 foot but does feel like a more cushion shoe under the 4 foot than you balance no problems with discomfort on the Nike on longer runs I think there is enough cushioning there but your balance probably just has that little bit more you know Comfort under the for foot with the extra foam you have there the slightly lower drop think the Nike rolls you through a little bit more aggressively onto the forefoot which is good as long as it doesn't end up being uncomfortable it doesn't for me with the Nike but you probably get a slightly more cruisy roll through with the new balance and maybe that will be more comfortable for some [Music] people it comes to the verdict I think the Nike Z 6 and the New Balance SC Trainer V3 do a similar job and they do it very well they are very versatile daily trainers that really Excel on the comfortable side of things and still have a lot of speed you not maybe as much speed as things like the hok X2 and the Sak endorphin speed 4 but you have more comfortable shoes here in terms of the upper and the underfoot feel and the kind of more relaxed Vibe they have when it comes to easy runs daily training runs progression runs that kind of thing they they really do work really well for it and they still do have pace so I do think they have a similar feel and do a similar job but I do think the Nike does it a bit better I think you get a little bit more range from the Nike in terms of the allout speed if I was just picking one of these shoes to stand in as a racing shoe instead of a full you know kind of carbon Super Shoe I would pick the Nike I think it has that a little bit extra pace for fast workouts as well and actually I think it also has a slightly more comfortable design in terms of the upper for daily training as well so New Balance ticks a lot of boxes does them all really well but I think the Nike ticks all the same boxes and actually I think it does all of those boxes just that little bit better so I prefer all around for sure the price is also a big factor especially in the UK in the UK this isn't really a contest cuz New Balance has got a silly price but you know even if it came down in price to the same price as the Nike I'd be picking the Nike in the US the price is closer but yeah I still do prefer the feel of the Nike Zoom fly 6 underfoot not writing off new balance is a bad shoe at all I really liked running in it but I think the Nike just does the same kind of stuff a little bit better and it's the one I'd pick out of this pair for [Music] sure that's our comparison of the Nike Zoom fly 6 and the New Balance SC Trainer V3 let us know what you think in the comments below how have you found the super trainers that have come out this year have you tested a few of them is there any that you've really preferred out of the main ones I've mentioned here the Nike the New Balance the Hoka max2 the Sak Dophin speed 4 even the super blast for extending it to non PL to choose but yeah do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we will see you next time on the channel",

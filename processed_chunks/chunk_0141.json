  "text": "a hybrid shoe or road to Trail shoe is a cross between a road shoe and a trail shoe something that is cushioned to support you when you're pounding the Pavements but also grippy enough to keep you upright when you're going along at some more challenging terrain shoes like this are super popular with Runners at this time of year who want to dip their toe into the trail world and don't want to fully commit to a trail shoe just yet plus they're really great winter option when you could be running on a lot of wet and slippery roads and can do with some increased traction that shoes like this offer so today I've gathered together my three top Road trail shoes one from Nike one from Hoka and one from Salamon we're going to be putting through a full test going through all my likes my dislikes of each one and see which one of these comes out on top all of these shoes here on test today are all neutral shoes and all hybrid and rotor trail shoes are not going to be perfect in really deep wet winter muddy boggy conditions or super technical Trails running through the mountains equally you're don't going to be sing any 5k PBS and shoes like this they're the best of both WS pretty good on the road and pretty good on the trail and perfect for this time of year as always I bought all three of these shoes 100% with my money to give you that completely unbiased 100% honest review so you can get the right shoes on your feet right starting out the first one we've got here is the Nike Trail 5 this sent me back \u00a3130 here in the UK stack height at the back 38 mm we're in a drop overall of 9 1/2 mm Weight Wise this came in at 344 Browns and my UK size 12 midsole we've got Nike's all new react X which is exactly the same midsole as you see in the Nike Pegasus version 41 we'll link to that video up here if you're looking for a new road shoe potentially in terms of the outsole we've got some 3.2 mm lug and we've got Nike's own allterrain compound here as well there is unfortunately no wide option in the shoe although the width is good but there is a waterproof version a gortex version here and it was true to size for me right let's get stuck into my likes first things first as I just alluded to it's a nice wide toe box here lots of room in the standard shoe Unfortunately they haven't got a wide option but they don't really need one because the stand one has got loads of room for a good footplay if you thought version 4 was a little bit on the narrow side this is definitely improved in version 5 and it is also supremely comfortable one of the most comfortable trail shoes I've ever run in the Nike react X foam just works so well on this type of tril and it's just so nice through the foot strike really nice and responsive as well the upper here gives a really good lockdown with no slipping at all no blisters no hot spots this shoe is just all about Comfort on the trails really like the Nike Flywire lacing system here and when you're on some more challenging terrain off-road jumping over some logs and things like that it just holds the foot in place really really well and the ankle collar as well something to really point out really gives a good confident feel no slipping or rubbing or anything like that good sort of toe bumper at the end here just to protect your feet at the front of the shoe as I mentioned the react X mids is a big step up from just Nike's standard react phone which they used previously and it just feels really good on road and off-road and if you really want to pick up the speed put in a little bit of extra effort up those Hills or towards the end of the race then it really does that well it now feels just much more responsive than the outgo model just much better energy return and it just looks good casually after run a really good looking shoe didn't really like this sort of pull tab on the back it just looks a bit flimsy so that brings me on to my dislikes first one the grip is fine for wet roads light Trail but you're going to struggle on wet rocks or anything like that yeah it's difficult with these shoes they're not really designed for that I'd love to see the vibr out sole on the Pegasus range that they put onto the zigama that would be a bit of a dream but yeah the traction's okay it's fine for what we're doing testing on this type of service but in some rocky areas you are going to be able to feel the stone sort of coming through slightly there's no Rock plate or any sort of plate in the shoe to protect you from that all in all the Pegasus Trail 5 is just a really good option for those nontechnical Trails those fire roads those single tracks and City running to and it will really work well for anyone that's going on some hiking walking long distances right let's move on to the next one in from hoker the Challenger 7 quickly guys if you are funing the videos so please smash that like button and please check out my website BP parks.com we've got Road plans Trail plans loads of five-star rated plans the best running hats in the business and Technical gear to keep you powering it through as you're getting it done thanks very much guys right back to the video I've really enjoyed running in the Challenger 7 or ATR senser all terrain I think I really like this colorway let me know what you think about this my girlfriend hates this colorway but I just think it's got some really cool 80s retro Vibes anyway this sent me back \u00a3130 here in the UK stack card at the back 31 mil which is a slight increase on the outgo model which was 29 and a 5 mm drop hit overall Weight Wise just over 300 G for me in my UK size 12 306 a slight weight decrease come on we love that versus the outgoing version six the midso with got the updated compression molded EVA foam here we've got the durasan rubber outs soole 4 mm lugs here a little bit longer than the Nikes ones and it also does come in a wide option should you spec that as well which you do need because this shoe is a little bit on the narrow side there's also a waterproof GTX gortex version and finally this was true to size for me right let's get stuck into the likes starting out you really got to think of the shoe as the Clifton of the trail World it feels exactly like a Clifton on the road just with that little bit of extra rip that extra outso which you can feel that's the only slight sort of difference but it's got a really good road feel and when you want to pick up the pace on the road or the trail with the lightweight nature of this shoe and that big chunk of hokus midsole here it's just a perfect shoe for those long runs and whenever I've been out for extending period of time just had no heating up issues at all really nice ankle flare at the back I have been having a few little Achilles issues but this has been an absolute joy to running no agitation there there's a lot of Cushing here to look after your legs it's certainly one that's definitely on the softer side hok's really squishy soft foam some people will really like that kind of ride and a stable ride as well and then finally the updated engineered mesh upper feels really durable to me haven't had any issues with that so far a few little dislikes to go through I'd love to see a bit more toe protection at the front a little bit of a toe bumper just to stop yourself stubbing roots and bigger rocks and things like that but it's just not the most Nimble it's a little bit big a little bit clumpy but that's just sort of the classic hoker feeling and the standard version is definitely on the narrow side so if you have got a wider foot definitely go for the wider option here but no all around fantastic shoe perfect for getting those road miles in and those Trail Mars as well and finally today we have the Salamon sens ride version 5 one of the first Salamon shoes I've actually reviewed on the channel and hopefully it won't be the last because again I've enjoyed the shoe these are all really good shoes for chel out here today now this sent me back \u00a3130 stack out at the back not 12929 mm and an 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise 346 R for me in my UK size 12 the mids soole here we've got some energy foam midsole which is an Eva blend from Salamon and the Contra grip rubber out soole lug depth 3 and 1/2 mm all these shoes very very similar to that there's no wide option here but there is a waterproof option that you can expect and this wasn't true to size for me I did get this in my UK size 12 but just found it a little bit small so I would say go half a size up because this this shoot is definitely on the narrow side right let's start out with my lights it has salamon's famous quick lacing system here you just pull it up lock and then tuck it away there and you're good to go it never came loose on any of my runs I never had to adjust it it's what you need when you head out on the trails you don't be stopping adjusting your laces it just cinches right and it gives a really nice lock down throughout the whole foot it just hugs the foot really really nicely with that fantastic lock down you've got some really good grip on the shoe here this is the best grip out of the lot of the grip at the back going up and down Hills has been really fantastic you're really not going to get much slip here unless you're getting some deep mud but this shoe grips fantastically in any sort of spring summer or Autumn type conditions and then not everyone will like this but some people really will is that this shoe is definitely on the firm side you've got a lot of ground feel coming through this very very similar to something like The New Normal KAG and as we know Killian was a Salomon athlete before he set up the whole new normal shoe brand everything and the feeling is very very between those shoes it's certainly a harder ride versus the hoker which is sort of super soft and pillowy you can feel a lot of the ground when you're cornering when you're running fast you can run really fast in this shoe and feel very very confident it's a bit more of an old school traditional feel but that's what a lot of salomons are like and finally I think this shoe is just pretty damn cool I love Salamon products I love what they do I love the athletes that they sponsor as well it's just got a really good Cool vibe about it let's have a chat about the dislikes this is very narrow if you are someone that has average and narrow feet you're going to be okay if you're a wider footed Runner unfortunately you're going to have to give this one a miss and then finally as I say you either like it or you don't like it but if you want a really soft plush ride to look after your legs on very long distances this may be one to avoid it really has that sort of faster engaging ground contact sort of feel with this type of shoe bit more suited for some shorter distances right let's wrap this video up so if you're looking for the most comfortable shoe out of this range I would go for the Nike trail version 5 the best for long distances then definitely the hoker Challenger ATR with that super soft foam in there going to look after your legs the best for grip I would have to give that to the Salamon shoe the outsole in here is absolutely fantastic and the best for Speed would be the Salamon shoe as well in there just so much more confidence inspiring really good lock down just worked really well but I think the best overall here the best that sort of mixes everything that I'm looking for is going to be the Nike Trail version 5 it's very hard to find any sort of fault with a shoe rctx foame I just think works a lot better on trail than it does in a dedicated row to it just gives that really nice responsive feel that you want out in the trails and super comfortable you're just not really going to have any issues good width in the shoe as well great lock down and it looks pretty cool so that's my best on test today but I wholeheartedly recommend all of these three shoes for anyone looking to get out on the trails for maybe the first time and that's where the next video is coming up because that's all about how to get into trail running so go and check out that video guys that's coming up next up here or up here hope you enjoyed this video keep on working hard keep on it done and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

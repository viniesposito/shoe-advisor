  "text": "hello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and this is our early review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so the Pegasus premium is an all new addition to the Nike range the Pegasus premium will sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus plus which is kind of a lightweight responsive allrounder shoe that has a zoomx midsole and then the Pegasus 41 is the entry level model the classic Pegasus which has a mix of react ex and Air Zoom pods in its midso now if you remember all those phones that's important because the Pegasus premium uses all of them in its Mido which has three layers it's a very high stack shoe it's the most expensive Pegasus shoe it's the heaviest Pegasus shoe and it's the shoe with the highest stack in the range and all around it's very very interesting on paper so excited to get out for a couple of runs in it so far it's set to launch next year at the end of January in the UK it's going to cost 18499 not sure on the US price as yet Nike gives the weight as 320 G which which is kind of an average across the line my UK size 9 which is US size 10 weighed in at 328 G or 11.6 o so you fair bit heavier than the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus because of this big stack heite which is 45 mm at the heel 35 mm at the 4ot so the kind of classic Pegasus 10 mm drop but a higher heel height than we've seen before in the line obviously the main interest in the shoe is definitely much in the midsole but looking at the other parts of the shoe the upper is an engineered mesh you've got a bit of padding around the tongue and heill actually it's quite an interesting almost duvet style tongue I found it's quite soft and and thick but it's quite lightweight as well and you've got fairly substantial heel counter and a lot of padding around the heel of the shoe and the outside you got pretty good rubber coverage aside from long section down the middle of the shoe which is a slight cutout that shows off the Air Zoom pod but at the heel and foref foot of the shoe you've got rubber in Nike's kind of typical waffle outsole pattern in the midsole there are three layers to this so the top layer is Nike zox foam this is the bouncy peber foam that introduced on shoes like the vaporfly and alphafly Racing shoes is now used in the Invincible and the Pegasus plus as it's kind of bouncy lightweight responsive foam then you have a fulllength Air Zoom pod running through the shoe which is the key Innovation I guess with the Pegasus premium Nike's been using this Air Zoom technology in pod form across lots of shoes for several years like you see in the alphafly the hidden within the Pegasus midsole as well the Pegasus 41 that is but now they've been able to form this continuous unit that runs the length of the shoe that gives you that responsive feeling all the way from heel to 4 foot also stabilizes what is quite a high stack of foam underneath that you have some react X foone which is the phone used in the Pegasus 41 and the Infiniti rn4 perhaps to try and stabilize the back of the shoe a bit more and also give a bit more durability it's quite hard wearing Pham react X so Pegasus premium was announced earlier this year very exciting looking sh was very interested to get out and tested it I have tested the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus as well done a couple of runs in the Pegasus premium so let's dive into how I found it first have a quick look at the fit and there's not much to say here it was all good in in my normal running shoe size got uk9 here us10 that's the size I've used across Nike's range ever since I've been testing Nike shoes the same size I have across the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus and yeah got a good amount of room in the forf foot it's quite tapered design but that fits me quite well I've got quite narrow foot I don't think it's an especially narrow shoe though good hold around the heel and midfoot on my run so far so yeah no concerns with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size with the Pegasus [Music] premium so far I've done two hourong runs in the Pegasus premium I've done both of them at fairly easy Paces the odd pickup here and there the first one I did I've got a fairly fresh leg so I was running a bit faster than the second one when it was a full recovery run on very heavy legs and yeah the shoe certainly has a very interesting ride like you do really feel the high stack and the combination of Foams in the mids sole in a way that is quite different to the Pegasus plus and the Pegasus 41 so feels very much like a shoe that is built for cruising and just bouncing you along like it doesn't feel like a super Speedy shoe to me and you can feel the weight if you try and pick up the pace or when I was running uphill even at an easy pace you start to feel the weight of the shoe a little bit but if you are on the flat or on a downhill you can get into a really nice Rhythm hitting that big stack of foam getting a nice amount of spring off and you know just really moving along quite nicely and it feels fairly effortless at times despite the fact you know it is quite a big shoe of the Foams in the Mido the one that I felt the most was definitely that Air Zoom unit which adds a bit of firmness for sure and you stabilizes the rer it doesn't feel like a for a high stack shoe like this doesn't feel like a very soft and Squishy shoe to me like you're hitting that Zoom X which does compress a fair bit then you hit the Air Zoom pod which you know gives you a lot of kind of bounce back and response as we've seen it in other shoes like the alphafly even when you hit the zoomx into the Pod you then get that bounce back and now that's running the full length of the shoe you don't get a really soft feeling at the heel but you do get moved quite smoothly onto the forefoot and get a fair bit of response from that Air Zoom unit you do get a little bit of the noise you kind of expect from Nike shoes a pods in and you know Nike shoes in general can be a bit Slappy it does have that slight feel to it the one thing I noticed with it compared to the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus was that these are all 10 mm shoes as a heel striker sometimes get a bit slap through when I'm running in a 10 mm shoe kind of slapping down on the foref foot you get a little bit less of that at the Pegasus premium because of the high stack of Foams that kind of compressed together it almost feels like a slightly lower drop shoe and you kind of get moved through a bit more smoothly onto that forefoot one thing I definitely noticed with the shoe is it feels quite narrow around the midfoot of the shoe so for a really high stack shoe like this with lot of Brands you'll get quite a wide base on the bottom to make sure that they're stable and hasn't happened with Nike it's got quite a tapered midfoot on both sides and your foot overhangs a little bit on the inside now the Air Zoom unit does do I think quite a lot to help stabilize the shoe but I definitely think if you are someone who uses a stability shoe or in general is a bit worried about it you should probably stay clear of the shoe because there's a lot of foam there and it does roll a little bit inwards like I'm a neutral Runner and didn't really notice it too much on the run but I feel like when I'm looking at the cutaways of me running in the shoe and that kind of thing it does feel like yeah that's quite a narrow midell for such a high stack shoe do think stability might be a little bit of a concern for people in the shoe again because of that high stack and narrow midfoot so of the two runs I did in the yearo like I say one was on quite fresh legs and one was on very heavy legs and I definitely prefer the Pegasus premium when I was a bit fresher it feels like you can engage all those Foams a bit more run a bit more with purpose get a bit more bounce back and when I was on very heavy legs tired legs after a lot of like hard workouts I was using it as a recovery run shoe it just felt you know a bit too much shoe I wasn't turning over so well and as someone has got a high Cadence I'm not the heaviest runner in the world I wasn't really engaging all of those phones that well and I was just kind of plodding along so that might be a bit different if you are someone who puts a bit more force in you're slightly heavier Runner or someone who bounds a bit more you might get a bit more engagement from all those phones at kind of any Pace but yeah that that on that run it a bit more just like a big shoe still fine you know seems to protect the legs pretty well but doesn't feel like a shoe that's built for Flatout recovery like you might expect from a big high stack shoe like this with this weight it feels more in the line of things like I guess the Puma magmax or even the Hocus SC X like big heavy High stack shoes that are built to be quite versatile though still like with lots of stuff in the mid I'll try and help you bounce along and if you're not getting all that bounce which I really wasn't on that kind of recovery run then then it doesn't feel so good but when I was on like I say when I was on kind of a more of a classic daily training run and just moving along a fairly relaxed pace it did feel like I was getting a bit more spring back from the [Music] shoe so very early verdict on the Pegasus premium mostly is that I'm not exactly sure where I stand on the shoe still like it is an interesting shoe it is got a bouncy ride it's got a very interesting combination of Foams but it's a heavy shoe has that slight stability issue I think around the midfoot with that narrow design but it was fun to run in but I'm still not convinced this a kind of shoe I would pick myself for any runs compared to the other Pegasus models which probably suit my running style a little bit better as more lightweight shoes with kind of slight more Snappy design to them but certainly an interesting shoe it definitely has a little bit of the ultra boost vibe to it in that it's a very good looking shoe an interesting looking shoe that you want to wear around a street wear but then you can also run in I'll probably do a comparison of those shoes in time but the ultra boost for a long time was very similarly heavy has now come down a bit in weight but doesn't really have I think the same level of kind of Bounce in it because it doesn't have you know such impressive phones in the midy as you get on the Pegasus premium but again two kind of similar shoes cool shoes can run in them as well so will be of interest to sneaker heads as well as Runners but when this shoe was initi announced there was a little bit oh is this going to be Nikes you know super training you've got that Big Air Zoom pod you've got some zoomx foam in there is this going to you know fill a gap in their lineup but that's not really what I'm getting from the shoe myself like the zoomfly 6 which just recently came out fills that Gap that's an excellent super trainer I put in a lot of miles in that shoe over the last week and a half and I'm really enjoying running it the Pegasus premium doesn't feel like a fast versatile super trainer like that shoe which compares to things like the Hoka ma X2 or the Endorphin speed 4 doesn't really feel like the ax super blast either which is a plateless super trainer with the mega stack as well the Pegasus premium to me definitely feels more in line with shoes like the Puma mag Max the hookus Skyward X maybe even like the Brooks Glycerin Max that are you know big Mega stack shoes designed to play more of a daily training role for people who maybe don't get on with those lower attack shoes and have a lot of Bounce have a lot of protection you know do a good job for that and actually are quite versatile because all the stuff in the mids soole but I think one thing that might count against it there is what I've been talking about that midfoot stability whereas you look at something like the glycerin Max it's very wide pum mag Max is very wide so is the Skyward X because with a high stack they want to give stability as well as well as all that cushioning underfoot and that's not something Nike's gone for so much with the Pegasus premium which is more of the classic kind of Pegasus silhouette certainly interesting shoe one I like I liked running in those first two times I've been looking forward to getting out and again but be interesting to see how it ends up being received elsewhere and how it ends up comparing to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus which feel much more classic daily trainers that will work for lots more Runners the Pegasus premium probably will have slightly more Niche appeal I think in terms of the runners who enjoy it the most and also then there's people who might look at it as a nice crossover lifestyle running shoe [Music] that's our first look at the Nike Pegasus premium let us know what you think in the comments below please

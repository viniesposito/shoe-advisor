  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers in this video we are going to be doing a comparison of the New Balance 1080 v14 and SOC ride 17 let's have a [Music] look the New Balance 1080 v14 costs \u00a360 or $164.99 it weighs 287 G or 10.1 o for men in a size8 and the drop is 6 mm the sakon ride 17 cost \u00a3 135 $140 it weighs 285 G or 10 oz for men in a size 8 and the drop is 8 [Music] mm the New Balance 1080 v14 is a daily shoe built for comfort and accessibility in the previous version of the shoe New Balance modified the fresh FX midsole to be noticeably softer but with that came a dip in the stability and the versatility of the shoe the Tennesse v14 addresses that with a slightly firmer version of the foam and the overall mids so geometry in addition there's an updated engineered mesh upper to improve the fit and provide better breathability that also includes a good level of padding as well as a soft gusseted tongue on the outsole is a modest layer of rubber across the key areas of the shoe although this doesn't cover the full length of the midsole Pham the sakon ride 17 receives a big update in the form of a new power on plus midsole the same material used in the trium 21 this addition dramatically changes the experience of running in the ride to provide more cushioning increased energy return and a smoother the transition built for daily miles the ride 17 aims to provide a balance of comfort versatility and a touch of stability for ticking off the miles the upper also sees an upgrade with a new engineered mesh design to improve breathability and a 360\u00b0 fit to ensure a good lockdown on the outs soole there's a generous layer of rubber to protect the midsole and provide a good level of grip on varied Road surfaces and there's plenty of interior padding for a plush level of step- in Comfort when it comes to fit I ran in a UK 8 and A2 which is my regular size in both shoes the fit on both is good I get good security and hold in all the key areas heel midfoot no slipping to report the New Balance 1080 v14 definitely has a closer More Hugging fit it's a bit more plush it's not quite as roomy the ride 17 I think have a bit more wiggle room in the toe box it's a bit more Airy on the foot they just feel a bit more spacious over all but both hold really well they both have good comfort and I'd recommend going true to size unless you have particularly wide or long feet in which case I'd maybe consider going half a size up in the New Balance so I've got my normal size with both of these shoes which is a uk9 with sakon that's a US 10 it's a US 9.5 with New Balance New Balance can be a bit more up and down with its sizing across its shoes but I found that the 1080 you fit me true to size in that 9/ 9.5 and I had a good hold around the heel and midfoot good amount of room in the toe box soy the same they're very consistent with their sizing I've got the same size across their entire range pretty much and the ride 17 fits in the the same way as all those shoes so no concerns really with either shoe about the hold at the heel or anything like that only concern related to fit is these little fabric eyelets you get on the ride 17 I have broken one of those by pulling too hard on my laces and you know that's something to look out for if you do have the shoe I don't think it's going to be a Corum problem I haven't done it you know to any other eyelets on the shoe or more than once but yeah they're a little bit more flimsy than the kind of more traditional eyelet setup you have on the New Balance so I would say these two shoes are very comparable when it comes to fit they're both very comfortable shoes there's plenty of space in the forefoot uh before the big toe and around the side I'd say that the ride 17 is a little bit less forgiving than the 1080 v14 um I've got fairly average width beet and haven't had any problems with either of these shoes but I would say that if you did have much wider feet you might notice that a little bit more on the ride 17 than the 1080 v14 there's plenty of ping on both of these shoes not loads but what you'd expect from a daily shoe plenty of comfort they're both shoes designed for Comfort uh so I would definitely stay to my size in both of these shoes so we got two good cushion daily trainers here that you are primarily focused on Comfort I'd say but do give you a little bit of Versatility you can use them for a mix of runs both a little bit different to their predecessors the ride 17 is quite different to the ride 16 and 15 which were lighter kind of lower profile shoes they had a firmer feel they were more designed to be kind of lightweight uptempo daily trainers whereas the ride 17 has kind of taken over where the Triumph 21 left off with the Triumph 22 being a very different shoe you've now got a similar setup in the ride 17 to the Triumph 21 with that power run plus midso which is a very reliable Pham it's a phone we've seen in shoes for many years and delivers you know a nice blend of comfort and responsiveness it's quite a dense feeling foam it lasts forever but kind does deliver the properties you expect in a durable daily trainer like this I say the ride to me feels a little bit less cushioned in the ride 1 it's got a lower stack and you can feel that particularly under the 4 foot where it's a fair bit thinner than New Balance and a slightly slapper feel to it as well it doesn't feel quite as rocked as the New Balance 1080 v14 for me which the 1080 v14 was a really pleasant surprise because it's never been a shoe that's been right at the top of my list I found some of the older versions were kind of okay pretty standard daily trainers and then the 1080 v13 which was really soft just a bit too soft for me and with the 1080 v14 they just tweaked that midell a little bit to be a little bit more resilient and I get a much better ride out of it as a result it's still a really soft shoe and a comfortable shoe softer than the ride 17 I'd say but I now have a much smoother transition I get a little bit more kind of responsiveness off the toes as well because that foam is that little bit more resilient it just creates a really nice ride for easy runs with a quite spritely feel you're still being very well protected but it feels like quite a Nimble shoe on your foot and then it does have a little bit more versatility as well I think because the really soft foam on the previous model I think I just got lost in and kind of wed through it whereas you get a bit more back from the foam in the 1080 v14 did a run wearing both shoes at the same time and you can really feel the smoother transition and the slight extra softness you get with a 1080 v14 I'd say like you have that denser feel the R 17 it slaps her a little bit more you know it feels a little bit heavier on the foot but it doesn't really feel heavy per say it's just it's just bigger this feels much more Nimble the 1080 v14 and I think part of that is just the way the ride transition is a little bit better for me as a heel Striker they both feel pretty good and comfortable but you get a softer feel and like I say that slightly more sprightly feel from the 1080 so these two shoes are shoes that you'd use for your daily training miles both shoes that are designed for ticking off um the miles comfortably um adding possibly a little bit of Versatility as well the 1080 v14 I really like the shoe I think it's a solid daily training shoe I don't think it's a particularly versatile shoe but um the previous version of the shoe the tenness v13 was really really soft they really maxed out the softness on that shoe and you really notice it on the run I love that shoe I preferred that shoe to the tv14 just cuz I like soft shoes but I would only use that shoe for easy comfortable miles I've never use that for Interval sessions um Tempo sessions anything like that it's just too soft and too squishy for that sort of run but it's very comfortable for easy day runs for Recovery runs um and possibly just just any run you need comfort um and you're not trying to do anything else with it the 108v 14 the mid foam has been modified a bit to be a little bit firmer it's not massively firm but it's definitely firmer than 108v 13 it uh as a result it has a little bit more stability in it which is what a lot of people didn't like about the tv13 it lost a bit of stability this is a lot more stable um and it's also a bit more responsive as a result of that midell phone becoming a little bit firmer um but still it's very comfortable easy day shoe it's very um the mid soole is very balanced so it does have a bit of softness in it um just great for ticking off the miles uh I wouldn't say it's particularly shoe designed for running faster in you could probably go up to maybe um faster longer sessions things like that it's probably an all right long run shoe definitely want use it for Interval sessions or faster training sessions where you really want to go top speed um but it is a solid or daily shoe very much like it I think it's the the the strength of the shoe is that it is very accessible to a lot of people you get a bit of everything bit of stability bit of softness bit of comfort it's all in there it's a great shoe especially if you're a beginner or if you just want something in your rotation that just ticks off all of those runs where you're not necessarily doing anything specific the sakon ride 17 big fan of this shoe uh used it quite a bit when it came out last year and it very similar to the tenness v14 it's a very balanced daily shoe that uh isn't too soft it's a bit firmer than the tening tv14 for me and as a result it's a little bit more versatile I definitely think this shoe has a bit more pop in it um I'm more likely to use the ride 17 if I was going out to do a faster session if I was going on holiday and I wanted to take a shoe with me that I could do all of my easy runs and do some interval sessions things like that in much more likely to choose the ride 17 just because I think it's got a little bit more to it than the tenness v14 I think the tenness v14 is better for easy runs um because of the way that that mle foam is built um but uh I think the R 17 is better for faster runs so it really comes down to to that sort of um what your focus is when it comes to daily runs and what you're most likely to do as part of a training block um and other things IID say about these two shoes is that they're both pretty stable um they you both you get a good solid ride in both of these shoes but when it comes to stability they both have very similar midell foam so you're getting a good solid ride in both of these shoes uh other thing I would say about this is the outsole on the ride 17 very very good uh I really like this out soole it's it's got a good covering of rubber on it but it's quite a uh sticky rubber so it's got nice little grooves in it very good for um running in the rain or anything like that have no problems at all with the ride 17 TT v14 equally it's a good out soole I prefer the ride 17 out soole it's just a little bit grippier for me and less exposed sections from the mid sole I haven't had any problems in the T v14 and I've I've done about 70k in this shoe now uh and there's not really any sign of we on the midsole sections of the shoe but ride 17 has a better outsole for me in testing I've run loads of miles in the socony ride 17 it's one of my go-to shoes for my casual runs I use it a lot when I'm not testing other shoes and I want reliable Comfort on a kind of heads up run I've covered around 50 km in the New Balance 1080 v14 I've mixed up the pce and Terrain in both shoes I did a 5em progression run in the v14 just last night in fact quick take on both these shoes we starting with the ride 17 I love the ride 17 there's excellent dis appearing comfort and a really good ride that balances cushioned Landings with rolling response and a bit of springy energy for me it's one of those shoes it just feels natural straight out of the box it's not totally effortless but it's very easy for covering long miles whether you're moving slow and easy or pushing things slightly more Up Tempo it's not super soft it's not super energetic but it's nicely consistent and I think it represents pretty good value for me the 1080 v14 offers roughly speaking more of the same as the 1080 v13 it's a really well cushioned shoe that's great for easy miles there's loads of plushness and comfort in the heel collar the tongues and the uppers and it really does an excellent job of dampening the road impact I like the fact that it's back to having a stiffer more immediate feel Under Foot with this generation so it's still highly cushioned but not quite as soft as the 1080 v13 that brings a bit more immediacy to the ride and some more energy so I was able to move up from sort of 8 to sub seven minute mile Pace on my progression run and the 1080 v14 handled all of that really well last night there's a bit more upper Pace potential I think than you get from the v13 so I also did a side by side Mile with one shoe on each foot it actually turned out to be closer to 2 miles when I was out there doing it but the big difference here I think is that the New Balance 108 v14 just has a bit more softness and a bit more bounce the soc ride 17 on the foot you know it's a bit more connected it's a bit firmer it doesn't sink as much there's not as much kind of Return of the foam so it feels a bit more controlled and there's a bit more stability in the ride 17 the New Balance 1080 v14 isn't necessarily a hugely unstable shoe but it is a slightly more wobbly Shue Under Foot I think if you really need a bit more stability the ride 17 is going to give you more than the New Balance 1080 v14 I think there's maybe slightly more energy in the v14 as well which I think is different from what we got from the v13 before I would have put the ride 17 kind of well ahead of the v13 in terms of its overall versatility but I think the 14 now comes much closer the other thing I I think there's definitely More Hugging feel on the foot with the New Balance than you'll get with the ride 17 a bit more room in the toe box both have very comfortable fits on the foot but yeah that's the main difference here I think you can feel the higher stack as well on the New Balance 1080 v14 a bit more there's a bit more connection to the ground in the ride 17 you really notice it when you put them side by side but I would use both of these shoes for the same kinds of runs mainly okay so which one would I buy out of these two shoes tricky one cuz I like both of these SHO they're not neither of them is my favorite running shoe neither of them is the top of my list for daily running shoes I definitely more likely to go for something like the Muno NE Vista which is a bit bouncier a bit more enjoyable to running these are a little bit more traditional a little bit more stable a little bit more balanced when it comes to running which makes them a bit more accessible shoes like the mauno Neo Vista um are a little bit soft and a little bit wobbly so if you want more stability you're not going to get it in that shoe both of these very stable shoes very comparable shoes if you're looking for a solid um all round daily trainer I think it really just comes down to that versatility factor of it um which if you're looking for a faster training shoe and it's not the fastest training shoe out there but you can definitely do a lot more than tennessy v14 I'd go for the ride 17 if you're looking for allout comfort and easy day um over past sessions 10814 the other thing as well is the price of these two shoes there's a bit of a difference between these two by about 25 because of that I'm going ride 17 all the way one because um I just like I prefer to use this for those faster sessions but also it's just better value all round so I'm picking the ride 17 in this versus verdict then and I think what you've got here are two genuinely good shoes both better towards the slower end of Paces but both with some versatility and some capability if you want to move up a few gears I wouldn't choose either of them for my fastest efforts but in a pinch I can hit marathon pce and Beyond quite comfortably though I have to work for it in both of these shoes I prefer the roomier disappearing feel of the ride 17 to the slightly cocooning hug that you'll get from the plushness of the 1080 v14 I also think the ride 17 offers a slightly more stable consistent rolling ride that's a bit more connected to the road if you prefer more softness and bounce though go for the 1080 v14 if you want more stability and ground field I think the ride 17 is your shoe for me personally I'd be very happy to have either shoe in my rotation but I think it comes down to Value so the cheaper ride 17 gets my vote not least because I've seen it going on deals for well under1 at the moment so R 17 is a really good shoe and it's a good value shoe as well it will give you a very consistent level of performance across the lifespan of the shoe which i' expect to be very long you get a little bit of Versatility here you get Comfort it's a good foam it's a good shoe but I do prefer the ride field of the 1080 v14 like it's a bit more expensive but I think you are getting an upgrade in ride en joyment from it like I said it's a bit softer rolls through a bit better has bit more cushioning under the forefoot which adds to the comfort of the shoe it's bit more comfortable and cushioned in general I would say whilst also being lighter than the ride 17 and I think all round this isue I prefer to use pretty much any kind of but especially on those easy runs where it just feels like a shoe that disappears a bit more on the foot or one that is just a bit more enjoyable than the ride 17 for me which like I say is a very solid performer you pick it up you're not really going to be disappointed I think it will suit lots of different Runners but 1080 is the one I'd pick it's just a shoe that I enjoyed running

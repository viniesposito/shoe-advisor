  "text": "over the past two and a half weeks I've been going over my favorite shoes of 2024 but now it's time for the best of the best I'm taking the winner of each category to see which shoe Can Come Away with best in shoe these are my contenders for shoe of the year [Music] yo what's going on my name is kafui and I'm anite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to go over my contenders for shoe of the Year 2024 but before I give you this list I do want to go over some disclosures these are all shoes that were sent to me by their respective manufacturers for the purpose of review so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe on this list and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage of my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the winners of each subcategory of running shoe that I've crowned already and because I've already talked about why I like these shoes so much I do want to spend a moment to talk about each of these shoes where they fit in a rotation and why I think they're significant for 2024 and going into 2025 first let's start with the daily trainer that's where I always like to start whenever I'm thinking about running shoes and for this year the daily trainer of the year was from New Balance is the rebel version 4 now I feel like this shoe is significant for a couple of reasons there's an updated version of fuel cell in this shoe that is a peba blend so we're starting to see race materials make their way into more and more daily training applications and for that reason it's significant but for me it's significant because I've always thought that pea blend meant some sort of a compromise a price point compromise or a durability compromise but the rebel version 4 proved to me that I feel like this foam is exactly what it needs to be and so they didn't just Chuck in a bunch of peba and make it a pure pea midsole just for the sake of having that line available to them in marketing they actually made the midso do what it needs to do and the other reason why I think it's significant is again from like the marketing perspective they didn't hide the fact that it's a peba blend and so they told us right from the beginning that this is a little bit of peba a little bit of Eva mixed together into a super critical process to make this foam and even though fuel cell is the trade name for New Balances racing caliber Foams again they weren't afraid that it would dilute the brand recognition of what fuel cell is by having one that might they might use in racing applications like in the SC Elite version 4 and a different kind of fuel cell that's available in the rebel version 4 so they made the foam that they needed to make for the type of shoe that they wanted to make it ended up being an excellent shoe and they weren't scared of what the ingredients were in order to make that product and for that kind of transparency and for the Excellence of this product the rebel version 4 made it to my daily trainer of the year now from daily trainers the next shoe that I typically like to add into a rotation is a racing shoe and from the racing category Puma brought us the Nitro Elite 3 this shoe is significant for two things one is because while it wasn't the first shoe to introduce us to aliphatic TPU as a race caliber material it's one that uses it exceptionally well and so we're getting all the benefits of that aliphatic TPU the bounciness of it the shock absorption of it but also the durability of it in a race product but it also is important because this shoe I think marks the beginning of the next level of carbon plate shoe Wars which the battlefield is going to be in the weight and this shoe is extremely light it's one of the lightest shoes that's available on the market right now and while there are a couple of shoes lighter there are a very few number of shoes that are this light and also this suitable for racing a Marathon distance not only for Elites and Pros but also for non- Elites as well and so for those Innovations and what I think it will Mark the beginning of in the next few years in terms of what we're going to see race product doing I felt like the Nitro Elite 3 deserved the top spot as the racing shoe of the year and then another shoe that I like to put kind of in between the daily trainer and the racing shoe is the tempo shoe or the session shoe it kind of has some features of the daily trainer but some features of AO but I really like to use it for workouts and again we have another entrant from puma and this is the deviate Nitro 3 now one of the things that's unique about this shoe is that it didn't change all that much and for me that's a really good thing because the DV8 Nitro 2 was my shoe of the year last year but there were a little tweaks in the upper that made the fit a little bit more suitable to its task and there were very small shape changes to the MSL that I think made it a little bit more exciting still compared to the already excellent shoe of last year so this shoe I think is significant in the sense that it reminds me that if you have a really excellent shoe with really excellent material you don't always have to reinvent the wheel every single year in order to stay on top the DV8 Nitro 3 remains an excellent shoe and it was my top Tempo trainer of the year now let's get into the shoes that you might want to run in when you are beat up from all those Tempo workouts and from your racing and that's the max cushion category and this year for me this was the glisser and Mac this was a completely new shoe type from Brooks and I think it is an a great exposition of what I'm looking for in modern Max cushion now we still have the idea of the classic Max cushion we have the Bondies the atmos the more version 5 those are shoes that I think we still need in the running space but as far as what I like and what's more modern I love what's going on with the glycerin Max it's giving us what I think is a reimagined version of what plushness and comfort are it's not just stinging a whole bunch of memory foam in a tongue and in a heel collar but instead it's giving us Comfort up top and a great amount of squishiness on the bottom that isn't too mushy and so you're not getting completely mired down in quicksand as you're running it's just the right amount of excellent softness it's super comfortable for me and I love what it could mean from the future of Brooks as they expand to appeal to different types of running consumers than they typically have been targeting and then the last category of shoe that I want to talk about at the far end of the spectrum is I think a newer category of shoe a subgenre of the max cushion Market if you want it is the long run shoe and these are shoes that can do a lot of the same things that Max cushion shoes do and maybe this category disappears in a couple years depending on what Max cushion does in the future but for now I consider this a separate subcategory because it uses a lot of racing materials in the midsole and it generally tries to keep things more minimal in terms of puffiness and padding in the upper if we look at the super Blast 2 I think it's a great example of that we've got a bunch of FF turbo plus which is the foam that they're using in their latest gen Racing shoes from as6 a little bit of daily training foam on the bottom to help keep things stabilized and this heel collar has less padding in it than the Glide ride Max or the Nimbus might have so it's trying to keep things a little bit more Nimble even though it's in this Max cushion type of package I've really been enjoying these YP of shoes for runs that are not only long but also have a little bit of pace changes in them those are my favorite kind of long runs to do and these are shoes that I feel like are purpose built for it this shoe along with the Invincible I think pretty much invented the category and it's been the type of shoe that I've been most excited about in the last couple of years and for that reason the super Blast 2 is a significant shoe and not only just an excellent example of its class and so amongst these shoes I think you have a really fantastic albe it expensive but a really fantastic and fun running shoe rotation most people don't need to get all five of these shoes and if I were to boil it down to just one shoe to have of all these shoes that shoe for me would be the Puma devi8 Nitro 3 this is going to be two for two a repeat for the devi8 Nitro Series in taking shoe of the year I think it can do easy running it can do fast running it could do long running it's maybe not the best recovery run shoe but I think that if you wanted to get one and only one shoe from racing to recovery run the DV8 Nitro 3 could be that shoe and for that reason that's why it's my 2024 shoe of the year so those are my thoughts on the best running shoes of 2024 it has been a great year to be a runner and I could say that from a personal perspective it has been a great year to be a shoe reviewer I've had a great time testing and reviewing these shoes and I've particularly enjoyed talking to you guys about how these shoes feel on foot I'm really excited for what's to come in 2025 and I've already started testing a bunch of new shoes hit the Subscribe button so you could see those reviews as they become available next year but that's going to be the end of this video and the end of my running shoe review videos for 2024 thanks so much for making it all the way to the end of this video and this year and I look forward to seeing you in 2025 yo what's going on [Music] n [Music]",

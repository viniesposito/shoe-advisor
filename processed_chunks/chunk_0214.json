joke last week just keeping people on their toes who are they going to get today feathers or Megan Alter Ego I like it I like it we should have different episodes ones are feather episodes one are Megan episodes the EGS but they're both here and excited to bring you news about nutrition for performance athletes yeah you are listening to fuel for the soul um and I'm excited to dive into a bunch of listener questions again today but before we do we have to do a quick shout out to two of our sponsors Runway and cherub Bundy two of our favorite things I still I keep raving about the Cherub Bundy gummies in fact I need to ask them to send us more because we've gone through them all um but are you still enjoying them Megan uh yeah I need some more too cuz my kids are also enjoying them um so we might need to hit them up at uh TR and get some more so are your kids also getting the benefits like are they of course Ralph he's fine the whole time now he dragging his legs through the cords um are they enjoying the benefits of anti-inflammatory uh cherry juice no I mean they're swimming their hearts out the other night at swim practice they had all the kids swim as far as they swim in 15 minutes and my kids didn't stop and most kids stopped they swim the whole time so I'm going to go ahead and say that the tarer is working that's my anecdote that's amazing 15 minutes of swimming straight is I'm tired thinking about it it's freaking hard yeah um if you guys haven't yet you should go get some Cher Bundy and you can do it by going to cheribundi.com and then if you use the code fuel f l at checkout it'll save you 20% that is true so go get some yeah okay and the other one we need to shout about real fast is our other favorite Runway woohoo yeah I mean have you guys been digging their protein powder Thomas have you did you eat it all do you need more did you get more he keeps this is upsetting It's upsetting that we have a sponsor that I don't like I'm like come on man I need that creatine I'm trying to bulk up here yeah yeah a matter of fact like I really need it cuz December I'm joining a weightlifting gym this is not like your regular like Fitness gym I'm actually going to one that is like specifically plates and bars and just getting jacked really do three things but I need the I need the protein recovery with a creatine for for for my getting all hulked out swole you're absolutely correct that's exactly when I think Runners need creatine the most is when they start adding like a different lifting routine or want to increase muscle mass gain some strength all that kind of stuff so yeah you're going to be like the poster child for this product well what I'm hoping is that a strong like body translates to healthier running and staying injuryf free because I'll be working they really it's weird they only do like the Three core things are deadlifts squats and uh bench press and they just work the hell out of those and I guess that's that gets your whole body well remember when I did that strength training program over the summer with Mary Johnson back before Chicago and then Meg started coaching me for Chicago I had like a seven minute Marathon PR I was like holy cow I mean there was a lot of things happening there but one of them was strength so I'm just trying to hold on hold on to something you know keep the from falling off as I run I feel like I'm one of those like rickety old trucks that like screws are falling out as they go down the road yeah 41 has not been fun I get that I'm like man we're going to have to change some things we're getting old add that protein and creatine to your life there we go right um yeah so if you guys want to get some of the runway product which is not only just the protein and creatine they also have um hydration collagen hydration and collagen yeah which is the original product that we started with um but you can go to runway. lifee so that's rnw dolie and then use the code feathers 15 for 15% off your purchase just okay so last time we spoke Megan you we were chatting about sourdough and you said you were going to quote get into it and get some starter so I saw on Instagram that this actually occurred I dove in head first real fast I mean like I think it was like the next day I ordered a starter from King Arthur we got rolling do you think that do you think that the sourdough life is like the cat lady life it seems like people who get sourdough it becomes is a big part of their life people are really into it let me tell you because after posting some of my successes and failures in my stories you should just see my DMs just blowing up with people oh yeah which I honestly this is why I haven't gotten into sourdough yet because I do I really do feel like it's an art and it's a commitment and there's a lot of educating yourself about how to do things in a proper way to get the right outcome and I just don't honestly have time for that so like I just try to and it definitely didn't turn out super well but everybody keeps telling me I just need to stick with it people are sending me books I can't decide how into this I'm actually going to get though like I I I don't know this haveed the yeast or something sure do this is like another child I feel like like this is takes a lot of tender love and care this is like Megan was talking about tag Gucci the other day that's was on this on this podcast and thereis not tag Gucci well you got the lowbudget ones I get the fancy one his have like really great shoes yeah taguchi do you feel like it's something though that once you kind of nail it then it's like riding a bike like you're good to go you'll make grape bread all the time yeah Helen our office manager is like cranking out yeah like loaves of sourdough everybody keeps telling me like your starter really does have to like sometimes it takes a minute to get everything rolling and yeah yeah get the good product and the kids are having fun with it so they've been helping me in the kitchen they think it's so cool and so I mean that's been fun to get them in the kitchen more but we also have a phenomenal Bakery it's called Brimfield bread oven and they make the best sourdough bread and it's like $2 for a loaf so part of me is like do we really need to do this like see that's that's the thing I want Megan to make it because I like it when the house like when she's making pretzels the house smells great when she's making Bagels the house smells great when she occasionally makes chocolate chip cookies they're amazing but that's the problem like I tried brewing beer and it takes so long and you have to wait so long and and I'm like I could just go to the store but that's why I think you it's like running right you have to enjoy the process of it like you can't just be excited about a loaf of bread you have to enjoy making it and the patience that goes along with it and the kneading of the dough and the I think you have to find a way to enjoy that if you're going to do it yeah yeah making the beard I hate it I'm not giving up yet I am not giving up yet but I'm also not fully invested yet either which might be the problem so we'll see TVD how how often do you have to feed the starter thing you're supposed to feed it every 6 to8 hours when you're leaving it out on the counter and it said to feed it like three or four times before the first bake so I fed it three times and I was like oh it's bubbly it looks like the picture I'm going to make some bread but everybody's saying maybe I need to keep feeding it they put it in the fridge we're going to delay this process I put it in the fridge and I'll get back to feeding it again some other day but yeah it's like so when it's in the fridge you don't have to do anything it leave it in there yeah yeah you can just like let it be for a moment okay I'm picturing this you you get up in the morning you're going to go to work or it's like waking up do whatever to feed your kids you feed your you feed your your pile of goo yeah and then you go about your business day yeah it's dinner time you're like little more food for you yeah yeah like you just keep doing that all the time yeah and then go to bed and then wake up and feed it again I guess it's like morning and evening I haven't read a book yet or any any information besides the three page pamphlet that King Arthur sent me so I'm by far no Pro but um it feels as though that's exactly what it is yeah I could see May getting totally into this I yeah I think that's the problem is sometimes I would go like I'd go like too hardcore into it and then like read every book about it and then i' yeah it'd be too much I I welcome it I would love loaves of sourdough in the house and tell I mean this is a nutritional podcast we're kind of off subject here but we're not really because it's a carb it is a tasty carb that's what like with the like discard when you feed it you take some of it out and that's called the discard so we made pancakes and we made sourdough pretzels and those were a winner those were great but bread so far work on yeah they we're good all right well keep us posted on the sourdough and obviously we'll be following your Instagram to see if we get any updates there as well um okay before we dive into listener questions there's a couple things on here that we want to chat about perhaps some new brands on the market people wrote into about these or where these come from yeah yeah a couple people on Instagram sent me this new hydration company called Cadence you guys hadn't heard of it either no I know there's a run group from like Belgium or something that's called Cadence running so I immediately clicked on it and I put the link in here so you guys can click on it it legitimately looks like Morton the way they're photographing things except for being black with white writing it looks white with black writing like it literally L looks like a hydration product show me the link they reached out to us um I didn't recognize they must have changed their website cuz it looked like a Zoolander ad the last time I went to it and yes you're right I remember that now yeah they reached out uh back in June saying that they were going to launch this new electrolyte product can I see their stuff oh yeah yeah they're right looks like Martin yeah they they they're going hard oh I like I kind of like The Branding though I like clean I really loved it and then it's got like a sparkling beverage that's what made me think about it but it's only half the sodium it's 500 milligrams of sodium instead of a thousand like element and then they have good because I could have two right then they have little sachets of like energy which has 100 milligrams of caffeine or sleep that had like I don't know calming stuff so it was like very cleanly branded what was that word you said sachet sashet isn't that what they're called a French a packet packet okay a pack it you fancy yeah so I don't know I just I was I was intrigued by it I do kind of want to try it um I'm going to assume it's expensive did we look at that I didn't look at the price I mean got you got to pay for rebranding somehow yeah yeah I mean even the way they're pouring the liquid from the can like dropped uhoh cuz it was $223 and I'm wondering what that what that gets you oh oh it's 24 pack of electrolyte drink 28 core hydration sashet they're called sashet yeah that's probably where she got the word 28 energy hydration 28 sleep and a bottle so that's a month of stuff and it's nearly $250 okay well now that this product is out I'll respond to this email and asking for some samples to send to both of us so stay tuned people for what we think yeah I don't know I liked it our first question this week is from Carrie while Carrie W I think um thank you for your super helpful content and always entertaining podcast I've caught bits and pieces throughout the show about your running backgrounds but would love to hear more about when and how you got into running how running has changed over the years for you all Etc you are all humble people so this might feel weird but always fun to know running histories thanks for all that you do that's a fun question that is I thought so too I thought so too I figur we could just say how we started running and how it's changed I thought that was fun yeah MH thanks all right T kick it off all right since I probably started before both of you guys I don't know about feathers but in um you know 2006 I was going through a tough time my father passed away from uh like kind of like a mix of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's I'm not even sure they never really came up with a diagnosis but it was a really sad time in my life and I noticed though the whole time his brain was going his body stayed really strong and so when I went to a running event and I was like I did the 5K and I was like wow I didn't even know these people existed there's all these happy people running around and I was like you know I was going to bars and doing that kind of thing and I was like oh all these happy people what is this and so I'm sitting there and while I'm having a you know a beer afterwards with some friends one of the guys rolls up and this he was a bigger dude and he just finished the half marathon and he was like yeah that was tough but I did it and I was just like if that guy can run a half marathon I can run a half marathon so I said to my friend I think I'll train for a half marathon he's like just train for a marathon you run a half marathon on your way way to doing it so I kind of went into the deep end similar to somebody else I know um and started running and it just kind of got me hooked and I think the thing that happened to me was there was two things once I ran my first marathon I realized that I could do anything I was like if you have a plan and you execute on the plan there's nothing you can't do and so that was kind of like really exciting to me like oh wow it opened up all these opportunities for me to look at life a little bit differently and then the second thing it did was I never wanted to lose my fitness because I was like it took so it was so much work to get to that point I was like I don't want to stop and have to start over again so let's just sign up for another marath and it's gone on from there so at this point I think I've run around 41 marathons done all six Majors uh I've done several Ultra distances so Meg and I actually did trans Rockies together at one point I've run 250 MERS I've done like more than a few handfuls of uh 50ks and uh I don't know I still love running like I was just thinking like right now I'm really enjoying it um when I don't necessarily have a goal like I I don't know what my spring marathon's going to be I have an idea what it will probably be but I'm liking that kind of like no pressure training where I'm out there I'm running I'm running six days a week and just really enjoying like body moving and then my coach will throw on some fart lcks or today I had 800s so I still get get to like get you know move my legs and go fast but you know it's just there's there's so much to get out of running and uh I just love getting up early the different seasons like sometimes the sun's coming up when you go for a run in the summer you get that heat over the we get to run by the water but yeah and then um I started working with this girl Megan and um we were in an office together and I looked over at her straa and I was like were you on straa no that that didn't even exist at that time what were you doing how did I see your runs I had a I had one of those not until later I had uh the Nike watches that was basically like a timx I think like it didn't maybe it had like Pace or I don't know it had like two numbers on it and it didn't sync to anything like it's just the data just like stayed on my watch I think is a digital watch I think is what you're saying yeah those things yeah but I grew up hating running like absolutely hating it like it was the punishment for any sport that I played so I loved soccer I love field hockey lacrosse you name it I loved Sports and being part of a team but the Running part I legit hated and then when I went to school to college I gave up all the sports I was playing and so it was kind of like I need to do something and just started like jogging and I would do like one mile maybe two miles Max like every other day or every day and I did that all of my college life and then when I moved back to Baltimore I met Thomas and he told me he was running a 50 mile and I was like this dude is batshit crazy and I have no idea what he's doing and he convinced me to sign up for a 10-mile which I did well I mean I don't know how I was seeing her Paces but I was like you know for someone who's not really consider I was running 930 minute miles you were running faster than that I was not okay anyway but so I ended up signing up for this 10mile and I had so much fun I thought it was the coolest thing ever that I was drinking a beer at 9:30 in the morning after I ran 10 miles and then she also crushed it she ran like a a 730 Pace on a really hard course that has Hills yeah I I beat Thomas which was also like my really exciting thing a week after the 50 mile yeah so I was like oh I beat that dude so I'm like definitely a runner now and um went to go sign up for a half marathon that fall and realized it was $10 more to sign up for the full marathon and when you're in your 20s and you're very dumb that seems like a great idea so I signed up for the full Marathon 3 weeks before it did a couple long runs no taper just went straight into that marathon and I just I thought it was so fun and so cool and I couldn't believe that I did it and then similar to Thomas it was like well I got to do another one and I got to see if I can do it faster and faster and faster and it just snowballed from there the best part was I picked her up after the marathon cuz we were going out with friends to a um a whiskey tasting yeah you would loved it it was bourbon oo yeah and at this at this point Megan and I there was no relationship at all like it was just co-workers and like this was just I I was like Ah that's great you did a a full Marathon let's I'll pick you up we can go to the the whiskey tasting and I I you were probably dating someone else at the time and uh yeah but we ended up going to a horse track and drink whiskey you would have died Megan if you knew what I ate before during and after that Marathon like you would be like how are you still alive today you know we live and we learn a little right learn a little more that's how we get better I love it I love it yeah I mean I feel like my story is similar to you guys's you know like you kind of stumble on it and trip and then you get stuck and you just keep snowballing forward but um like Meg I grew up playing sports and I was always quote unquote the runner on the team but I never wanted to run unless it was part of a sport right but in the back of my mind if I'm really honest I was always very intrigued by people who could run for a long time so like even in high school like my senior year between Seasons I would try to run a little bit because I'm like okay I'm the you know midi on the field or the center and Lacrosse I've got to make sure that I can run and have the stamina to you know keep going back so I started kind of running for fun my senior year of high school but it's hard I mean running is really hard like I remember being like this is a really hard thing so then in college like maybe I ran a mile or two but nothing crazy um and then in grad school you know we had other things we're working towards and an internship taking you know the exam to become a dietitian so I had all these different focus and then I landed a full-time job and I was like this is it like this is what we do now like I was so bored I wanted a challenge I wanted something to work towards and in the back of my mind I always never thought I physically could run a marathon I would watch people do it and be like that is like very cool but in the back of my mind I'm like that's not ever something that you're going to do you know like that feels very very hard to think about that and then the guy I was dating at the time was training for the Cleveland Marathon and I was like well why not why not go on training runs with him you know then there's somebody to run with in the middle of the winter in downtown Cleveland to stay safe and all that kind of stuff so I started training he moved away we broke up he didn't end up running the marathon and I did so yeah right right and it was my first ever road race was a marathon like I'd never run a 5k I'd never you know pinned a bib to my shirt and it was kind of like that I I think I needed the challenge of can I actually do this versus like it wasn't exciting for me to go run a 10K because I was like I can run that far you know but the unknown of like can I actually do this was very intriguing to me so I just did that and then same thing finished in barely under four hours is very undernourished dehydrated and was like hm let's do it again and then the rest is his that was in 2009 so it's been a been a hot minute so you were 2006 you were 2009 I was 2012 there that's crazy that's wild the craziest thing about well I I guess I did it in 2 I'm not sure if I started running yeah it would have been 2006 but um it's interesting to me that all three of us are what I would call adult runners like we didn't run in high school or college all of us played sport I played Midfield lacrosse at my school I played basketball I was a avid skier and snowboarder but it's almost a blessing to start yeah as an adult cuz I yeah I think that if you knew how fast you would could like I'm watching my son right now he's like dropping sub you know he's he's an 18-minute 5K for his CrossCountry team and getting faster he just he just joined track for the winter track indoor track season and he's going to be really fast and when he's the age that I started running he's going to be not able to run as fast as he could probably back in at these times and I think it can do a mental F to people that you're like okay you can't get that longevity that Lifetime Love for running if you're comparing yourself to high school and college and that stuff like I had no when I started running I had no idea what fast was I had know it like what is fast like you remember you asked me what should I run my first marathon and I was like I know a lot of people like going sub four so what' you end up doing 256 or 356 sorry yeah and you sounds like you did the same thing yeah 358 yeah yeah it was wild and I do I think too A lot of people who start running early or running College get really burned out you know like I I I see a lot of people that don't enjoy we the three of us love to run and I think that's a piece of this too like even when it was hard and it still is hard I still love the way running makes me feel and that's what keeps me coming back it's not the times it's not that I work in the running industry now you know like it's literally like I love how I feel when I run during runs after runs and I think that's what keeps like us coming back to it and then it's cool that we can also get faster and do cool things and go to Epic races and travel and do all these amazing things with something we love so much um okay now that we've chatted all about our running for for a good bit of this podcast let's get into a few more questions here this one is from Adrien Rustin they said I recently ran the 2024 New York City marathon hey congrats I battled an injury in my training cycle so I fully expected a slower time on course just enjoying the day not a Meg 3:30 chill but more like a 435 situation knowing I wasn't racing I did set a goal to nail my nutrition I took sis gels every 30 minutes just as I had all my training runs at about the 230 Mark I could no longer stomach my gels also I had been alternating water and Gatorade throughout the race and the Gatorade was also making me queasy I ended up running a 420 but didn't take a gel after the 3-hour mark and definitely felt the energy start to wne what could I have done differently to keep my nutrition going could I have been dehydrated I did I did drink it every single stop any other things that could have caused my nausea I feel like you have addressed this before huge fan of the podcast thanks for keeping us educated on nutrition it's it's interesting because when I was running with Carl and this was early on like mile 4 he had just taken one of the Gatorades and he was like oh that did not sit well he's like I am not feeling good and so I'm wondering if like always they weren't exactly um the right mixture of well also were they training did he train like I don't I never train absolutely not and that's I wonder the same thing about Adrienne like maybe she didn't train with the Gatorade because it sounds like she trained with the sis Js every 30 minutes so that was not something that was new maybe the Gatorade situation was new and the other thing that I do worry about if if Gatorade is watered down you're not going to get as many electrolytes so that kind of sucks but it's not going to harm your stomach but if it's too concentrated our stomach doesn't like that especially if we're taking a concentrated liquid with a gel it's just a lot of carbohydrates in our stomach that could potentially cause some nausea so it's possible that it was that um a lot of times nausea is a lack of sodium so yes it wasn't very warm that day but maybe she went into it a little bit dehydrated and then wasn't getting enough sodium because the sis gels only have four milligrams of sodium per gel um so it's even lower than Morton is and then you know so it could have been a lack of sodium you know not knowing if she's a salty or heavy sweater that would be you know a piece of interest for me um the sis gels you know tout themselves as being quote unquote isotonic which means the concentration is similar to our stomach so we talk about like if we dump a bunch of sugar into our stomach we have to dilute it so our stomach doesn't get upset so the sis gels are supposedly the same concentration as kind of how our stomach accepts things so it shouldn't have been the gel um however you know sis gels also do have some artificial sweeteners in them which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me so I don't know if something like that could have upset her stomach but a lot of us drink things with artificial sweeteners too she also said that she didn't take a gel after the three-hour Mark and I'm wondering wondering if she probably didn't do a training run longer than 3 hours yeah I was thinking that too cuz she's running a slower Pace than she is used to running so she's going to be out there longer she's going to be taking more gels than her body is used to taking in training or in another Marathon so I think that could have potentially had an impact um the other thing I wondered too is nausea could be related to what we ate like before the run so given that it was a late start if she ate more fat fiber protein those types of things take a longer amount of time to empty from our stomach so it's possible if she had something that had a lot of fat or a lot of fiber or more protein than she was used to pre-run that could have trickled over and impacted how she felt out there so lots of different factors so I I think for her maybe it was the time on feet was longer than she was used to maybe she needed more sodium um and then also maybe what she ate before those would be kind of the boxes to check see this is why you're a genius because I was going to ask you about you know the stuff that that we do before the race you know we always stick to you know people eat toast with peanut butter or do stuff but a lot of times when we're traveling you kind of scrape together what you can get at a location I know mag's now in the habit of stuffing a shoe with graham cracker so that she has what she needs before run but a lot of us like we'll go to like the grocery store before and we'll get some raw bagels or you know like whatever's there and we'll go to the aisle with the peanut butter and just get like even maybe a brand we're not used to like if you get the Justin's packets or something like that to squeeze on a bagel and you're cramming them down even though you're not hungry before you go how does that affect during the race because I would think that most of the time we're digested about before the time the race starts if we're eating the the two hours before or whatever MH no I think that and that's something I always work with my folks oneon-one like very early on I'm like hey like we're traveling for this race or maybe we're not right it's more so for people traveling what are we going to be eating the morning of our race let's start practicing that now before our long runs um so I do think that's a good thing to be thinking about and practicing and it could be a very small element that doesn't impact a lot of people but in her case like maybe it did you know so I think we're dialing everything else and let's make sure that pre-run nutrition's dialed in too so do you find like you've worked with several people now um for multiple races the people that really follow your advice what's the percentage of those people that are having a GI issue or a cramping issue or can't get things down is it have you had pretty good success with people avoiding these situations yeah I mean the marathon's a beast right like things can pop up even when we do absolutely everything correct you know it's a it's a wild west we see that in the results in marathons we can never predict who's going to win and who's not right and it's wild I mean just look at New York City like no one didn't think Helen would win again you know um so it it is pretty crazy what can go down in a marathon but as far as when we have committed to working through all of the pieces and parts to support ourselves come race day people have outstanding results like even you know people I work with with different PRS and then also just people who listen to the podcast and take our advice you know come back with I had a 10-minute PR I had a 15minute I mean it's wild I I screenshot them all the time and I'm like I'm gonna do something with these at some point and I haven't yet um but it's it's just so cool to see when people take this into their own hands and really dial in their nutrition um like how much better running can feel and how much better the results are and how much more you know back to our initial conversation of like getting the most out of our bodies from running you know from where we started and where we are now it's just absolutely incredible what we can accomplish physically that we never even comprehended mentally when we really dial in all these things all right let's get in another question here this is from Meg Tim she said love the podcast I'm a literature and research nerd so if it's backed by science I'm all over it my question is regarding fueling and long runs and races I currently take a gel every 30 minutes in long runs and race scenarios I often find myself in the situation where my watch gives me the fueling alert but I only have 1 mile 10 minutes 20 minutes Etc left is there any time in the final miles of a run that taking a gel doesn't benefit you what is the top end threshold for that probably not it's probably always going to benefit you to take that gel right like I think that's kind of the golden rule here but since Meg like us loves research um let's chat through it right so a lot of things can change our rate of gastric emptying and that is going to impact how quickly that nutrition gets into our bloodstream to actually benefit our performance so we know um normally if we take a gel such as a Morton or something that is more of that engineered fuel that empties very quickly that is designed to get into our bloodstream fast it's in our bloodstream in about 12 minutes so most of these scenarios I'd be like take the gel take the gel take the gel right um now things that can delay gastric emptying would be a higher exertion level like if you're running way over your skis Pace planwise that's going to make it take longer to to empty if your core body temperature gets too hot so some of us feel very nauseous when we get too hot when we're running and like don't want to take gels and that is kind of a slight protective mechanism because our stomach's not emptying quite as quickly um the weather could be a piece of it um or other food consumed with it like we were talking about in the last question like if there's some fat or fiber or that's why some of the whole food gels take longer to empty our stomach and hit our bloodstream um just because of some of those additions in there so there are things that are going to impact it but let's just say right in like 10 or 12 minutes those gels are within our system so I mean even if we have two miles left it's still going to benefit us to take it and honestly may actually allow us to have a kick at the end or finish a little happier because our brain loves carbohydrates but then the other piece is even if it doesn't hit our bloodstream we have those carbohydrate receptors in our mouth which tells our brain like yo carbs are coming and we have an increased in performance so that's why I say it's probably never too late to take one because you're going to get those immediate benefits of just having carbohydrates in your mouth before it even hits your bloodstream so um you know I and and and also like in training taking a gel at the end even though we only have 20 minutes left trains your stomach to take gels when it's hard when you have less blood flow so it all kind of pans out I mean yes the cost of the gel sometimes you're like I could save that for the next run right but like when we really think about it like you know it is it is helpful to to fuel right up to the end I I have never regretted taking an additional gel MH I agree yeah just do it folks all right more of the story just take it I mean I'm I'm proud of of Meg for being like willing and and wanting to take those last gels all the time because my struggle is not like oh should I it's like I physically cannot take this right now is usually the answer for me it's not like should I yeah B comes back with a sweaty crinkled up one that's now and it's not saving it because she'll put it in the drawer and she won't pull that one out for the next run it just sits there for it looks gross now and then it expires and then it expires so it's actually a wasted gel yeah that's a good point nobody wants it I'm not I'm not like I'll take this Morton that looks like it went through with a I brought them all to New York City marathon and I left them in the VIP section for people to have if they needed them great they pre- swe it on yeah no it was it was not it was just a bunch that I had that were going to expire in like a week or something that's why people are getting diarrhea on the course all oh goodness um sabotage okay our next question is from Seb short for Sebastian I don't know how to say his last name g g g g g g a g NE yeah okay Seb said love love the oh he's Canadian love the podcast and I'm a loyal listener up here in Montreal Canada my question is about sodium maple syrup I've been using more electrolytes for my long and not so long runs more consistently I feel like this helps me as I'm preparing for my first marathon this fall I was looking into how much sodium is needed for the for this distance I found an an article in runner world that said that sodium doesn't really help to prevent cramping dehydration or nausea is this actually true the article was dated from 2019 and I wonder if re research since then has confirmed any benefits of taking sodium supplements for longdistance running keep up the good work and thank you in advance for answering my question and before we start Seb I'm sorry that you're paying for a subscription to the pay wall of Runners world you can just get this for free on on uh on Megan featherson website or read stuff on believe in the Run do you think Morton sponsored that article on Runners World probably 2019 it's possible yeah it's very possible yeah um I had to giggle about this one because I mean how many times have we read Runners World articles that are just so black and white and just so ridiculous and you're like was this actually helpful or is this actually more confusing than anything yeah so I feel like that kind of what this one was like but again back to the black and white like there is no black and white in nutrition right so you cannot say sodium does or does not cause muscle cramps muscle cramps are crazy multifactorial there is a million different theories about why our muscle cramp there's a million different reasons why our muscles cramp but it is totally neglectful to say that it's never sodium or dehydration because it can be it absolutely can be there's a lot of factors we want to take into it when we're assessing whether someone's cramping is related to sodium and dehydration so I always want to ask like are you a heavy sweater are you a salty sweater when do the cramps hit what are you fueling with now do you avoid sodium in your daily life right there's a million things to help us figure out if these are sodium related or not and then what do we do scale up sodium and see if it helps the cramps and if it does ding ding ding that was the issue right however there is a lot of research that questioned that for a while and it was probably around 2019 would be my guess and what they were finding was they were they you I think we've discussed this on here before was that is it more an altered like neuromuscular control right like is brain not telling our muscles to contract the right way um and that's what's causing muscle cramps and it has nothing to do with hydration so I'm assuming this article was going down that route um that's why hot shot was created to try to trick our neurons into like oh this is spicy don't tell my brains to CRA to cramp yeah yeah so I mean that's one Theory she hurled I remember listening to that one yeah I do I I think it was 2019 when I went down that rabbit hole and did all that research you wrot an article on the site about and my conclusion was that it wasn't related to electrolytes because yeah I like I was just basing it off of everything that I had done up until that point and everything that I read but I was so uneducated on what a proper amount of sodium was or nutrition was or any of that so I didn't have that knowledge to understand that that was a huge piece of it well yeah that's like I think that was before you were even doing hyper hyd ation or anything like that like you were getting like a Gatorade and you like hated the taste of Gatorade and you were like H that's not it yeah but there I mean and to this day I think you can go and find a research article that's going to support what you believe yeah 100% um but it's and and like Seb said he said if he feels like it's helping so it probably is right well Megan didn't it like we talk about your leg cramps that were debilita yeah what fixed it I mean it was definitely proper hydration and nutrition was a huge piece of it but a big part of that was sodium MH yeah for sure and I've had plenty of people that I've helped through muscle cramps and there have been a few times that I'm like I don't think this is nutrition related right like that happens but there's plenty of people that have helped through it that have not had muscle cramps when we altered their sodium and hydration plan so you know I think this is a great exercise in research is fantastic research is phenomenal it helps guide our train of thought especially me as a sports dietician clinician like it really does put some guide rails on me to help people help themselves more but it's not all black and white when it comes to research the application of it the trial and error with Runners I have learned so much working with people and then there's research involved but then there's also a lot of I've been in this long enough to see what's working and what's not and you know working with people and all of you guys and you guys giving me feedback is just makes me stronger and being able to help everybody with this type of stuff I also wonder like when Runners world is talking about this what athlete are they talking about because some of these pro athletes that are out there for 2 hours and 11 minutes they like we we saw the diet of one of them when we were in Berlin she has a cup of tea and a biscuit or something before the Before the Race but she's out there for 2 hours in and 10 minutes and she probably eats a ton you know when she's preparing for runs and stuff like that I don't know what she eats maybe she doesn't um but there's a big difference between somebody who's out there for 2 hours and 20 minutes mhm and somebody who's out there for 2 hours and 40 2 Hour 3 hours 4 hours 4 and 1/ half hours just the amount of sweat cuz like when you're out there for 4 and A2 it's not like you sweat less right than if you were out there for 3:30 or or that you're probably sweating more you're out there longer so and you're still giving an exertion and that's the other thing like I've run 320 marathons I've run 5 Hour marathons by accident and the effort the effort really does feel very similar on depending on the day so you know it's it's I don't know yeah yeah and I mean even in some of the pros like I think Clayton Young is a perfect example like he is visibly much sweatier than a lot of his competitors and when we talk to him and we talk to his wife like he puts a lot of sodium in his bottles you know he he has this certain concoction that he's worked on that works best for him so that he you know doesn't have a decrease in performance related to his sweat losses um but some pros are just bulletproof and barely sweat and obviously they can have a very different approach um and the same thing applies to all of us Runners you know it's like we just got to make sure that we're getting what our body needs to perform its best and there's no cookie cutters equation for that okay Seb I think that while that article might have some wonderful research attached to it we have tried and tested and it sounds like you have too that electrolytes are probably helping you out so I haven't talked anybody that we've said hey you know what something that we've done is like load up on salty beverage the night before drink some salty beverage in the morning when you go out in the run at a certain point maybe can carry your bottle and have some salty beverage in it nobody who's done that has said you know what that really didn't work for me you're not wrong yeah so like at at worst you're just getting some salty beverage at best it's actually helping you from cramping MH agreed okay I think that does it for this week um thank you all for submitting your questions if you have a question we haven't answered you can send us an email at fuel for thee Soul podcast gmail.com and we would love to answer it here on the show especially if you make it funny and if you know you know peas and car bye SN bye [Music] stop touching your microphone I well then I have to go over here no Ralphie you're not helping oh my God Ralph I know see you're a you're a mess today mate all this is on record so that's exciting that's it I like it cuz you're Mak me yeah dude every time all right you ready for it in five four it already did three two I don't trust yeah I don't trust children at all and so when I saw you using child labor to roll out your prets I was like I don't know if I'd eat those I can't I I will probably cut that out they're they're they're probably mad at me for the pay wall comment whatever they did

  "text": "running is simple right just lace up your shoes and go but as easy as it seems there are some classic mistakes that can turn your runs into struggles struggles into problems and problems means you're not going to be enjoying a running as much as you deserve so today we're breaking down the most common running slip-ups from doing too much too soon to not hydrating and fueling your runs properly I'm going to be showing you exactly how to avoid them to run smarter stay injury free and enjoy your running even more right let's get straight into this starting out we're going to be chatting about not fueling and hydrating your runs properly this will become increasingly important as our runs get longer for everybody out there training for half marathons and marathons and potentially longer than that for your longer runs you want to be taking some sort of fuel throughout the run to keep your energy source topped up and running strong till the end so if you're going out for 60 minutes or more then consider taking some gels or an alternative fuel whatever suits you you should be taking around about 30 G worth of carbohydrates taking this around about every 35 to 45 minutes and this is really why most people struggle on their long runs because they don't fuel early enough they wait till they get tired you got to top up these stores early and often also make sure you're starting out the Run feeling fueled and hydrated beforehand this of course depends on the time of day for me it's always that classic bagel and then I'm going to be running about an hour after that nutrition and hydration is so much about trial and error what works for for someone might not necessarily work for somebody else so experiment a lot try with lots of different things and then come race dat it will all click because you know exactly what you should be doing next up I want to have a quick chat about running with poor form few of us were ever really taught how to run and consequently we pick up a lot of bad habits that are hard to unte but there are a few basic things we can do to concentrate on improving our form getting ourselves covering the ground in a more efficient way starting out make sure we're not over striding this is when you land with your foot out in front of you and this is going to create a breaking force and put a lot of strain on your joints as well we want to be focused having that foot Landing nicely underneath our Center of mass underneath our body which is when we're going to be able to absorb that impact nicely and then spring off with the next stride with our posture we want to make sure we have a slight forward lean from the ankles not from the waist this will really help you to get that correct foot placement that we've just talked about about and then finally our Cadence this is the number of steps we take per minute as we run newer Runners typically have quite a low Cadence maybe 150 160 steps a minute there are lots of ways we can increase this that's all for a separate video we'll link to our Cadence video up here and down below moving on I want to have a quick chat about strength training yes it's a bit boring but it's so important especially for older Runners getting that right balance can be quite hard getting worried you don't want to overdo your strength training because that might impact your running you're going to get even more achy muscles in those early days of strength training your body's not going to be used to it so you may get some achy muscles you may have to dial down your running a little bit as your body adapts and becomes stronger and then we can start to build the running back in I'd really recommend in those early days just one strength session a week will have a really positive impact on your running it doesn't have to be long or super intense you can simply do this at home with just some basic exercises like some squats some bridges some planks some lunges and some Cal races you can even do a lot of these on the run as well just stop for 10 or 15 minutes and do these when you're out on the run I like to do these always on my easy run day so I do an easy run in the morning and then my strength training in the afternoon as I believe it's really important to keep those rest days as for rest days next up don't do too much too soon now you might be new to running or coming back after an injy sometimes it's difficult to know exactly what you're capable of and it's easy to get carried away with maybe running too far too fast or too frequently as well or potentially a combination of all three injuries can start cropping up which forces us to have time off no one wants to be doing that when the golden rule of running is trying to achieve that consistency and that's what's going to make us a better faster stronger happier Runner overall now you may have heard of the 10% Ru which basically says don't increase your weekly volume by more more than 10% per week while this can work for a lot of runners in that middle band from We're experienced Runners they're going to ramp up far too quickly and for some newer beginner Runners it's not going to be challenging enough so it's all about using that 10% rule as a rough guide and just adapting it for where you are in your training and of course it doesn't take into account intensity that we're building into our weeks as well so I'd really recommend as you're starting to build things up in your training just change one thing at a time time frequency or intensity don't go adding loads more time to your runs doing more runs and doing them faster as well that's going to lead to some injury just change one thing maybe per week and build it up gradually like that I'd really recommend take recovery weeks as well to let our body adapt that doesn't mean of course we can't go for a run this is going to be a week every 3 to four weeks there's going to be less volume during this week and there's going to be less intensity during the week as well allowing our body time to recover I'd really recommend always following a your training plan which we have on the website link down below at benp parks.com all our beginner plans are completely free to download it's going and check those out there's links to marathon training plans half marathons 5Ks 10ks Ultra plans all on there with thousands of fstar reviews from loads of Runners all around the world that have been using our plans for years and achieve some great results and then finally in this section simply listening to your body your body is the best indicator for how well you are adapting to your training if you are feeling more tired than normal then rest up if you got particularly achy muscles then rest up if your mojo is just a little bit low lacking is some motivation then rest up which leads us really nicely on to the next common mistake which is ignoring pain when our body is telling us that something isn't quite right we're so often taught to push through pain no pain no gain mentality and it's most likely going to lead to an injury and some time off from running if you are getting some pains be flexible with your training consider your training plan as a Rough Guide but don't worry if you have to miss a few runs here and there just to allow your body to fix that pain that it's experiencing flexibility is so important over the long term as we're trying to achieve that consistency definitely seek some professional advice if you can afford to of course that's not going to be available for everybody but getting some professional advice from a physio or even a sports massage therapist and then you will know exactly what to do to fix that pain and get it out of your life and get back running stronger so many running injuries can be fixed by simply resting icing heat treatment stretching massaging and doing strength work as well so a lot of the time it's not something to be particularly worried about or scared of but get that professional advice if you can afford to if you can't then I always recommend checking out people like Bob and Brad here on YouTube they've got an excellent Channel but you've just got to make sure you're 100% sure with that self diagnosis and just build that into your strength routine to get that injury gone next up is an alltime classic everybody does this I think when they start running myself included running too fast people head out the door and absolutely tear it down the road running far too fast and before they know it they've got their hands on knees thinking this running lck is really quite difficult it puts so much extra stress on our body training this way and it's really not the best way of running fast in the long term with our running either what I always like to do with my running is around about 80% of my training a week will be at a low heart rate a conversational Pace Zone 2 heart rate zone 2 training however you want to phrase it the kind of training at that intensity as you're running along you could have a chat with a friend as you go and then the 20% of the week we're talking about some more structured training some intervals some faster Pac running some thresholds things like that and again a lot of people can be guilty of running these too fast as well going out to smash their K reps as fast as they can this again can lead to overtraining as well so if you're really unsure about how fast you should be running download one of our completely free pacing guides and it would just give you an idea of how fast to run your easy runs at how fast to run your intervals at it's going to be a really good guide that you can take in your training so why this is so important it's going to allow us to build up our mileage safely build that endurance build our cardiovascular system without overly straining our body right put your hands up if you're guilty of not warming up before your runs I am definitely guilty of this when I was running in my 20s I was and then what once you get into your 30s and now into my 40s you just can't get away with it warming up properly and getting the body ready for running especially in the colder months as we're experiencing now again it will really help reduce that risk of picking up injuries you're most likely to inj yourself by pulling a muscle of straining a muscle in those first few minutes of a run I know a lot of us are particularly time poor these days but it really does take just 5 minutes of doing some dynamic stretches so things like leg swings opening and closing the gate some hamstring stretches are really going to help you Ease Into The Run we'll link to our complete follow along along warm-up video up here and down below and then finally I just say ease into your run as well it's a very slow jog for that first K on my run today my first opening K was just over 5 minutes but my overall average for the Run was 4 minutes 26 okay just treat that opening K as very gentle very relaxed as you get going and then you can speed up and warm up to the average pace that you want to do for the whole run another one I've been guilty I've been guilty of a lot of days today it's basically not resting enough rest days really are part of our overall training this is when we're going to be making those all important adaptations and our muscles can rebuild after the tough training sessions we've been putting them through in my own training I always treat rest days as full rest days no cross training no strength training definitely no running how many rest days is going to depend on the individual for me it's always once per week now it used to be once every about 12 or 13 days but as we get a little bit older we need a little bit more rest in our routine when to put these in during the week point it's usually a good idea after a hard session after a long run and then also when you are having that little bit of chill time relaxing and resting you can be doing that in your rest day sweater or rest day te which you can pick out from my website benp parks.com we ship all around the world and feel free to use code youtube1 for 10% off your order next up we just want to touch on overanalyzing everything we're doing getting bogged down in all that we're collecting on our devices there's so many different running gadgets these days analyzing everything we're doing heart rate monitors lact tape monitors foot pods there's so much data that can be analyzed and of course it can be incredibly useful in improving our running but equally it can be damaging and demoralizing at certain times as well remember with our running progress is not linear and it does take time as well you'll always have good days and bad days as part of your training and these can't always necessarily be explained we're complex human beings there are so many other factors that can affect our running nutrition life stresses are mood I always say it's completely fine to turn these features off use them when you feel comfortable using them if your garment is telling you you're unproductive just a few days before your goal race maybe your heart rate is a bit elevated maybe you're a bit stressed about everything and then it goes and tells you you're unproductive it's really not going to put you in a very good head space when in fact you could be in the form of your life you're just a little bit stressed about about the travel and everything that's going on out there our gadgets are only as good as the data that we're feeding into them and we don't always know it's that accurate either so it's all about knowing the relationship you have with these gadgets and devices they're not always correct they're not always right they can be but just take everything with a bit of a pinch of salt and see how do you feel inside and that is the most important thing right our last one now is especially important in 2024 is simply comparing yourself to others or other people on social media of course it's really good to follow people for inspiration and ideas potentially for your own training but try not to compare your training to theirs how fast they're going where they're running who they're running with remember everyone's on their own Journey everyone's got different life stresses in their life different experience levels you really will never see that full picture on social media apps like straa can be really great for tracking your own progress but it's really important to keep that ego in check St trying to impress your mates to keep your easy runs nice and easy and of course as with any social media it's completely fine to take a break I've had to a few times over the years where my mental health has not been in a good place to be on social media contrary to what everybody says the runs really do still count if they aren't on straa or you can just keep them private and go back on straa when you feel ready to go out there and share your running Journey again there's so much to think about here have I missed any what running mistakes have you made over the years and how have you overcome them let me know down in the comments and help out the running Community as well please check out my website benp parks.com and feel free to use that code you 10 for 10% off

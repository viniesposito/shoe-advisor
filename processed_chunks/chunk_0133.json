  "text": "New Balance have just released the third generation of the super trainer which on paper seems like it could be the perfect shoe great for long runs great for easy runs and also a potential really great race Sho for people looking at marathons and half marathons but unfortunately there's one pretty big thing that's going to be putting a lot of people off but we'll touch on that later on so here is my full honest review of the super comp trainer which of course I bought 100% with my own money give that completely impartial unbiased review we'll go through all the facts and figures my likes my dislikes whether I recommend you buy this shoe but firstly let's talk about what's changed and what's all new in version 3 the super trainer from New Balance is such an odd shoe because with every new version that comes out New Balance like to change loads of different things on it so if you really like version one and then you get version two it's not the same version three again some big changes here version one had this huge stack kite to it version two had totally different geometry from that and actually did feature it in one of my most comfortable shoes of last year it was super bouncy great at all speeds and I say Ultra comfortable but a little bit unstable so what's new with version three where we've got an updated upper here the midso foam is a slightly different composition as well and the toe box at the front is a little bit more tapered it doesn't feel quite as bouncy as version 2 but it's certainly a hell of a lot more stable oh and it's also \u00a320 more expensive here in the UK but we'll touch on pricing a little bit later on right let's get stuck into the facts and figures all the stats about super comp trainer version 3 with a purpose of a shoe like this this is for your long runs and just a very premium everyday shoe targeted towards people that are training for half marathons marathons and potential some longer distances as well price-wise this is absolutely outrageous this shoe is costing \u00a3230 yes2 \u00a3130 here in the UK as a dollar equivalent that's $300 for our American friends but they don't have to pay that because in the United States this is just $180 \u20ac250 Aussie doll $330 again people in Europe and people in Australia people pretty much everywhere around the world apart from America and Canada are paying a massive premium on their shoe stackwise we're talking a 40 mil stack at the back 34 mil at the front giving a 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise for me this is coming at 325 G I've actually got this in half a size down in a UK 11 and half cuz I just couldn't find a 12 anywhere and that was a mistake I wish I'd waited and try to find my UK size 12 so it should be true to size go with your regular size don't go half a size to like I did upper wise we've got a phantom fit engineered mesh upper and a gusseted tongue inside midsole we've got new balances fuel cell phone which is very soft it's a peber and Eva blend very very similar if not identical to the rebel V4 but offering a lot more stability than the rebel V4 and it's got some biobased content in here as well plate wise yes we have got a plate we've got the energy art carbon plate to add in some extra rigidity and stability and of course a little bit of extra speed and propulsion as well out soole we've got a very wide rubber out soole here the grip in the shoe has been surprisingly good as well so far you can get this in two different wids again I think this is only in America and Canada as well they're offering the two wids everywhere else we've just got that one width unfortunately hopefully New Balance might update the websites but that's what I'm seeing at the moment well let's get stuck into all of my likes my first like is this Phantom fit upper it's really fantastic and it's also really quite breathable for something that's actually quite thick as well you can see your socks or put your fingers through you can see you're going to get get some good amount of air flow through this shoe I've been running this shoe in some quite hot weather in London here in the summer and it's been really good also getting a good heel lockdown loads of heel padding at the back of the shoe here adding to that extra Comfort yeah didn't have to use any heel lock lacing the gusted tongue good amounts of padding around the tongue as well and also a good length for the tongue as some people know if you have got the elite the tongue is just so short and flimsy but in the trainer version it's just that but lot more comfortable carrying on that comfort from version two in version three as well no issues no hotpots no blisters or anything like that just good allar around Comfort stemming from this lovely updated upper my second like with this shoe is just a fantastic Cruiser New Balance have pitched this for someone that's training for those marathons and half marathons going out for your long runs and ticking off those ks in comfort and that's what this shoe has really been doing well for me at easy Pace at marathon pace and also a little bit faster up to half marathon pace it's just really really comfortable the midsole has without doubt lost some of its spark that version 2 had in my opinion but what it's lost there it's gaining providing just some non nonsense cushion some really good stability a shoe that you can really trust now not going to roll any ankles or anything like that in a shoe like this just going to go out there tick off your runs and get it done just fantastic at cruising along all those nice steady Paces yeah very very dependable my third like with the shoe as I've touched on before just that all around Comfort straight out the box it's a really good option for that mid pack Runner that doesn't want to have an allout super lightweight but quite uncomfortable shoe when they're going to be going out for 3 four 5 hours on some training runs and during the race as well they're just looking for sure they can trust for many hours out on their feet to get their training runs done and also in the race as well it's nicely cushioned but with enough extra speed from that carbon plate in the shoe to make all the difference versus that standard daily shoe that you'll get in that sort of 120 1340 price point you really feel the premium difference you're getting with something like this right as I said it's not all smiles let's move on to my dislikes the first one being it's really not the CPP of shoe you could use for all sorts of different speeds it's not going to be great for your super super fast running it's just not responsive enough for those 5K and those 10K training Paces this is a shoe that's Happy cruising along at marathon pace and easy pace and even recovery Pace as well this will be perfectly happy with that there really just isn't the same amount of pop that version 2 had this one's just a little bit Bland a little bit less responsive but a little bit more stable version two just had a little bit more range speed range that you get versus version three my second dislike is just the ridiculous priceing compared to Canada and the USA I just can't work out why they're charging \u00a3230 which is honestly crazy it's just really really weird I can't really see why they think this is \u00a330 better than something like a super blast but the rebel 4 pricing at \u00a340 that was completely fine and normal the more version 5 \u00a3140 pricing completely normal like it's only \u00a330 cheaper than that all out Flagship super light rate full peber racing shoe and it just I just can't work out the pricing and what they've done here you can go buy a pair of vaporfly 3es from Nike for only \u00a39 more expensive so his Flagship and dorphin pro is the same price as this so the pricing is just all wrong this shoe really should be priced at \u00a3180 in the UK \u20ac190 all day long anyway let me know your thoughts down in the comments maybe you know more than I do but it's just absolutely crazy but there are of course some similar options out there a Shoe I had in quite recently the mauno Neo Vista \u00a3 150 you get in the plate you get getting some really nice high-end foam in that shoe and you're getting some good comfort and it can do a lot of things that this shoe can do as well something like the Boston 12 140 again you get in the plate you get in the premium Foams in there as well or the Hocus skywood X again a plated everyday type of shoe I haven't actually running the Boston 12 or the Hocus Skyward X so I can't recommend those but we will be getting them in for a review on the channel but as you can see with the pricing of those shoes significantly cheaper than this so it's really hard to recommend but anyway let's have a chat about my final thoughts on this shoe do I recommend this shoe 100% definitely if you live in the USA and Canada or you're going to be visiting soon then maybe try and pick it up but at \u00a3230 I couldn't possibly recommend this it's absolutely crazy is it worth the upgrade of a version 2 probably not I just really like version two it's just bit more poppy bit more versatile but if you're looking for something that's got a more stable ride then yeah you're going to want to upgrade to something like this so who should buy a shoe like this someone that is looking to train for a half marathon or Marathon prioritizing that Comfort over all outspeed for their longer runs so that's it guys let me know your thoughts on the super comp trainer have you got it are you going to be getting it in have you been put off by the price or are you in the states and you love this shoe I really wish this was 1880 and I'd be giving it a much more glowing review but I just can't at that price unfortunately we've got our full New Balance comparison video down up here for you to check out next to go and see that and we'll be updating that probably next year at some point so that's it guys guys let me know your thoughts keep on working hard keep done we see you in the next one",

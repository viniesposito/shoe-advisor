believe in the run and this is Megan with Featherstone nutrition okay do I even have to say it anymore we've been doing this now for a couple years let's see your news yeah let's see the we even got new brand on it's shiny there you can kind of see it better so for those of you who are listening who can't see it feathers marked herself for life with a new tattoo that looks like sort of it's I would say it looks like Arrow but it's not because it's more like almost like um what do you call those things that you can measure like straight down like you hold and it it it's like a plum or something they call it it's supposed to be an arrow with a feather on the end so I don't know what you're saying I okay it looks like that but it's with one feather it doesn't look like your traditional Arrow yeah right no no no it's you know got some artistic Liberty I like it because you can point it the direction you want to go yeah and when you do this way yeah and if you did the Usain Bolt thing where he shoot like shoots an arrow you're you have it back there already yeah you're going to have to think of some new like um Mid race photo moves you can get and like Finish Line yeah you're going to have to work on that so think about it yeah I also think that you should do a feather to nutrition T-shirt with long sleeve with it printed on the on the sleeve that would be cool we on the sleeve on the same place so like everyone can have the same tattoo everybody can have it yeah it's not V anything I love it I think who wants to be like [Laughter] me oh my goodness no I do still like that I like that idea I do too um okay you are listening to fuel for the soul the podcast where we chat all things hydration and nutrition and how it affects performance and today we're going to talk all about injuries and how to come back from them and prevent them and all that good stuff but before we do we want to chat about our sponsor Runway who is not only sponsoring this episode but all of our episodes in 2025 we're pretty excited about this yeah right I mean they are in it to win it I mean I I I do want to tell people like when we take on a sponsor like this it's not lightly and we I've been using the product I know that feathers has been using the product quite a bit for I mean I guess it's it's I mean been over a year it's been over a year started with a collagen drink mix mhm and then um yeah cuz when we went to Orlando I think it's when the first time I met cam in person yeah and i' been using it for a while um that was last February and now I've been using the protein with the Crea te yeah so you know we talk a lot on this podcast about the importance of carbs and how we need to scale up carbs for our performance and I think you know we make that pretty clear but we also know that our friends over at oneway have a product for us that Thomas was just talking about which is their complete protein so it has 23 grams of protein per serving so you can scale that up if you need to and it contains creatine which we have a full episode on as well um and we're realizing that that might actually be something that we need as Runners as well well yeah and we've added in and I think a lot of Runners are doing this now are adding in a weight routine or some strength training to their efforts uh you know to stay healthy we're going to talk about injury and I really feel like that's a a big plus is having having that uh creatine in there for workouts and that protein for muscle building so it's not just for running but you can use it if you're doing other activities as well and I actually didn't know this this is in their notes to us but this is a vegan Protein that's made from fermented nutritional yeast um which is derived from a byproduct of the beer industry so that's interesting and so it uses less land and less water and Whey than the usual vegan protein and in studies it's been shown to be just as effective as way based protein for building muscle so but that's with an additive right the Lucine or something isn't it that's the cool thing right that's the cool thing about this vegan protein is most vegan protein powders are deficient Lucine which is our trigger to actually stimulate our muscles to recover and grow and rebuild but this fermented nutritional yeast is just naturally higher in Lucine and to my knowledge this is the only vegan protein powder that's made from this fermented nutritional yeast um and don't worry it doesn't taste like beer and it doesn't taste fermented by any means I think it's actually quite delicious yeah um if you guys haven't yet and you want to go try it you can go to runway. lifee so that's rnw dolie and then use the code feathers 15 for 15% off your first order good World folks here we are to talk about not the most fun topic but a very important topic as almost everyone I I mean maybe I can say everyone who is a runner and has been a runner for years has experienced some sort of injury in their in their running so Megan this is very fresh in your mind um talk to us about what's happening and and what we're going to go over today so first and foremost I was curious like is there research on how often Runners get injured and it looks like over 50% of Runners get injured on a yearly basis like out of the whole pool of Runners like half of us have something that side side lines our training at some point whether it's just a week or two or whether it's like a big injury like it wasn't differentiated but I mean we know running is a tough sport on our body and what what constitutes an injury what what like when we talk about injury because like I think all of us get like niggles yeah there's you know you wake up like I woke up this morning and I was like ah my body feels a little beat up and then you start running you feel fine but like I think that there's that fine line between hey you can can continue your training and hey you should maybe pull back or see get an x-ray or something well and I think that's the hardest part is like when do you know when to push and when do you actually pull back when it comes to pain or discomfort or and I think a lot of us are kind of in that boat because like you said when you're in a training block like things don't feel wonderful like things feel creaky things hurt when you get out of bed in the morning like you said sometimes things feel better as you start to run sometimes things feel worse and it's like what do you react to What do you go seek help for what do you shut it down for I think that's something that we would all love to have like the perfect answer for um and I'm not sure that we actually know this and it was really interesting this morning so this was like what four hours ago I put a poll on my Instagram stories just asking like hey how many of you have been injured you know in the past five years 92% of people have said yes so far so I mean that was like I think 1500 people had answered it when I logged on here so I mean like that's nuts right like I think we've done one or two podcasts on injuries but I'm not sure we've actually given them quite their due due diligence on here yeah um because I don't think any of us really want to talk about injuries we don't want to talk about the fact do what we love to do myself included segue yeah right before we get into that is there any when people talk about there's kind of different injuries and I I always get this one confused it's kind of like feet fever cold whatever yeah I forget which one you're supposed to do when you have a cold but when we talk about uh I remember I had my coach one time told me if while you're running it doesn't hurt then you can continue running but if you if it hurts while you're running you should stop is that is that right I I think it's so like you can't even say that statement like that blank statement just because there's so many factors involved um it and it depends on if it's like a tendon or a bone or a like it's just there's so many I don't think you can say hey if it's like this do this yeah it's so hard it's so so hard I'm looking for the cheat code right I think we all are and I think that's why you know it's so hard to try to figure out what this looks like so you know after Berlin I ran a great race there and I felt better than I've ever felt after any race I didn't feel beat up I felt great I was like super stoked to get back to training and run New York city so started back I don't know maybe five days off and I was like me I feel great let's train you know got back to it and still felt good and I was having some back pain that I started to go see my sports chiropractor for he thought it was like a dis issue and same thing he told me he's like if your pain is a four out of 10 or less run right so I mean like I guess that's something out there in the you know the community so I was like oh well it hurts a little bit but as Thomas said I'm like it feels better when I keep running and it kind of hurts when I get up it kind of hurts when I do certain things but like to our point you know I think as Runners we learned to run through pain which is probably not a great thing when we need to shut things down for injury because I I don't know about you guys but I feel like my pain threshold specifically when I'm running is probably higher than it should be because we've learned to push our bodies like crazy through marathons and also I probably I can always speak for myself but I have like crazy endorphins when I run so I think it kind of minimizes the pain and then after you stop you're like oh my gosh wait something actually hurts right so it's like I think it's really hard to have that judgment call like in the middle of a run in the middle of a race of like do I stop do I keep going so that was kind of the situation I was in building back to New York City um you know and he kept saying oh I think it's just a disc I think it's just a disc it was just like some low back pain really didn't think anything of it honestly um and it the last long run I did it was I went to stand up off my front porch when I was done and I was like oh something doesn't feel good there you know like this doesn't feel quite right so I didn't run at all until our ShakeOut in New York City and I was with Meg and I was like ready to cry I was like something's wrong like this really really hurts you know so as you all know didn't run New York City kind of shut it down at that point still had no clue what was going on you know was being told that it was a dis issue and those things can resolve pretty quickly on their own so like you may just wake up one day and be okay was what I was told so I kind of was just like okay you know maybe I'll be okay but again like limping around New York City for the whole weekend um so then when I got back I have a really good friend who's a physiatrist that works specifically with Runners she's a runner her husband's a runner so I texted and I was like Hey like this is what's going on she's like you need to come see me so I immediately went in and saw her and she had did some tests on me and she immediately said I think this is a sacral stress fracture she said this is exactly how they present and I wasn't quite ready to hear anything about a bone injury because I've never had a bone injury and I feel like I understand how bone injuries happen and I felt like I was doing everything appropriately you know some of the risks for like a bone stress injury is like increasing running duration or intensity quickly I mean you know I've just kind of been hanging in the high 50s maybe low 60 miles for like two years now with a little bit of time off in between so like no no big changes there um you know other things like amenorrhea not getting your period increases your risk of a bone injury that is never something I've ever had I get a very regular cycle like hormones are totally fine um not eating enough can be another sign of a bone injury and I'm like you know kind of pride myself on the fact that I scale up nutrition and really make sure I'm supporting things things from a timing perspective so I'm clicking away all these things in my head and I'm like this can't be a bone injury like I know what the risk factors are for it and I don't think I have any of them right so you know how it goes to wait for an MRI and it was goodness three weeks maybe more before I could actually even get an MRI and then Forever Until the results were back um sure enough unfortunately she was correct so um been sidelined a little a little bit here in case you're wondering why I haven't been taking my front porch selfies Thomas told me I should do them anyways but um [Laughter] yeah so just kind of disappeared yeah rewinding real quick to your last long run when you stood up and you realized that there was an issue there was nothing out on the run that like you heard a pop or something and like all sudden it hurt it was just like a gradual MH I think that's the crazy thing with bone injuries cuz I went through I went I it takes a little bit of experience almost I think like now I kind of know after having a metatarsal break I was running and I kept running on my foot and the foot hurt and I would massage it I would go get massages I was doing you know needle something like why is my foot hurt so much and I just kept running on it and running on it until during the Charleston marathon in the last quarter mile a lightning bolt hit me and a white flash went off and I was like you said with the endorphins I crossed the finish line but as soon as I stepped over the Finish Line I like blacked out and fell to the ground because of the pain in my foot and I do think that as Runners when you have these goals and yours was to run New York and to you know coming off of Berlin and you know oh a little I'm a little fatigued I'm a little worked up I can run through this but now you know like if this was to happen again or if you were to feel this thing I think you'd be able to diagnose it a little bit faster now mine was defitely due to increasing intensity quickly and also at that time it was during the minimalist shoe craze and I was wearing all these shoes without any cushioning so I was putting a tremendous amount of stress on my on my foot but I I can totally understand how you would like delay taking care of something and thinking that it might just go away especially cuz the way that I at least my bone presented as an aching more than a like like a pain it was just like a constant ache mhm yeah yeah I mean now that like I said I've never broken a bone in my life so like I didn't really understand like bone pain versus soft tissue pain versus like you know like I think now maybe I can decipher it a little bit but you know of course you know me I buried myself in any research there are on sacral stress fractures and Runners and there's not a ton of research in any research studies it's like four or five people because what I'm learning is they're very under reported because the pain is never where the injury was like I've never had pain in my sacrum like it's always referred either up to the lower back or out to the hip so it's possible that like more people have these as Runners and we just don't realize it um just because the presentation of this injury isn't quite as clear as maybe a foot stress fracture or a FAL fracture or something like that is it just not nerves in that areaa I have no clue no clue and you know like you were saying the weirdest thing what like I said like I felt amazing at Berlin like no pain so this happened in like four or five weeks between Berlin and New York City and I've talked to doctors about that and it's just wild to me that you can go from and so they were thinking like okay it's probably just a stress reaction it's like a full-on stress fracture right like we got some healing to do here um but it's just wild to me that our bodies can break down that quickly um and you know like for those of yeah for those of us who don't know where sacrum is MHM can you describe that is it's like the very bottom of your spine so I guess you could say it's part of your spine or some people might think it's part of your pelvis so like our spine you know goes yeah yeah yeah the tailbone is the bottom of the sacrum absolutely so it's almost a little bit like a heart-shaped bone that's at the very end of our spine you know I think it's still part of our spine but don't quote me on that so it's like how do you get a fracture in that thing so that's the thing like that's what it takes a lot of force right from there so you know I wish I had the answer of why do you get a fracture in there because I'm searching for that answer and in searching for that answer like I want to share with everybody listening like if you are in this situation like what are some of the things at least for me as a sports dietician like we need to make sure that we're checking the boxes of like why did this happen how do we prevent this from happening again are there things we need to be doing or changing and what do those look like so um because I I think it can kind of drive us mad to be like why did this happen you know it's it's not like I understand the foot you're pounding it against the ground I could understand you know even a a thigh bone or you know the hip on the side or something like that your tail like like what Sloan's running around telling all her friends my mom's butt's broken don't bother my mom her butt's broken like thank you Sloan is this the spot and she'll like smack my butt I'm like could you not she ruthless ruthless outside of outside of obviously rest did they tell you here's what you need to do X Y and Z in order to make in order to speed up recovery as fast as possible that's a great question so fast forwarding and then we'll rewind at some point but all Sid's always trying to get as fast as possible Right get me back working oh I get it yeah so you know saving the the Allure you know that end point I've met with four different doctors now and this is an overuse injury plain and simple I can't we can't find any other reason why this would have happened 100% overuse right and that's what most of running injuries are yes we were smart about volume and consistency and shoe wear and all those types of things but at the end of the day the things I've asked my body to do over the last three years both in running and outside of running being a mom of two young kids running a business with myself and a part-time employee you know running all these marathons going to four different countries this year you know like all of those things it was just too much for my body and something had to give and because my mind doesn't like to not do what my mind wants to do I was pushing my body to do things that I probably shouldn't have continued to push it to and I should have listened more and taking more downtime and taking more rest and that's exactly how overuse injuries happen right is when our mind drives our body to do things and our body is really trying to tell us we need to slow down and we're just not listening um so you know that that's to answer you know Thomas's question is it's just overuse my body needed a break it was too much jarring on that specific area um and at some point something's got to give one of the to get to Megan's question about having it heal faster and what are the things I know that they told you and this is crazy to me because every once in a while when I'm having like a little bit of pain during like just general fatigue or whatever I'll pop a couple avils and then the next day I feel like whatever it was is gone yeah and I feel fine um but you've been told and I'm seeing I actually forwarded you a story on Instagram about nids which is Advil um and they're they're they block some of the healing in some of the things and I didn't understand why so I sent it to you and you told me that they said don't take Advil you want your bon they told me any type of nids will inhibit bone healing so it slow down the healing of the bone regrowth so that's the biggest thing with any type of bone injury is our bone is broken right and we every day we're kind of building up and breaking down muscle mass and obviously we want to or I'm sorry bone mass we want to build up and make new bone cells faster than we're breaking anything down right so it's like how do we to answer Meg's question how do we maximize that building of new bone to repair that muscle and make it or bone and make it stronger um without prolonging the injury right so it's like what is that sweet spot so very interestingly enough you know as soon as I saw my good friend who was the one who actually was able to diagnose this and truthfully I think she diagnosed it quicker than most people could have I think most people probably would have told me to take some time off and get back and I wonder if I wouldn't have figured out what was going on till well into the new year you know so I'm very thankful that she was able to help me figure this out so quickly um but she immediately said Megan she looked me dead in the eyes and she was like you need to rest like you need to shut this down right like do not walk too much do not run even before we knew what it was just because she suspected it so I got immediately very scared of like what can I do I shouldn't do anything I need to be like completely immobile so then I was talking to you know a different physician and he actually told me being completely immobile and doing nothing is as bad for bone healing as doing too much so you want to find that sweet spot in the Middle where you're getting good blood flow to that area without um stressing that bone injury anymore so I was told like as long as you're not in pain swimming biking any type of just kind of moderate activity so not trying to maintain Fitness while I'm off or anything like that but just trying to stay active from mental health for bone health all that kind of stuff so it was super helpful for me to hear that to be like okay this is okay that I'm still swimming and biking and moving as long as I'm not having pain and that in my mind that's actually helping with the healing process um but then is a really tricky spot to be in you know like I can't do what I love running which is completely okay I know my body needs that time to heal but it's like what do I do without doing too much like it it leaves you kind of in this like little bit of a strange spot why does an N said why is it bad why is it bad for bone healing so I mean it blocks our I mean it blocks different Pathways in our body that would promote inflammation and and that inflammation actually does help heal right so like we're blocking some of our body's natural response to try to heal an area I'm sure there's a much better explanation for that but I think that's a good just kind of basic one um and you don't necessarily want to block that right and I'm sure there's something that specifically interacts with actual the bone process of rebuilding that um as well so you're doing this like Balancing Act of movement and not overdoing it and stressing out more which I'm sure itself is probably a challenge but what else can you do outside of like physical activities whether it's nutrition or otherwise what else can you do so that was an interesting conversation I had with a physician recently and he said there's things we can do to speed up bone healing but it doesn't necessarily improve the Integrity of that bone so he said like right now with our research like you could do shock wave therapy which will help you like lay down some bone and like you speed up that healing but he said like bone needs time to heal so by speeding that up it doesn't necessarily mean it's like stronger right it just means that it still has work to do and maybe we might jump back too soon right so he was a little bossy with me and very much um I said something about doing a summer half Iron Man and he's like I'll tell you if you can do a summer F man I was like whoa okay thank you I mean I he was great like I'm making that sound dramatic but part of me was like good I need somebody to tell me not to do something like do you know what I mean like I need somebody to be like do not run a spring race do not try to get back you know because I think we're all like but I could do this or I could do that and that's just part of our me the medical profession in my experience has been a little conservative especially when it comes to exercis and there are their answer is always to to pull back yeah so I think it is tough you do kind of have to this is where I think really getting a good idea and understanding your body and and the messages is sending you is really important and it is like our brain is going to be like yeah I want I know that if Meg takes a week off I'm not going to have a good time around the house like it's not going to be a good place for me to be so even even though she's going to want to start back exercising I'm also like yeah give it a shot see that works yeah yeah and I think you know the I've had some time to reflect on this and you know I'm so thankful for what my body has accomplished over for the last three years like the things that it's accomplished I honestly cannot believe I I look at some of these things I've done I'm like how did you do that like I'm so thankful for everything that it did that at this point like I'm going to try not to cry the fact that it broke I'm like I need to respect that like I need to respect the fact that like this body has done a [ __ ] ton for me and it needs a break you know and it like told you clear right loud and clear that it needed a break so I am 100% in on whatever this body needs to heal if that's three months four months six months if it's a full year like I'll be back I'll be back and I'll be back stronger but you know I just I don't I'm not going to be one of those people who's like on the elliptical for three hours maintaining Fitness so that I can hop back and run like that's just not going to be I'm I just I respect the hell out of my body enough that this scared the crap out of me right that something went this wrong with something that I love to do so much um that I just I want to respect it I want to respect the healing process and you know do what I have get back you bring up a good point though here um there's two parts to an injury there's the physical aspect and there's the mental aspect and I think that our bodies are going to heal and they'll take care of themselves if you take care of them right but the mental thing I think is so much harder in what we do and to a certain degree our professions rely on us to to be active so right now with the mental side probably being really big and like await I know that you talked to our friend Emily Saul M how are you how are you working through the mental stuff and can you kind of give like a time frame of first second and like kind of like you know how they have the acceptance and denial where am I all that stuff yeah did you go through all those things and probably where are you now I mean total denial thinking this was a disc and I've been told it's actually better that it's not a disc I don't know if I'm if I'm on that train quite yet but um yeah um um um yeah I mean total denial like this I was going to wake up one morning my disc was G to be fine I was going to keep running like total denial right you know um and I think it's our love of the sport and our love to continue to do what makes us feel great that like puts us in that denial um but you know I guess to be completely transparent like I don't especially at the beginning like I didn't feel like myself without running and I think we can all relate to that like running makes us feel a certain way it starts our day a certain way like when we are truly ingrained in a routine with running like things just feel off without it right so that was probably the initial thing that I felt is just like that this was off but like I said I've been very um I don't know what the right word is um I I think maybe because I am older like if this would have happened 5 years ago I would have been in a very different space mentally but like I said like I think I'm just so thankful for everything that I've accomplished and I I truly believe I will continue to accomplish more but I just need a break right now so having that consistent thought in my head of like Megan you need to respect your body you know to your point like you guys' running is probably a little more ingrained in what you do in your career like I can still do my career without running I don't want to but like I can still work with Runners I have the experience even if I never ran another step I think I I still could do what I do that won't happen but you know so like having that and understanding that and then two I think I'm learning a lot through this process I have a ton of athletes that come with to me with bone stress injuries because there's a huge connection of nutrition to Bone stress injuries so I've worked with so many people most some of the people I'm working with right now don't even realize this is going on in the background because I don't want to make it about me you know but I'm hopeful that I'm going to learn some things through here so I can help other people more and two I think every time we experience something in life we have a greater appreciation of how to support others going through that type of experience so I'm trying to like be like okay we're growing here as a human from this really shitty thing that happened um and you know I think you mentioned Emily sa the biggest thing you know that was hard for me with this injury is like I said and we'll talk through you know some of the things that I checked the boxes on to make sure that that wasn't a piece of why I got this injury um and as we check those boxes and we're like no oh like none of this is adding up you know my good friend that diagnosed this you know was like there's too much stress in your life there's too there's excess stress somewhere Megan that is like coming out as this injury right like I said you know being a mom running this business traveling a lot all this stuff so I think for me talking to Emily Saul was like okay this is my life and I I like to be busy I like to have a lot on my plate I don't like I've perceived this type of stress as good stress you know but obviously my body doesn't so kind of working through that with Emily to try to figure out like how do I either perceive stress in a different way or do I need to decrease certain stressors or you know and I don't have the answers for those yet but I do truly believe that this was more less about running stress and more about total life stress right that kind of culminated in just the running being too much um so yeah I guess I don't have an answer for that but you know anybody who is going through this I just really encourage them to go and find somebody to talk to that was the first thing that you know Allison said to me when she gave me this diagnosis was like do you have someone to talk to about this like I think all of us know as Runners that like it takes a huge mental hit when we can't have that running hit you know so you know I really appreciated that she understood the importance of that yeah yeah for me the the running on a daily basis it kind of squeezes the evil out like there's like fog or something that's inside of me in the morning and when I go for a run I come back the other day I was like annoyed and I left I was like I just need to run so I went out and I ran I came back and I was fine but yeah so that outlet is is huge and finding another place for it now you talk a lot about you work with people that are having bone issues due to nutrition and you pride yourself in Understanding Nutrition and having that were you afraid or was there any thought in your head that you had somehow failed yourself and then sort of like how would your the people that you're working with perceive you when you're having a a issue with bone I hadn't had that thought until someone told me that someone told me the Optics of a sports dietician having a bone injury is not good for your business I had someone specifically say that to me and I honestly had not gone there until I heard that and I was like oh crap well now that's in my head but was that person a professional uh in the space but not a nutrition professional no no okay yeah um so of course I I probably take to heart what others say more than you would notice from the outside um you know so like that kind of stuck in my head and resonated for a while especially when you can't run and can't like have your stress relief you know um so you know I do I and and two I don't want to be negligent like if there was something I was doing with my nutrition and I didn't realize that I was under cutting or short changing myself somewhere I would be the first one to be like okay I think I actually need to change X Y or Z I even sat down with another professional to talk through my nutrition to see like do you see any glaring pieces like this is how I did like especially now not exercising as much and seeing how my nutrition has changed I'm like Megan you were eating plenty like there you know the timing was there the scale the scalability was there the fueling you know during runs was there so you know in my heart I truly don't believe that nutrition was a piece of it and like I said you know I've sat down and kind of hashed that through with other people so I think I'm at peace with if someone wants to perceive this situation that way then that's something I can't change you know um but it is funny like how many people because we get to spend a lot of time with you in the public you know certainly when we've been in New York or or something how many people are come up and are appreciative of the advice and they tell you how you change their running change their life through nutrition and how it it improved everything you hear that you know when I'm with you I hear that maybe you know 50 times a day uh you know as people come up and want to meet you take a selfie whatever um who who are followers on Instagram or wherever you are and then you get one comment right that and that's the one somebody saying hey you're a piece of [ __ ] and you're like yeah know that's the one I'm going to pay attention like what like when you're dealing with like um you talking to Emily and we didn't really say Emily Saul is a um a sports therapist so you know somebody that I've I've used when I've been injured when 200 um 23 I was going through an injury and it was just destroying my head um and so a couple bad races and stuff like that but she's she's fantastic um when have you talked to her any about about that like that you get so much praise and so many people you've helped and what you've done for the community and all the free things that you do for the community um but then somebody can say something kind of off-handed or you read a post where somebody questions your integrity or your professionalism did have you talked to her at all about that she actually said and it stuck with me she was like do you pause to appreciate all that appr all the folks that appreciate you like do you pause to like take in those moments like you were saying like when we go places and people are like excited to be like how much the PRS or how much things have changed and how you've changed my mentality about nutrition and all that kind of stuff and you know I was like sometimes question mark AKA I don't enough you know like I I probably don't like allow myself to take that back seat and just sit there and kind of soak it in I feel like I such a go go go person like point A to point B to point C you know so yeah I mean she was talking about that and not necessarily like to drown out the negative stuff we were just talking about like just being more appreciative of you know all the good that comes in these circumstances just as a way to like decrease that stress response right like I was just talking about like you know being a little more appreciative and in the moment you know to kind of help things not appear stressful yeah and and you know I noticed it as being a father yeah that when I see a good thing happening to my child I I glow about it I'm excited about it I'm proud of them I'm you know it it's amazing if anybody said anything negative about him I wouldn't even register it because I know him I'm like that's a good kid and he's doing good stuff I've I I noticed that about myself and I said why am I why do I do the opposite for myself MH you know it's hard not to but you know I don't know about you guys but like I've always wanted to help others and I've always wanted to do that through nutrition I think that's very obvious from all the resources we give for free from here to the website to anywhere to in person all that kind of stuff but I never actually wanted to be Megan an influencer right like that was nothing I ever I wanted my knowledge to help people right so all of a sudden we're in this position where we kind of are like people are kind of also intrigued by us and then something like this happens and I just want to just go into a cave and not talk about it which is why it is now eight weeks past the stress fracture and I'm just talking about it like that's justo right like I'm just like I don't want to talk about it but I realize that because of what we've built here that like yes it needs to be discussed and quite frankly like that's probably a shortcoming of mine to not reach out to people to want to talk about things to get help you know what I mean like yes I'm reaching out think going to help people too I do too I do too it's just how I am Megan it's not like you curled into a cave and you're like I'm not talking to anyone like you've been seeing all these Specialists to make sure you when you did talk about this injury you had all of the specifics and all the answers so that you could say very eloquently this is what it was this is what it wasn't right look at M dropping it eloquently well no she's right cuz you guys were like hey you want to talk about this and I was like I need I have a few more tests that need done like I want to make sure I have like all my ducks in a row which is again just kind of how I how I function but I do if anyone I know like I said I took this poll on Instagram and I actually was fairly defeated by the number of people that were like why don't you have a both button I've had a bone injury and a soft tissue injury this year and I'm like oh like it's just heartbreaking because I know how hard it is to be injured and even before this I've had like Achilles stuff so I've had like s so you know it's not like this is the first time I've been s used to wear cat sleeves all the time I know it's been a while but you know I guess I just I want to make sure we do diligence to like make sure that people feel supported if they are injured um and know that you know like you can reach out if you have a similar injury or you need something but but then also like if you are diagnosed we'll specifically talk about a bone injury first like if you find out you have a bone injury whether it's a stress reaction a full- bone stress fracture or even if it's like an accident you break something and you want to get back to running right like any of those three circumstances the first thing we want to do is take a get blood work so immediately got my inside tracker done to see like is anything off and the main thing that we're looking for is vitamin D because if vitamin D is low we don't absorb as much calcium through our diet which that low serum vitamin D less calcium absorption in our diet is going to delay bone healing like there's just concrete literature to show like if our vitamin D isn't where it's supposed to be it's going to take longer to heal a bone injury also if our vitamin D is chronically low it's going to increase our risk of getting a bone injury or another bone injury so that was the first thing I did is get blood work done we want our vitamin D well over 30 if it's under 30 that's when our risk is increased or we're not healing as well mine was 34 so I started 5,000 I use a vitamin D a day you know not in the danger zone but definitely could be better right especially looking at how to heal I don't think that was a a reason that this happened I don't think it was that low but definitely you know needed to increase that a little bit so started on that vitamin D um the other calcium as well so yeah there's research to show we need adequate calcium so what I did was I mean getting calcium through diet is actually better for bone healing than supplements so rather than just immediately throwing a supplement at it which if someone has like a dairy intolerance or just doesn't consume much calcium then yes by any means let's add a calcium supplement in there um but I eat a ton of dairy a ton so I actually sat down the first two days after you know I was looking into all this and calculated like how many gram or milligrams of calcium am I getting a day and I was like way over like the recommendation so I in my where you where do you get your calcium from give me when you say you those Fair life 30 gr protein shakes that I drink every morning are fortified with calcium so technically I guess it's kind of almost like a supplement but um those had like 700 some milligrams and then I always eat at least one Greek yogurt maybe two and I have like two cheese sticks most days as a snack and then you know something like tofu at dinner or you know obviously that changes a little bit but um a tofu has calcium yeah yeah yeah so you know there's all sorts of place but yeah I so I did buy like the victive calcium chew because I was like maybe I'm going to need it and then as I really looked at it I like sometimes at the end of the day I'm like oh you didn't quite get enough Dairy so I'll like take one but most of the time I'm just getting it through diet but that's a good thing to assess as well is just making sure that you're getting that calcium because we can't really store calcium in our body so if we're not getting enough to restore that bone health we're going to be taking it from somewhere else which is a bone right so you know it's definitely important to make sure we're getting enough um the other thing was interesting was um the two actually three and a physical therapist that I've been to were looking at like the physical assessment right so sometimes stress fractures could have nothing to do with anything but like gate or one of your legs is longer or you changed shoes or something like that right so looking at like how does your body move so one of the guys was like totally assessing me and for whatever reason my right calf and my right quad are significantly SW smaller than my left but it's stronger it's been like this since I had kids no one can seem to figure it out so he assessed me and was expecting it to be wonky like my angles and he was like I I'm shock shocked but he's like everything's fine with you like your symmetry is fine he was like I I I didn't think this is what so he was basically saying and then my PT said the same thing like your body is moving fine like I'm not sure sure it could be like a gate because obviously I can't run and have a gate analysis now so it could be something with that but you know down the line we'll look at that too um but nothing you know blaring there now my physical therapist did say my glute needs were very weak which I already knew that which is like that muscle that runs from your sacrum down around like on top of your butt from your sacrum down around to almost like the sides of your hips femur type area if you will so I said I'm like if those were this weak and I was running this much could that have put undue force or stress on the sacrum he's like sure yeah it might so again who knows if that was it but certainly certainly strengthening the gluten needs at this point so I say all of that make sure you've got a team of people to assess your body how it moves where the weaknesses are just making sure that you know in down I can do things to strengthen that right now right like it's not like I can't do anything in that area like I can work on some things so mentally it's nice to be like okay I'm strengthening these muscles so when I come back you know this will be better so make sure you have that team um we talked about psychological assessment right making sure like I for me personally it's those stressors the stressors in my life and how I perceive them and how I let them ruminate in my mind in my body and all that kind of stuff so you know obviously that's going to be different for everybody but just making sure you have somebody to to talk through anything it could have been a piece of this injury um the next thing was uh bone bone health so my one of my doctors said you get one bone stress injury for free and then the second one you have to get a bone scan to see if your bone density is okay so I was like okay all right she doesn't want me to get one quite yet well over Thanksgiving I'm talking and like both sides of my family have terrible histories of premature osteopenia which means in women their bones start to get lose density before menopause so that's like a big concern for this right so I got a DEA ordered which will look at like the Integrity of your bone to see if it's as strong as it should be for your age right um so two of my doctors were expecting this to be really bad given my family history even though I'm a runner and it came back and it's phenomenal so that's wonderful to see that you know I don't have like anything that could potentially cause this to happen again you know or things that I need to be concerned about because there are like medications you can on to help with bone density if you have like early bone loss things so that's not an issue but for a lot of the people I work with that come to me with recurrent stress fractures that is a problem and usually bone density is is low in people who've had a history of an Edy Disorder so like if in those Peak years of bone development we weren't eating enough we were under fueling we're gonna I see a lot of that in someone's history that does have low bone density at a young age um so if that's you know people listening that maybe you're in a similar situation that's definitely something to push for I did have to push a little bit to get my insurance company to approve it but I don't know about anybody else but I don't want I don't want this to happen again so like if I can figure out everything I need to know now um you know I would also just for your for your mental sakes you can again like check that box and make sure you know that's fine so if someone if someone did suffer from disordered eating of some kind and earlier in their life and they're fine now but their bone density is low can they fix it at this point yeah yeah so there's a lot we can do obviously running improves it strength training improves it a ton eating enough getting vitamin D up eating enough calcium all those things I've seen bone density improve for women it's really cool to to see what good nutrition you know solid training all that kind of stuff can do to help um for sure so you know that's definitely something to look at you know when we really look at the research there's a huge connection as I said with like low energy availability or red s and these bone injuries like I said sat down I really don't think that was a piece specifically for me but that is a piece for a lot of people right you know just inadvertently maybe we're not eating enough um or maybe it is like an intentional thing and we need to pay attention to some disordered eating habits um but that's certainly not something we want to overlook with any bone stress injury I have a ton of people who come to me with the diagnosis of a bone stress injury no matter where it is in their body to assess is my nutrition okay right and sometimes it is sometimes it's not so you know it's just I think that's a good thing to check that box as well and just make sure that we're you know doing everything we need to do there um you know from that perspective so those are kind of some of the things that I specifically worked through that hopefully will help somebody else if unfortunately they're in you know a similar spot yeah I think that's all super helpful to someone and I'm hoping cuz I can see someone being recently diagnosed with an injury and not and you know like just not wanting to think about it or deal with it or or even like listen to a podcast like this I'm hoping that that it reaches those people because I feel like this is I think it's the opposite I think when have an injury I'm like I want anything that will help me to fix it okay that's what I'm hoping I won't listen to it if I don't have an injury cuz I don't want to hear about it it's like a that Juju yeah I don't know I mean even though like just knowing how to prevent an injury right like all of these things like like I said a huge risk for bone injuries in females is a Manara where they're not getting their period right so like if somebody's listening and they're like I've never been injured but I haven't had a period in six months let's do something about it before we get injuried well injuried Thomas um but you know that type of stuff right like you know let's not wait till something breaks to fix it yeah okay I don't even think we're going get to any questions here because we're already at an hour mark here but I feel like this was super helpful for someone who may be going be going through an injury right now um what would you say are your takeaways like what are you the most grateful that you did in order to like you know figure this out and check all the boxes and then like what are you doing right now to just kind of help with your your mental health yeah I think finding the people that can help you get the answers you need or if you don't know the answers you need like luckily with the space in I knew exactly what I needed to figure out to make sure I knew what was happening here make sure you reach out to somebody that can help you right and you don't have to do it all alone you know the doctor that diagnosed me is phenomenal but there's also another phenomenal doctor that I wanted to talk to too you know so like get multiple opinions if you want to um find a good physical therapist push for that dexa scan get your blood work you know do the things so that you can feel like you have like an ounce of control in this situation and so that you can understand if there were fact factors that are actionable for what might have caused this right for me I just need to rest more and not be quite so crazy with all my running um and life well also find a way to get rid of some of your stress yeah right right and and two you know maybe it's just how I perceive it maybe it's not even that it's too much stress maybe it's how my body deals with it right so like even like the whole me Emily saw stuff you know like the mental piece of this all is just as important as the physical um and you know I didn't talk talk a ton about life without running which I think is the scariest thing for most people and maybe it's because I've had eight weeks to process this and come to a spot where it gets easier I guess is what I want to say like if running was taken away for you for some reason in your life like the hardest part is the beginning you know the hardest part is when it's immediately taken away and it's almost like that withdrawal if you will um and I would you know talk to your your team your doctors about what is okay from a movement perspective because as I learned in this which was actually kind of shocked like not moving is not helpful right so it's finding what type of movement your body can do I hate swimming but I'm starting to like it because that's what I can do you know and that's how I can move my body and my core is getting stronger my arms are getting stronger so it's like focusing on some of the positives from this and the things that you could potentially gain by taking a step back from the running focus and get stronger right get a stronger butt heal my broken butt you know like all that kind of stuff so um it sucks I don't want you know my positive outlook right now to you know minimize anyone's feelings if they're feeling very like this is a really shitty situation because it is it sucks when running is taken away from us but it doesn't mean it's gone forever and yeah you know there's a lot we can do in the meantime not to draw this out longer but that that I think another part of running isn't just the emotional like your daily routine but what was hard for me when I was injured is I want to be running with with Megan or I want to be running with the faster bastards or I want to be running with my friends and you see everybody else especially with Instagram and stuff you see people doing stuff and you're like I can't participate and you're all of a sudden shut out of like a life that you've built like for me yeah there's a lot of my life that revolves around friendships and everything where when you're not running you're just you're out yeah and that's why I feel honestly very very lucky like if I could pick a time for this to happen it would have been now I had an amazing Berlin I felt amazing in Berlin it sucks that I couldn't run New York but no one wants to run in this 30\u00b0 sleet and snow in Ohio like Now's the Time to get better I have to tell you Megan I have been so unmotivated to run recently and I'm not doing any like hard workouts I'm just doing some base mileage to keep like a normal amount of running in my life and every time where I'm like I don't want to get out door cuz it's cold or something I'm like I can I have I am not injured I can go out and run and so your injury while it sucks has also made me rethink about running in general in a positive way so yeah yeah and this is the hard time posi to all of it there is there is yeah and I'll be back and thank you for those who gave me space and didn't uh what's going on what's going on why is just drive a blank you know like thank you for people who gave me some space through there but as you all know I'm ready to talk about it so if anybody needs to chat now I'm here all right yeah and thank you for sharing all of that because I know like you said it's not what you want to be talking about but it is what we're talking about so we appreciate it yeah definitely we'll do some more on injuries we have some questions to answer so we'll chat a little more about it here in this new year I'm sure we'll get more questions after this episode yeah is it time do it peas and carrots [Music] bye okay [Laughter] it's fine I added these you know it's fine get this together my brain is not firing on all cylinders um yeah you know what you you don't want to snap bones but you know what you do want to snap what peas oh wow really bringing that back yeah and carrots",

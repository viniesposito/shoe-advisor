  "text": "this is the cloud boom strike LS the upper is made by a machine that sprays on the upper cures it with UV light and then inkjet prints on the color the entire process takes only 3 minutes and to see it in person is remarkable but is this a shoe you can actually run in it's time to pull on the cloud boom strike LS and take it for a run [Music] [Applause] [Music] yo what's going on my name is kzi and I'm an non Elite Runner reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I'm talking to you guys all about the on cloud booom strike LS but before I give you my thoughts on this isso I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that on sent to me for the purpose over review so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the on cloud boom strike light spray and let's start with the specs we got 40 mm of sack heite in the heel with a 5 mm drop giving us 35 mm of stack heite in the 4 foot and in this shoe as far as the midsole goes there's two components there's helon HF that's on super foam it is a biobased PBX material that uses at least 40% biobased materials I believe it is the same compound that we see in the nonl spray version of the cloud boom strike now something to keep in mind about these two shoes is that other than the differences in the upper there are some significant differences in the midsoles of these shoes even though they do share a Midol foam compound one of the things that you'll know if you look at them kind of carefully is that there are four clouds or those holes in the midsole that an is known for in the cloud boom strike LS and there's only three in the midsole of the cloud boom strike and the other thing to keep in mind is that these clouds are in a different position both vertically in the stack of the shoe and forward to back in terms of position of the shoe the clouds in the cloud boom strike are in the heel there's three of them here and they're below the main portion of foam that runs the length of the shoe in the cloud boom strike LS we have four clouds that run along the side of the shoe they don't go all the way through like a lot of clouds do in different on shoes but they're also kind of in the middle layer of the shoe here which is something that I had wished that the regular on cloud boob strike had done because those clouds although they seem kind of decorative they actually do have a significant impact in the way that the foam deflects and deforms something that is similar though I believe between both of those shoes is that they have a carbon fiber speedboard now speedboard is kind of like a carbon fiber plate but on uses them in a wide variety of a lot of their shoes and they're not always made out of carbon when an is talking about speed boards but the cloud boom strike and for the cloud boom strike LS those speed boards are made out of carbon now on the outsole of the shoe we have a pretty standard array of rubber that we see in a lot of racing shoes we've kind of got like the front third of the shoe covered basically where you're going to be pushing off from and then we have got two little patches of rubber along the heel now on the inside of the shoe there is no strobo board there's no insole in fact we have a setup that I think is pretty similar to what we saw in their Cloud boom strike where they have like a kind of a drop in insole SL midsole chunk that they put in the shoe and at least when I asked them about the regular Cloud boom strike on says that they do this so that they can remove the Strobel board and remove the need for a separate insole you're standing directly on that biobased PBX now I I'm not brave enough to try and remove the insole from the cloud boom strike LS with the way it's constructed I feel like it's an integral part of the shoe It's seems more than just glued down and now the the main story about this shoe is the upper I had a chance to go to New York for the popup that they had set up there for the New York Marathon and see the machine in action uh I will say that it looks pretty much exactly like what the promo videos for light spray machine looks like online on has put together a really cool video that only takes 3 minutes to watch from beginning to end about how this compound is sprayed onto the shoe very much in a Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs kind of way uh cured and then painted and then kind of they go through the steps it's not like you do all the spraying all the curing and then all the painting it kind of goes back and forth steps at a time depending on what needs to be done with the shoe uh but still nevertheless it's a really fast and fascinating process the one thing that I'll say is when I watch the videos that an puts together it kind of looks like you could see the stream of the substrate being applied to the shoe no matter how close I looked at it and the lighting wasn't perfect for trying to depict this I couldn't see that spray it just kind of looked like a sprayon wet material was being applied to the shoe and then as you kind of like stepped back and like figuratively zoomed out you could see that like material was being added onto it and then every once in a while they had to like run it under a brush to kind of smooth everything that had been sprayed onto the shoe then they would cure it and then they would add some more and then do a little bit of painting and kind of repeat all those processes until you were all done and the result is a very lightweight material that I believe is made out of TPU I'm still waiting for confirmation from on I'll update either in the description or in a comment below if I ever get a follow-up confirmation on that but based on some of the stickers and labels that they had to put inside this shoe to prepare it for mass production and for sale uh I believe that the upper is made out of TPU and uh despite what you might think it's actually pretty robust I mean you can really kind of Yank on it quite a bit and it will stretch a little and the way that they told me to try this on when I had a chance to try it on in New York was to kind of like stretch it a bit and be aggressive with it so that way you can open up the the opening by the ankle to get your foot inside and then kind of use your fingers as shoehorns to let your foot get inside and then once your foot's in it it all kind of like goes back and morphs back into its original position and and some of the sensations that I'll say that I feel is that it feels a lot less snug than I thought I would it's certainly snug because there's no laces on this thing uh but I really thought that it was going to Crunch and almost like vacuum seal in all my toes I didn't get that at all but I am getting like pressure across like the widest part of my foot I feel like it's um if I could use my hand as an example if these are the pads of my feet like right here at the ends of the pads of my feet that's where I feel a little bit of tension and I feel some tightness on the shoe but otherwise it's really comfortable and it doesn't really feel like it's all that different at all which is kind of what I want out of a lot of technology I don't want it to really feel all that different I just want it to work and this upper definitely works for me the other thing that I was worried about is that kind of like this Edge uh looks kind of Unfinished and based on a lot of kind of knit shoes which is the closest thing that I was kind of mentally comparing it to anytime there are these unfinished edges and this goes high it's kind of like a midtop uh I was worried that this was going to cut into my skin and I didn't have any problems with that at all my low cut socks didn't always come up over the edge of the light spray material and even though there was a lot of rubbing against my ankle none of it ever caused any irritation uh much less any chafing so that was a real surprise as far as the upper goes and then when you're touching the inside of it it's really smooth almost creepy smooth kind of like a synthetic leather fake skin kind of texture on the inside it's it's really quite amazing now altogether an says that this shoe comes in at 170 G and that is just incredibly light but the size of shoe that they're using for that 170 G figure is an 8.5 in US men's which is smaller than a reference size I do happen to be reference size and a US men's size 9 for me in this pair of shoes on my scales came in at 188 G which is still incredibly light cuz it's a me near 6.6 o making it one of the lightest shoes on the market [Music] today now that we've talked about what this Sho is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on the road I'm really enjoying the tweaks to the midsole experience that we have in the cloud boom strike LS I feel like there's more cushion and softness in this shoe but it's still exception Al good at fast running when I'm running V2 max type efforts or faster getting all the way up to mile race Pace I feel like there is an incredible smoothness to the entire experience almost as if the shoe itself is carving the asphalt that I'm running along and it just really works well for when I want to be as powerful and as quick of a turnover as my legs will allow me to produce but then when I dial it back to some of the more intended effort levels of the shoe when I'm running threshold level or towards Marathon effort Pace uh and I'm landing a little bit more in the midfoot I feel a little bit more of the kind of Technology of the shoe I'm feeling the clouds a little bit more because I'm landing more midfoot and I'm feeling a little bit more of the interaction I guess there's more time for my body to sense the interaction between the foam and the carbon fiber plate and and how all those things are interacting with my stride and my pushup and I feel like it's all working in a really nice and Powerful way now on Marathon shoes have a tendency for me to be a little bit firmer than I'd like and I still think that that applies to this Shue here and I guess to kind of translate the experience into something that I think a lot of you will have tried before is I think that kind of what I'm feeling in the cloud boom strike LS reminds me a lot of like the adios Pro one like the Light Strike Pro that was in that shoe um that was a little bit on the firm side but ultimately had a good amount of cushion and had a really great amount of pop and give you a really powerful push off and stride sensation I feel like I'm getting a lot of those similar kinds of feelings in the on cloud boom strike light spray and I I know that a lot of you guys have probably come here wanting to hear all about this upper and and have me go into Exquisite detail about like how this is different from a traditional running experience but I think it's like running in a a shoe that has a really good knit or otherwise minimal upper but it's doing it in a way that's extremely lightweight there's no like potential problems that I'm really foreseeing with this so far it fit really well for me I took it on a really tight turns and tangents and I didn't feel like I was sliding around I feel like a lot of the concerns that people have with knit uppers are kind of being recycled and reased for this shoe but the material is both strong and flexible it's both stretchy but also retains its shape at at the the same time I'm not really sure chemically scientifically how all those things can go together but they all seem to be going together really well in this shoe I will be keeping an eye on for a longterm usage uh if the upper is going to stretch and mold to my foot and kind of the barometer that I'll be comparing it against is not whether it stretches even a little bit or not but does it stretch more than say a traditional racing upper does it stretch or deform more than a knit upper and how much of that deformation is happening relative to the life expectancy of this midsole foam so I don't need this upper to last like 300 miles like I would for a daily training upper I just need it to be able to last as long as the racing foam is going to be good and that's something that I'll definitely be keeping an eye on but for those of you that are still like really concerned about like how fragile uh this material might be just know that they are putting this into some racing Spike prototypes so they feel like it's strong enough to handle the even greater pressures and forces that would have from track athletes so I feel like that gives you a good indication of how resilient and strong that on thinks that these materials are and I'm tending to agree with them at least in my testing of this shoe so far I'm not that concerned about the longevity of this upper [Music] now before we wrap up the video let's take a moment and step back and see where the cloud bam strike LS fits within the broader on lineup especially now that they have multiple marathon Race product and then I'll also kind of talk about some of the daily training product that I especially like coming from on now on has a lot of different types of shoes that are for different types of experiences of the ones that I tend to like are the ones that use their new shape of clouds the cloud Tech phase uh clouds again are these holes that onp puts into their shoes and the cloud teac phase are the ones that are not as rounded they're more kind of triangular and the shape tends to change depending on where in the shoe that they are and I think a really great example of this technology working well or this approach working well is in the cloud Surfer I think it's a really nice spongy comfy daily trainer that's really comfortable for easy miles and even a lot of recovery miles as well and then the other shoe that I would look to would be the oncloud Clips this is a little bit taller of the shoe and it can be used as a recovery shoe and I like using it for that but I also feel like it works really well as kind of a good long run shoe something that has some uptempo miles in it maybe you're getting up to marathon pace and maybe you've got some easy miles and a couple of pace changes between easy and marathon and I feel like this shoe is really great for that and again it's using that on cloud Tech phase the new kind of cloud from on and these would kind of be my daily training the two two shoes that I would use in the on lineup rotation and then for anything faster than what these shoes could really give me or if I had a really long workout uh a long run with a lot of marathon miles in it and a lot of pace changes in it then that's when I'm going to reach for the race product and we'll put these aside for now because here's where I think it gets a little bit complicated now on currently has three different shoes in the lineup uh that are all considered Marathon product and I've asked on about it and none of these are going to be replacing each other I think they're all going to coexist in the on lineup at the same time going forward for how much for more forward I'm not really sure on didn't really say but at least for now these are all going to exist in the product lineup at the same time and the first one that I'll talk about is the one that kind of came out first and this is the cloud boom Echo 3 now the cloud boom Echo used to be the only plate carbon plated race shoe in the lineup and this is where I feel like you know on says that it's a marathon shoe but I really feel like it's a 5k 10K racer it's a much lower stack heite it's a much firmer experience um and it's a very Snappy type of shoe it doesn't have the kind of like compression decompression that I'm looking for in something that I'm going to be running in for about 3 hours at a time I think an explained it as a shoe that's really designed for people that want to run really fast and have a lot of ground feel which I think is a nice way of saying it's firm and then there is the cloud boom strike which came out uh shortly after that in the year uh a lot of people thought that this is the same shoe that Helen o was racing in but it's it turns out it's quite different and the the light spray is really the the shoe that's closest to what she's been racing in but this is a shoe that I feel like kind of adds some stack height adds some softness to the experience as well I think the plate position gets tweaked a little bit in this shoe too uh but you're feeling a lot more of kind of like super Foams uh in the cloud boom strike and then I think like the softest and I think most forgiving and I think also the most exciting at the same time shoot of the three is the cloud boom strike LS again it's got the four clouds higher up in the stack so it's closer to your foot uh but also I feel like the combination of the the featherweight upper and also the midsole which feels like it might be a little bit lighter and aier of a midsole if you ask me um makes for just a really fantastic experience and so these are kind of three different but coexisting options that are available for people that really want to race in on shoes I definitely have a favorite in here but depending on kind of the level of firmness or ground feel that you're looking for in your race product there is an option for you at [Music] on now let's wrap up the video by going over the the buying guide and we'll also talk about some Alternatives that you'll want to consider if you're interested in the cloud boom strike LS I think that the on cloud boom strike LS is the best Marathon shoe that on has ever made it's fast it's incredibly lightweight it's flexible I hope that on continues in this direction of making Marathon shoes that are more runnable to a wider array of both Elite and non- Elite Runners but for now at a retail price of $3 $30 for the cloud boom strike Ls I'm not sure that this is a shoe that I'm going to be able to recommend to anyone except for the most Avid shoe nerds and the most fervent shoe collectors let's take a look at some other shoes that are on the marketplace right now that you might want to consider instead so the first thing that I will take a look at is another shoe that I think is definitely a little bit too expensive but it's the closest experience that you're going to be able to get and that's the shoe that we've already talked about quite a bit today that's the on cloud boom strike and remember this isn't just a difference in uppers there is a difference in midsole design across both of these shoes that I think makes a pretty big difference I think that for those of you who like a little bit less cushion but a little bit more responsiveness out of your race day shoes I feel like this is the shoe that you're actually going to really prefer uh but for me I feel like it's on that borderline of like I think I could take it for the marathon distance but I'm not sure I definitely personally would prefer the light spray version of this shoe that being said the upper here is really comfortable it's still really lightweight it does come in at almost an ounce heavier though because it's using traditional racing upper materials but I feel like you're getting a lot of similar experiences and this shoe comes in at a I guess it's a more reasonable $280 now the other shoe that I think we should take a look at is a lot more reasonably priced and that's from Adidas and that's the adios Pro 3 and I specifically I'm going to highlight the three and not the four which will be coming out later in 2025 uh and the reason why I specifically want to talk about the 3es because I feel like this version of a Light Strike Pro is a foam that feels more similar to the foam that's in the on cloud boom strike light spray and I feel like there is a responsi to it it's definitely feels fast and you're getting a lot of bounce back from the foam uh and I feel like there's a little bit of firmness to it as well it's not uncomfortable it's not hard by any means uh but it's a little bit more firm than it would be say cushioned and so there is a little bit less of the compression but there's a really quick and satisfying decompression that comes with both of these shoes now the adios Pro 3 is even heavier still compared to the cloud boom strike LS and the cloud boom strike but it is readily available it's pretty easy to buy even right now and it comes in at a retail of $250 so $80 cheaper than the light spray so those are my thoughts on the OD Cloud boom strike LS it's definitely a shoe I like more than I thought I would and I do think it is the best Marathon shoe that an has put out hopefully this is a technology that can become a little bit more affordable and a little bit more producible so that way they can make it in inventory numbers where more of you can try this out uh I don't think it's a musthave technology but it is certainly very interesting to try and for you sho nerds out there you're going to want to at least find a place to be able to try it on and get a chance to experience it hopefully you'll get a chance to do just that if you have any other questions about the cloud boom strike LS or any of the shoes that I talked about today feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet stop by the live stream I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kfoi Run Club Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all I have for today everybody thanks so much for making it all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music]",

  "text": "this is the Nike Pegasus plus the daily training shoe I have been super excited for I've been testing this all week over loads of different types of runs and I'm here to give you my 100% honest thoughts but first before we get stuck into it let's take a little trip down memory lane in 2018 Nike came out with one of the best ever shoes in my opinion the Nike Pegasus turbo which is this one here this is actually my girlfriend shoe but this was one of the first ever Super Shoe trainers that the world had ever seen there was a huge marketing campaign behind it all the influencers had it and it really was one of those shoes that definitely lived up to the height thousands of Runners myself included say it was one of the very best ever shoes out there a year later they stripped it all out released version two a even lighter weighted version I absolutely loved it and then it's fair to say after that Nike went a little bit off the rails and they released the turbo next nature in 2022 which is really disappointing subpar zoomx Foams all that recycled stuff glued together heavy and narrow but now fast forward and Nike are back with this the Pegasus Plus or maybe the turbo 4 as they have on the bottom bizarrely so will this give me the same spring of my step as the OG did or will it be another let down well firstly let's dive into the facts and figures and of course before we start I bought the shoe 100% with my own money to give you that completely honest 100% impartial review right let's get stuck into the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like the new Pegasus plus is a road running daily trainer this sent me back \u00a365 but \u20ac180 we'll put all of the different currencies up on the screen now 36 mm stack height and a 10 mm drop overall Weight Wise this is coming at 313 G for me in my UK size 12 so yeah on the lighter side as we go another tick there from Nike we'll talk about all of my likes and dislikes coming up in terms of the upper we've got this lovely fly knit upper here mids salt we've got Nike's F length Zoom X foam this is Nike's premium foam that you get their Vapor Flies their Alpha flies their Fillon race shoes nothing recycled no carrier Foams here we got a ful length zoomx there's no plate in this shoe the outside we've got these two patches of the hban rubber out soole it has a weird cutout in the middle I really can't work out why they've done this other than to save weight but now you've got some exposed zumex mids here which I just think if you're going to be taking this show Offroad in any way on that's going to get a bit bashed so this is really a road running shoe only and as I mentioned at the start of the video it says Pegasus turbo on the bottom of the shoe here and on the top Nike Pegasus plus I guess there's just been a little bit of misunderstanding between the two departments at Nike over what they're calling it Nike got a lot of changes going on in their running department at the moment to try and sort of bring a lot of life back into to their running shoes so I hope you we see that as we're seeing with this Pegasus plus there are no different widths available there are men and women's different size available and this was pretty much true to size for me if you're a little bit unsure maybe go half a size down I got this in my UK size 12 they were just maybe a very tiny little bit too big I had 12 in version one 11 and 1/2 in version 2 and I think I really if I was going to get another one I would get an 11 and a half in this half a size down but it was really okay if you're on the fence go half a size down right let's have a quick chat about the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus so the Pegasus 41 has Nike's react X foone this is a little bit more on the heavy side 347 G versus 313 G in the plus version these are also 35 more expensive the Pegasus \u00a341 \u00a3130 the sizing may be very very slightly different these were really good true to size to me as I said maybe half a size down would have be better for the in these ones also the Pegasus 41 has the Air Zoom pods up at the front here adding that little bit of extra propulsion they've gone from the plus version to make it a lot lighter and the Nike X foam is far more responsive the plus version of the shoe is just a more premium option it's lighter weight it's got better foam more responsive foam it just feels better quality but the 41 is still an okay daily shoe as it goes we'll link to the review up here and down in the comments as well they are much better all around sort of daily training shoe definitely in the Pegasus plus but let's chat about all of my likes and then we'll chat about the dislikes afterwards my first one being this is just a great daily shoe it's super versatile it's handled everything I've thrown at it it's that perfect balance between the Invincible and the streak fly the Invincible being that very plush that very chunky Sho perfect for your easy runs and Recovery runs the street fly being that very lightweight shoe perfect for Speed workor and this just sits so nicely in between a shoe that can do speed work easy Pace work Tempo and also recovery runs pretty well my second like is this is a really fun foam we've been big fans of the zoom X foam here on the channel for many many years and it's a really good option for someone that wants to get out their runs but doesn't want a plate in their shoe so maybe if you are a super blast fan for example you don't like running with a plate in your shoe all the time this is going to really bring that fun factor into your running there's so many high stack height shoes out there at the moment this is a fun lower stack height option for people that want a little bit more ground feel with their running more of a traditional feeling very very similar to how the OG Nike Pegasus turbo was when that was released when picking up the speed it's got some really good level of responsiveness and it's got no problem maintaining that speed as well I did a very long run session in the shoe which is some of the footage you can see from the screen now this is me running at about 340 a pace just cruising along at some 10 minute reps here felt super comfortable throughout the whole rep and it's also really nice to get a little bit more ground feeling in your running shoe rotation to help with that Pro reception my third like with this shoe is just a great looking shoe it feels great on the feet it just brings a good smile to your face you look down you see the stripe going down the bottom of the shoe and I know it doesn't make any difference but anyway let me know what you think of all the different colorways what colorway option would you like I really like the flare at the back here the way it sort of tap is off because the everybody was having issues with the first two shoes with the way it would split at the back here so yeah this is what they had on the nature version kind of Turbo version 3 and I really like how that sort of flared at the back just a good all around good looking shoe and my final like here is the breathable upper and which really gives a really good solid lock down there's no gusseted tongue here but it's held in place by the laces absolutely fine all around good Comfort pretty good width on the shoe here it's a shame there aren't some wider width options available but Nike aren't really one for doing that type of thing that some of other brands like Brooks and hoker are really good with but unless you've got a seriously wide foot you're going to be absolutely fine in the shoe right let's have a chat about the dislikes now the first thing I'm just going to say here this could be a positive could be a negative it really depends what sort of Camp you're in so again let me know down in the comments it is certainly a little bit firmer than you would expect for say like a 2024 release of shoe but it is certainly a very similar feeling to the original shoe me sort of thinking back all of those years ago and everybody holds this shoe in such high esteem one of the best ever shoes of all time and it's true lots of shoes have moved on technolog has moved on Foams have moved on plates have moved on the world is a very different place as it now as it was in sort of 2018 2019 a couple of years ago I actually bought some turbo on EB I was surprised just how different they were from the shoes I was running in the current times so yes this is a really sort of true feel to the original shoe it's hard to say whether that's a positive or negative for some people looking for a firmer lower stack ride it's really great and you will really love this and I personally really do like it but please don't think Nike revolutionized this shoe to expect a super super super responsive very high plush shoe something like the super blast or sort of a very plush soft Ride Like the rebel version 4 it's not like that it's got this really good section of the market and I'm really pleased Nike kept true to those original feelings with the shoe with the pricing it's a really difficult one what do you think \u00a3165 for this shoe plenty of people saying it's overpriced it's actually the same price as version one and version two which when you count for inflation over all these years would make this significantly cheaper now in my opinion in the current range of shoe it's probably around about \u00a310 too expensive it puts it into the realm of all sort of the lower end plated shoes out there and some more responsive phones with without a doubt the trouble is this shoe isn't meant to be competing with them but because it puts it into that sort of price bracket you draw into those natural comparisons so yeah maybe a little bit on the expensive side and then thirdly there's just potential for a bit of big toe irritation here with the line down the front of the shoe some people are getting a little bit of irritation because the the height of the toe box isn't great it certainly hasn't affected me of all if you got a really big chunky toe then maybe this is going to be one to avoid because the toe box does sort of taper a little bit more more aggressively than some other shoes down to the front of the Shoe Right conclusions and final thoughts so should you go out and buy this shoe well for me yes I've really enjoyed it I'm glad I spent \u00a365 on this shoe if you're looking for a shoe with that lower stack height bit more ground feel to do your daily runs in I would say going up to only about half marathon distance I wouldn't want to be doing my super long marathon training runs in the shoe in 2024 we do just have some better options out there such as the super us be doing those very longer runs I'm just going to want a little bit more stack height to look after my legs just take advantage of all the tech in these days but if you want to get some speed work in then give it a go if you're a fan of the original Pegasus turbo I really think you will like this shoe is it worth \u00a335 over the standard Pegasus well yes I really do think so if you've got the budget to spend an extra 35 then I really recommend going for this shoe it's just a much more capable lightweight fun daily shoe the next video is coming up we've got the whole Nike lineup video up here if you want me to sit here and explain what each shoe is good for we've got the best value shoes down here if you want some really good value for money hope you enjoyed the video guys let me know your thoughts on the Nike Pegasus plus down in the comments and I'm off to get some more miles in this because it's definitely staying in my rotation that's it guys keep on working hard keep on we'll see you very soon in the next one",

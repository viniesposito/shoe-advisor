  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with my first thoughts on the Northface Summit Series effective Pro 3 now the second version of this shoe the the predecessor to this one is still my current favorite allaround race day trail shoe especially if it's that light to moderate Trails whether you're going short or long it just one of those shoes that really feels special you really feel confident in it it gives you that Zing the cushion pretty much everything you want super highly technical super fun to run in and this vective Pro 3 takes everything that that is and brings it to a new level I've just had a couple of runs in it both of them have been like one was 11 miles one was 14 miles about the same amount of gain they both had um right between 1,600 and 2,000 ft of gain um it was on the light to moderate Trails where this thing is likely going to shine I I still want to get this out on some more technical stuff but man I'm just having so much fun in this shoe so far um a couple of things that are different and it's not all that different between this model from a material standpoint but it's how they use those materials that's going to be different it still has that dream foam that is probably my favorite foam on the market now for trail running it's a blend of peba and Eva so you get the resilience and the moldability that comes with Eva and you also get the fun um high energy highly cushioned feel that you would get with peba and they blend it together instead of putting it in layers which many uh trail running shoes are doing right now they're putting it in layers um which is a great option but I felt that this just feels so seamless and you get all of those aspects in one that's what I've Loved about it in the vactive Pro Series I've loved it in the Ala Mesa and in 2025 you're going to see it through a lot of their lines and this is their Marquee Ultra distant shoe that has a lot of it it has four more millim of it overall um I can't remember the stack off my head but it it's up there it's one of the highest stack shoes available they counteract that with a really wide profile on the bottom so stability um in the terrain that I've run on so far it's been equally stable maybe a little less stable than the vactive Pro 2 that's why I want to take it on some more technical terrain to really test that um but overall stability hasn't been too much of an issue so far um the upper you can see is very similar to that second version really tenacious really highly technical fibers um the lock down is really nice up top this is really well mapped got some structure and good padding in the heel which a lot of Trail Racing shoes lack I love that they kept that this thinner tongue racer style tongue um has really hugged my foot nicely and I've been able to really cinch down these um braided cords these Lacy style laces made famous by something like the alpha fly um it's the racing it holds really nice um the most exciting thing about this besides four more Mill millimeters of foam is that this shoe has two plates and now that might not be legal in a road running sense this is the trails we're talking about where where these carbon plates uh don't quite matter as much from a propulsion standpoint but they we have to get creative in this world to be able to be more stable and get the propulsively um and that's going to be lower down it's embedded now for those of you that have tried the vective pros in the past you might have gotten some rubbing on that 4 foot so that was just because of that plate was so much further up right below the sock liner and so they've embedded that now and you can see that there's even some foam in between that plate which is down here and this upper plate which is a recycled carbon fiber um so it's going to be a little more flexible little lighter and that's where the stability comes from it wraps up right here in the midfoot also has those re structured Wings to to have that more Dynamic stability so they split the plates apart and for the most part I'm feeling that the stability has um been pretty much the same maybe a little less because there's a higher stack foam but overall on the terrain that I've been on that uh lower to moderate terrain really roll have some good climbs good some good descents but the the terain that you can really let loose let your legs go uh this has been such a fun shoe and I'm so excited to get some miles in it more miles in it so far on my runs I've had a little bit of that that bite right on the U medial side right underneath that uh big toe where a lot of people have been getting that uh bite and blisters I had that in the first version of the vective pro not in the second but I'm getting it again a little bit in the third um it really could be because I I ran in a a trail shoe last weekend that gave me some blisters in the forefoot uh really bit down on that part and I might not be fully healed from that so I'm going to let this one sit on the shelf for a little bit and take it off uh and put some big miles in it again I've already got plenty of miles in this shoe to do a full review but I really want to see if that 4 foot bite can be relieved and maybe maybe it's not that maybe that's the Kryptonite of the the vective pro series and it still will be a a challenge to solve I don't know but overall man this is fun this is fast I'm excited to get more miles in it check out our our full review on believe inther run.com",

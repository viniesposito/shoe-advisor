  "text": "long runs long runs long runs arguably the most important run of the week for anyone training for those longer distances and with so many shoes out there it's so hard to know what's actually best for you there's been a real explosion from shoe manufacturers launching specific long run shoes recently they designed to be comfortable for a long amount of time with massive stack Heights and softer Foams to look after your legs and keep that fatigue to the minimum so I've got six shoes today here to go through all tried and tested on those longer runs at six different price points too so there's something here for everyone anyway let's get stuck into it starting out with the cheapest and finishing off with the most expensive the first one being the pummer velocity Nitro 3 before we get stuck into it I bought all of these shoes today 100% with my own money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review so thanks very much to everybody liking sharing and subscribing to the channel it really helps us out here so much right starting out with a puma this cost me \u00a3110 here in the UK well it should have done but actually got these on for a bit of a cheeky discount PID just \u00a388 this shoe you can always find on offer somewhere stack cut of the back 36 mm 10 mm drop overall and 336 G for me in my UK size 12 the midso we've just got pummer standard foam here their Nitro foam and there's no plate in the shoe and this shoe for me was true to size I think the shoe looks pretty cool but not quite as cool as the Ben Parks PB hat which is what I'm wearing in all of this footage here so check it out in the links down below and feel free to use use code YouTube 10 for 10% off your order thanks very much guys right let's have a chat about all the likes of the Puma velocity Nitro version 3 this shoe really was super comfortable in all the training I did the Nitro foam that they're using here is fun and bouncy it feels a much more expensive shoe than it is it's a good all round daily option really versatile at all sorts of different paces and different distances as well dislikes for the shoe just unfortunately it's a little bit on the narrow sides this one is really just for those narrow fitted people average you're going to be okay but it might be a little bit snug there I think they used to make a wide version but I can't personally find it unfortunately so not sure about that but overall with their shoe if the price point is real priority this is a fantastic option great value for money massively underprice and you can usually as I said pick it up for cheaper than the RP it really is more of a general everyday shoe rather than specifically for long runs at this price point it's virtually impossible to find a dedicated long run shoe but I think this shoe really does get very very very close to it so I wanted to put it in for that budget offering here that really does do long runs pretty well moving on to have a chat about the aex Nova blast version for came out earlier this year this set me back \u00a3135 stack coat at the back 41 mm a good chunk of foam under the feet here for those long runs 8 mm drop in the shoe at a weight of 300 G so nicely on the light side here it's really what I personally love to see in my running shoes with the midsole we've got the FF blast Eco plus cushioning sizing wise I went half a size down in this shoe what I really liked about the shoe is just a great balance of light cushioning and responsive all while being super comfortable in this package as well it's also got a bit of extra width in the shoe as well so really good wide-footed option here and it's a shoe that can really pick up the pace nicely as well not one that's again just for all out long runs this one can actually pick up the pace very versatile offering but with that massive chunk of Stack height again really good on those longer runs as well and I really think at this price point around about \u00a3135 there is no better value that you can get out there what I didn't like about the shoe the wet weather grip isn't fantastic which is actually one thing that is really good with a pum I forgot to add what that in there fantastic grip there but they do actually make a tree version a trail version of this shoe which is exactly the same but they just slap a different outso on the shoe which has got a lot better winter grip so as we're coming into the winter here in the northern hemisphere it could be a really good solid daily and long run shoe to look for there and then overall I just feel this shoe is offering great value for money it's so versatile like the Puma it's a little bit hard to find a dedicated long run shoe at this price point but with these two options I really feel you can go out there and get your long runs done and also pick up the paces they're just really good allaround options but with the Nova blast 4 you just got a little bit more stack height to absorb the impact coming up through the road as well just to keep your legs feeling fresh for a little bit longer and I think that's what you're going to find by spending that little bit extra to get something like the Nova blast four right moving on to a shoe that I still have because I haven't actually worn it out we're talking about the Brooks ghost Max 2 which has only recently dropped this shoe sent me back \u00a345 stack Co at the back 38 mm and a 6 mm drop overall weightwise it's a little bit on the heavy side 373 G for me in my UK size 12 the midsole in this shoe here this big white chunk here we've got the DNA Loft version 3 which has been an update from version one to version two and sizing wise this shoe was true to size for me and it comes in medium wide and extra wide the only shoe on the list offering these wide options so wi footed Runners this is the one you need to be looking at Brooks are fantastic are offering so many different widths and sizes and Support options in their shoes and what I liked about the shoe yes this updated mids is now much much better there's also a lot of foam underneath your feet and it will look after your legs really well on the long run I really like this rocker design again a little bit of update here The Rocker design at the front of the shoe it just helps you cover the ground well through the foot strike it's just really quite a smooth shoe it doesn't look it when you feel it and you hold it and you put it on you don't think it's going to be like that and this when it's just got a lovely turnover through the footstrike it's also just very dependable it's a little bit boring a little bit like uh I don't know this really doesn't excite me that much but it's a shoe that can just go out there on your long run and just get the job done with no fuss very very comfortable option here as well it's also a good shoe I'd recommend for any beginners or any newer Runners out there got some good stability in the shoe as well just as people are building up strength coming back to running on newer Runners as well it's going to look after your feet really nicely on the long run now what I didn't like about the shoe as I said it's just a little bit unfortunately on the heavy side also incredibly padded which some people will love don't get me wrong but around the ankle there is so much padding here yes it's great for Comfort but it's probably a little bit Overkill and you're also going to struggle a little bit to pick up the pace too much this shoe like a lot of the shoes here is just very very happy cruising along in that marathon pace easy Pace recovery Pace second run of the day type option so overall with the ghost Max 2 obviously it's going to be a good option if you like the ghost as a daily option already this is basically that but with a lot more foam underneath just to make it a lot more suitable for long runs and it's also definitely the option to go for as I said if you've got wider feet as well right let's move on to the hoker Skyward X we're now starting to talk about some plates in this shoe which is what you starting to get by going up to this sort of price point now at \u00a3185 that I paid for this shoe and I couldn't get it on special offer anywhere no discount codes so had to pay RRP for the shoe stack cut at the back an absolutely crazy 48 mm it's a really odd sensation when you put the shoe on you just feel like you're 8 ft tall walking around in this thing in terms of drop we're talking about a 5 mm drop here and 378 G for me in my UK size 12 I'm pretty sure this is the heaviest shoe I have ever reviewed huge midsole wise we've got two levels of midsole here one very soft premium Heber midsole the kind of foam that a lot of shoe companies using their very highest end Racing shoes and then want a level of super critical EVA foam here just for that added durability just a lot more hard wearing and then a carbon plate that runs through the shoe kind of an x-shaped carbon plate it's just there really more for stability rather than speed now what I liked about the shoe it's just so much fun to run in it feels super smooth smooth as well despite what is a lot of bulk in this shoe and it feels really good quality great for the long run or even long walks as well just for a good option for anyone that's going to be on their feet all day there's so much foam underneath you to absorb impact and that's really what I found on my longer runs in terms of dislikes with the shoe yes it's just very heavy it's very bulky and it's really only good for going up to that marathon pace in my opinion but overall just perfect for someone that's just not overly worried about the pace they're going at they just want something that's going to be Dependable super comfortable out there when they go out for their very long run it's a good option also for heavier Runners whose shoes might be bottoming out a little bit there's so much foam in this shoe you're not going to be worried about that at all right let's spend a little bit more money to go up to 20000 now we've actually lost the carbon plate in the shoe and this is I know you can't smell this but the shoe absolutely stinks cuz it's been pouring with rain here today and this is still a little bit damp but this is my aex super blast version 2 no car carbon plate in the shoe but you've now got a f length very high-end PE midsole in the shoe and a massive stack kite in here as well 200 for this shoe but it's really for me it's been my favorite shoe of the year it's sold out absolutely everywhere if you see one coming up for sale then definitely go and buy it if you can afford it because obviously it's quite expensive stack wise 45 mm stack at the back of shoe 8 mm drop overall and coming in at a lovely 288 G which is so nice and light and yes you can massively feel the difference between something like that and the Skyward x 100 G difference per shoe 200 g overall yes you really do noce it seems like that midsole wise it's mostly the FF turbo the high-end peber midsole and there's just a little Slither as well of the more Durable aex foam and as I said there's no plate in this shoe sizing wise I went half a size down ax I tend to always go half a size down compared to every other brand that I buy but what I like about this shoe it's just so versatile easily the most versatile shoe here on the list a shoe that can really truly do everything races speed easy long runs whatever you want to do it's just super comfortable this is the shoe that I reach for about 90% of the time when I'm not testing other shoes hence this is now done about 400 miles in this shoe now and I've absolutely loved every one of those it's really lightweight and so you can pick up the pace really easily I've done reps in the shoe 5K Pace 10K Pace run every different type of pace in this show as I say I raced a half marathon in it and it performed super well and I've taken it up to Long Run wise uh 36k getting ready for Berlin and I've raced marathons in version one of the shoe as well and it's been absolutely fine what I didn't like about the shoe yeah unfortunately it's just super hard to get hold of at the moment in those regular sizes yes it's a little bit more expensive but it's so versatile the durability is fantastic this is holding up really well I'm pretty sure I'm going to get about 800 really good training marves out of this shoe before it's going to drop off and the phone will become a little bit dead the super blast does give quite a firm ride so if you looking for something a little bit softer to really look after those legs that marshmallow that cloud that squishy feeling then go for something like the skywood x or our next option which is the New Balance SC Trainer version 3 you can really sort of feel the weight difference it's not too much this is 50 g heavier anyway let's start out with the facts and figures \u00a3230 this shoe set me back so a hell of a lot cheaper in the United States at just $180 there's a lot of price differences around the countries with this shoe it's a little bit of an one stack height 40 mil stack height at the back of the shoe and a 6 mm drop overall as say Weight Wise 225 g so not too bad the mids sole we've got a mix of a pea and Eva blend which is a really good compromise for that softness and that responsiveness and that durability and we've got a carbon plate running through the length of the shoe here again like the skyex it's more there for stability rather than all outspeed and sizing wise this was true to size for me I did actually get half a size down and it was too small small because I couldn't find my size and I wanted to get in to review it so half size down was okay but I really should have gone up true to size in the shoe I also really love this colorway let me know what you think of this guys it goes so nicely with our technical te which you can get on our website and I'll link to it down below and feel free to use code YouTube 10 for 10% off anyway let's talk about the likes really comfortable straight out the box as of course A lot of these shoes are are here I'm talking about some really good high quality trainers here they've got to be comfortable for our long runs and the plate adds a good amount of stability as I say rather than that speed so again it's suited more for those slower Paces marathon pace I think you could go up to half marathon pace in the shoe absolutely fine half marathon pace marathon pace easy Pace recovery run Pace this is just going to absolutely look after your legs really nicely on those long runs just really soft marshmallowy feeling this foam here is just going to massively really help to absorb that impact of those long runs especially anyone that's out they're running like I do living in a big city here in London spending a lot of time on that aspal and that tarmac dislikes the price is absolutely crazy unless you live in the USA or Canada which is just really unfortunate because a lot of these shoes here they are a bit Niche just for those long runs but overall as I say I have really enjoyed running this shoe and I'm going to continue running it even after I've done my testing and it's definitely one to pick up if you live in the USA and Canada and can get it for around about $180 $185 Canadian dollars but for a lot of people they might be better off in the UK going for something like the Skyward X very similar feeling Skyward X is just a bit chunky a bit heavy here this is a bit lighter bit more Nimble but still two very good options so final thoughts I know what you want me to say just tell me which is the best one and it's really hard to do that for me the super blast is probably going to be my best show of the year so get subscribed to that when we drop that video out probably at the start of December when we do our top three worst three and all of those sort of videos that will be coming up soon yeah it's really just that good but if you want to go out there for simply all out comfort and a bit of fun something like the sky X it's a really good solid bet as well or as I said something like the SE trainer if you live in the states or if you're visiting the states or something like that so again a really good option to pick up the ghost Max 2 is going to suit some newer Runners out there some more beginner Runners it's just so dependable very comfortable as well and the pume and the Nova blast at those price points they're really good so don't think you're being short changed or anything and you're not getting a fantastic trainer all the shoes on this list will look after you really well the cheap ones they just might not last quite as long and just don't feel quite as premium as some of the more expensive ones so that's it guys thanks very much for watching if you want to check out my super blast after 350 miles full review that is coming up here and if you are a bit more of a beginner Runner then check out my complete list of beginner running shoes down there that's it guys keep working hard keep wa done I see you very soon in the next one",

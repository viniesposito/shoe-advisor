  "text": "the World Marathon major season always ends on the first Sunday in November it's the most challenging course of the series but the crowd support is unmatched it's my favorite race for chasing the pros and finding my friends so let's hop on a plane and head east this is a runner's weekend at the New York Marathon [Music] yo what's going on just made it into New York it's going to be a crazy busy weekend here for the marathon already I took care of some first things first business checked in the hotel got myself a slice and now I'm going to head over to Under Armour and make some pasta [Music] when you're thinking about marathons you're thinking about carbs and pasta is definitely one of the runner favorite ways of loading up under armor set this media event at ant Jake a place that is part restaurant and part pasta classroom the ingredients were laid out on Long workbenches along with images of the ingredients of some of under armour's best performance running product the space was cozy welcome and intimate 2022 New York Marathon Champion Sharon Loy was there to talk to us about how she was feeling for the race in Just 2 days and it was fantastic to hear from her this way I've always been impressed with her achievements in running and now I'm a Sharon [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] fan sh [Applause] [Music] all right that was really great to be able to hear from Sharon M I've never had a chance to really hear from her like that before so that was fantastic thanks Under Armour for the invite now I'm going to head back to the hotel let's go find Drew get in some [Music] miles how you feeling Drew I'm feeling good nice I'm glad that it's getting the ts are going down for the running stuff yeah it'll be good for [Music] them looks like there's a race happening non sanction [Music] race what are these what are what are those these are a wild ride that's what look great they're perfect for the concrete jungle oh my so that was fun ended up running into the Lost Boys relay race saw a lot of friends down there chatted for a while now we're going to wrap up this run head back to the hotel get change up Qui quick and then head over to the endorphins [Music] party endorphins is a run club that has exploded in popularity with chapters in nine cities and a strong cheer squad Presence at just about every race you've likely seen them somewhere before this year they've set up shop in the Shopify space which is where Bandit had its popup last year and on this evening they were having their New York Marathon weekend kickoff [Music] party from endorphins Drew and I decided to head over to the craft Afterparty there craft was unveiling their latest carbon plated shoe the kite Pro a lot of people there had just raced in the shoe as there had been a take the bridge event earlier that night they had prototypes on display and I was able to get a look at the unique carbon plate there was a food truck outside the spot and so many friends to catch up with [Music] inside and then afterwards Drew and I decided to make one last stop before calling it a night [Music] good morning it is about 8:00 a.m. in the morning on I Saturday here in New York today is a big day let's start it with a ShakeOut with Runa I am walking past the believe in the Run event it's a long line already trying to sneak by undetected I don't know if that'll happen so what's going on guys how are you [Music] hey Runa is a training app and they're pretty big in Europe and the UK but they're now trying to make a big push for the US I'll be using the app to train for the half marathon in Houston and this weekend was the official kickoff of the partnership guys wow we're an official shake out for the marathon 2024 [Music] wo 3 2 1 once we got outside Runa had everyone go through a quick warm-up we got the group photo and then [Music] off a lot of congestion with the end of the dash to the Finish 5K going on on and kind of intersecting with our route here but now that we're in the park spreading out a little bit it's a beautiful morning the r [Music] comfortable the halfway point was at the reservoir and we stopped there to make sure we had everyone we took another group photo and then we headed back to the Run of space [Music] we are back to some of the congestion by the Finish Line almost done almost back are you are you in a red yes oh sorry yeah no no no F there's so much congestion here you know so oh my you can keep going I we're almost done we're just a little bit down [Music] [Music] all right just finished getting some breakfast with Chase and Drew now Drew and I are going to head back further south and go check out the coffee Club podcast is this the way I don't know if this is Del way you have half away Drew did take us the right way and the subway got us to the on popup pretty quick but we still got to the podcast a few minutes late so it was already a packed house when we arrived I've been listening to the coffee Club podcast for a while it was good to be able to see a live taping they had trivia Q&A from the audience and even a little bit of heckling of the OAC rookies it was a fun show all I long to say to you oh downstairs there was a bit of running shoe history from on which is the kind of thing that I always love to nerd out on and then a chance to watch the Shoemaker robot and even try on a demo [Music] pair yeah you make me so nervous yeah say it's true tight and twisted that's what you do my hands sh [Applause] it [Music] CL all right that's it for the on store that was pretty amazing that robot's cool I welcome our robot overlords as long as they make good shoes now we're going to head over to Bandit I think a lot of people forget that Bandit is still a very young apparel brand I have been to every New York Marathon popup they've done and that tradition only goes back to 2022 want to welcome you guys to our uh first popup they've come a long way in that amount of time and this year they're releasing a collab collection with a major running shoe brand and personally I love the R herana theme [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] race day morning started early for me with a wake up time of about 4:30 a.m. I did a big a digging to find out which hotel is the athlete hotel and I wanted to try and get some Paparazzi style footage of the athletes as they boarded their buses to Staten Island but like in Chicago and in Boston the athlete hotel is also a hotel for a lot of marathon participants so it's a pretty busy atmosphere in the morning people I know both personally and professionally kind of all over the place the athletes though seem to be in really good spirits most of them seemed chipper despite the early hour but they were just very [Music] relaxed after the athletes left I had a couple hours to put together a pre-race reel and then I met Drew for [Music] breakfast okay we've got off the train we got a little bit of time before the athletes get in here let's get into position we started the morning in Brooklyn as we always do and this is my favorite spot to watch the race as it's early enough that all the pros are still bunched up together but it's also relatively less crowded so I can do my thing running along with the athletes to film them I put together a separate race video that is more of a contemporaneous account of everything that happened that day so here what I'll do is I'll give you a bit more of the behind the scenes now with the way that the race waves are staggered we always see the women first and then the proen but in between there is the MasterCard secret wave my friend Ashley was in that wave as was feno who is getting his six star while running in a tuxedo of all things and then there was Alexi p who is another perennial runner in this wave after we saw the men Drew and I had to hustle to catch the train last year we got super Lucky by connecting to the express six train that took us up to see the runners at Mile 19 with just a moment to spare this year though we were trying to get to 59th and see the pros right after Queensboro Bridge at Mile 16 we knew the women would be far too fast for us to see them there but we thought we might have a chance for the men but the train took longer than we expected and the men were already gone before we were out of the subway fortunately we had Chase on the team to grab footage for us at a couple of spots along the course he saw the pros coming up first ab and then again in the park near the end of the race meanwhile Jew and I had to run across Manhattan and then navigate through security and the paths of Central Park to get to the bleachers of the East grandstand there we had really good access to see the athletes as they came to the finish and because most people who buy East grandstand tickets do so to see their friends and family finish the race and not to see the pros there was ample space there there's also a private set of porta potties there too which Jew and I took advantage of after seeing the pros come in and before we headed back out on the course to find our [Music] friends now there's a special magic to the New York Marathon the first is that even though this race is gigantic and this year's race would end up being the largest Marathon ever you can usually find your friends just a couple of weeks ago I had loaded up a bunch of friends into my tracker for the Chicago marathon and I somehow ended up missing almost all of them in New York though you'll end up finding everyone you were looking for and you'll also run into people you didn't even know were racing like my friend Nicholas who is one of the founders of Chicago run crew 3 Run 2 and even though you don't plan it you'll also find Friends Along the course that are always cheering like Hela who I first met a few years ago while we were each cheering for friends along the course of the New York Marathon at Mile 8 in Brooklin Pro tip though cheering for the New York Marathon is an endurance event unto itself make sure you eat Drew and I usually stop by this Shake Shack that is on the course and as we're eating if we see that one of our friends is about to come through on the tracker one of us stays in the restaurant with the food while the other goes out to cheer and we take turns this year I was able to find Chloe who is a runner who lives in the next town over from me out in the suburbs of Chicago we never actually met in person but we each notice that we sometimes have some familiar looking backgrounds in our running videos and that's how we started connecting this was Chloe's first marathon and she did such a good job while also raising a bunch of money for charity the last bit of magic that New York offers is the final finishers even though Aid stations may have to shut down and the slowest Racers may have to move to the sidewalks as roads Rea in to car traffic the Finish Line itself waits for every Runner to complete the mission more than 10 hours after the last wave starts in Staten Island there are still Runners crossing the line in Central Park and the New York Marathon keeps the cameras rolling the lights are still on and crowds line up to give these final finishers a proper welcome Ted metalis the race director who is there to welcome the first finisher of the race he also welcomes the last finisher as they crossed the line too this year that last finisher was Super Mario a 74-year-old Italian man who finished his 35th New York Marathon Ted gave me a hug as I finished my marathon in Berlin and completed my six stars a couple months ago so I can tell you when I see Ted hug someone else at the end of the race that Ted gives out the best hugs and let me tell you another New York Marathon Secret inside the pouch that Ted wears is a packet of wet whips and as Super Mario was getting photograph and about to be interviewed for TV Ted made sure to First wipe the sweaty crust from Mario's mouth so he would look his best in his television interviews at a time where maybe your faith in the goodness of people may be a bit rattled know that the people you see here are good people know that empathy still does exist thank you New York for this reminder we need it now more than [Music] ever you you [Music]",

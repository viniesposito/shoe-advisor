  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run and this is Robbie with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and you're listening to the drop our weekly podcast about all things including running mhm mostly the all things part yeah exciting week some of the running yeah we've got I I know what it is but these new mics I'm always like it's never quite right yeah it's literally the best it's like exact you could put it exactly how you want it no like I wanted to I want to push it that way a little bit press the uh the filter the on your mic Meg what the foam the foam thing press that the whole way down yeah it's not the whole way down there you go now that everyone has heard weird noises yeah we're good to go yeah um despite everyone saying they were Revolt if Ralphie wasn't on this episode he couldn't come into the office today but he's doing fine we didn't we didn't want to risk him with Chad coming in to do his big guy shoe pcks we thought he would go nuts and oh be out of sorts and then now he'd be like on Megan's shoulder like a parrot yeah trying to hang out so yeah we just decided yeah so now he's just home alone he's setting booby traps up he is probably I was like big we should leave him a nice chew toy for him to hang out when she's like he won't use it he'll be in anxiety the whole time we're going gone yeah he just sleeps or has anxiety the whole time we're gone but that's does that even mean if a dog has anxiety dude they used to make us give him pills for it and then I was like this is too much now mag takes the pills yeah yeah Thomas got into them before his last marathon trying to I had such high hopes for Ralphie being a running dog yeah and then you broke him you tried I did wait why didn't that work out he would run with me he'd like doing like a mile Thomas took from one mile to eight miles no no no no I I bumped it up to four then I bumped it up to six uhhuh and then when I did eight he was like no never again we got to we got to about four miles out and he sat down and just was like not for me sounds like my kids just we bought one of those um like dog running leashes that you tie around your waist and one day I tried to go out for a run with him in the afternoon and he like saw a squirrel or something and it just the whole thing just broke in half oh so yeah but he was done running before that like I I would even go get that leash because we got a replacement one and I would go get it and he would just sit down be like nope man anyway so he just become a lazy bum then that's emmo always he gets skinny when we take him to Doggy camp and then he comes back and loads back up nice it sounds like me going to tr and then it's the opposite the opposite effect do you think we should tell everyone what we're doing with the Monday podcast for the remainder of December SL beginning of January yeah cuz honestly I don't even know so go for it so everyone who listened to the last Mondays heard Taylor Bodin chat who is going to officially become part of the team in 2025 uh and for people who maybe don't know all of our backstories we will be interviewing each other oh I didn't I actually know we were doing that and Publishing that on Mondays yeah but but that's for do you think we were doing with you is that on the schedule for today it sure is oh what time it was on for 1:30 but we can adjust it Oh I thought that was just the drop in general like I thought that was this episode well could be okay could be all right cool well man and now I have to get my head straight I'm G to ask some really tough ones get ready have to see what kind of tall tals I can come up with I feel like it'll be okay all right it should be fine and then uh I mean we've also got we could give updates on our weightlifting now oh cuz I know people are dying is Carl putting up the first shots right now photos whole body they do not go up until until something looks better yeah seriously did you take the photo Robbie uh I actually did oh wow um but it's horrible isn't it yeah it's a site for Sor eyes for sure I would wait I think it's the opposite a sight for Sor eyes a sight for Sor eyes means that like oh site for Sor eyes is a good thing yeah like oh you're a site for Sor eyes yeah what's it sight for un a sight for health eyes it it like that like mine would be blinding I wish I was blind so you have cataracts yeah that's what yeah site for cataracts site for cataracts um well yeah instead of update it's probably more of a Down dat I feel like the first week the first session I was absolutely destroyed I did you never do for the record I don't do anything I was going to say I'm the laziest person out there outside of running activated parts of your legs that you don't activate normally yeah I don't think I think they were in hibernation you had me all worried like I went and I was like totally freaked out that I was going to get crushed no I thought I figured you would be mildly okay yeah I am yeah I there's no uh from I've R been running somewhat healthy so I figured I'll just let it ride and see what happens and I well I figured out what happens when you weight lift and I was couldn't run for like 3 days but think about the potential now once you get great at weightlifting you'll be so strong and then running will just be so easy I don't think it will be I think it right now I'm just maintaining it's like I need this to maintain like it's not like I'm going to weightlift and all of a sudden become a great Runner I think it's just to keep me I see what you're saying keep me running yeah I but then we went at the same time the other day and can't really th it reminds me of when you first started running every time you go for a run there's a new injury do you know what I mean maybe not okay I don't know I was tell Meg like I feel like what they're doing to us now is like we're trying to learn how to run and they're like do a lap and we do a lap and they're like all right good job yeah yeah yeah yeah they're like here's like I don't think they put in negative weights I think they had to cut parts of the bar off to make it lighter for me I think there's like removable Lego pieces from the bar and they're just like taking it off here you go here's 20 lb just give that guy just just the bar they're doing the like less than the bar but they're doing the 5B increments on you right yeah I mean it was a broomstick with uh marshmallows on the end but I tried not to look over I just I was like I'm just GNA let Robbie do this thing I'm not g to look over yeah but I don't know so we'll see the now the I have like a hip flexor thing going on so the squats I couldn't do the whole way cuz they would pinch it or whatever did they not like for me they're putting like a little bench with a little spacer for me to because I can't go really deep in my squats yet oh okay so I go down and I touch it with my butt and then come back up yeah do are you not doing I didn't have that no um like what are you doing like is yours just freeballing it yeah I feel like that's not the term free butt in it yeah but yeah people do I can't even imagine the the absolute agony that people who weight lift are going through right now listening to this yeah by the way I Googled in my prayers I Googled what's the opposite of a sight for sore eyes and there's a lot of really good ones but I think my favorite is mon monstrosity oh a monstrosity yeah yeah does that feel right I mean that's just a word that's not a saying yeah oh no yeah they're all just words oh so it's just saying that's a synonym for it it's an an antonym oh an antonym iore horror good blemish hidey deformity yeah that's all act descri sight that's the one that's the my weightlifting journey in a in a nutshell yeah but yeah so there is no official Opposite of sight for sore eyes I think that's just a saying all right cool I mean the the only thing I hate about the squat is that I have to get my shoulders back real far and like where they want you to place the bar and it kills my shoulders like it's not not the weight of the bar it's the flexibility I don't have in my shoulders so I open up my chest and the bar is holding it back like that he's like especially especially the shoulder that you blew out yeah and didn't ever actually get physical therapy for that's the one he's like it'll loosen up you're like no trust me there's no loosening the cartilage is I go back tonight okay yeah have fun I will are you on once a week twice a week how are we doing uh twice okay but I think think I'm cutting back my running mileage as far as like I'm not doing marathon training I've resigned myself to I'm not doing the spring training for a marathon but fall maybe maybe so are you just going to run a marathon without training yeah I thought about CU I do I wouldn't hate doing like a 50k but I'm yeah I love that race but the worst thing about it is that you still have to train for it isn't that why it always sells out and then you can still get in like a few weeks before cuz people are like for that yeah it's like I want to do the Race part without the training part I want all the glory and the beer after that race isn't that fun that's the thing it's not like a great it's not like I'm doing it for a time or for I just want to do the race but to do 32 miles or whatever 31 miles you still have to do long runs unless you want it to really really suck after the third time I did I said I'll never do it again and then I ran it five more times cuz friends would sign up and you'd be like okay we'll do it cuz we used to have like a a party and and people down for it and so I was like well I might as well I don't want to be the only one who didn't run yeah and every time right around that second Loop where you're going back in and you can you know when you can hear the finish line but you know it's like six miles away mhm they kind of come close I'm always like why did I do this this is the worst is so bad but like you don't have to like when you're trying to race a marathon I feel like you have to incorporate a lot of speed work like for that you just log a bunch of Miles no you need health that's the problem though I I don't want to log a bunch of Miles okay yeah I don't mind the speed work I like the speed work that's fine uh I don't like the it's just I just don't have enough time I'll be honest like the to do the long runs every weekend and then 48 mile runs during the week it's just like with family stuff and everything else and if if I'm doing weightlifting I feel like the weightlifting will be more advantageous to My overall physical fitness than doing two more Six Mile runs or but that's the thing like I run in the morning so the weightlifting doesn't interfere like that time isn't like extra time to me CU I don't run in the afternoon yeah so it's like I'm just adding no even if I run in the morning it's still like I it's just it's just it just I end up hating running I'll be honest okay so let's not do that yeah um but anyways so maybe in the fall okay I just don't feel like doing it right now be h what about grit you're going to have to get lots of miles in January anyway yeah I I mean I just I just fake it he's going for B baby seal okay what is that 25 no one's checking those grit stats I know that personally don't say that um yeah 25 we'll do 20 I mean I could do I'll do a 100 do 100 yeah maybe a little maybe more than that I don't know Rio you're you're finicky you always changed you could get into and be like you know I'm really enjoying running right now yeah it's just just depends uh but I felt like even in the fall I was juggling I was really like trying to put pieces in like the running pieces in and it was a little bit stressful are you still working with your running coach yeah okay so he's been cool cuz he's been like knows that I'm crazy like mentally like you said I'm always just uh trying to figure stuff out and so but he's working with me to build a plan cuz in my mind when I when I think about running coaches I always think oh you got to be pushing for this goal you know what I mean otherwise what the what the hell is the point of having a coach yeah but it's also i' never considered it's just meeting you where you're at and making therapist running in a and making running what you want it to be you know what I mean well I mean while incorporating some stuff to help you get better we're you know we we still work with the coach right now and it's not we're in between like training for London wouldn't start until January yeah so I was kind of like well why you know what do I need a coach for it in between but the he's actually been working on our fitness and making sure our leg turnover is good and I actually have really enjoyed this part of training because I've got a training plan it's not like totally aggressive like I'm averaging like 40 something miles a week and it's just like the long run is like 12 miles but then I'll have like a 10 mile run the next day or something like that um but it's not like those long grinding yeah yeah runs and so it's just like it's fun and to watch kind of like the fitness grow during this time where it's there's no pressure MH to kind of for me it takes some of the like stress out of running yeah part of it though is that I do need a goal also to call me accountable so it's kind of like I don't know how to juggle those two maybe half marathon goal will be nice well you could do that but like my goal right now is just like I want to be able to go out and run with people and not be totally out of my depth yeah I also kind of Miss here's the other thing that I told him I kind of miss running with people because when you have work prescribed workouts and stuff you you're just like well I have to do that workout I can't run with a group cuz I have these Paces thrown in and that kind of drives me crazy see I thought I was going to do that with the faster basses and doing the Wednesday night run I was like I've always you know I can do that the health I went a couple times I'm like I don't want to do this I don't like running at night and man everybody there is like throwing down yeah hardcore on those Hills Robbie there's 151 spots available and have 50k just saying okay nice if you wanted to do it let's see what's the least amount of training I can do to get by it's March 22nd I'll ask my coach that what's the least amount of things I can do to run up 50k I bet you could do 10 and 12 Mile runs long runs back to back that would probably do it yeah I still don't want to do that okay okay so maybe this is out we should do let's see how bad it can hurt by doing just Max 10 mile long runs on the weekend yeah that would be horrible I don't know this guy Daniel wrote in though with a good idea for grit and I think we could implement it now for winter grit I did see that yeah I if we do like a week Challenge and it could be something like uh you know take a photo of this or or you know just different things that we could do like a weekly challenge and then have a prize for each week yeah that'd be cool like finding random things like you do on the ground or make us like hit someone in the face with a snowball that's feels less nice all right build an but if but if you video that yes the least run with the least amount of clothing in January oh tank tops and shorts and 30\u00b0 yeah like it would be least amount of clothes coldest weather make get some nssw stuff what I was thinking there's some freaks out there too many PE too many dudes without shirts are going to be running around and loving it it'll look like a choy choy Winterfest we have to change the name Joy to the World yeah nice yeah absolutely oh man just trying to think of other things uh anyways but yeah that that's a that's a good idea I like that yeah we'll um we'll brainstorm on it and if we can get four really good ideas together we'll implement it this year in January for grit speaking of winter we we got some new tracksmith believe in the Run bright and Basse layers yeah believe in the Run brandit bright and bass layers for sale that's definitely my favorite winter long sleeve I don't know how many we have left we oh really yeah no way they they we just did one story and a lot went so I think half of are gone already wow yeah so if if people want them we'll put up a thing in here but if people want them they get better act fast cuz it was limited sizing that we are able to do anyway that is the best piece of winter running gear you can buy pretty much and I have to say the print looks amazing it looks nice although tell everyone what you're getting to wear this winter Robbie that's from tracksmith uh oh they have this what is it a jumper onesie a onesie onesie bib a bib so it's the is it the turnover tights but a bib version yes I believe so and I'm 100% going to wear those I don't know how it looks like to you know how you got to take everything off as a whole ordeal it's like when you wear a jumpsuit as a lady sorry it's the N obviously the ndo bib yeah and it looks like um sort of a cross between your running tight and a cycling bib or like or like your ski gear yeah like your like isn't that isn't a B what you wear when you're skiing uh yeah pretty much yeah as somebody who doesn't ski I agree with you 100% I feel like I used to wear those you know I've never gone skiing ever what do you know that I was actually on have you been snowboarding like the one sport I've never tried I've gone snowboarding like eight nine times yeah so I have done okay that feels a little better I grew up skiing yeah so I that was my it was one of my major sports did you see Lindsay Vons coming back it well she is out of retire uh she's skier yeah oh yeah she was like really good she Olympian yeah very good like the best she's pretty good I get her mixed up with peekaboo Street remember her yeah what peekaboo I don't know who that is peekaboo street from back she's like a 90s yeah she wasn't as good as Lindsay Von though all right first check in this one's going to be a weird episode for you so buckle up uh I I should say that every week but this one feels particularly weird so hang in there we'll probably get around to something you enjoy listening to at some point we'll see you in a minute all right guys let's talk about our sponsor Lagoon pillows all right let's do it we've been using them for years now still my favorite pillow ever and now's a great time to gift a pillow do you ever remember sleep without a legon pillow under your head I mean when we travel and it's not great yeah I I felt like the last hotel we were at it was almost like someone rolled up some socks and put it in the pillow to give it the stuffing socks and rocks yeah yeah well if you want a really great pillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com there is a quiz right on that page just hit the button fill out your information say what you like what you don't like and it'll populate the perfect pillow for you and if you use the code believe at checkout you can also save do the Winter Olympics get you guys as excited as the Summer Olympics no yeah it's really hard dude when I go through the channels and you're like looking and there's figure skating or even that sport with the curling curling MH I mean the only thing that I'll stop and watch I really kind of like the the loue L is cool and like is it because of that movie cuz only for the yeah the Jamaicans are you are you hoping for the Rex like watch I like the Rex but I just the amount of speed and it just looks so cool like you know they go they're like flying it's like a bullet wait they wreck on those oh yeah yeah I wouldn't want to but they do jeez I like that decapitations i' watch downhill downhill skiing I enjoy you know what the uh downhill skiing is pretty awesome what about like the I mean the snowboarding is pretty cool now they have it yeah I mean after a while though I'm like oh cool you did a loop you you did a they did trick cool I think the best one to do would be the the biathlon where they have to shoot stuff and then ski yeah but you would just like to shoot stuff yeah minus the scheme yeah yeah just I'll just walk there um they but the the calming your heart rate to you know from going all out effort to then like settling your heart to get a perfect shot that's an incredible skill it is pretty sick and it's also I like I like the sports that are based on like that was a survival thing it like it was I think we talked about this how track and field the field portion is just War tactics yeah that's it and I love that kind of stuff I'm surprised they don't have drone flying in track and fuel by now oh jeez just that's that's the newest version of track and field speaking of shooting though we had a guy from Maryland from talson oh yeah with the Gilman of all places so for those of you listening who don't know Gilman where this kid Luigi was from this is like one of the most prestigious high schools schools in it's it's K through high oh it is yeah one of the most prestigious schools in Maryland yeah like it it used to be like a joke like those guys all there like a fraternity once they left there that like they'd all go work at like the financial places and stuff like that but I mean that school's been hit a couple times cuz they had a little thing with um little little problem with a teacher a couple years ago yeah and now now this I this isn't yeah their PR needs to step it up we went to the we had a cross country race there for the kids a couple months ago it's a beautiful campus yeah it's ridiculous look like nicer way nicer than my college campus yeah right but it it was crazy cuz I was Googling remember at work that day I was Googling Gilman tuition like hours before this guy was caught and before we even knew that he went to Gilman or anything cuz we were just talking about private schools yeah yeah why would we talk about Gilman we know something cuz I ran into that person that you knew his kid goes there and uh I was like oh man I hope they're not connecting the dots on me here 35 Affiliated $35,000 a year for uh for elementary for elementary 38 for upper upper yeah is that what they call it what what are the Richer what are the rich people call it Upper School upper class upper School Upper School yeah Callison oh college preparatory yeah Preparatory Academy it's a beautiful Campus A lot of people use that track because it's a great track in you're able if you get there before I think I think it's before 8 a.m. you can run on the track it's a it's fantastic condition and uh a lot of people would like I used when I lived out in the county I used to it was exactly like I think one or two miles from my house okay I would run over there for my warmup do my track workout and run home so it's it's just a fantastic campus and everything but to it's kind of like it's so weird when a big thing happens and you're like I feel like that Meme of um Leonardo Caprio where he's pointing at the TV there that's us yeah it's like yeah of course it that's a thing in Baltimore that's what we're known for that crabs and The Wire yeah we're really doing there has it has to be murder involved in some way yeah um but yeah that's that was a that was a wild thing to happen uh speaking of wild things Robbie do you want to tell everyone why we're recording on Wednesday instead of Tuesday oh yeah because I woke up well I didn't wake up I I eventually you did oh yeah I did do that too took my kids to school came back my wife was going to take the car to work someone broke into the car last night or whatever sorry not broke into the car she forgot to lock the doors which wait it couple of weeks ago yeah which also happened two weeks ago or a month ago it happens quite often I'll say that how's the relations at home right now what oh it's fine here's the thing I do it too so I'm like I can't really call out judgment but you know if you're getting the kids out of the car and a lot happen grocery whatever I get it and but we don't have any we don't keep anything in our car so there's nothing to steal so that's why if somebody gets in our car it's not a big deal that we didn't unlock except for your manual dude you didn't replace the manual right yeah still haven't gotten that back still looking through the neighborhood for that one um and then so anyways somebody popped a steering column and tried to guess steal a car but it's not a hondai or kia so you can't just like stick a screwdriver in and start it um but nevertheless I thought all was good because I I mean the battery was dead so then I charged it but then the um and it ran and everything but the locks if you try to lock the doors or whatever it just they keep unlocking Non-Stop and the key fop doesn't work cuz I think there's a you know a safety feature on the ignition that disables everything if it's tampered with and so now I got to go to the freaking dealer and tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. and get that try to get that figured out which I'm sure it's going to cost like four4 or $500 probably well you just for someone to look at stuff sometimes you know the clock starts going yeah oh yeah I mean just putting the wheels in the parking lot is going to be 100 bucks ah so that's it so that was annoying and then someone was trying to scam me through text yesterday and then Seafood dins no but they were like you do you remember you exchanged pictures with me and he's like I probably did I was like trying to recall who that was and exchanged phot did you engage in in conversation oh yeah I kept it going for like dude as soon as I see that I don't know the number no I flipped the script on them oh cuz let him know that it's a working phone number they sent me like a stock photo of some random uh did you send one back no man but they I I was messing with them they're like you need to tell me the truth or whatever and I said I'll tell you the truth if you go get me an Apple gift card for $100 and then give me the code did they do it no but I kept like just using that line of uh and then I just cut it off you seen the AI grandma that they built in the UK to handle like phone scams I think I heard about this like keeps him on the line she's like now you want me to do what it's like he's like you they had recordings of like the scammers on the other end just yelling at the old lady you know the sad thing about this is that about that is that a lot of the scammers are in basically slave or slaves in like Myanmar and Cambodia and stuff so they're in these compound where they got tricked into basically work they thought they were going to work as a like a real job and they essentially get kidnapped and they have to buy back their freedom by raising so much money through these scams so if they don't do so much in a day or whatever see but why would I let a good earner go and that's well that's the thing is they don't really they keep telling them that okay but then they drag it out did you see aliens Romulus um is that a SC is that about a phone scammer no but they you are on this off Planet working on the mines there and when the girl is like I think I'm almost filled my credits like they're like no you got to keep going yeah so it's pretty much the same thing so I always feel bad kind of leading them on because I know it's most likely just somebody who's trying to work their way out some weird death you're too you're thinking about this too much here's what happens when someone texts you that you just go report junk and then you move on I know I know like I don't I like to pull the thread see what happens yeah but like you're making up a whole story about this young C Cambodian fella trapped with a G you don't know um but yeah it's anyways that's a whole different thing yeah so that was the oh and then I had a sorry last thing there was a contractor doing work on my house and you know they subcontract out to other their workers and he was installing this door on basement in the back of the patio and I had to correct him like four times on the work and make him redo it because it was bad work and I was just so mad because how did you know it's bad work also where did you find this dude well the guy the contracting company is good so they it turns out that it was like somebody who they were training and it was like his first his first day by himself how how did you know he was doing it wrong though oh because it's a simple it's a pretty easy job just to stalling door like so I mean it wasn't flush with the the wall like all this stuff and I'm just like dude I I I could do this by myself if I had the time um and so I just had to make him correct it over and over again but wait if you had the time if you weren't talking to Cambodian telemarketers well I don't do that for my whole Saturday that's only from 8:00 to 10: a.m. on Saturdays yeah um so anyways that was my day yesterday wow and by the end of the day I was like I'm not even going to go on a run I feel you man I feel you man yeah oh here's the you know what but this was the counterbalance for it I found someone's I found a pair of glasses on the ground in a case near actually near your oh you're going to like the story actually okay I can't wait it was a pair of prescription sunlasses okay and are they mine no but I posted it to the neighborhood group and the guy who glasses they were was the dude the NPC guy for that lives by you oh wow like the it was his brother okay but they they lived together and so I when I delivered it to the house I was like actually met him so he's a real person right but did you ask him what he does or how what I I think they're retired now but I my guess my story and my head is I don't think they're Brothers I think they're ex cops oh really well the guy with the long white hair he's he was a former Runner because we started talking about running okay cuz I just figured he was a cop I don't H I don't think I don't know what it is about those two but they just look like cops to me is it because they go out and check the cars every morning maybe that's it they and his brother though I see him like I wave to him when I'm running cuz I'll they they they walk quite a bit Yeah I think they walk pretty far yeah I see him everywhere that's why I think they're NPC that's the weird thing you see him you all over Baltimore you're like there he is but he gave me 20 bucks get out and you took it I it was one of those things where D on like a fixed income I was like no no no no and he just like for skid in your hand like with and you can't deny it it would have made it more weird if I'm just like all right it's fine it would have been a good uh I think you should real or think you should leave like just keep pushing him back just like shoving the door closed you take it yeah that was nice I think they're nice guys no they were super nice that was it was great did you see them both at the same time I did actually okay what were they doing um just standing in the doorway talking to me oh but they both came yeah that's awesome yeah I think they're yeah I think it's a package deal okay you get one you get the other yeah okay yeah well did you spend the $20 on oh it's uh still in my pocket but probably some scratch off was say he's going straight to the lottery those are going straight to fixing his car yeah that's actually exactly where it's going oh you won $140 some dollars on a fantasy the other day that's right so there you go it all is going towards F you realize all that luck the lord giveth and the lord taketh away yeah well I do I consider the Baltimore it's kind of like my Baltimore [ __ ] fund like I because it's cheaper to live in Baltimore I just assume I'm going to pay a tax on some there's a reason it's cheaper is because your car is going to get broken into your packages are going to get stolen you're going to deal with other okay let's talk about something though nobody will care about it's the water bill in Baltimore yeah I don't even look at it because I don't even know I don't think people I don't I think I want to know the percentage of people who actually pay that oh it's not high because I was talking like so basically for those of you listening to live in Baltimore you pay about 100 bucks a month for water yeah if if that's whatever the month whatever they feel like you owe that month nobody knows how it actually works but I was I was talking to uh Helen and she was renting a place or her sister was renting a place and the landlord hadn't paid the water bill for like 5 years so he owed like a few thousand and and he's like whatever no it's true there's actually uh I think there's a law or something where they can't cut off your water unless it's unbelievably egregious so you could you can get away with it for years in Baltimore without paying in so what happens when you go to sell the house there's like a like that has to be reconciled yeah I'm not sure if they can put a lean against it or if it just goes to collections obviously it's not going to I mean it's going to hurt your credit if it goes to collections but but they really just can't they just ref won't cut your water off there's like a law or something where they can't do it so I think you'll be all right just don't pay I mean don't we get I feel like we get bills here for people's stuff all the time that are just who even knows yeah so when we purchase the headquarters we were still getting bills and checks for people that hadn't been here for years yeah that was pretty crazy for the city yeah yeah but like they were getting checks too like cashes no I I'm not going to jail for 20 I mean $20 is $20 but also you wouldn't go to jail for $20 that's the thing oh that's yeah you're right yes but once you start doing stuff with the deposits and stuff don't you get in trouble I would guess feels like a slippery slope yeah cuz then before you know you're dealing cocaine that's that's the next step well that's a that seems to be getting real popular again like and I still don't know like where did people get it I've seen that too it seems to be what do you mean what do you mean you've seen it and it's gotten more popular like it people are outward I think what's happened is now that weed is legal people are like yeah I like doing coke too and talking about it it's just like a step above or something yeah I think also people were reverting to the 90s or 80s or whatever so people were smoking sigs people were doing coke did we reach ma max level it around the 9s and since then everything's going backwards since then everything in what way cuz I was like watching they someone posted on Instagram these young kids coming out of a Tower Records in New York oh yeah I've seen real like a thousand times and I was like oh I love it it just feels good to me it Feels Right like that's a memory and a core and I'm like yeah I get it it's Nostalgia for me I live through that time period yeah you know I get it but I do also look at it and be like having kids now they don't have to leave the house for anything oh yeah it's terrible and like back then you might go to the record store and you like if you were in the teenage years you might start chatting with some a group of girls if you're you know whatever that's the whole thing that's why it's awesome yeah and there's nothing for the kids these days so they're online chatting with each other and you can't have like a that's why conversation that's why that's why like the rates of like like the sex rates have been declining like crazy since the 90s is because hey guys don't know how to talk to girls anymore girls have this insane expectation of like what a a like from just online stuff like what a GU should be so there's this huge gap between the two plus then I think I believe guys are going more conservative while women are going more liberal so that whole Gap is widening too so it's like this really bad recipe for future the future of civilization at least in America well it does feel like we're in a loop now where I'm like uh I like all the music even the stuff Spotify recommends to me is all starting to sound the same oh yeah it's get me start on that like today I put on like I feel this is such an old guy comment to make but I was like I got to put on some classic rock or something and hear instruments and things playing I feel that Megan Megan as as the youngest person here what like do you think that we peaked peaked as a society oh I don't know need your opinion I don't know I don't I do feel like there's a lot of areas that it's not going in the right direction but I I also like there's so much more Tech there's so much more advancements in areas what areas I want to get into I want to get into using AI in real life like see how I don't know how you're talking about AR no no AI like how it can help me like my friend was telling me that he when he if he's going to the grocery store which I know you can get like order online or whatever but if he has just the ingredient lids for dinner and he puts in like hair teer Baltimore this it shows them like exactly what row everything is in and lines it up so you can just like go and not like have to find anything it's just see and I don't like that like we order our groceries so we're rarely in there but when I go I want to peruse I want to see what I like the perusing yeah that me too I actually hate that idea that he told me about I like the perusing how are you going to know if you want spicy pickles if you don't see spicy pickles yeah but it's not fun to peruse the grocery store when it's packed with people but we can go at times we don't have to be at the pack Times by I I picked a b 3m. is the worst baget last night was insane oh what was last night Tuesday at what 600 p.m. yeah yeah at Harris teer yeah yeah yeah I went around that same time last week and I like when the line's crazy long and then you just take your time let the line die down well you know Co hanging out for an hour in Harris Teeter when I was there losing my mind I I I was buying baguettes yeah and so I just had two baguettes and the self checkout line was all the way back to the bread yeah huge but the guy who's like the little cash R guy that's there he's like you oh and I was like what did I do you were a chosen one two items come here you were the chosen one and he pulled me out of line rang me up let me go I was like whoa I just saved like 15 20 minutes dude that's cool all right second check in I warned you I told you it was going to get weird and here we are I hope you're enjoying it I hope your run is going well if you're not running I hope you're thinking about running and that's going well so uh let us know when you get out there and remember build that mileage up slowly as you get ready for grit don't be like jumping into high mileage right

have this chocolate in yeah do there you go so go get them and enjoy see you can't get that kind of hide from uh from AI absolutely not and you know what I found uh I was going to the Oreo flavors cuz you know they have all kinds of new ones in the grocery store yeah yeah how are you going to see new stuff yeah you you and it's you see with your eyes and instead of online you know so more just a better experience and I got uh tiramisu flavored Oreo thins how they okay Megan loves terisu yeah so they exist so that's like a coffee creamy yeah it's nice but here's the thing I think they're cheaping out on the thins which is insane but I noticed how could you get any the wafer is even more thin than the standard thin and the other thing is that it's a normal size cookie pack and they're labeling it family size now oh well actually I don't think that's a bad idea I mean you're right it is a family size for a normal normal family but but before a family size is like the big one and I noticed they're doing that on seral boxes too like everything is getting labeled family size that's just slightly more I like it and how's that make you feel though if you don't have a family uh yeah it could be could be introduce some trauma into your like tra or I really want to get those Oreos it looks like a regular size but I ain't got no family yeah but I will tell you this speaking of AI the grit polar bear that's on the back of the sweatshirt mhm I did that with AI oh okay it's not a real polar bear that polar bear does not exist no polar bears were hurt in the taking of that photo I just said I want a raging polar bear so it's not made of polar bear fur it's made of pixels oh it feels like that was probably just made from a photo that's not how AI works okay gave me several options yeah it's probably a composite of all these different polar bears it looks like a polar bear so that's good yeah well I had other options it gave me like three options and then I upscaled one of them and I was like this is the one I like the Roar and it and it worked out I like the roar that's good yeah um looks Fierce you hear that my stomach's growling you think it came through on the microphone I you hungry no he just was talking about talking about Oreo thins yeah that's probably what did it oh the T his Telly was like family size me um oh can you believe that this is some people's podcast I did yeah this is how many people's number one podcast is this like over a thousand it's ridiculous people there's a there's a thousand of you psychos out there no no no the the Thousand was our top fans yeah that's what I mean that's how many top fans that's what that meant okay like we showed up as the number one podcast on their list of podcasts of top five thousands of people wow there was like 5,000 we showed up in their top five wow yeah which also insane that is I love you people thank you um so uh wait sorry Spotify yeah the crazy people listening to us the um notes from Robbie I wanted to say we were talking about Christmas movies last week oh we've been we've been doing it oh je I I have updates but please go ahead no no that's fine I was just I went to introduce I want to ask you if you've ever seen the movie Just Friends yes have you yeah dude that that's like that great wait have I seen this yeah honestly that's my favorite Christmas which one was that I had forgotten about that one it's with Ryan Reynolds but he's he wears like a fat suit oh yeah that one's good cuz a it has like when you look at it you're like holy [ __ ] they're still staying this stuff in 2004 yeah it's very not PC yeah and then B it's Ryan Reynolds like Peak Ryan Reynolds at his best and Anna Ferris is hilarious in it and the soundtrack's amazing Anna Ferris is funny in that one it's just like the perfect movie we got to watch that one that one is good um yeah I we I watched die hard again definitely Christmas movie no doubt about it uh like I don't even know why there's a debate um okay we watched we watched some really good ones yeah give it okay some of these I'm embarrassed to say out loud that we that we watched okay um wait you want me to go from best to worst we've watched enough movies that we could have installed that door for you okay one of the one of my one of my favorite ones is Family Stone is this a home like a lifetime no that has people in it oh no I remember this okay yeah that's a good one um and then the family man which I we watched it we watched that this past weekend too pretty good yeah I a little sad yeah a little sad but overall pretty good okay now here's where they get really good oh no actually before Christmases we did we finish Wasing that one uh yeah okay um that one was pretty good okay and then this is where the lifetime and really bad ones come in Holiday in the wild sounds which one was where she goes and lives with the elephants oh yeah that one was uh okay pretty bad it's the brunette from Sex in the City oh yeah Charlotte yeah yeah and she how do I know that her husband as soon as the kids are leaving and what's his name uh who's the famous actor who's in it oh Rob low yeah Rob I'm looking it up right and his son is in it too and his son plays her son which is weird um but the uh the premise which was funny about it was that her husband decides as soon as the kids are out he's like I'm done let's get a divorce the opening scene is her saying goodbye to her her College Bound uh son and then she's like I planned this second honeymoon for us and he's like I'm out yeah before before we get on the plane let me just let you know we're not doing anything together anyway she ends up going to live with elephants it's all wonderful okay a really bad one our little secret Lindsay Lohan oh I okay I didn't fresh on Netflix oh that's a new one that's right yeah yeah um five out of 10 Stars I I I actually think that one's almost so bad that it's good okay but then oh this one's the worst hot Frosty an oxymoron if there ever was one hot Frosty it's about Jack Frost is oh my gosh to life and he's a ripped dude that for anyone who's seen shitz Creek it's the vet from shitz Creek who's hot Frosty that has 81% on Rotten Tomatoes head that's way better than the other ones you okay there's one that there's one that we didn't finish and it's actually quite devastating yeah it's horrible but it's the one it's Christmas and Spotlight the one that's based off of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce okay yeah it was so bad I couldn't watch it we turned it off after 15 minutes no we it was a little long maybe hour so somebody mentioned that the whole reason that's uh a movie is because Hallmark is is it a Hallmark movie yeah it's based out of Kansas City too so that's like part of the whole deal I don't know if it's part of the plot but that's like it kind of ties into the whole B is it that bad hot Frosty is really really bad I don't hate that title remind me it remind me of Ino man you should just watch the beginning to look at this dude shredded app as inspiration so I go to Megan I go this dude like she missed the part where the Snowman melted and turned to human flesh so I had to go back and rewatch so I was like Megan he's pretty jacked and she's like he looks muscular I'm like no Megan this dude is like 0% fat and so we rewatch and she goes what was your comment he's super jacked like the most fit human I've ever seen this makes zero sense because Frosty has literal sticks for arms not this one if you now this one this one looked like it was it was like if someone sculpted David yeah and she puts a magic scarf around him okay magic sarf turns him yeah he's he's constantly he's like overheating cuz you know he's Frosty so shirt off so he actually does have to remain cold he has to remain cold until the end when he turns to a real boy oh spoil alert sorry people that's amazing yeah he turns into a real human at the end cuz he falls in love so is Frosty cold blooded or he's just cold cold blooded I don't think he's blooded oh he doesn't have blood so this this guy his temperature his body temperature was like 32\u00b0 oh so he doesn't like if you cut him open there's no even veins the hot wasn't a temperature hot it was hot good looking dude the sequels of this is going to be hot chocolate and you know where that's going it's good they're definitely going to do it okay I've been foring you um a small gentleman that looks just like Jared Weissberg yeah I know our wide foot reviewer I think I've been ignoring them yeah me too I I would like people to know that Instagram handle so they can see our wide foot reviewer no you are so caught up on this guy I dude you're telling me it doesn't look exactly like Megan even no I I will not engage with this conversation it looks like it but I think uh he looks jar wife of Jared looks more like David bla I think that's that's what everyone thinks yeah so you don't think that the Littlefoot Jarrett looks like David bla yeah but I mean I think the closer one to one would be Jared and David bla this one I every time I see it I think I'm watching Jared's stories he probably thinks you're his biggest fan at this point he's got to I mean I B his stuff to Jarrett you and Megan every time I see that's insane dude how about satisfy coming out with uh the Jean the Levi satisfy Jeans by the way I didn't see them that was kind of a random offshoot they're climbing climbing jeans so I guess the front is like a got an abrasion um like layer so that it won't make look yeah did they put a shirt on the guy this time I think so so they took uh old Levi je Levi 501 jeans from the Heritage vintage I don't know I think that just means left in the basement yeah you guys got the old 501's laying around and uh they basically put panels of that satisfy and these are for sale rip stop stuff how much are how much do they cost I don't know there's only 200 pairs available so you do the math if well if there was numbers to be just pretend math I don't think they're for sale yet maybe they are you see them on there at all I just got a hype Beast article okay and I googled it um but I was like man that's going to be that's something would you wear them probably right it just wait what's today oh they drop tomorrow oh okay the December 12th for how much I'm satisfied that it's not telling me I mean I'm guessing like $800 or something who knows their rain pants are $350 so let's say $450 I mean if they're yeah they're going to be more than that how much are their climbing pants four these guys yeah yeah Thomas you're wearing them I think 400 or something we didn't get paid paid for doing a podcast we just got a piece of gear the climbing pants are \u20ac300 and and I have to say I love these and my son there the highest compliment I can get is he was like Dad those pants are cool where' you get those oh wow yeah you can't yeah these are on forever never change yeah um but then what was the other thing I wanted to talk about why do I have worm worm grunting I will tell you this I don't know if as long as I'm talking about the I'm in a little bit oh yeah you need to that he ran he started indoor track and we went to an event uh on last Saturday and it was his first time running the 800 indoor and he smoked it came in second place yeah it was against all the Catholic high schools so the in the area which there there was probably what do you think May six or seven um different high schools were there say so and the just I I wasn't expecting I've never seen him to display like a killer instinct or anything like that out on the race I was like oh wow he's in the front pack for the first it was 150 M the track was 150 M I don't even know how to do that math on the it didn't end where it started you kind of went also like some of these kids were going so fast coming around these Corners like they were like just almost eating it because it was flatten on a basketball court basically yeah and uh so five in a third times round yeah and okay he he was in the front pack and I was like okay he he G going out a little hot I was a little worried about it for him mhm and then next thing you know he came around he was in second place and he just stayed there the whole time and I was just like the one guy who was in the front was like super fast but like they was cruising and I was just like wow he ended up on a flat 150 M track like with no banks no traction just like wood floor thing you ran a 224 800 nice which yeah I was like wow and he ran the Tumi sen yeah he he likes the Adidas Tumi sen which I'm like do you want like I was like we can look at other options for you know like they're going to be doing some stuff like this week they're going down to a track in pachy County M and I'm like do you want spikes do you want you know something else he's like no I don't really like spikes the way that they like the hard bottom I don't think he enjoys but I don't know maybe one of these days that this one is weird I'm not going to be able go to it it's on Friday it starts at 3:00 yeah and it he won't get home until 9:00 p.m.",

  "text": "the 10K is a great distance for many Runners it's long enough to provide a serious challenge but short enough that the training isn't going to completely take over your life running a 10K at Max effort is seriously tough but if you execute it well it really is one of the best feelings ever crossing the line earning yourself that new PV after watching this video I know that's what you're going to be doing because today I'm showing my best top tips on how to run that 10K PV we're going to go through all the training that you need to do the sessions that help me run at 3245 and some bonus race tactics as well so stay tuned for those so how long should you give yourself to train for the 10K well ideally we're talking around about 10 weeks that's exactly how long our training plans are that we have on benp parks.com so check those out on the link down below and this will allow for a proper build and then a short taper before race day you can make some really good improvements in the 6 to 8 weeks if that's what you've got but ideally we're talking about 10 the next thing you want to do is figure out where or when you're going to be racing your 10K and then work backwards those 10 weeks to get to your starting point make sure that when you're searching for that flat and fast course also find one where there's not too many turns that you've got to slow down for during the race as well if you're not interested in getting an official 10K time you just want to run a fast 10K in your local area again search out for some parks search out for some traffic free routs anywhere where you're not going to get interrupted because we can't stop during the 10K it has to be 10K of continuous running we'll list a few race organizers that we like to use down below yes they're all in the UK let us know down in the comments where are the fastest 10k routes for you maybe put your location and where they are help out the community Down Below in the comments right so what's a realistic time to aim for with where we're at well of course this will vary wildly from person to person newer Runners are often able to make some more significant improvements in those early stages whereas more experienced Runners are likely to be already a little bit closer to their the Improvement isn't going to be quite as much but as a Rough Guide what can you do well if you're someone tracing a sub 60 you want to be around about in 1 hour 10 shape or comfortable doing a sub 35k sub 50 we're talking around about sub 55 minute shape already around about 25 minutes for the 5K sub 45 you want to be running around about sub 49 already and sub 2230 for the 5K and if you want to get that sub 40 you want to be running around about 43 minutes before we start the training or be comfortable running a sub 20 minute 5K now what does weekly mileage look like for doing this training how many times are we going to get out there how many miles we need to be running well for a sub 60 we're talking about 3 to four runs a week up to around about 22 miles or 35k for a sub 50 we're talking four to five runs a week up to about 35 miles in those Peak weeks 56k per week sub 45 get a little bit faster now got a little bit more training to do about four to five runs a week up to around about 40 miles 64k in that peak week and then finally sub 40 minutes we're talking 5 to six runs a week up to around about 45 miles or 72k one of the most important parts of training for a fast 10K is getting those weekly speed sessions those intensity sessions those reps those intervals into our training we need to get the body used to running at or even faster than our goal pce and a great way of doing this is through these interval sessions now we'd recommend setting aside at least one day a week for your speed session day traditionally this is normally on a Tuesday but it's whenever it falls for you quite frankly and then more experienced Runners probably would to be putting a second speed session into their training but we'll touch on that a little bit later on now these workouts involve running at a hard effort for a particular time or distance followed by a period of rest to recover so get the heart rate up and then recover get it down heart rate up and then down and these interval sessions are what really help boost that V2 Max our fitness to be able to compete at the 10K distance running really really fast so here's some example sessions that you can try when you're next out there of course with all these runs you want to start out by 10 to 15 minutes very light jogging to get the body nice and warmed up maybe do some drills proper warm-up routine to get the body ready to be running fast now the first session I'd recommend trying out is 10x 400 m we will be running these 400 m at our 5K current pace and between these reps we're going to be taking a 90c walking recovery really good one to do on a track if you have that available to you but don't worry if you don't just getting it done in the local park will be fine second session I'd recommend 6x4 minutes at round about our 10K goal Pace the pace we going to be running that race at at the end of our training between these reps we're taking a 2minute walking recovery and then finally my favorite session for 10K running is what I call kick down KS they're basically K reps we're doing the first 800 M of these at our gold 10K pace and then the final 200 M of that K rep at our 5K pace and then taking a 2minute recovery between this if you're trading for a sub 60 do four reps of this sub 50 five reps sub 40 we're talking about six reps here so nice and steady fast finish for the rep and then a 2minute recovery really is the best of both worlds with this one a little bit more fun and interesting and gets used to increasing the effort towards the end of the rep which is what we need to be doing when we're running that 10K now your local running club might well put on a weekly speed session maybe that's something you can check out speak to them if you're not remember of running club we always recommend joining making some new friends in your local running Community as I said at the start you don't have to be doing things on a running track if you don't feel comfortable you don't want to there's not one near you just getting somewhere nice traffic free local parks local cycle paths canal toe paths whatever you've got available near you where you can run uninterrupted that's the best thing quickly guys you find this vide well please smash that like button share with a friend that wants to run a faster 10K and let us know down in the comments what your 10K PB is and where you'd like to get it to as well if you got time please check out my website benp parks.com we've got amazing running hats technical gear casual gear to power you through those training miles and get it done in races as well right back to the 10K tips now most GPS watches I don't tend to wear one day today but I do find running and I normally like to program my workouts into my watch and then I follow it along as they go Garmin choros whatever it is I recommend putting these workouts into your watch one less thing to think about when you're out there getting your runs done now as I touched on before if you are more experienced Runner maybe you're looking to train for around about a sub 45 sub 401K run here you may want to include a second speed session during the week if you're in this Camp focus on that first speed session on the Tuesday maybe doing some shorter reps the 10x 400 something like that then the second session maybe Thursday Friday something like that we're going to be doing some longer reps so maybe some reps here some mile reps or maybe even a 20 minute tempo run later in the week on that Thursday or Friday this will just help to push that Fitness up even more you're a bit more of an experience running you've got some good leg strength already you're used to doing some higher mileage weeks so that's when we can start to really push our fitness forward by doing this second session during the week another key part of this and so many people ignore this so please don't but look at getting some strides into your weekly routine at least once a week we want to be doing some strides now it's really easy to incorporate this you can do this after an easy run as part of your warmup before you go and do a session but basically these are 20 seconds running around about 90% effort so really really fast High Cadence High turnover and as I say maybe do these before your session as part of your warmup or at the end of an easy run if you're you new to strides start out with maybe four reps intermediate five reps more advanced six reps and then just take around 20 to 30 second walk between each one really important when you're going through these focus on good form staying in control then just a gradual acceleration up these are really good way to recruit some more fast twitch muscle fibers when you need that Sprint finish at the end of that 10K and they also help building some strength and improve our running economy as well the more efficiently we can get to point A to point B the less energy we will use during that 10K and the faster we can run it's really quite difficult to run with bad form when you're going that all out pace so it really helps unlock some free speed so definitely get those strides into your weekly routine another key aspect of our running week is getting those long runs and those easy runs here this is when we're really going to build that endurance build that engine that we need to be running at a very fast pace for 40 45 50 60 minutes or so it's going to require a big effort and we need to build that endurance the speed sessions really put a lot of stress on the body we need time to let that recovery set in to adapt so the rest of the week outside the speed sessions we need to keep this a nice low intensity if every day was a speed session we would get injured very very quickly so we need to get a good mix of Paces throughout the week now for your long runs I'd say if you're someone training for a sub 60 looking around about 5 to 8 Miles for your long run sub 50 we're talking about 7 to 10 miles for the long run sub 40 we're talking about 9 to 12 miles for the long run in terms of the pace for these long runs we want to be keep them nice and relax nice and conversational easy Pace zone two kind of pace you can chat to a friend at that's a rough guide will put some recommended Paces for that sub40 sub 50 sub 60 recommended Paces for our easy and our longer runs up on the screen now right the fun is here it's race day we're ready to go how are we going to go about attacking this 10K to get your your PB with all racing we want to avoid going too fast and blowing up this is what so many inexperienced Runners do they go out feeling all good and by halfway they're absolutely gassed and they're walking it in I've done it many times myself when I was learning but I've learned the proper way of pacing races now and that's what we're going to go through what a lot of people like to do is start out slightly easier than gold Pace then move to Gold pace and then move ahead of gold pace so averaged overall is your gold Pace but you start out nice and relax and just build into it gradually and then that fast finish to get your time now what I prefer to do is aim for even pacing throughout and then that final K just give it everything I've got throw the kitchen sink at it for that final K there's not one way that's right or one way that's wrong there's definitely one way that's wrong is going out too fast and then tailing off at the end going through a slow sorry death because that never results in a fast time now if there are some Pacers in your event then it can be a really good idea to stick with them as this really does take away a lot of the guess work and that hard work if you're not sure about your watch you just want to rely on someone else stick in the pacing group if they're offering it now with regards to fueling and hydration it's a little bit harder with 10K something like it some people don't I say definitely make sure you're nice and hydrated maybe have a gel on the start line before you go off and then for me if it's a hot day I'm going to be taking a couple of Cups going around just sipping drink to thirst there's no need to chug a load of liquids down as we go gel's little bit more of a personal preference here some Runners will really like something around about that 30 minute Mark to really help sort of spur them through in that back end of the race other people will just go all the way through without needing anything remember the gold W here don't try anything new on race day use what you practice in training another top tip I like to say is use your lap Pace on your watch rather than the overall pace for the whole event if you've got Auto laps turned on these are going to be going off every mile or every kilometer it's just going to be telling you the pace of that mile or that K that you're in that's all I like to look at and I just make sure I'm running the right pace for that particular K this sort of takes away the errors with some potential GPS issues over the course of the whole run just focus on that moment focus on what you're doing right here right now just making sure you're running at that right pace now running a 10K flat out is really hard I think it's one of potentially the hardest distances but it feels so good when you cross that finish line and get it done now if you do need a little bit more guidance on training then check out our 10K plans we'll link to them all down below all the beginner plans are completely free to download and if you're interested in running that sub 40 minute 10K then check out this video up here next so that's it guys keep on working hard keep on it done let me know when you're next running a 10K what time you're hoping for what your PP is that's it we'll see you very soon in and good luck was in the next one",

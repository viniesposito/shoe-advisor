  "text": "this is the Puma mag Max and it's got a double tall dose of nitro foam will it be the max cushion Cruiser that the name implies or will this just be another big shoe that ends up being a bit too firm time to lace up the mag Max and take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kzi and I'm a non-elite runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the Puma mag Max but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that Puma sent to me for the purpose a review so I didn't have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage of my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the Puma mag Max and let's start with the specs this is a very tall shoe starting out at 46 mm of stack heite in the heel and dropping down to 38 mm of Stack height in the 4 foot giving us an 8 mm drop and the only thing as far as I know from this shoe is that there is Nitro foam in this shoe now a lot of times when I think about Nitro Foams I think of it as being lightweight and fast but I don't always think of it as being soft and so seeing this much stack heite of nitro foam initially gave me a lot of concerns but stay tuned for the what's it like section of the video where I can talk about what it's like to actually run in the shoe now protecting all this stack heite is Puma grip it's a nice thick layer of rubber on the outsole Puma is tending for this shoe to give you 500 mil or for more of durability so they're going to need a lot of rubber to protect the midsole foam and that midsole foam has to be a highly durable material which Nitro foam historically have been moving to the upper we have an engineered mesh which is supported by power tape there is a very comfortable knit tongue which I'm very much enjoying and a minimal amount of padding relatively speaking for a shoe of this size and of this type there is a little bit of rigidity built into the back of this Heel Cup and the foam definitely kind of Scoops up around the back of the heel and on the sides of your ankle to give you a little bit of support and further aiding in that support is the very wide footprint so that way your foot doesn't move around too much whenever it hits the ground now in terms of fit I do want to mention something specifically Puma normally sends me my usual running shoe size that's a US men's n in this shoe they sent me a 9 and a half I don't know if that's just the tester sizes they had remaining because sometimes I get kind of whatever the brands have left to send out to testers or if they thought that this was something that needed me to size up I will say that the 9 and A2 which is a half size up from what I normally wear was really comfortable and for most of my testing of this shoe I kind of forgot that I was a half size up so I would say if you're the type that sometimes sizes up size up on this one now Puma says that this shoe comes in at a stated weight of 290 G but that would be for the usmen size 9 the size 9 1/2 that I had came in a little bit heavier at 302 G and 10.6 6 [Music] oz now that we've talked about what this shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on foot I'm absolutely loving the Puma magmax and I feel like it sets the new standard for what Max cushion shoes should be like in 2024 for a long time we've been getting a lot of bigger taller Max cushion shoes but they haven't been getting commensurately soft and cushioned the Puma mag Max proves that you can do both of those things get bigger get taller get more cushion and get a more comfortable experience using new techniques and new Foams now I mentioned earlier in the video that sometimes Nitro foam gets to be a little bit on the firm side I don't think that softness is Nitro Forte but I'm not sure how they've tweaked the formula of this Nitro foam or if just adding more Nitro foam like this makes it feel softer underfoot but they're doing a fantastic job of balancing and cushioning and bounce in this shoe in other words it is a big soft shoe but it's not mushy underfoot which is something we get a lot of times in these Max cushion shoes and I usually take that as an acceptable trade-off for a shoe that I just want to be in for a long period of time or just want to take for a really comfy relaxed recovery run but this lets me have kind of The Best of Both Worlds where it has that daily trainer feel while still having that extra level of comfort and cushion now I do think that you could even pick up the pace and do a couple of short bursts of speed in this like if you had some strides at the end of an easy run but I think that even with the foam that's in this shoe uh the size and the weight of the shoe would make it a little bit cumbersome for anything longer than just a couple of strides like I wouldn't want to take it out for a workout but if you've got a long slow distance run or just a regular everyday run or recovery run this shoe is going to be really fun and comfortable for you to put your foot into I started testing this shoe out before I ran the Berlin marathon and I loved it for just regular easy run days and then I also tested it after I came back from Berlin and used it for a recovery run and it was just the thing that my feet [Music] needed now before we wrap up this video let's take a step back and look at where the magmax might fit within a broader Puma lineup now whenever I take a look at a running shoe brand I always like to start with the daily trainer and from Puma that's going to be the velocity Nitro 3 it also has Nitro foam in here but it's a little bit lower to the ground so you could use it for a wider variety of paces and kinds of runs it's also built for high levels of durability and that's going to be kind of the anchor and center point of a puma lineup now when it comes to racing there's two different options that Puma has available depending on your preferences and the one that I'm going to talk about today is the devi8 Nitro Elite 3 it's one of the lightest most Nimble Racing shoes on the market it's got an updated version of nitro Elite foam which is even more premium type of racing foam and it's got a carpon fiber plate that's going to go right here you might also in the alternative use the Puma fast R2 which is a shoe that I particularly like but it's going to be an either or situation you're either going to use the fast R2 or you're going to use the DVA Nitro Elite 3 and then kind of in between these two shoes when it comes to like some faster workouts that maybe you don't need to reach for the race day shoe but you want something a little bit faster than your daily training option there is the DV8 Nitro 3 not to be confused with the Nitro Elite 3 just the Nitro non- Elite 3 it's got a little bit of daily trainer DNA and a little bit of race DNA in it and it's a really fun shoe for logging in a lot of workouts and where the mag Max fits in is on the other side of the speed Spectrum when you just want to get out there and log some time on feet and just take care of yourself a little bit more have a little bit of extra cushion and the paces can slip a little bit cuz it's that kind of run that's where the ma Max fits in really well and it's a nice comfy way to round out this Puma [Music] lineup now let's wrap up this video by talking about the buying guide and also some Alternatives that I think you should consider the Puma magmax is a refreshing update on the max cushion genre and it's one of the best examples I've tested in a very long time this is the first year of the shoe so there isn't a prior Year's version that you might be able to save some money at so 180 is what you're going to be looking to spend in order to get in these shoes and I always feel like 180 for a Max cushion shoe kind of feels like a lot but let's take a look at some of the competition to see where that price Stacks up the first shoe that I think Stacks up really well against the Puma mag Max is a shoe that I haven't reviewed yet so hit the Subscribe button if you want to see this review but it comes from Brooks and it's the glycerin Max and I think a lot of similarities between these two shoes that make them line up really well and are both going to be the contenders for Max cushion shoe of 2024 both of these shoes have a Nitro foam in them and both of them are exceptionally soft while also being surprisingly Nimble and if you haven't liked previous Brooks glycerins don't worry I haven't been a fan of the previous glycerins either but this glycerin Max is excellent you are going to pay a price for that Excellence though cuz that shoe comes in at $200 and then the other shoe that I want to talk about comes in a little bit underneath what the Puma magmax comes in at and that's going to be from as6 this is the Glide ride Max coming in at $170 so $10 cheaper than the mag Max I feel like this is also a really great example of a Max cushion shoe although it leans a little bit more on the firm stable side than the mag Max or the glycerin Max does I'm not saying it's not a very soft shoe it's actually what I really wish the Nimbus 26 would have been if it weren't for the mag Max and the glyer max the Glide ride Max would have been probably my choice for a Max cushion shoe of the year so it's certainly a year of Max so if you're a big fan of the max cushion genre 2024 is definitely your year there is a bumper crop of fantastic options if you have any questions about the mag Max or any of the shoes that I talked about today feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet STP by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run clip Channel love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I'll see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music]",

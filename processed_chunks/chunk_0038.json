  "text": "one of the promises of the adios Pro Evo 1 is that the learnings from this shoe would trickle down into Adidas's mainstream product we've seen some of that promise fulfilled in the recently announced adios Pro 4 and now even more of that lineage is making its way into everyday product this is the azero Evo SL and it's time to take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm an an elite Runner who used running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the adero Evo SL but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that Adidas sent to me for the purpose of review so I didn't have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the a zero Evo SL and let's start with the specs I think the headline spec is that it's Light Strike Pro midsole foam in this shoe and unlike other shoes from other brands that use the same name as their racing Foams even if the daily training versions are chemically different this is actually racing caloro in this shoe I've confirmed with Adidas that it is Light Strike Pro in this shoe and nothing but Light Strike Pro in this shoe and the same exact Light Strike Pro that's in the adios Pro 3 and there is a slight variation in terms of Stack kite and drop in the Evo SL versus its racing big siblings where the Evo SL starts out at 38.5 mm of stacky in the heel and ends with 32 mm of sa in the 4 foot for a 6 and 1/2 mm drop and like I said there's no stabilizing element whatsoever in the midsole of the shoe so you're getting a really great opportunity to experience what pure Light Strike Pro really feels like now another element that they've borrowed from the Evo one other than the Aesthetics of the shoe and it does look absolutely stunning and it does look very similar is that they've borrowed the 60% rocker position and so what that means is the rocker is the point at which the front of a running shoe kind of curls up a little bit and it helps you as you're running forward to get over the foam and through the foam so that way you can push off for your next stride now if we measure from 0% all the way to the full length of the shoe 100% where the rocker position starts is at 60% of the length from 0 to 60 over here is where the rocker position starts and this is really early compared to a lot of other shoes in the Adidas lineup even the adios Pro 3 started at closer to 70% of the length of the shoe uh before it started in that rocker geometry but the EVO One and the adios Pro 4 both start at 60% and the evos SL is mimicking that geometry here now to protect all this midsole foam we've got a generous helping of Continental rubber there is pretty wide coverage in the forefoot of the shoe and then two little strips in the back of the heel now while there is a good surface area amount of coverage the rubber that's on here isn't very thick but as we've seen from other cont ental Rubber products the durability on these rubber outsoles is pretty high so the thickness of the rubber doesn't really bother me here moving to the upper we have what looks very similar to what we saw in the Evo one but what feels in fact very different the upper for the Evo one was almost transparent it was almost see-through and extremely lightweight yet also strong now we have a little bit more of a traditional upper in terms of what we see on the EVO SL but it is very breathable and the design is still very clean and minimalistic just like what we saw in the Evo SL which makes the three stripes that go across the shoe even that much more striking then the other really big difference that I know between the EVO One upper and the Evo SL upper is in the tongue and in the padding in the heel cup the EVO One tongue was kind of difficult to deal with this one is much more kind of traditional and standard it's still very thin and I I like it very much and then in terms of padding in the back you could tell that this shoe is built a a little bit more for daily training and not necessarily for racing because there is a lot more comfort features built into this there's a lot of padding around the back of the heel cup and a little bit of structure as well altogether Adidas tells us that this shoe should come in at 224 G and when I weighed my usmen size 9 my reference size shoot it came in at exactly 224 G or 7.9 Oz [Music] now that we talked about what this shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on foot and I got to tell you pure racing foam in a daily trainer is really nice or at least it's really nice in the way they've implemented it here in the Evo SL I've taken the shoe out for Recovery run efforts daily training and for some speedier work as well I think it excelled in all three areas although it is doing certain things better than others I find that there's a really nice squish to it the foam is compressing nice ly and decompressing really well although I think that some people are going to find that the way that this shoe is set up it's going to be a little bit unstable at some of the easier paces and I found that like the shoe kind of felt a little bit muddled after long extended periods of easy running in the shoe I do feel like the shoe does speedier running or like kind of uptempo running really well though and what I mean by uptempo Paces is stuff that's maybe a little bit slower than your marathon Race pace and all the way up to half marathon or maybe up to threshold efforts I feel like that range of speed which is a pretty broad band of effort levels at those Paces that are faster than easy I feel like the foam is really starting to perk up and respond like a super foam wood where it's getting a great amount of compression and decompression and I'm enjoying the amount that the foam is deflecting but I also enjoy kind of the the the Rhythm or the pace at which it's deflecting as well cuz I feel like it's really matching with my foot strike and my stride and I think that when you're picking up the pace a little bit in this shoe that's where I think that the 60% geometry of The Rocker that's in the shoe feels the most kind of sensible I feel like at some of the easier Paces the 60% rocker where the rocker starts so early uh makes it feel a little bit more aggressive than the shoe necessarily needs to be it's a 6 and half millim drop shoe and I feel like it feels like a much taller drop because of that aggressive rocker that start starts so early but when you're picking up the pace even just a little bit that's where I feel like the whole thing really just makes a lot of sense together and if you think about it it should make a little bit more sense that way because it's borrowing so much Heritage from the adios Pro 3 the adios Pro 4 and the evo1 kind of all put together and distilled into this daily training package and at the end of the day I feel like calling it a daily trainer is a little bit reductive or calling it a session shoe also is a little bit reductive because it's not strictly a session shoe at certain Paces when I want to go faster than threshold and certainly if I were to do a a big V2 Max workout I I would want something that's a little bit snappier here and that's where I'm missing the pop of a plate in this shoe but the fact that this shoe can kind of handle a lot of what an average Runner is going to encounter during a marathon or half marathon training block I think is it was really quite amazing that they've able to put that all into one shoe I do feel like the big biggest attractor I'd say for this shoe is the upper the materials that they've chosen look great but I think that every material that's here is a bit of a sweat collector so on those hot days on those really big workouts that you're going to put into this shoe your shoes are going to be soaking up a lot of [Music] liquid now before we wrap up the video let's take a moment and see where the Evo SL could fit within a broader Adidas running shoe rotation now the evos for me fits as a daily trainer it can certainly do a lot of different types of things but the bulk of the time that you're going to be using this shoe you're probably going to be using it for your everyday runs your easy runs taking up the bulk of your weekly mileage and then for racing you're going to look to its sibling the adios Pro 4 as the racing option there are similarities in Geometry a lot of similarities in feel these two shoes alone are going to make for a really fun running SHO rotation if you wanted to go with just two but let's add some more into the conversation I think one way to go really crazy and wild with this is to bring in the prime X2 strong this is more of a long run shoe but not just any long run shoe if you've got a long run with some speedier miles built into it or you have just a big workout where you want a lot of cushion and this has a lot of cushion and double carbon fiber plates this is a really fun albeit expensive way uh to add some spice into your your long runs and now there's some gaps in between each of these shoes and this is where this running shoe rotation is going to get a little bit I don't know about controversial but it get a little bit interesting and the reason why I'm going to kind of play around with it a little bit is because when I reviewed the adios Pro 4 I went through the similar lineup kind of conversation and then went through the I think more traditional take on the Adidas running shoe lineup but let's spice things up a little bit especially because Adidas has so many different shoes in its Arsenal I think one shoe that I could put here here in kind of like the max cushion category or in the long slow distance category where you just want to be chill and comfy is going to be the Boston 12 now this isn't normally where the Boston sits normally I put the Boston here as kind of a session shoe but the way that the Boston 12 is built and the way that the Boston has been going for a lot of years is to put it more in kind of like this uh longer run time on feet category of shoe it's really comfortable for casual wear it's really comfortable for long longer easy runs it does have some Light Strike Pro in it and some form of energy rods in there so it can pick up the pace a little bit but for me it doesn't love picking up the pace so I'm going to put it here in this kind of Max cushion more comfy category of shoe and then in this speed category spot I'm going to put in the adios 8 now normally I would say I can't imagine why you would pick the adios 8 over the Tumi sen which is the normal shoe that I put in this spot but keep in mind that these are 202 five shoes that we're talking about here the Evo SL is coming out in 2025 the adios Pro 4 is coming out in 2025 each of these shoes won't make it into my 2024 year and wrap-up videos and comparison videos because they're 2025 videos so as a placeholder for now I'm going to put in the adios 8 here watch this space for 2025 cuz I think what they're bringing is going to be I don't know if it's going to be better than the Tumi sen but it's certainly going to be in the conversation of the Tumi sen for what the next audios is going to be so I'm going to talk about this here in that speed category when you want to go a little bit faster than what your daily trainer can do but maybe don't have as big or maybe have a faster workout in terms of Paces than what you might do in your Marathon racer and this I think is another very valid way of putting together an Adidas running shoe lineup in 2025 [Music] now let's wrap up the video by talking about the buying guide and we'll also go over some Alternatives that you will likely want to consider the azero Evo SL is the best daily trainer in the Adidas lineup and it's a really great example of how good and versatile Light Strike Pro can be for people who are looking for their first marathon racing shoe and don't necessarily want to get into carbon this is going to be a really great choice for people that are looking for an extra cushioned session shoe it's also going to be a really great choice and for anyone that just wants to be a little bit extra and have an all Light Strike Pro Mido foam as their daily trainer the Evo SL is going to make you pretty happy as well this shoe won't be available until 2025 but when it does release it'll be coming in at $150 which yes is a lot of money but I really think that it's quite a bargain let's take a look at some of the competitor to see what they come in at to see where that 150 stack up and the first shoe that I'm going to talk about is the Pegasus plus this is a shoe that proudly labels that it has zoomx foam in it but anyone who has run in this shoe and also run in any other zoomx Racing shoes know that they're not exactly the same kind of zumex that's in it now while I think it's wildly misleading to the consumer to give the same name to the phone that's in the alphafly 3 and in the Pegasus plus I think that given different names I don't think that there's anything wrong with tinkering with the formula ation of the materials in order to achieve a desired effect in a daily trainer and I do think that this is a really great daily training experience it feels very much like a pegasus and it feels very much like a peg turbo as well kind of wrapped into one splitting the difference in a lot of ways and each of these shoes would be a great choice for daily trading or for workouts and sessions the other thing about this shoe is that it comes in almost an ounce heavier and $30 more expensive cuz going to be paying $180 to get to the peg plus now the next shoe that I want to talk about and again both these shoes that I'm going to compare to the evos SL are shoes that I really like in 2024 uh and the other one is from New Balance it's the rebel version 4 this again is using a foam that is called fuel cell which is the same name as the racing foam that New Balance uses but it's a a different formulation than what's in their race product their race product has peba in it this is a peba Eva blend and I think that that's it's a successful combination I kind of take offense to the fact that they call it the same thing but overall at the end of the day the material that's in here is really nice it's lightweight it squishes the right way it bounces back in the right way and it makes for a really lightweight fun running experience it's about the same weight as the azero Evo SL and I would use these two shoes in a lot of very similar ways the big difference for me though in the rebel version 4 and why I might not reach for it in as many kind of fart lick workouts or even longer Tempo progression runs that I might use the Evo SL for is that there's a lot of width to the bottom of this shoe it's wider at the pads of the feet it's wider underneath the arch and it's much wider through the heel and I think what they're trying to do is prevent this shoe from getting too unstable and so they're trying to stabilize it with width which I think does the job that'll certainly make it more stable but also makes it a little bit less Nimble and a little bit less excit exting you're getting a little bit of discount though for those trade-offs because the rebel version 4 comes in at $140 so those are my thoughts on the azero EO Asel and the competition let me know in the comments if you have any other questions or better yet stop by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I'll will see you in the next one yo what's going on a [Applause] [Music]",

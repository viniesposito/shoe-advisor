apparently it's all changed a little bit here in this year and we can pick up our numbers quite quickly you do that first and then go into the Expo so yeah let's go and get our wristbands and check in and see what it's all about we just got the uh band and a bag which is probably just full of promotional stuff yeah a lot of people always ask when we come and do these races how did you get in I actually ran a qualifying time if you can run under 245 in a marathon then you get a guaranteed entry like a fast runner entry into Berlin around 243 I think in London not this year but the year before and I could use that to get a entry into this race so you just enter it's guaranteed you pay your money to get in and it's quite cool if you're a fast runner you get right up at the front so just behind the elites and like the first sort of Corral a so you get a really good start as well right let's go get a number German English uh English is easier English okay perfect they print the numbers on the day it comes out comes out the little printers just here starting number for tomorrow you starting to a very good thank you 50th Burly Marathon 2 6 7 10 have I got this yeah I hope so running should be fun first and [Music] foremost yeah that is actually ridiculous how light how light that is I've never actually seen one of these guys this is the uh Pro Evo 1 it's \u00a3400 in the UK I'm not sure how much what that is in put it up on the screen this is the shoe that currently holds the female world record and you can only really use it on one run so quite expensive so let me know guys do you want to see this reviewed on the channel I mean it's a hell of a lot of money I can't make that back on reviewing a reviewing a shoe but yeah let me know I try and get one in absolutely [Music] crazy as we're here a little bit later than I'd normally be there's no space left on the wall but luckily being over 6'1 uh I might be able to [Music] reach right let's head out of the EXP oh the camera's up there can I move it down there no I've already got this camera I don't really know how it works uh yeah just come back outside and it is now raining but the weather for tomorrow is looking really quite good perfect perfect weather no excuses if you see anybody on their stra tomorrow saying how hot it was they're lying but yeah let's have a chat about my goals for the day tomorrow and hopefully I won't be uh having to come up with excuses cuz I'm hope I'm probably trying to go out there and run about sort of 90% as always every year my big goal of the year is Valencia so TimeWise hopefully 245 to 250 solid run I'm just going to go sort of go through halfway see how I feel kick it down a little bit have some fun right let's go and get some food Sarah because we haven't been doing well today we haven't even had really proper breakfast so we need to go to get some solid pasta down for some lunch [Music] right guys so we had a lovely bit of Passa there came back to the hotel and just crashed caught up with some work but and then I've had a a pizza for my dinner and now I need to go to bed so I just thought to take you through all the little kit bits for tomorrow so shoewise we're going with these The Vapor vaporfly it's good start to this isn't it alphafly version three yeah just super comfortable doing a lot of my speed sessions in this shoe just got some of the saw socks to go here watch wise I'm really enjoying this I bought this this is the the little baby Garmin watch the one65 and it's just been so good it's just really lightweight on my wrist I'm just going to have my naked band as well as well and they're just going to have the GoPro and a load of gels going to have some Morton drink mix in the morning on the way to the start line which you'll see cuz this video will carry on in the morning uh that's just my waterproof jacket for the morning there some gloves I've forgotten my pink gloves in London like what an absolute idiot but I'm just going to take these black ones out I don't think it'll be too bad um woolly hat for the start line as well that we'll check in this is just launched on the website we'll link to all the stuff down below so feel free to C you use cod code YouTube 10 Sarah can you put on the screen cuz I'm messing this up for 10% off um any purchases on the website really helps out the channel so thank you so much for that we've got a brand new B Parks cross saw running singlet here got a few of these left I've never even showed this on camera and it's pretty much sold out already so if you want to check that out on the website that would be great very very lightweight just don't even think like feel like you're wearing anything gels wise I'm just going with Morton going to take four of these 160 gel out on the course with me of course Ben Park's backwards black cap on got my number ready to go just got some Nike trackies to wear to the start line This is the uh GoPro setup so I've got the external little microphone little thing you have to plug in so much better audio quality still on the 12 at the moment but it's working absolutely fine for me absolutely no need to upgrade and what else we got here some tablets so I don't need to go to the L during the race just some the standard oh the camera over the place em modium tablets there some pants I want to see that just got my saw shorts I have been chatting to saw about potentially making some shorts because so many of you guys want these shorts with the logo on and they are fantastic hopefully we'll do something with that in the new year and then a spare battery cuz you don't want the camera to run out during the race and the body Glide uh which we use to the start line and I think that's everything anything else to chat about Sarah don't think so here we [Music] go all right good morning every we're here at the start it's about 8:00 in the morning what a absolutely beautiful day it's still pretty cold at the morning but it looks like it's going to be perfect running conditions hardly a breath of wind and crisp probably about 7 or 8 degrees at the moment I'm just going to get my race gear on get my bag checked in which is just over here behind me and yeah then we'll have a chat as we head through the tear Garden on the way to the start yeah really looking forward this one a lot of nervous energy this morning right let's get the bag checked [Music] in right guys just doing the warm up and uh yeah just going to do probably about 5 minutes gentle jogging through the woods and then

today all right guys halfway 122 just said 122 and you're not going to lie the last 5K felt pretty tough so might not been enough mileage of my training but not particularly looking forward to the

volunteers out here today making the burlin marathon happen so many thousands of people that come together to get people around this course and that's me3 30k absolutely heading the W big St there's really no substitute for mileage sort of 780k a week is not enough for now just need to get myself to the Finish [Music] [Music] [Applause] keep pushing back all right guys we're coming up to a park run today 5K today and yeah it's been a fun race but incredibly tough race far harder than I was hoping for unfortunately but we never give up we always got it done you's got to have the lows if you have the highs at the end of the day we're out here running a marathon and that should never be taken for granted I'm very lucky to do what I do going to push the last five for you guys get [Music]

runs not going very well Sarah 3% battery with 85% uploaded so always working hard wher we are we got to catch our flight about 10:00 this evening feeling a lot better now like my body feels absolutely fine it just did not have the fitness but I have tried a lot of new things in my training a lot of lower mileage but still getting a lot of intensity and a lot of gym work in there and quite clearly today it just spectac has not worked I'm trying to see the positive side of things so yeah no no real worries just going to go back to my my regular wear training now for the leadup to Valencia which I'm really excited for and going to get more of those 130 140k weeks I think my biggest week recently has been about 75k and that's probably good for a sub three hour marathon which is what I did today so I can't really complain I just wanted to try something different and yeah I don't have like a load of stack of natural Talent I'm just a regular guy and I can't supplement that high mileage with anything else other than high mileage so that's what we going back for really excited for that be back in the gym doing loads of strength work as well well next time you see us we're heading off to Australia to come and meet a load of you amazing people out there and of course a quick shout out to Philly who ran a 225 another YouTuber give her a follow that is just absolutely epic

  "text": "the most anticipated shoe of the year is finally here the aex super blast version 2 the original super blast burst onto the scene last year and almost immediately became one of my absolute favorite alltime training shoes and when I'm not out running testing other shoes this was the shoe I'd reach for about 90% of the time clocking it over 3,000 km in a few different versions of version one with two big updates to version two with the out soole and the upper hereit I was really worried that aex might be messing this one up so is this new model going to live up to my very high expectations or am I going to be scaring eBay to try and find some pairs of version one and as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review right let's get stuck into all of the changes between the version one and version two the price of the Superglass 2 is a little bit more expensive here in the UK now costing \u00a3200 most markets around the world it's pretty much the same we have got an updated midsole this big chunk through the middle here which now uses the FF turbo the same as the updated metas speed sky and Edge asex is most premium responsive foam that they offer out there and then we've got a thin layer along the bottom of here of asx's FF blast plus which is what they use for a little bit more durability and also sort of stabilizing the shoe we've got an updated outsole much welcome updated outo this is new aex grip rubber on the bottom here a little bit more grippy here in the wet weather we'll come on to chat about that a little bit later on the review and also you can't get any stones and Pebbles and little hitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe here which I you get all the time on version one when you'd run on sort of more grally areas they filled in all of those holes in slightly different design and pattern on version two and then finally we've got a different updated upper to the shoe here which is now this one piece woven engineered mesh so it's a little bit more stretchy and just has a little bit more movement with the shoe versus version one right let's get stuck into the facts and figures this is is your long distance mileage monster for crushing those long runs out there and it's also one of the very best non-plated racing shoes perfect for like 10K half marathons marathons and also Ultra marathons if they're going to be on the road as well is very much a road shoe although you could do have a little bit of light trail with this great aex grip on the bottom here price-wise this sent me back \u00a3200 here in the UK around about \u20ac220 $200 around about $320 Australian dollars stack Heights we've got 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and it's basically the same weight as the outgoing model for me this is coming at 288 G that's really really quite light for sure of this size this is in my particular size UK 11 A2 here the old version was 290 so basically exactly the same it is a neutral shoe the upper as I've just said is this lovely engineered mesh upper which Asic say is going to improve the air flow through the shoe midso we've got the FF Turbo plus through the middle here and then the FF blast plus Eco along the bottom of the shoe there there is famously no carbon plate in the shoe and the outsole Now features this aex grip which is these yellow sections here and aex also put this on some of their trail shoes as well so it's very tacky very sticky a lce sort of slow density rubber to try and improve on asx's usually quite poor wet weather performance there are no different wits available at launch but it's pretty good here on the witth side there's also this one Flagship color at launch which is asx's Paris colorway personally I absolutely love this let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments asex say that this is to do with Paris called the city of lights and we've got sunset and sunrise colors here and finally this wasn't true to size I actually ordered a size 12 my usual size and a size 11 and 1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version one and I've stuck with that in version two basically i' just say go half a size down from your regular size or go exactly the same size you had in version one if you had that shoe if you could like and share this video and let us know down in the comments your thoughts on the superl 2 that be great and please check out my website benp parks.com we've got training plans the best running hats in the world some technical gear and Casual gear to keep you going through your training right let's get stuck into the likes my first like here is they didn't mess it up come on I get so worried when you have your absolute favorite shoe out there and a manufacturer releases a new one and you're like please don't mess it up please don't make it really heavy bulky use different materials they have used different materials but all the updates in the shoe have worked really well the upper is just a little bit more breathable the key area such as the ankle lock down absolutely fantastic no slipping no blisses no hot spots nice gusseted tongue here just gives the perfect right amount of padding so your foot stays nicely locked down yes I was a bit worried my foot might move around a little bit at the front of the shoe with this woven mesh upper but it just stays perfectly in place so no problems there and also finally thank you to ax for not increasing the weight actually for me brought it down very very so slightly super lightweight shoe it is absolutely amazing how a shoe can be this light and it just feels so much fun to run in my second like with the shoe is this updated midsole foam it's just ever so slightly more Poppy and responsive but really very very similar if you're a fan of version one you're going to love this updated foam in version two It just strikes that perfect balance in a shoe that can just have that sudden turn with speed of course there's plenty of faster dedicated 5K and 10K shoes with plates and things like that there but that's not what this shoe is all about this shoe is perfect for crunching those long distance marathon training runs or marathon races as well if you don't want to be using a carbon plate and really if you don't want to have a carbon plate in your shoe there really is nothing faster out there than the aex super blast version 2 and then finally my third like with the shoe is this updated outsole the super blast was okay in the wet it really wasn't that great but the new aex grip they put on the bottom of the shoe here just means all of that worry has gone away when I have running it in the wet it's just gripped super fantastically and you really can feel the difference even walking around the house the you one it just feels different it's lot more tacky when aex had all their problems with their grip with their wet weather grip in like the Nova Blast 2 and three it really wasn't very good this you don't have to worry about it at all fantastic update aex well done finally got a shoe that you can trust in the wet weather and also you can just take this out on some light Trails as well and it will handle those absolutely fine some fire roads and things like that you'll be good to go here moving on to the dislikes this is really hard to be honest my first dislike isn't really even about the shoe it's just about all the supply issues that you have with the superlast and I don't know why aexs are like this the shoe sells out so quickly pretty much sold out on launch day all around the world maybe it's all just marketing I don't know there's nothing in this shoe that you can't get on all of the other ax shoes the materials are all available but they really seem to limit Supply I can only assume I don't know why that is but this shoe will be selling out very very quickly if you can get a pair you want to get a pair don't dilly dally just go and get that order in and also the shoe was meant to launch on Friday just gone on the aex website here in the UK they didn't even launch because I think they had supply issues themselves and they delayed their launch again I don't know that's just what I suspect even assets can't get it right I got my player from sport shoes got up at 5:30 in the morning to try and secure a pair which I managed to do so very very happy with that got the 11 and a half and 12 come in and now yeah need to send the 12's back cuz I just a bit worried about the sizing but we're all good the second sort of dislike I've got with a shoe yeah it is a little bit on the expensive side it's so hard to be talking about a 200 shoe and saying this is great it is a fantastic shoe but also what you're getting with that 200 L is a super durable shoe as well I'd always get at least 1,000 k out of my version one the updated outsol in the shoe should be even better so it should be getting a little bit more mileage out of this but it does last a long time I can't wait to bring a full whizbang pop review once I've done my thks in the shoe will slot it into a review somewhere down the line and speaking of cost maybe you're better off at going for something like the Nova blast 4 for example \u00a365 less that's a big chunk of cash and really the Nova blast is a superb allaround shoe the super blast it is slightly quicker without a doubt it's just a little bit more responsive less bouncy foam you get here and it is better suited for your long runs just a bit firmer bit lighter and just a bit Smo smoother through the footstrike overall but I'd say stick with the Nova blast if you're just looking for something that you can do all of your runs pretty well and you're not doing too many long runs it's a shoe that's I'd say around about 90% as fast and really will suit the vast majority of people unless you're looking for the absolute Crema creme or if you're very fortunate to have the budget and you want to get both of them then you could use you all your sort of regular daily training in the Nova blast and then use this for your marathon training long runs and maybe even a marathon racing shoe at the weekend moving on the Neo Vista hit the scene a few weeks ago I gave it a rave review it was fantastic \u00a350 cheaper and it really is a bit of a shoe at the moment has a nylon plate in it so slightly different feel very different ride going through the shoe it's bouncier and it's softer and it does soak up those easy Mars a little bit better the super blast picks up the pace a little bit better and it does have a firmer ride both these shoes supremely comfortable I could personally choose this type of upper rather than the booty upper just get a better lock down in this one and with the near Vista it's just a little less stable around the corners where this is absolutely Rock Solid and the super blast will probably last a little bit longer with this better out soole with the shoe there as well so I really think you're getting about the same sort of value yes the super blast is a little bit more expensive but it will last a lot longer I think in my opinion then finally something like the Nike Invincible version 3 around about 20 cheaper here the Invincible is a lot bouncier it's roomier it's heavier it's perfect for those easy recovery runs but again a shoe manufacturers using their Flagship foam without putting that carbon plate in the shoe the super blast is just much smoo through the stride a lot firmer much more Nimble and lightweight and just better at a more wider range of speeds where something like the Invincible it's really is just your sort of steady marathon pace really steady marathon pace and easing recovery run sort of shoe so let's bring this all together what do I think of the superlast well it's a fantastic shoe without a doubt it is definitely going into my rotation I'm going to finish my miles I've got about 300 miles left in my last pair of version one so I'm not going to use this straight away it's not a revolutionary update get subscribed and see if this shoe will be making into my top three shoes of the year which we normally launch around about December time if you are interested in other asset shoes we've got a complete assets comparison guide again completely unsponsored B all the asset shoes with I money check that out that is up here coming up next let me know if you've got any questions down in the comments about the super blast I'll catch up and answer all of those down there keep it working hard guys keep done I'm have to get some more marathon training done we see you very soon in the next one",

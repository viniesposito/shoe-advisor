  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video we're going to be comparing the choros pace 3 and the choros pace [Music] Pro so the pace 3 and the pace Pro are the two best watches in corus's range in our opinion they are both lightweight really impressive sports watches that offer a lot of the features you get on more expensive and larger devices in a comfortable little package with the pace 3 being one of our top picks for beginners or just budget sports watches in general while the pace Pro is chorus's first AMOLED sports watch and competes in general with watches like the Garmin 4 265 so in this video I'm going to run through the key differences between the two watches I've been wearing both for a couple of weeks and I've tested both extensively in the past as well and then we'll go straight into a verdict where Kieran Mike and I will all say which one we'd buy if we were coming to choose between the pace Pro and the pace 3 having tested both watches so there's a lot of similar features on these watches like corus tends to have the same features throughout its entire range in terms of like things like sports tracking and training analysis you're getting a lot of very similar stuff here but there are obviously some pretty big differences between the pace Pro and the pace 3 starting with the price the pace 3 is significantly cheaper at \u00a3219 or $229 whereas the pace Pro is \u00a3349 or $349 Pace Pro is also a bigger watch you've got a 46 mm case a slightly thicker case as well and that makes it a bit heavier at 37 G with a nylon band compared to the PACE 3 at 30 G with a nylon band they are both still very lightweight watches overall similar materials used on both watches with plastic cases and glass screens but you've also got that big AMOLED screen on the chorus Pace Pro which is probably the biggest reason you'd look at upgrading from the pace 3 it's a 1.3 in AMOLED screen whereas on the pace 3 you've got a 1.2 in memory and pixel display so getting a much brighter and more engaging screen on the pace Pro got the same two button design on both but on the pace Pro the back button a bit bigger and the digital dial is steel so you can take ECG measurements whereas it's a plastic dial on the pace 3 they've both got the same 58m water resistance and a similar slate of sensors under the hood things like a barometric altimeter and pulse oximeter however you have a faster processor on the coros pace Pro which makes it snappier to navigate its menus and useing like the maps on the watch and that is a big feature you get on the pace Pro which you don't get on the chorus Pace 3 Pace 3 just has breadcrumb navigation with a line and pointer whereas you get a full offline maps on the chorus Pace Pro you've also got bigger storage on the chorus Pace Pro which has 32 GB of storage compared to 4 GB on the pace 3 which gives you more room to store things like maps and also music they both offer music storage although it's just simple drag and drop music files rather than connecting to any kind of streaming service then the last difference you'll see on paper is battery life and you'll see that in practice as well the battery stats depend a fair bit on whether you're using the rais to wake feature on the chorus Pace Pro or not but even if you have the screen always on you're going to get 6 days of battery life with the pace Pro or 20 days if you use the rais to wake feature whereas the pace 3 is listed at lasting 15 days in watch mode so the pace 3 lasts longer outside of workouts but during workouts you get more battery life from the pace Pro which offers up to 31 hours of dualband GPS battery life that drops to 24 if you use the always on screen whereas a course pce 3 just offers 15 hours of dual band GPS battery [Music] life so I think the biggest pull to me on the pace Pro over the pace V Lies first and foremost with the AMOLED display which I do think makes it a nicer watch to use day-to-day when I think about the Smartwatch features that you have at your disposal I know you know very very similar to the ones on the pce 3 I just think having that bigger screen that color display just makes them features that I want to use on a more regular basis you've got that full mapping support as well which I think you know as we've seen with other AMOLED watches you know allows you to give you you know a lot more detail in that mapping and just make some features that feel a lot nicer to use kind of day and night I probably had a couple of extra things on top of that I think the GPS performance has just been a little bit better for me in my test has not been a huge amount in it and I think the pace three is very accurate but I think for me the accuracy has just been a little bit better for me on the pace Pro I think the battery life as well I think you know if you're using this watch in a kind of with a R to wake I think the battery life is better than the pce 3 it's got a really good standby battery mode that we've seen in all chorus watches and I think you know if you're willing to use it in the raise to wake always on display mode battery life is very good but I think as I generally use it with the raise to wake I think the battery life is very good and better for me than the pace 3 now in terms of which watch I would go for I still really like the pce 3 and I think you know from a valy point of view I think there's a lot to like about that watch I like the design I think the core run tracking experience is very good I think the Dual Band GPS performance is good risk-based heart rate monting is probably a little bit better for me though would you know pair it up with external heart R mon with both watches but I think you know if you were you know for General runs I think the performance has been a little bit better you know it has kind of breadcrumb navigation which for me would be enough you know I just want some kind of mapping and navigation support you know I like having some mapping and navigation Sport and I think having that on the P3 is probably going to be enough for me so as an all round package from a point of view I would probably still be going for the pace 3 I do really like the pace Pro and there's a lot that I've liked about this watch it's one of my favorite watches I've tested this year but if you can live without I would say that kind of you know Amed display the kind of slightly Slicker software that full mapping support there's a lot to still like about the pce 3 and as I said it's a very good value watch that you know still delivers in the key areas and it would probably be the watch that I would go for despite really liking the pace Pro and if I had a little bit more money to spend and I would definitely be going for the pace Pro but you know if you're looking for Value I think the pace three is the one that you should go for and that's one I would go for I'm going to open by saying that these are both excellent watches that I think represent good value in the whole kind of scheme of running watches probably the most appealing watch is in the chorus lineup for sure so I don't think you could really go wrong if you buy either but getting into which is best in my testing the pace 3 and the pace Pro come up a pretty close match in many areas I think the pace Pro is a bit snappier to move around thanks to the faster processor the big bright screen does elevate your stats insights and make the most of that additional mapping capability that's definitely a step up in the experience but it's like kind of turning left on a plane you might not notice the difference until you've actually experienced it for yourself and the pace 3 is perfectly good for most Runners needs if you've not experienced the AMOLED you're not going to be all that bothered necessarily but the experience is a little bit up there on the pace Pro on accuracy I tested the accuracy and heart rate reliability against a selection of Rivals including the CTO race s titanium the polar Vantage G3 I also used various chest straps to Benchmark and I did the sort of GPS up against things like the Garmin Phoenix 8 AMOLED as another Benchmark and when it came to the GPS performance I think it was solid on both I didn't really find that much to choose between these two the optical heart rate can be a bit fallible on both as well does well during kind of easy steady runs mainly during intervals it struggles but I wouldn't wait to say one is better than the other beyond the screen the build for me is largely the same too both devices are a bit plastic with cheaper materials but that does make them nice and lightweight and wearable 24/7 pretty much the same the pce three is a smidge lighter but I wouldn't say that's noticeable on the wrist the screen is also a touch bigger but again I don't find that makes a huge difference in terms of the use on the move it's the brightness and color that really gives the pace Pro the Boost not the real estate you get now on paper you're also getting longer battery life in the most accurate GPS modes on the pace Pro and this is some where where I did spot a difference in my tests when I had the always on screen set to off in the max GPS accuracy modes that's using the Dual frequency GPS it use around half the battery of the coros pace 3 that obviously becomes less pronounced if you have the always screen on or the always on screen on that said I'm not sure it's a big enough difference to make me buy the pro over the three now another area where you might be looking and thinking it's different the extra storage for maps and music also sounds good in the specs but the music is such a faf getting the mp3s on there that I never really I don't even own music files so it doesn't matter how much storage there is for it not bothered by that unless you are then I wouldn't worry so then the decision ultimately comes down to whether you want that bright AMOLED screen and those offline maps if you do I think the chorus pce Pro is worth the extra it's easily the best corus watch to buy if you're looking for a capable sports watch with a killer screen the longest lasting AMOLED battery life going and those better navigation skills if you already own a coros pace 3 and you're not bothered about the AMOLED screen and the maps then I don't think it's worth upgrading even for the added ECG and that little bit of extra battery life if you're a newcomer and the screen and Maps aren't priorities I'd probably say save yourself some dollars and go for the choros pace 3 for me personally when it comes to bang for buck I choose the pace three as the better value option if someone else was paying for it though let's get someone else to pay for it I think I would choose the pace Pro so I've tested both of these watches a lot and I really like both of these watches they're two of my standouts on the market two I would cons consider buying myself for sure if I was a new Runner or an experienced Runner they both really offer everything you need to track your training I've not really seen a big difference in the accuracy of these two watches the chorus does say you've got an improved satellite setup on the chorus Pace Pro and the heart rate sensor is designed to sit more snugly against the wrist but I've seen very similar results from both watches when I've been testing them side by side over the past couple of weeks and in general throughout my testing both watches have really impressed me on GPS accuracy I can't really F them at all compared to other watches out there and the Heart Ray accuracy is about in line with what you expect from an optical sensor in that it's been pretty good for me for the most part especially in warm conditions testing it lately in cold conditions I've had a bit more kind of variability in the results compared to those of a chest trap but overall I'd say both of them offer pretty good heart rate tracking especially as they are small watches you can really you know pull snuggly against your wrist and get better readings uh especially like I say in warm conditions like I said I have been wearing them both at the same time over the past couple of weeks and GPS accuracy have not really seen a big difference the pace 3 tends to be slightly more generous when I'm doing uh workouts especially on Loop courses but talking a couple of seconds uh per rep that kind of thing so no big difference so I wouldn't say that be a big reason to upgrade to the chorus Pace Pro the big reason for sure is certainly the design though you have got that AMOLED screen which is a big upgrade especially as the mirroring pixel displays you get on chorus watches aren't the brightest in general and that's the case with the pace 3 it is still clear enough to read it's not a problem but the chorus Pace Pro screen is much brighter more engaging easier to use on the Run easier to use off the run and yeah that's probably the killer reason to upgrade I was also really worried that when I was looking at the stats on paper that the pace Pro would feel like a much bigger watch on the wrist than the pace 3 but that isn't the case at all although it is quite a bit thicker in in terms of the stats actually the way it sits on the wrist makes it feel pretty similar in thickness to the PACE 3 for me and it's still really lightweight and the fact that it's a bigger watch is only a benefit because you get that bigger screen I'd say it still feels really small and lightweight on the wrist Pace 3 feels a bit smaller but the thickness is the big thing for me and actually doesn't feel thicker to me the pce pro so I would say the design is a big upgrade all around you could say that if you've never used an AMOLED watch and if you never do use one you're not going to miss it at all so you could just get the pace three and never even try an ed watch then that wouldn't be a terrible idea because it is pretty you know still a pretty nice screen but certainly if you do use them both side by side or try the pce pro you will miss it I think if you go for the memory and pixel screen afterwards then battery life side by side has been quite interesting they've be lasting pretty much the same amount of time so in general if I'm running every single day uh you know fairly heavy use with the screen always on the chorus Pace Pro will last me five or 6 days that's more like six or seven days on the chorus Pace 3 however the battery life during workouts is better on the chorus Pace Pro so the more you train the kind of the closer in battery life these two watches will be so over the past 5 days I've warned them both having charged them both to 100% at this point the past three is down to 34% and the chus pace Pro is down to 23% so it's dropped off a little bit more after the run today they might be slightly closer in battery life again so but you are getting you know overall quite similar results and you always have the option to turn the raise to wake feature on on the pace Pro which I think would push it past the pace 3 so even though it's an AMOLED watch I think actually it battery life is probably a little bit better in practice because you really want that longlasting General watch mode you can go to race to wake and then during activities it does Outlast the past three quite considerably in jaw band or the all systems on GPS mode so that's another reason I would look at the pace Pro surprisingly the AMOLED watch the battery life is really good on it and then the maps are certainly a bonus so there are times when they're really useful and for most the time they're not that useful so like if I'm just running around the streets that have near my house I don't really need maps to navigate or anything like that and the breadcrumb line and point of navigation you get on the pace stre is good enough to get you places but when I went to a trip to Paris recently you know the maps on the pace Pro were a really big benefit to make it easier to navigate you know those very tricky streets you get in Paris and the same would be if you're someone who's regularly doing a lot of trail running I'm heading up to Scotland over Christmas will map out some nice trailer runs and having the full maps on the pace Pro is an upgrade it's not one that would be an absolutely key one for me to make me upgrade over the pace 3 but for some people it certainly will be so overall it's a pretty big step up in price but I do think the pace Pro is worth it just cuz of that screen especially if it's a watch you're going to wear all the time it's just a more enjoyable watch to have on like even now the the Christmas screen I have on it is better than the one on the pce 3 and it it makes me happy to see that all the time and while it is a fairly big jump in price I think you are getting you know an equivalent jump in the quality of the watch because of that screen and then the bonus like the maps and then the faster processor and extra storage I think will make it a little bit more future proof in terms of corus's software updates as well that said if you're just looking for a watch to wear during workouts only pce 3 will do that job really well and you can take it off and put on I know a dress watch or a smart watch or something outside that then the P3 will be the one to go for because it is so much cheaper and if you're just not fussed about the am display then I would get the past3 because the other upgrades on the pace Pro you know are good they're useful especially the maps but they're not enough to make me pay that extra amount of cash for the pace Pro pace3 is such a good watch still so yeah it's really whether you really want that AMOLED watch and you plan to use all the time in which case I do think the pce pro is worth the extra and that is the one I'd [Music] get that's our comparison of the coros pace Pro and the

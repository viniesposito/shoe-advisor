  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Robbie with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and you're back for a funfilled packed podcast holiday Christmas Hanukkah why is there a c in front of Hanukkah you can spell it two ways why I don't I that to me is they don't do they don't do good branding some people say Hanukkah some people say chanuka they still say Hanukkah but there's a silent sea I I well no like cha chica wait there's oh I just I assumed it was a silent sea Hanah it's probably something like that but that they really they got bad branding which is strange because typically yeah you know yeah we need w foot Jarrett to come on the show and give his Jarrett wife B and give his uh full indepth history it'll take eight days though yeah oh if you're out there getting ready to celebrate Hanukkah you know congrats yeah when does it's probably starting one of these days no I Googled it um it starts on Christmas oh is that like Passover you never know when it starts exactly it's on a different calendar right sorry for being so ignorant about this stuff but you know how it is yeah we we never claim ourselves to be the most educated bunch in the world no but you know that Google released this chip that says that there is actually a Multiverse Oh I thought that you going to say there's a Hanukkah two things a different day two things that blew my mind well multiverses Christmas and anuka that's two different true verses and they have different calendar so I going they should call they should make a holiday called chronica that's probably exists in certain circles I would believe Snoop Dog celebrates Chron Dr Dre and Snoop dogs um yeah but with the multi verse that one blew my mind with this new chip that Google has okay so what do you I don't understand you got to explain a little bit more the chip is existence in itself points at having a Multiverse because the only chip that would do the same work right now that we have would take a trillion years to do it oh I have heard about this so that this chip is actually they're saying has to be accessing multiverses to oh because computational power it almost like breaks the laws of physics or whatever exactly and the other one that blew my mind was this guy was talking about space travel and speed of light and we could get to it would take about I I think he said like it was like some ridiculous short period of time to get to the next closest galaxy uhhuh he said and to get back if you could travel at near the speed of light uhhuh he goes the only problem is you wouldn't be able to tell anybody about because by the time you got back it'd be four million years later on Earth man hold on I'm breaking my head I know I was just thinking about chips the only kind of chips that probably I was thinking more Kettle Kettle Coke or something that's some Kettle Coke chips feel like I'm in a Multiverse depending on the flavor yeah I also think that Megan time travels cuz when she runs a marathon it's about an hour faster than us and by the time we're done that's actually she's already had cocktails yeah there's definitely some time travel going on there yeah Thomas also everything he sees on Instagram now I mean there's no reason not to what what have I been wrong about so this week he sent me a real and it said it was Deep Creek Maryland uhhuh and it was Lake Co no I haven't been to Deep Creek in a while maybe it looks like Lake l in Italy it wasn't you you can't prove where it was no it was 100% from Italy and he sends it to me as if like cuz he's always looking like real estate like places where we could get like a cool like Lake Shore home or some place where we could go to to vacay and so I think the intent was to be like look how great Deep Creek is and I was like possibly it took me 15 seconds to realize that was in fact not Deep Creek oh wow and he was like yeah look at how great this could be look I also spend I don't do like in depth when I'm going through Instagram I scrolling I see something a that's cool send that yeah it's not like I go let me read the entire thing and see the fine print and maybe Lake like Deep Creek is the Lake Como no the person who posted it was trying to make everyone believe that that was deep like I don't know what people are doing on Instagram just posting I've seen these um I've seen these before I don't know if in Instagram by the way Deep Creek is man-made lake in Western Marland okay fun fact there's no natural lakes in Maryland at all yeah there's just reservoirs and I don't know Army projects but the I've seen this though people will post there's a lot of AI Genera stuff and it's like the Grand Canyon of uh Pennsylvania not like not even what it looks like there is this quote unquote Grand Canyon Pennsylvania that's a real thing but is it Grand actually it actually is pretty grand for p by Pennsylvania standards but uh but I'm like what what's the point of this I don't even understand the engagement part of it why do you need why you like what is like what brand deals are they getting from that wait I think that you guys like why do you immediately go to Brand deals well what are what are you doing I think there's all kinds of reasons for these bots on Instagram they build up a giant following then they sell the account to someone you think that's what's going on I think that's one of them I know that they do what they do is they'll try to build up a huge audience quickly yeah and they use all the little techniques and then they go to a business and you can change the name so then you buy it and you look like you have you know 50 to 200,000 followers and you're like boom I was talk did we talk about this on another episode about how I think we did but how if a real goes viral now yeah we talked about that it doesn't get any you said it doesn't necessarily do anything for the account yeah and on that but remember when it actually did like you would if someone had a viral post or real they would end up getting like 50,000 followers from it that I mean I look at like the hakua phen phenomenon yeah that happened this past summer yeah that Arc used to be like you had like six months right of it being funny and let's t-shirts and yeah all sorts of stuff now I really feel like you have like three to four weeks and it's gone yeah and then yeah but she got like a podcast stuff yeah that it was horrible of course I don't already done I think so and then she did a meme coin that she might go to jail for at this point okay do you think that she actually knew what she was doing like do or do you think someone said hey let's do a Bitcoin and probably not or a blockchain coin and I don't think but I don't know if that absolves you from the potential uh whatever violation SEC violations from yeah cashing out on it immediately after it spikes yeah I don't know um it I think I don't know how hard that stuff is to prove I will tell you that Bitcoin man it hit another high it did it yeah I haven't really been paying attention a bit you don't want to if you're not in it you get mad was it 110 like I think it hit like2 or something or that's all right yeah but whatever anyways um yeah for those of you not in the super power computational chips what do you call Quantum Computing yeah Instagram reels and crypto yeah imagine imagine jumping into this running podcast and you're just like what is happening anyone listening to this knows there's minimal running content these days I don't know if anyone there's tons of running content there's definitely has to be a number of people each week who come into this new new yeah thinking it's a running podcast which it is we'll get into that in two hours from now it's it's a like what can we relate it to that something that's like like this um like our universe is running but we're also going to talk about about the other stuff in the universe yeah I don't know like a some sort of barnab and Bailey freak Show it's still a circus they have tigers and lions but then off to the side it would be more like that if Megan had your mustache yeah you should try you should get one I don't think that's how it works I mean I don't I I've been I've known Megan for several years now I think over we're well over 10 years now and uh I've never seen her with a mustache well she digs into Carl's T stash uh creepy Carl creepy Carl oh guys don't make it stick creepy creepy Carl's not creepy he said he was he's a little creepy do you watch his stories um I love his stories yeah like I feel like I'm getting a look like it's like a little window opens up in car Carl's head and you get to see what's going on in there it's all through the lens of a binocular yeah binoculars from if there was apartment word for emo that started with K I would be calling him Kemo Cho I don't think you want to call him that that's not going to work no we need we need a word for emo off The Rocker Carl's been running though yeah I know I heard I heard there's been sighting Sasquatch sightings of Carl out there the grer films yeah yeah so was the Bruder the one who filmed from the null no the guy was on the null the grassy null the grassy null is where they think shots were fired from but the the camera was the one that captured like the Kennedy getting shot right that's the film yeah did you um speaking of which I was watching a thing when Trump was getting assassinate and I don't know if this one's a fake and me says I believe everything on Instagram you just said when Trump was assassinated so I'm thinking that's fake no attempted ass there's a woman sitting right behind him oh gosh who doesn't she doesn't Flinch she doesn't move she like holds up a sign then puts it down and nods and then the fire goes off and she doesn't move and then she just kind of smirks when everything that's going on and it's in the video and I'm like dude yeah I just I just think people react to things differently well yeah I don't know that one I'm starting to think I mean I don't know that the whole thing's insane so I don't I mean yeah I don't trust anything from anyone anyways and talk about surreal they showed a box at like the Army Navy and it was Trump Elon Musk uh like several other guys and you're just like looking in that box you're like there the weirdest group of people it's a weird time yeah I mean if there's any Multiverse we're living we're living in one of them the chip is proving it yeah um before we get off the subject of Christmas and holidays do you have some updates on new movies that we have watched oh okay if you want to hear about them I would like to hear about them you were there uhhuh well kind of um okay Operation Christmas drop oh yeah I've heard of this one before four out of 10 Stars really bad yeah not good not good it was really bad I couldn't tell you any of the actors in it um it was about I don't even really understand the plot and I watch the plot was that they're have to close down the military is making cuts and they want to close down a base and this one base went viral for dropping Christmas presents to um to like Islands out in the Pacific and they where they at bombs this guy this guy is wasting Resources by doing Christmas present drops on these islands and so they send out a rep an attractive rep uhhuh from the mil from the government okay one of the congresswoman's Reps and she goes out there and you make this sound better than it is she meets the guy and he's like debonaire and you know like no he looks like a Kendall like little cocky and so you think oh he's just a a-hole and then no you find out he's got a heart of gold oh okay and that what he's doing is he's helping people and he's doing it all through donations and stuff so it's not wasting the military uh money this sounds like a propaganda film but okay she falls in love with him the congresswoman comes out to spoil Christmas and be like you're close down oh and she gets a Christmas spirit as well and everything is great so it's kind of like uh what accent just happened I think that's my Christmas it's kind of like SpongeBob but instead of Bikini Bottom it's like the bikini at to they're like on top they're on land so Squidward is the uh is the one who wants to ruin Christmas SpongeBob no crusty Krabs wants to cut prices ah okay or expenses they're using too much fresh crab in the Krabby Patty okay this makes more sense now thank you for that's quid where it's like oh go check it out I think that's the accident you were going for yeah whe unintentionally SpongeBob okay that's not bad actually don't do anymore just stop that was perfect I I think the key to doing accents is doing one word and then no one can tell that was I had a friend who did James Bond she could do Bolt the door before you leave or something that might be too long yeah yeah too many words okay two other movies a sudden case of Christmas it had Danny deito in it didn't even finish it it was very boring not sure what happened like he got Co but it was Christmas Co no the parents were getting divorced and they were going to tell her in Italy is in it will will will yeah hold on the parents are getting divorced and then what they went to Italy where her dad lives to tell the daughter that they were getting separated and then she decided she wanted to have one last Christmas together but it was August so they decided to have Christmas in August okay first off the girl likes Greta thornberg so the little child is a big Greta thornberg fan oh like the the climate person yes oh okay sorry that's part of the plot that's she mentioned her in the movie Weir um and then from then on I just was like oh you little brat and she's she's uh she she's going she's going to visit her throwing pain on all the on the paintings the mum basically yeah she's you know that she's decided that she's going to have Christmas CU her parents are splitting up and it's summertime but who cares yeah that's entitlement if I heard it it's like you said the whole whole time I'm like this little brat um and then you can't have Christmas in August you maybe can do it in July because that's like a funny haha thing but August there's no way yeah no and her summer boyfriend that she visits when I hate this no he had a summer girlfriend she winter yeah was a whole thing she was like that was a thing and was like reverse cuffing yeah is that the deal yeah and is that Carl do you know that's true okay cuffing Carl oh he likes that actually that could be a band name that's like um yeah speaking of Christmas trees he just lit up yeah um um anyway yeah that one Danny deito couldn't save it which crazy but Vilma wi dama Wilmer vama that's it he's in it he's the dad added nothing okay yeah he hasn't done he must have just been there for the paycheck or something he was just like okay and then the final the final movie I'm guessing the parents got back together if we had watched it to the end yeah 100% it's a Christmas movie um the final one we saw was called nut crackers and it's a Ben Stiller and it is not at all what I was expecting it's about um four orphaned boys their parents are killed in a car crash and Ben Stiller is the brother of the mom who had the four boys and he's like this businessman that lives in Chicago and they were like in the suburbs of nowhere land no they weren't in the sub they're in the country in the country they're basically feral children so the parents were educating the kids at home their homeschooling these kids they're like homee all the boys have long hair like they all look like Bad News Bears like he shows up to the house and they're like on the roof and like ones in a costume like kind of creepy there's pigs in the house oh yeah oh it actually did sound like your podcast earlier this week I was like I was like that actually sounds pretty cool Min is the trash yeah uh it was it was it was pretty dark humor um it was a nice message at the end but yeah I don't know I didn't get to the end I don't think of that one either okay you fell asleep I don't know did I I think so oh jeez all right so that was Nutcracker nutcrackers yeah oh okay yeah we did watch Home Alone though yeah classic yeah I mean it's I def we watched that last week I think it's the best it's my favorite Christmas movie even the second one isn't a bad sequel like it's it's pretty pretty solid sequel It's the third one that was really bad yeah yeah but we um we finished I pretty much finished the uh Home Alone Lego set oh you did yeah finished it does it do stuff like does it have like little it's honestly incredible traps and stuff like that yeah it's incredible okay like the detail is you should do a little unreal you should do a little real I thought about it it's like going to take me too long but they so they have the the traps that they have are the paint can swinging down the steps I like that they have the they have a little thing that pushes a sled him riding the sled down the steps out the door they have the iron they have uh two levels where you drop the iron down the laundry shoot like that um the does marf get can you spin his head around has a red yeah can yep and uh and then he has in the basement they have that like stove or whatever the wood stove that if lift it up it has a light up brick that glows nice then the they have a Michael Jordan and a like record player that if you turn on a thing it spins both of them is it actually Michael Jordan yeah it's a they don't it doesn't say Bulls it says like bricks but it has 23 yeah and then um they have the treehouse with the zipline very good and did this make you wish you could shrink down to Lego size and play around yeah it's a it's oh and then they have uh inzz room they have shelves that collapse ni if you pull lever it it does it has the spider for that goes on Marv and the like it has a oh sorry yeah but it's not in the aquarium so it has a tarantula um but it's like on the wall near the staircase going up to the attic it's pretty awes like it's the detail is incredible um so I was pretty pleased with that and then you can get like a light up you can get lights for it and it it's not through Lego but third party makes a whole lighting system that you can intricately put into like every room and stuff so I haven't done that yet but I did get it I will say I've never been disappointed with a Lego Product yeah they they know what they're doing it's a good it's good stuff uh speaking of Nutcrackers though I and uh I feel like they've been jawser sizing pretty much since the beginning of time nutcrackers know what's up so are you a a I went to check in on the Jaws are sizing are you still I've been a little laxed lately uh but I keep thinking I got to do it did you listen to that to the episode of search engine that had the talked about the jaw maxing stuff yeah I never knew that that was like a thing in the that people did in uh like other not subreddits or something like I didn't know it was like a trend I didn't know it was J it's crazy but I did it was funny because I was talking to someone who was I talking to he was he he had oh was it was somebody messaged me through Instagram and he was having work done at his house uhuh and the guy that was doing the work was like hey have you ever heard of jazer size and he's like yeah he goes That's my son his son no way the creator of jaer side so he told him about the podcast oh wow that's wild so yeah all right first checkin it's the holiday season so shouldn't we be grateful for something like I don't know what you're grateful for I don't even

Robbie at the gym two times and our gym is not like and not exercising like demons and stuff like well maybe like spin head spinning around puking actually sometimes I feel like that but it's not like it's not like when I think of a gym normally I think of like a merit or like that one where it's like social and people are walking around talking to each other and this is not that kind of this is more like what I would imagine like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 70s yeah like it's just iron and bars and like racks and stuff like that yeah there's no it's not pretty at all yeah I love it cuz I was thinking about this I like the the setting of a gym that's just kind of bones and work and not I was like if I had this equipment at home I would never do anything but I feel like when you're in a space that lends to that do you think it feels it kind of feels like a car garage like a uh like you would go there to get your car fixed yeah it's yeah it's an old Warehouse kind of space that has if you've ever been to any of our grit parties we've gone or grit parties what else do we do at Mobtown and just party parties Mobtown Mobtown Brewing it's a same building basically just further down and uh so like how many people are in the gym when you're in there uh like four that's it cuz we go a little bit earlier I think later if you're there at 6:00 p.m.",

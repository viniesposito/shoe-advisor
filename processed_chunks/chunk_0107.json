  "text": "[Music] do you ever wake up and just ask yourself why does that hurt I don't there's no reason that should hurt but it does oh man not getting any younger but we're still we're still trucking still trucking in life Trucking on YouTube a little bit little bit all right let's go find an oval in college we used to jog 3 miles holding our spikes in our hands from the uh campus down to the track pottsfield and uh now my closest track is 6 miles that's open right now during the school year so thank you camel back for the uh vest brand new vest from cam Beck it's nice it's feeling good appreciate the uh send in the gear but the spikes are in the back for the track now I'm not I'm not giving up on my 2024 running goals trust me despite having to take basically 2 and 1/2 months off of serious training I was still running but not very much wasn't going to the gym just because of Life circumstances you know everyone's okay family's healthy and happy but life popped up and I just had to I had to focus on some other priorities in life as the bottom line so but we're back I'm back to training at the volume I like to train at and I haven't forgotten about the goals and actually it's crazy though I said this late December 2023 uh two years ago I was at 4100 miles last year I was at 3900 I do believe with the sacrum stress fracture so I'm right in the ballpark again we'll come back to the mileage and vertical or the mileage in vertical here in a minute and last goal for 2023 34 340,000 vertical feet um I'm ending up 9,000 ft short and I might as well talk about this right now for these mileage and vertical goals that I have every year it's just ranges okay it's fun to chase it's fun to keep yourself accountable to overall goals for the year but but I'm not going to go out and run 9,000 vertical feet between now and the New Year's just to hit that goal and risk I'll just say it like injury or like don't H just be careful with if you do have big goals like that um be accountable to them but don't if you get behind or if you get a little niggle and you need to take a week off don't feel like you should try and make that up I mean I I called it sometimes life happens and you just got to pull back a little bit but you don't give up on your bigger long-term goals and projections in the running space and life but in the running space specifically in that video uh so now in the present uh the birthday mile yes I want to I I can't believe frankly that I ran 438 here's some footage from the 438 shout out to Steve for filming that was I think it was almost 4 years ago I can't remember maybe 3 years ago actually and I ran 438 at a track and so I want to PR my birthday Mile and it's coming up so that is what and you know what's interesting I came up with this idea the birthday mile you know four or five years ago just kind of for fun but now I'm realizing and everyone in DJ a lot of people in dgr do a birthday mile where you go to you preferably a track you run as fast as you can for one mile and what's nice is that every year it's a little bit of a challenge to make sure not only are you getting in your long runs but you're also getting a little bit of turnover in your workout as well which is why we're at the track today introductory workout I do this workout every uh every time I'm introducing speed into my training 300 meter repeats on the track nothing crazy fast not all out it's basically a long stride a little faster than a long stride 8 to 12 I'll probably I'll probably do eight we'll see the legs are a little tired from the long run on uh Monday uh so anyway that's what we're up to oh yeah question of the day we're through q1 2024 how are you doing on your goals for this year uh most of my goals will transpire after June after July you know the fktsgi so let's let's get laced up start to get a little turnover over going cuz the it's nice like the fitness is coming back it does come back you all know that if you're consistent uh over the long haul you might have to take a little time off like I did but over the long haul you will return well that was fun little 8X 300 nothing crazy all right 55 seconds it just nice and easy uh got a little turnover going felt good again getting ready for that birthday mile but but uh oh yeah the sled don't do the sled if you're a track runner if you're getting ready for short distances the only reason I pushed that sled whether it's in the gym or at the field here is for uphill Mountain running I think because of the form that you're actually using as you're pushing that sled it's very similar to running up steep mountains like it's short steps powerful steps all right so that's why I use the sled it's not it's not for track runners out there just wanted to clarify that all right goal number one for 2024 is to uh was mobility and core I've been working pretty good on the core lately got to still focus on the mobility uh but the kettle bells have been my friend in the gym let's go get it [Music] [Music] and we're back 16 miles on the day not too shabby all right here we go the I don't even know where to begin with this one um the most obscure strange unique um just bizarre almost running injury that I think I've ever had in my life all right and yes could potentially uh include surgery to resolve this issue uh I'll just say it's a uh any optometrist out there all right aium is that am I saying that right Surfers ey all right let me just look at this here uh it says also known as Surfers ey is a raised wedg shaped growth of the conjuctiva that extends onto the cornea basically I have this this growth on my eyeball and it doesn't hurt uh it doesn't obstruct my eyesight at this point but it is something that I have to be aware of watch and potentially have surgery for because it they really don't they don't go away and it can expand and eventually it could grow to the point where it is obstructing your view obviously you don't want it to get to that point uh based on the research I've done though you can get the surgery and it can grow back so that's not good and the optometrist is like what do you do for work what are you doing out there why do you have this growing on your eyeball and I simply said well I'm a runner and specifically I like running up in the mountains a lot in the summertime and so what causes s I'm going to call it surf Surfers ey that's the nickname um Sun wind and dust all right it's like those are the three recipes for what I do like that's exactly what is happening when I run above 12,000 ft it's very sunny very it can be very windy and yes it can be a little Dusty at times out there on the it's like so the the op the doctor uh the optometrist said uh that's exact that's it that has to be why this is happening so it is a running injury uh because it's caused that's what she said like it's it's definitely going to be caused by your running and that's why this this topic is coming up because over on straa I'm getting a lot of questions about Seth what in the world are you doing wearing these goggles well now you know all right these are high-grade Goggles meaning it blocks more the Sun but also the main thing the doctor said is you want to try to keep your eyes out of really windy situations all right so I think they're actually working as far like they as far as keeping the wind out and the dust um will I be able to wear them all summer long through the summer heat I don't know but they've been really awesome to wear uh through the winter and early spring months here in Colorado where yes we do get a lot of wind so that is my running injury that is might requ it well I I'm going to get a second opinion just to make sure uh what the best course of action is but it's like you know what do you it's like it's not going to stop me from running at this point but it is something I just need to monitor so I love you all thanks for tuning in to uh a little a little baby track session A Little Gym work and then of course this uh this running injury all right there it is oh Deli oh Deli it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt just looks kind of eh not so great all right onward and upward we will uh pass it to the maybe the running injury playlist or something like that right there all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

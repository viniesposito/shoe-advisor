  "text": "hello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the choros pace [Music] Pro the pace Pro is a new watch from choros it is their first watch with an AMOLED display it sits in the range above the choros pace 3 which is the entry level watch which has a memory and pixel display take some cues from the design of that watch of course having the aim of keeping the watch very lightweight whilst upgrading some of the features on it it cost \u00a3349 or $349 and it comes in three colors black gray and blue with a silicon band and they're also matching nylon bands which you can buy which cost \u00a329 or dollar it has a 46 mm case and it's 14 mm thick despite the fact it is a fair bit bigger than the chorus pce 3 it's still a very lightweight watch it's 37 G with its nylon band or 49 G if you Ed the Silicon band as mentioned this is chorus's First Watch with an AMOLED display it's a 1.3 in screen and it's 1500 knits of brightness you still got two buttons same design as you have with the choros pace 3 the top button is a digital dial that is now made of stainless steel so it can take ECG measurements the watch has a waterproof rating of 58m has dual band GPS with a new improved chipset and configuration to in theory improve accuracy got the same heart rate sensor as other corus watches but corus design means it now sits more snugly against the wrist and can be more accurate as a result then you've got the other usual sensors under the hood like an altimeter and a pulse oximeter and you have an upgraded processor which corus is their fastest one yet which improve certain actions in particular like zooming in and out of maps got 32 GB of storage on the watch which is a big jump on something like the pace 3 you can use that to add offline maps to the watch to use during activities or to store music uh the music feature is still pretty limited though it's just for drag and drop files rather than linking up to streaming services coros pce pro has a similar looking charging port to other coros watches but it's set a bit deeper so you can't actually use other choros chargers with the watch instead of getting a cable proprietary cable you get an adapter which you can use with a USBC cable which also is a little keychain a very neat little system if you don't have a USBC cable which most of us do have if you don't have one of those chorus will send you one though battery life is obviously a little bit shorter than some chorus watches given that you've got an houred screen but it is still pretty long it's listed as 20 days or 6 days if you're using the always on screen and then when it comes to activities chorus only offers all systems on or dual band GPS you can't use a less accurate GPS only mode but the battery life is still pretty strong with those more accurate settings you get 31 hours of dual band or 24 hours if you're using the A on screen and 38 hours of all systems GPS 28 hours with the A on screen those numbers will be cut in half or drop even further if you're also using the music playback on the [Music] watch so start off with the good stuff on the chus PST Pro and I will start with the design and I would say that you know I'm one of those people that actually really loves the look of the cars p 3 I love the fact it's kind of this lightweight dinky watch um it is you know comes in a mixture different colors as well too and I think you know just is a little bit more fun to wear and I think the carus Pace Pro the design language is very much in keeping with the pace for you obviously you're getting a bigger case design you are still getting the option of a silicon or a nylon strap I've had it with the Silicon strap and I think I preferably would want it with a nylon strap I'd prefer with a nylon strap but I think you know generally it's been comfortable to wear it's been fine but I think you know I think it's a better match with that n strap and that's kind of what I've liked using the pace three um or matching it up with the pace three the nylon strap obviously the headline story here is the amlo display it's the first am display on a crosswatch and it is a very good one you know this is from someone that has tested a lot of am watches smart watches and sports watches and this is very much in keeping with the best I've tested particularly around this kind of mid-range price point you know it is it has all the qualities of a good Amo display those kind of Rich deep blacks the colors are very good it's very vibrant you know the brightness is very good as well here I think that's something I've really noticed up against other kind of um watches around this price I think another thing that kind of feeds into to that is also that the interface you know obviously having an amay we've seen this other watches as well you know from Garmin and you know particularly polar and suto where they have those AMOLED displays and they have to re maybe think about how that kind of Osa interface kind of really sits on the watches and I think in terms of you're getting here on the choros watch maybe isn't sophisticated and slick as some of the other watches I've mentioned but I think it kind of fills the screen a lot nicer it feels a lot you know better optimized to this AMOLED display and I think that's crucially what you you really want to see you want to be able to look at that screen and feel like that data belongs or those screens and those menus just you know really belong at that am dis spay that's kind of what I found my time with the carus paace pro I think the other thing for me is performance now I think performance is something that is generally overlooks I think I'm talking about not just the kind of tracking performance but also the software performance and what it's like to interact and kind of move around screens and I think for me the cor paace Pro really kind of impressed me on that front I think particularly when I've you know you know recently used the sunto race s and the race the polar V M3 which I think generally are fine to kind of get around on those watches but I just think it's a step above on the pce pro in terms of interacting it's just a little bit Slicker just feels a little bit nicer and smoother I think the place I've most noticed it has been in the mapping support where I think it's even better some more expensive watches where you know you're kind of just scrolling through Maps or getting around a section of a map it just refreshes a lot quicker it just feels a lot nicer to use those features so I think performance is a really important one that you know really kind of stood out for me in my time with a pace Pro I think from a r tracking point of view I think the GPS performance has been very good for me I think you know we've seen that dual frequency support kind of spread across the chorus range it's been good in places not so good in other places I feel like this is a good example of that GPS performance and I've used it against other um dual band watches from Garmin cinto Polo the Apple watch as well too and for me it kind of stands you know up you know in those kind of good uh versions examples of that dual frequency GPS and I think the other thing for me and I think the crucial one for me is that battery life performance with that AMOLED display and that's the big story here you know corus has really kind of delivered really strong battery life with its other watches in standby mode particularly and then also kind of really pushing the GPS battery numbers as well and I think the performance on the pace Bo is very good I think up against the other mid-range watches that sit around it it performs very very well and I think that's even when you're using the always on display mode when you're using race to wake as well too and I've used a mixture in my testing and I found in both scenarios the battery life has been very good and I've used some of my testing has been against the polar Vantage M3 well I've had that as well and I've definitely found it's performed better for me uh from a battery point of view um compared to the M3 but all a lot of good positives for me with the carus pace Pro a lot to like here on corus's First multisports Watch with an AMOLED display so my likes with the pace Pro start with the screen I do prefer having AMOLED screens on my watches now definitely made that transition with my sports watches and as much as I've liked chorus watches in the past I would always prefer to have an AMOLED watch as my daily driver and you now have an AMOLED screen and it's a really nice one it's really bright in all conditions it's clear to read yeah corus has done a good job here and it's a big upgrade in particular with chorus because their memory and pixel displays aren't really the brightest of any Brands so yeah like the screen a lot I like the design a lot in general actually like I was a bit worried when we saw the kind of specs and it might be a fair bit bigger and bulkier than the choros pace 3 and while it is a little bit bigger it's not at all bulky it's still a really lightweight watch feels really thin on the wrist feels very you know unnoticeable to wear throughout the day and all around I really like design like I know it's not necessarily the classist design people might prefer the metal watches you get further up the choros range or of other brands but I like an all plastic watch like this I think it's a good design I like watches like the 265 and the 4965 as well and yeah I think it's a good looking watch and one I've enjoyed wearing I would definitely use a nylon strap though got the Silicon one on here now and a nylon straps just lighter and much more comfortable accuracy has also been really good for me so the GPS accuracy you know I've been using this watch same time as 4 and a 965 265 I've used it for lots of Hard workouts during marathon training you know pacing myself fire the watch I've also done a twisty 10K in Paris City Center and the GPS accuracy has always been you know really good you know matching or outperforming other watches very happy to rely on it for all the pacing during my workouts so don't have any concerns GPS ACC I think it's you know right up there it's dual band GPS and it's as good as you're getting from other brands for sure and when I mention pacing I know some people have a thing with chorus that the instant Pace isn't very good like it's laggy to respond now I don't really use instant Pace very much because I find that with all watches like I use lap pace and kind of pace myself over the course of a rep I find that much more reliable but did look at the instant Pace on the watch comparing it to the 265 during a couple of runs you know doing sprints to see how quickly the pace changed and seemed comparable and how fast it changed so yeah I would say the pacing is fine for me with the pace Pro and it's yeah it's been very good on GPS accuracy heart accuracy I say has also been good like not perfect some troubles at the start of runs and sometimes the end of runs especially as the weather's got colder towards the end of my testing but for the most part most of my workouts have looked down and and it's been the same as the reading from an arm strap I'm looking at on another watch or you know comparable enough and you pretty usable like I probably would link a chest strap or an armband myself for the ultimate accuracy especially during the winter months but the heart ratea sensor on this and the way it fits against the wrist has been pretty good and I think given that I'm not huge fan of optical heart rate in general I would say this is probably just slightly above average you know pretty good all round you could use it I probably would still link a chest rat but has been fine throughout my testing the maps are definitely a plus point on this watch that's now becoming a standard feature in this area with polar sunto and chorus all offering mid-range watches with maps that Garmin don't like I I was in Paris for that 10K and I did a long run on the Friday before that and used the maps on the watch to guide myself around the city and yeah it's always great having Maps I think they're really quick to download and easy to get onto the watch via the app as well like to the point where the first time I put them on I was just standing outside my house you I still had my Wi-Fi on my phone and managed to download them apps to the watch really quickly and last life for me is the battery life so it's obviously a pretty small watch of an AMOLED screen but I've still been getting five or six days out of use with it pretty reliably during my kind of normal heavy use so that's running Every Day always on screen enabled you know that kind of thing I've also so set the heart rate tracking to be continuous rather than the standard Coral setting which is every 10 minutes which obviously extends the battery life outside of workouts that is and even then I'm getting plenty of use out of it at the moment I'm not running the last few days I've sprayed my ankle a little bit so it's it's lasting even better it's going to hit probably over seven days I think even with the yours on screen on which is you know better than chorus even says but you know with running involved and stuff like that you're still looking at five or six days which I think is probably the longest of the kind of mid-range AMOLED watches that certainly outlasted the Garmin 4 a 265 during my testing I think it's also Al bit longer than sunto race s and polar Vantage M3 lasted me they might have you know equal or better single activity battery life but in terms of day-to-day use the B has been pretty good for an Amed watch I've been using the coros pace Pro for just short of a month in testing I put it up against some similarly priced and spec Rivals including the polar Vantage gem 3 the sunto race s titanium but I also benchmarked it against the much pricier Garmin Phoenix 8 AMOLED and used the Garmin HRM Pro chest strap and the polar h10 for my heart rate accuracy tests now before we get into the pros and cons i' got a quick word on the design the big headline here obviously is the arrival of the AMOLED screen that's bigger and brighter than the choros pace 3 screen it gives you a bit more real estate over the pace 3 as well for not much extra weight on the wrist that's a thumbs up now like all AMOLED that punched up color and brightness brings your stats to life really nicely and the offline maps also are more vibrant it's been interesting using this side by side with the polar vage G3 as well and to my eyes I think the choros screen doesn't seem quite as sharp as the polar or indeed the Phoenix 8 it's not a huge difference and I found the screen easy to read in all lights but it's just not quite as crisp the other note on design aside from the lovely screen is that this is a basic looking watch it's not that far away from the past through in terms of the materials I think they kind of feel cheaper than the sunto races and the polance gem 3 the strap the casing the bezel even the crown it just feels a bit plastic it's not unlike the pace 3 and there are benefits to this in that it does make it light on the wrist overall the cir comtable watch to wear and I definitely swap the silicone strap though for a nylon one to boost that Comfort but overall it has a pace three style lightness to it that's comfortable for 24/7 wear now the processor is supposed to be two times faster than the P3 as well and so far I found the touchscreen responsive in the navigation on the watch Snappy enough I also like that the touchscreen gives you a little haptic feedback too into the things that I found positive then with the battery life is always a priority for me and I'm really happy to see choros delivering an AMOLED with enough single activity m Max accuracy GPS battery life to tackle Ultra distances potentially even multi-day adventures with always on screen off the brightness seted normal the average burn had choros trademark stinginess a 1H hour run using all systems burn 2% a 2hour run in all systems burn 6% a 1H hour run with a Max accuracy dual frequency mode burn 2% my daytime burn without any training was just 2% while the average overnight burn was just 2% as well I got 17 days General usage with 7 and 1/2 hours of GPS training and 1 hours heart rate cardio that battery burn Rose by about 30% when I switched on the always on but I didn't find I really needed to I think the raise to wake on this is responsive enough that you can get away without it another big thumbs up here is the inclusion of those color topo maps there a welcome upgrade here on the pace Pro it sets that watch apart from the Garmin 4r a 265 which doesn't offer it plus having that big AMOLED really helps bring those maps and the navigation tools to life you also get root planning here and sync so you have to do the latter manually plus there's turn by turn navigation with off course alerts you're still lacking the really useful climb Pro style feature that serves up useful details on the climbs and descents that you've got left on your route and things like how long it will take you to Summit that Ascent that you're currently on both Po and Garmin offer these on their similarly priced watches but the nav skills here on the choros pace Pro are good for a watch at this price another interesting unique feature here is that you can use corus's extend mode to beam your watch screen to a smartphone to get a better view if you want more yeah easier to view the maps and bits and pieces another thing I've put in the positive pile here is that when it comes to GPS the coros pace Pro Joel frequency perform pretty well for me at least on the overall distances which is the thing that I'm most concerned with on all my runs I had it up against the Garmin Phoenix 8 a lot and it was always within the margin for era against that and the other watches that I tested against if you dig into the tracks more closely like here on this run versus the Phoenix 8 with both is using Max accuracy multiband they both track closely at this level but when you zoom in more closely you can see the chorus Pace pro has some struggles like here on this bridge where it's got me very much not on the bridge but then neither does the Phoenix eight the pace Pro sometimes Cuts Corners like here through an office building and you can see here through a row of shops on this other run up into London it's the same story largely gets the overall distance within 0.2 mies of the Garmin Phoenix 8 but then sometimes has wobbles when you dig closely into to the tracks though in my testing of many many watches I've not found a watch that doesn't have some struggles like this if you look at various different runs and overall I'd say the coral Pace Pro GPS is [Music] solid some things I wasn't so Keen about then starting with the charging adapter this is an interesting Edition corus has changed the size of the charging port so that essentially none of your old cables fit the new watch without having to do some fiddling with a knife so far so bad they also included this little charging adapter that you hook into any USBC Cable in theory it's as good because you can carry a little thing with you and use it anywhere you can find a USBC Cable in practice it's a little bit fiddly these little adapters look very losable and once it's gone you're going to have to pay 20 bucks for a new one I'm worried I'm going to lose this and then looking at the heart rate performance my experience in testing was a bit mixed for the optical here you can see from the data on a short interval run that while the pace Pro optical does a reasonable job of tracking the chest trap on the steady warm-up Mile and it hits the averages on par with the chest strap and polar it really struggles during the intervals with some big overreaches and spikes on the effort sections at times it was reading at you know 20 beats per minute higher than the Garmin HRM Pro Plus then on a progression run the coros pce pro struggles at the start and then has a few moments where it's reading 5 BPM or so higher or lower than the chest trp but tracks generally well against the h10 across the whole run so it's a bit of a hit and miss job with the optical but that is pretty much Optical performance for you now another thing to note for whatever reason you can only buy the choros pace Pro with the Silicon band with the coros pace 3 when you purchase it you get the option of nylon or silicon but you don't get that here you'll have to pay extra if you want to buy an additional nylon strap I much prefer nylon straps and I'd really appreciate having the option to choose between them at the checkout rather than having to load another one up and more expense okay into the things that I didn't like or maybe a little bit disappointed about my time with the cars Pace Pro and I think the first thing for me I think maybe it was kind of unavoidable thing and that is the price now it is more expensive than the corus pce 3 and what I think we all loved about the corus pace 3 is that it really undercut the competition I think particularly from a Garmin point of view and I think from a value point of view the pace three is largely untouched in terms of you get in performance and features and I think with a pace Pro I think we're were all hoping that maybe it would kind of slightly be in keeping or a little bit closer to the pricing of the pace 3 and ultimately that's not what's quite happened it is more in keeping with other mid-range watches which is you know at least it hasn't jumped too much in price I think the other thing for me I think it's kind of a long running thing with the coros uh kind of Eco system in general and I think ultimately you know it is a work in progress I think from the kind of training point of view I think the user interface point of view and I think that's on and off the watch on and on the watch I think ultimately you know that it's it's pretty good I think in general I kind of like the more kind of simplistic kind of approach there's definitely some Garing elements to the kind of user interface in terms of where things live I think I think for me it's really and this could ultimately be leveled at polar and cinto as well too and probably a lesser degree to Garmin but just the presentation of some of the data that I think is really useful I think from an analysis point of view I think you have to work to kind of find it it I think another thing feeding into that and that kind of whole ecosystem is the Smartwatch experience and now you know applaud cars for trying to improve the Smartwatch experience and it is I think a little bit like polar a little bit reticent to go all in a bit like Garmin has um or you know offer a lot more kind of in Terms that Smartwatch functionality you know you're not getting payments here you're not getting kind of a fully-fledged app kind of ecosystem here as well too they plays a lot of third party apps so yeah just a few things that I think are slightly disappointed my time with the car Pace Pro I haven't you know entirely ruined my experience using this watch is a very good watch but ultimately I think those are things that cars definitely probably know and appreciate they they're still working on and involving improving and making them better features and overall making the watches like the PST better to use dayto day onto my dislikes day and a lot of these are quite small and fairly nitpicking like overall I do really like this watch for sure but the design so one it's not my dislike but I think it will be disliked for some so you can get you know probably slightly more elegant looking watches in this area I do prefer the look of the Garmin 4 a 265 for one the sunto race s has a slightly hardier design with better materials and a polar Vantage M3 you know somewh prefer the look at that watch as well I like all plastic watches like I say so it's not a big negative but for some people wearing a watch all the time they maybe won't want an all plastic watch like this chorus might have to look at AMOLED screens and it's kind of more expensive elegant Apex and vertx watches and another little dislike for me is that you just don't get that much data on your watch face as you can You Can't customize it as much like corus has the set stats it can show on watch faces and I guess this is something to do with stats that can be refreshed you know only occasionally and not affect battery life too much but you can't put like a weather forecast on your watch face and there's no weekly mileage option or anything like that all stats I can get on the Garmin 265 which has a better always on screen as well it shows a lot more information when you've got your wrist down and you can still see it and has a lot more customization options like when you've got an AMOLED screen now I think being able to really push the boat out and customize that watch face I think is important to really enjoy it and you still can't really do that too much with the pace Pro training analysis is also a slightly iffy area for me so it's fine like it's usable for sure you can definitely get a good idea of your short-term and long-term training loads and how your training relates to them and a good idea of your weekly load but chus does a few things that don't feel that intuitive to me sometimes like they have the 7-Day load as the week rather than the past seven days and they give you suggestions about where your training should land in those seven days and those always haven't really felt right to me and I've blown way past them and then even when I do blow way past them and my you know my balance between acute and uh a chronic training load seems really off like I'm at 140 or 150% it's still saying it's okay and it doesn't feel quite as intuitively spot-on to me as the advice and information you get maybe from something like a Garmin watch in particular but you know it's still fine it's still very much usable I don't mind it but sometimes you just you look at it that doesn't feel quite right to me that's the race predictions are the most accurate of any watch brand I've tested like they're very close to the times I've been running with the watch and what I could be running I think in general and the last thing is the music feature and the smart features in general like it's not really got those smart features for sure even things like that watch face customization I was talking about this is an area where Garmin is way ahead and especially the music storage being drag and drop like for me that's almost less useful than the kind of music controls you get on the sunto or the polar and Garmin obviously has full music storage with links to streaming services so this isn't a big area for me and I know lots of people say oh I don't care about smarts but you know people do care about smart features like those and the ones on the chorus watches just aren't up to par with other brands even if it's not something that necessarily concerns me that much it's something to look out for so I think the choros paace pro is an excellent watch it's one that's really delivered on performance for me I like design I like pretty much everything about the watch I think it's a really good option to have in chorus's range at the price that's very much comparable with the other watches in its area like it's probably not a shock that we're all quite positive on this watch we just gave it our joint watch of the Year award at the r tester Awards and yeah like I said it's watch I'll probably keep wearing because I really liked using it and want to keep using it so there are four really good watches in this area I'd say in terms of sport watches AMOLED sports watches there's the chorus paace Pro that gin for 265 the polar Vantage M3 and the sunto race s so they're all at roughly the same price the sunto is a little bit cheaper in the UK the Garmin is more expensive considerably actually but it's usually in sales now to be the same price as the others but let's run through some comparisons of those four so the Garmin 4 a265 is was the watch that stood out in this area for sure and I've been comparing them side by side the pace Pro and the 265 the Gin is more expensive and that is a big deal if you find them with the Garmin at its full price I'll definitely get the pace Pro but in terms of the features they do in comparison the Garmin has a better design better training analysis better smart features for me I like the user interface more and stuff like that I think it's a little bit more customizable all around and just the general experience of using it I think is slightly slightly better corus has better battery life though it has maps and it is considerably cheaper and you know it's still a really nice enjoyable watch to use so at the same price I might still lean towards the 4265 just as someone who's been using G in a long time you I'm very comfortable with their system but I'm pretty much just as happy with the pace Pro and I'll get the pace Pro if there is that price difference there and then I do prefer the pace Pro straight up to the sunto race s polar vage M3 so the sunto races is a really good watch and it is a bit cheap and it's great value it's got a really good design and if you prefer the look at that design which I think lots of people will I look at getting the sun ress I actually prefer the design of the chorus myself because it is that thin lightweight plastic watch I do like that I prefer the chorus user interface I find it just less fiddly and I find easier to use you know Maps workouts just generally navigating the watch just finds all a bit easier on the chorus and I also have found the heart rate actually to be better on the chorus P Pro as well if you're not using an external strap so yeah overall I prefer the chorus myself the sunto but it's definitely one I can see a lot of people preferring to the corus especially if you like the design more in which case I would get the sunto and the polar Vantage M3 is probably my least favorite of these four watches despite still being a really good watch design I find is just quite thick sticks out from the wrist a fair bit again I prefer the feel and look of the chorus myself much prefer the chus user interface find the polar one quite fiddly there's not much customization there it feels a little bit outdated not been updated very much I would say recently can't even have more than four stats on a run screen and just there's a lot of little things that crop up dayto day that just annoy me a little bit with the polar which I don't really get with the choros I also think the choros just has a slight Edge on um GPS accuracy and it was definitely more accurate on the heart rate tracking front than the polar for me so again I tested those two watches the pace Pro and the Vantage M3 side by side and definitely deferred to the choros throughout that testing as the watch I preferred using another option in this area is the Apple Watch series 10 if you want a smarter watch it's got a much nicer design it's obviously got loads of great smart features goodl looking watch pretty good Run Tracker as well but the pce pro is obviously know a better sports watch you've got the buttons there for like taking laps you've got dualband GP s which is more accurate on the GPS accuracy I got from the Apple Watch series 10 you obviously got longer battery life as well so they're slightly different purposes but both good run trackers but definitely the corus pace Pro is better on the running whereas the Apple watch is more of that kind of General really good lifestyle Smartwatch and then comparing it to the corus PACE 3 which is another watch I really like so you know you're paying a fair bit more here for key upgrades for me would probably be that analed display and the maps you get on the cor space Pro and in particular the AMOLED display around like there are some other upgrades like the processor and stuff like that but the one that pretty matters the most day today is the design and that AMOLED screen it's a big upgrade for me for a watch I'm going to wear all the time I want that AMOLED screen I really like it I'm prepared to pay a bit more for it but if you're not too fuss about that the pace 3 is still a really accurate and very good sports watch with a really nice and lightweight small design I'd say if you're worried about the pace Pro being vastly bigger and bulkier on the wrist than the pace 3 which is so small I wouldn't say that felt like the case to me like this felt very lightweight on the wrist it didn't feel like you know much bulkier watch than the pace 3 which I've also tested fairly recently so it really comes down to that choice like there are lots of little upgrades as well as well but overall the ones that would matter to me are that AMOLED screen if you're someone who's use maps a lot obviously that's a really nice feature to have like I use it occasionally and I really like having them when I do but for me mostly it's just I prefer the design for the pace Pro enough and that extra brightness and readability of the screen that I think is worth the upgrade but for lots of people it won't be and you're still getting a great watch with the pace 3 so overall really enjoyed testing the corus pace Pro it's another really strong entry in this very strong area of the market this mid-range area of the market where I think you know you are getting really good value and amazing watches now and of those four watches in there all things being equal the Garment being at its full price I think the pace Pro is the one I'd pick verdict then andus has produced a really good watch here that will definitely go toe-to-toe with the other Rivals at this price it crams in loads of features and track and fire power for the price and there's more than enough you know insight and potential here to cover most Runners needs it lacks some of the smarts and finesse I think that you'll get from watch is like the Garmin 4 a 265 and the software that comes with it but if you're in the market for an AMOLED watch with excellent staying power and boosted navigation skills the pace Pro I think represents really good value the GPS is solid the heart rate performance is pretty much Standard Optical heart rate performance for me but coros has done well to deliver an AMOLED watch while keeping its nose in front of the similarly priced Rivals like the sunto race and the polar Vantage M3 on battery life it is more basic looking than the polar Vantage gem 3 and the sunto race and the Gin 4un 265 you could say it simpler you might even say cheaper looking but you're going to be swapping some looks for the lighter build that you get from the coros pace Pro if you want a lighter build then that's a thumbs up if you want it more premium then maybe a thumbs down but this is corus's best watch to buy if you're looking for a capable sports watch with a great stream long-lasting AMOLED battery life and better navigation if you already own a pace 3 and you're not bothered about the AMOLED screen or the maps then I don't think it's worth upgrading if you're on an Old Apex though it might be worth looking and up against the pace three the pace throw is the more accomplished watch but if you're a newcomer and screen and Maps aren't priorities I'd save yourself some and go for the cars Pace 3 so my take on the cars Pace Pro is that it's probably been one of my favorite new running watches I tested this year and I think if I look at it up against other new mid-range watches that have launched as well then I would say that the overall package on the pace pro has just been a lot nicer for me and I think as a debut AMOLED watch from carus I think there's a lot to like here now is it the perfect watch there's definitely things to work on I think from a kind of corus ecosystem point of view but I definitely do think the good outweigh the bad here on the pace Pro now if you're looking at the pace Pro you looking at the pace 3 they share the same name they've got similar feature sets and you probably think what am I actually paying more for essentially now what really boils down to is that that am display costs a lot more money cost a lot more money to put on watches we've seen it from other watch brands as well and it's the same story here with the pace Pro I think you're getting a little bit more of an upgrade in terms of the support and software you know you look at things like the level of mapping support you're getting breadcrumb now navigation on the pace 3 you're getting full kind of mapping support on the pace Pro and it's really pushing more towards the Apex 2 and Apex 2 Pro watches in car's collection I think for me I think as a kind of day-to-day use um performance just you know just very easy to use and just really likable ultimately I think I've just liked more about the pace Pro from those other watches so I think yeah as a debut AMOLED watch I think there's a lot to like about the pace Pro I think if you are be have been waiting for a chorus watch with Al a display hoping it really retains a lot of the good features from the pace 3 and getting some of those features from those more expensive chorus watches then I think that's ultimately what you'll getting here for a little bit more money but I think ultimately it's worth spending a little bit more money if you want those key features as

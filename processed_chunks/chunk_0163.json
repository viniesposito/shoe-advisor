  "text": "hi I'm Thomas with believe the run this is Robbie with believe the run and we're going to go over our most exciting shoes for 2025 that we're looking forward to but before we get into that make sure you stay at the end because we're going to tease out some stuff that maybe we aren't supposed to be talking about yeah well we'll [Music] see new year new us new shoes new everything new new burger new readinger and it doesn't work but we're here we're excited we are excited there's some really cool stuff coming out in 2025 we couldn't contain our excitement so we thought Robbie what should we do let's just make a list of our most exciting shoes of 2025 I don't even know if all these shoes are going to be good or not I'm just excited about them let's start out we're going to go alphabetical order for this list so no favorites just straight A to Z there's no Z but uh we're going to start out with Adidas or Thomas likes to say let's talk about the evos first okay so controversial cuz some people already have it in 24 but we're calling it a 2025 sh the wide release is in March 2025 this shoe is going to be I'm I'm predicting this is going to be your Tailor Swift of shoes this next year everybody's going to be clamoring to get get these and I think that you're going to see it on a lot of Runners feeds if you belong to a run club or something like that get ready this is going to be it I mean I feel like even if you're not it's going to be a lifestyle shoe for a lot of people I mean it's a great shoe it's we're talking about $150 price point a l strike Pro midsole classic silhouette it's looking good it's coming like I said coming in wide release in March I don't know this is going to W all right let's move on next shoe uh let's go into the Adidas adios Pro 4 that's again also saw uh somewhat of a release here in December but that's going to be you know gearing up for those spring races and this one we got to run a marathon in and we can tell you right now it's a banger yeah it's probably my favorite race stue right now there's need a little more room in the toe box I feel like if you go half size up that'll fix things but or are they going to change that just in production you think oh maybe they will I don't know but I love that shoe uh it's just like a better so much better version of the uh adios Pro 3 bouncy Fast Fun Great upper that's going to be a good one yeah it's punchy let's move on to the next brand we're talking about Brooke Brooks has turned things around I know I can't say that I've been that excited about Brooks in the last couple years we're excited about a lot of the models getting some upgrades in 2025 so we're talking about the glycerin Max 2 specifically which is going to see a DNA gold top layer that's the peba style midsole material that they're going to be coming out with and I feel like that's going to be a really nice one and then also with the DNA gold is the Brooks Hyperion Elite the PB four PB and the five yeah I've already run in the four PB it's a big Improvement welcome to the dance Brooks we're so happy you're here now and that shoe works and then the five just has some style points I mean the one they showed us looked like it was like the racer from Speed Racer yeah the mach five or what not the mach five what was the blue racer guy the zero yeah yeah yeah it looks good anyway I never actually watched Speed Racer so oh really yeah I was like I was in that in between time of life so the PB version which is kind of the H hyperian Elite 4 and a half basically that's coming in February for 250 fall is the Hyperion Elite 5 all right let's move on dude Hoka Hoka had some good stuff come out 2024 we're seeing some updates to some things mainly C clo X1 2.0 which is I don't know seems like a code to get into some nuclear missile silo but it's still a name for some reason that's what the drones are looking for is the name of the next TOA shoe probably so that's their $275 race day shoe slup Sho SL daily trainer Thomas's this is the Hope is that it's be going to move it fully into the race day shoe some changes to the upper little tweaking of the midsole I think that it's going to lighten it up a little bit and maybe yeah maybe it'll be that shoe that you're picking for race day I mean I felt like the first version of the shoe was the most fun shoe maybe I've ever run in and so I'm hoping that all carries over to this version as well what was a shoe that we all love but seemed to cause problems for people yeah so the Hoka Mach X2 2024 was such a great shoe maybe would have won shoe of the year except for the heel collar which tore people's ankles to Pieces they should have called the Hoka razor yeah Sketchers and Hoka could have finally collabed together yeah anyway so they fixed that heel counter and the collar and it's pretty much the exact same midsole which we loved and the plate and it just that shoe is just so much fun to run in so we're really excited to see more people enjoy that shoe yeah and that'll be coming in I think late summer early fall for 190 so definitely stick around for that one and then this year I didn't even know about half the stuff hoko was bringing out until it came out right so who knows yeah there could be other bangers in there all right next up let's talk about the mauno Neo Zen which we actually have here it's actually out now I think the full full release is January 1st we've been running in this shoe so we can tell you that this is a shoe you want to be excited about it's exciting the price is exciting the fit is exciting the foam is exciting if they don't change anything with the fit which I don't think they are right now the only thing I have to say about the shoe is go a half size down yep but bouncy underfoot soft soft foot bouncy it harnesses all that feeling that we loved in the Neo Vista into a more I don't know normal trainer daily trainer what I like about it the Neo Vista was a lot of fun but that wide gape in the middle made it a little unstable because you had those two rails basically of rubber on the side so with this not having that plate in that Valley this one feels a lot more stable but you still have all that cush yeah I think this uh it was this TPU midsole I think uh people are going to be a little bit surprised by what maunu is coming with if you haven't experienced yet or the Muno comeback I think this is going to be the one enery next yeah all right Thomas let's move on to New Balance one of my favorite shoes is the rebel MH it's had some ups and downs but the rebel four was great and it just need a little tweak to make it even better and I think the rebel V5 is going to be that tweak all right and I don't know how much we're allowed to talk about it right now but we could tell you it's coming we tell you that it's probably going to be good and it comes in a lot of good colorways all right and then we also have the New Balance SC Elite V5 so that's the carbon plated race stue Thomas that's uh also seeing some upgrades I believe I think they've been listening to the people they're bringing that platform in a little bit it's going to be lighter it's going to be more race like it's going to have a little more I think that's what the I think that's what we want it was a the SC Elite has always been a little bit too uh conservative nice nice Comfort over a marathon but sometimes you want a little bit more aggressiveness so hope hope we get that I think we're going to get that at least from what I'm seeing all right cool let's move on to Nike there were some shoes in 2024 that we were excited about coming in the year like the alphafly but honestly besides that there wasn't much else feel like things are starting to change it's starting to tip one of these shoes I've already run in and really had a good time running it it's very nice I enjoyed reviewing it the price tag is a little heavy but we're talking about the Pegasus premium right so that's a $210 shoe that's coming in Spring 2025 now a lot of people have seen this shoe and they they say this is BS this is a lifestyle shoe what are you talking about this is a running shoe it has a full layer of Air Zoom in it uh has some zoomx foam but what what's been your experience in this shoe it's really fun like it is a heavy shoe on the scale but because of the zumax and the air you know coming in there you really get a bounce and a lot of energy return so like I was doing long double digit miles and the shoe just sang it just felt great it never felt heavy on my feet and my legs felt great afterwards I don't know what more you could ask for all right for a shoe like that and so in case you haven't watched our running uh a videos from the running event which you should do the Nike is moving things shifting things around moving shoes around getting rid of some other models so we're not going to see the Invincible anymore we're not going to see the Infinity Run so they're moving them into these different silos or categories either they going to be the peg the vomero or the structure yeah and one of them we're really excited about is a Vero that's their cushioning platform and there's some crazy looking stuff coming out of there yeah so there's going to be the standard model of those shoes and there's going to be the plus and the premium and you'll see different aspect you can you can kind of figure it out from the shoes that we've seen already in the Pegasus plus and the Pegasus premium kind of where where their shoes are going to fall into in those categor so we've seen a couple of them I think people are going to be interest like it's I think it'll also be divisive I'll say yeah it's going to shake things up but here's the thing that we're seeing a trend across the board is that lifestyle shoe and that performance shoe they're starting to like kind of bring them together where you're having shoes that not only look great and interesting but they're also going to perform yeah I think with the rise of the Run clubs the more social aspect uh just running in general becoming more popular yeah I think that we are starting to see that kind of molding melding of the two and speaking of that was a little segue but speaking of running becoming more mainstream in public more Runners are getting at you know people started in the pandemic or in the soci social clubs or the running clubs are now increasing their distances maybe doing their first marathon and now we have a first time Marathon or shoe in the on cloud boom Max yes and what's exciting about this one is it's really designed for somebody who's going to be out there a little bit longer so you're 330 and above Marathon this shoe is supposed to be more efficient supposed to help you get through the marathon more comfortable and it looks great too yeah and we've seen that with these shoes like the Solomon slab Spectre which has been geared towards 330 and slower marathoners that we're I feel like that's a thing uh Niche that brands are leaning into is that firsttime marathoner or slower marathoner who need maybe needs a little bit more support or cushion or Comfort over over the marathon you're still getting all the premium right like ingredients but it's put into a setup that's going to be better for you like okay if you're going to be the tip of the spear and you're running in our premium race stue that we develop for the top athletes you're going to not get the benefits of having some of the stability and stuff that as your form breaks down over the marathon for someone who's out there for 2 hours and 9 Minutes 2 hours and 10 minutes versus somebody who's out there for 3 hours and 30 and above these shoes are going to have a better experience for you in the Long Haul so it's not necessarily like Hey we're gatekeeping the technology it's like hey this might actually give you a better experience next up this is another shoe that you've run in Thomas we have you and Megan are both running it but the salony Endorphin Elite 2 love it I absolutely love this shoe now we were just talking about shoes that were built for that 330 and above marathoner and then there's a different shoe for the you know Pinnacle Runner this shoe I feel like works for both it's kind of dynamic the way the foam changes when you're running in it yeah so that has the all new incred run foam which you came up with that name didn't you okay if you don't put that on me Ricky Bobby uh the incred Run phone which is a soft bouncy lightweight magical fo in your hand you can squeeze it like a marshmallow it's like but once you start running and especially when you start picking up the pace somehow gets denser so while you're running say more easy Paces it feels great because it's nice and bouncy and soft but as you start to pick it up instead of it being like that situation we talked about in other shoes where if it's soft it starts to feel like you're running through sand the shoe actually kind of like changes as you're going through your speed and as you put that pressure on the foam it's really Dynamic and the shoe is so much fun to run in I really like it I think it's probably one of the better race day shoes I've run in Period across the board and I think it will work for just about everybody and I think that's coming in at the $275 price point in Spring 2025 mhm continuing with sakon we have another popular very popular shoe I think it's one of the most visited reviews on both YouTube and our website theorin speed 4 is seeing an update to guess the Endorphin speed five wait they're not skipping a number that's amazing yeah uh they're not norda so they're staying to the normal uh numbering sequence so we're going to the endorf speed five that's going to be an exciting shoe I mean hopefully it's not an exciting shoe it's so well- loved that it's hopefully just a continuation of what makes the speed a great sh yeah I think they're trying to make it even a little bit more aggressive back to the kind of what we loved in the speed one and two so we'll see hopefully that works out again it's just a great versatile shoe that everybody loves and and they're going to release it in the mutant color way which is somehow a five years later now a Heritage a Heritage color I mean with the attention span these days that does seem like a long time doesn't it I mean anything before Co seems like decades ago so fair enough all right moving on let's get to the sketch um honestly the whole Sketchers line I'm just at they're back almost yeah it's it's mostly just Sketchers they're back we thought they were just gone I thought Sketcher performance was done for yeah and then we tried a couple of their shoes on while we were at the running event I have to say they're they're they're good yeah they have a whole new Arrow line coming out so it's three different shoes one's like a Max cushion super trainer uh like a Tempo shoot the vault is a race Tempo shoot that was the one I kind of was into yeah that's I think some people I think people are going to like that and they're using their hyperburst foam they nitrogen Infuse super critical um I think they they've always done that well so they were The Originators they were so I'm excited to see what's coming from them all right next one's a weird one I didn't expect this to be on here we're talking about speedland for the road yeah for road so we're talking about the speed RX fpy which is again a lot so this is speedland athlete Don reel's first or signature shoe and it's a road model that employs the speedland boa fit system with the dials on top but it also has this midsole that takes a page from the Adidas Pro Evo 1 Playbook which is it's an uncompressed block of foam that was basically cut out into a very lightweight shoe for how much stack and substantial elements there are to it I think it's going to be an interesting shoe I tried it on they give you two options you can put a plate in it or not have a plate in it I tried on both and I have to say without the plate I and normally I would be like I think I'm going to like without the plate because I like that cush I like that balance it was almost too balancy too squishy without the plate I put the one on with the plate and I was like all right this feels amazing this one's not cheap if you've got the cash and you want to shoe that you could do that long distance it's going to be going right up against shoes like mounted Coast or something like that where you're going to be looking for that Ultra distant shoe for the road yeah and I so that's it's you said it's not cheap it is $299 I think pre-orders open up shortly uh deliveries in April it's going to be an interesting shoe for sure all right Thomas last in the shoes we can talk about category just tell me it's something that's foot shape you got it dude it's your lucky day talking about the toppo athletic Cyclone 3 this is kind one of those sleeper hits that a lot of people especially maybe people who have defected from the ultra call uh have moved on to too athletic the Cyclone 3 is a very simple daily Trainer slmo shoe with a full pack midsole 5 mm drop 5mm drop uh only 20 mm second of heel this is that shoe for all those people that are complaining that shoes are getting too stacked and too cushiony and too that this one feels low to the ground fast grab it we actually have it yeah we do have it um it's quick in the turnover it's light like if you've been complaining that things are getting too stacked too cushy this is going to be your shoe yeah that's what 7.4 ounces for your men size 10 and a half now with the pack midsole it's got to be expensive right 150 coming in h February 2025 so there we go as you might have noticed we didn't do trail shoes in this video our lead Trail reviewer Taylor Bine of the dirt division he's out in Colorado he'll probably give you a preview but what I'm excited for personally the norda 005 that's I feel like that's going to be an awesome shoe we wore that for an entire week we did we actually running it it's that's I'm excited about that we saw the satisfy the rocker that looks like it's going to be a great shoe you could probably guess it's not going to be super cheap but some cool stuff into that the North Face is doing some awesome things normal L sportiva uh dude there I feel like Trail is hitting its stride right now where there's just some crazy models coming out from all kinds of Brands uh we have our most exciting ch shoes of 2025 preview on the site it's like 16 or 17 shoes over there make Taylor get in front of a camera and read them off yeah yeah maybe we'll make him do that so check that out but let's move on to maybe like the secret under embargo segment we can't really say much about some of these shoes but I'll see what Thomas does so he gets in trouble for it and I don't so take it away Thomas all right look I hyped up a shoe really bad and when it came out it was a disappointment this is in 202 three yeah it was like I was like it's going to change the running it's the greatest shoe ever and that was the Prime X strung 2 yeah when we got here I think I still believe that we tried on a prototype shoe that didn't quite make it to production for sure this year though I tried on the prime xung three and they said it was in Final Phase so it should be what comes out and if it is I'm going to say again man I can't wait for this year all right I'm I'm not saying anything but I also didn't try it on so or at least in my size anyways I'm also excited an update to one of our favorite shoes the Boston 12 is coming yeah and you can probably guess what other Adidas shoes are Tumi sen season upgrade every year that's always been one of our favorite uptempo shoes 5K 10K Racers so that's I'm sure will be exciting as well cuz we've also seen the the the super Foams the really nice Foams kind of start trickling down into everything now which you may have noticed from some of the previews already and I think that's going to be exciting and moving the ball forward as6 has some stuff coming that's pretty sick dude as6 is going to be hitting it out of the park you're going to see something from them may got to test out one of their shoes that we can't even talk about that is right up there with the Pinnacle of what's available on the race day today and she said it's is comparable to the top stuff as you can get and watching Thomas on The Struggle Bus I want to tell you what it isor it's amazing uh it's going to be great and I also know that they're working on some other shoes we've heard some names thrown around that I won't repeat because they're telling me that it's not that name but I think it is that name okay but it might have blast in the name somewhere it's going to be great it's going to be up there with the super blast as uh a shoot it to consider for running around all right uh you know what Robbie the ones that we couldn't talk about we kind of alluded to them we saw some stuff from Nike in the structure line that you guys were like Blown Away by I mean visually I was I thought it was pretty awesome obviously I didn't try it so I have no idea I'm excited to I I know we didn't mention the tracksmith Elliot racer that's going to use a drop in midsole with a plate I'm interested in it I don't know like I interested in anything that people trying new stuff yeah that one's going to be coming out you're going to first see it in Miami uh they're going to be releasing it there and they've got some other stuff up there seve at tracksmith they're going to really make a go of it in the running space for Footwear and I'm excited just to see because shoe and culture run running shoes run culture regular culture Trail everything is like kind of swirling together we've seen some sick collaborations over the last year I think it's going to be 2025 is just going to blow the doors open on all that stuff so I'm excited to see what's coming in that way and how running is just going to keep taking off and going up so

believe in the run and this is Megan with Featherstone nutrition okay do I even have to say it anymore we've been doing this now for a couple years let's see your news yeah let's see the we even got new brand on it's shiny there you can kind of see it better so for those of you who are listening who can't see it feathers marked herself for life with a new tattoo that looks like sort of it's I would say it looks like Arrow but it's not because it's more like almost like um what do you call those things that you can measure like straight down like you hold and it it it's like a plum or something they call it it's supposed to be an arrow with a feather on the end so I don't know what you're saying I okay it looks like that but it's with one feather it doesn't look like your traditional Arrow yeah right no no no it's you know got some artistic Liberty I like it because you can point it the direction you want to go yeah and when you do this way yeah and if you did the Usain Bolt thing where he shoot like shoots an arrow you're you have it back there already yeah you're going to have to think of some new like um Mid race photo moves you can get and like Finish Line yeah you're going to have to work on that so think about it yeah I also think that you should do a feather to nutrition T-shirt with long sleeve with it printed on the on the sleeve that would be cool we on the sleeve on the same place so like everyone can have the same tattoo everybody can have it yeah it's not V anything I love it I think who wants to be like [Laughter] me oh my goodness no I do still like that I like that idea I do too um okay you are listening to fuel for the soul the podcast where we chat all things hydration and nutrition and how it affects performance and today we're going to talk all about injuries and how to come back from them and prevent them and all that good stuff but before we do we want to chat about our sponsor Runway who is not only sponsoring this episode but all of our episodes in 2025 we're pretty excited about this yeah right I mean they are in it to win it I mean I I I do want to tell people like when we take on a sponsor like this it's not lightly and we I've been using the product I know that feathers has been using the product quite a bit for I mean I guess it's it's I mean been over a year it's been over a year started with a collagen drink mix mhm and then um yeah cuz when we went to Orlando I think it's when the first time I met cam in person yeah and i' been using it for a while um that was last February and now I've been using the protein with the Crea te yeah so you know we talk a lot on this podcast about the importance of carbs and how we need to scale up carbs for our performance and I think you know we make that pretty clear but we also know that our friends over at oneway have a product for us that Thomas was just talking about which is their complete protein so it has 23 grams of protein per serving so you can scale that up if you need to and it contains creatine which we have a full episode on as well um and we're realizing that that might actually be something that we need as Runners as well well yeah and we've added in and I think a lot of Runners are doing this now are adding in a weight routine or some strength training to their efforts uh you know to stay healthy we're going to talk about injury and I really feel like that's a a big plus is having having that uh creatine in there for workouts and that protein for muscle building so it's not just for running but you can use it if you're doing other activities as well and I actually didn't know this this is in their notes to us but this is a vegan Protein that's made from fermented nutritional yeast um which is derived from a byproduct of the beer industry so that's interesting and so it uses less land and less water and Whey than the usual vegan protein and in studies it's been shown to be just as effective as way based protein for building muscle so but that's with an additive right the Lucine or something isn't it that's the cool thing right that's the cool thing about this vegan protein is most vegan protein powders are deficient Lucine which is our trigger to actually stimulate our muscles to recover and grow and rebuild but this fermented nutritional yeast is just naturally higher in Lucine and to my knowledge this is the only vegan protein powder that's made from this fermented nutritional yeast um and don't worry it doesn't taste like beer and it doesn't taste fermented by any means I think it's actually quite delicious yeah um if you guys haven't yet and you want to go try it you can go to runway.",

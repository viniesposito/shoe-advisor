and this is Megan with believe in the Run Robbie I love the way your hat almost matches your pants it's a beautiful did you plan it or was it just like I I didn't really plan it what it really matches is your ver 18 teens it does we talk about pallette of the year or something yeah Pet's always a word that I have trouble spelling cuz you have a cleft pallet yeah you're an artist aren you like that should be one that you know I know and that's to get the Emoji I like had to keep retyping it there it is it's confusing cuz there's the wooden palette is spelled different than a color palette right that's dumb it should just be p a l e tte but it's not and then there's pallative care if someone's dying and that has an i and an a in it does so Pala of care means that you're going to go yeah I think it's like hospice pretty much but maybe a little bit longer isn't hospice like you got a couple weeks the Robbie I if I have to go to hospice or Pala of care I give you permission written note that you can smother me with a lagoon pillow okay wow wow I'll do that is that a is that an ad spot they're hoping not let me fill out a questionnaire to see Ryan let me fill out a questionnaire to see which one will smother you the fastest yeah we could do that I think hospice sounds like a nice actually it sounds like something you put on pumpkin pie little bit H I was going to say the exact same thing can we move on from this not really making his back um and pal well palad sounds like your Pal's hanging out with you just sounds both both sound good to it's like palr Ralphie's on UNP palatable yeah dude's got he's very ill diara oh really do we need to get a lugon pillow over here stat no sorry Ralphie roll roll of did he contract a little uh dog Co when he was at the kennel I don't know but we had a night last night oh up every couple hours yeah he didn't take his chair Bundy he didn't chair Bundy sleep I don't think chair Bundy helps with that the dog Co yeah okay we'll test it out later um yeah anyway this is our TR recap episode okay did let's just start off with the fact people you don't understand the running event one day is equivalent to a regular week yeah that's actually true here's how I know because my kids were asking me about these Pok\u00e9mon cards that they had bought the day before we left the running event like they bought them online I was like they should be here today or tomorrow and it was like the next day I thought it was a week late I thought it had already been most of the week had passed and it was I think it's just we start early in the morning and then we have appointments that are like back to back to back until what 4:00 or was it 3:00 9 to 4 pretty much 4:30 and then there's get togethers afterward mhm where you you shoo and hang out it's act it's just actually a day that goes on forever like and there's just stuff the whole time actually I think Aaron our friend from Solomon described it well cuz she said one of her co-workers was going for the first time and she was like it's basically Las Vegas you're in this room where there's no windows you don't know what time it is I actually said that to someone and then they randomly just start shoving boo in your hands yeah and and they don't unfortunately there's no smoking sex there um but yeah they they have all that stuff time disappears or stays the same whatever yeah it's a basically in a casino yeah yeah except a lose except you're losing would I feel winning would I feel sorry for I I feel like no I'm just kidding but what I feel sorry for like our feet by the end of the day are trash because we've been walking around it's a cement floor for hours we're going place to place to place but I actually feel worse for the people that have to stand in the booth for that entire time like can you imagine having to stand there and you don't really go anywhere you're just kind of like yeah it's like you're in Guantanamo Bay getting you might as well add a waterboarding booth next to the pickle ball cords speaking of things that were missing that would be fun there's a staple of every running event that I've been to it's the uh untapped Maple ice cream wait before we go hard in the paint with TR okay I was not on the podcast last week oh yeah because the lovely team of Adidas invited me to the dream Retreat ladies for the ladies yeah sorry you guys weren't invited it's not like a P Diddy party or anything that's like something else yeah how much baby oil was there oh jeez there was Zero um they invited us there to try out the new Supernova rise 2 uhhuh which it turns out it's very similar to the Supernova rise one but it has a it has a nice new upper I still don't know what this super NOA is I I'm pretty sure we've reviewed it I've come to the retreat and we learn about the whole line it's a basic trainer okay it is all right um so yeah they took us out to this really nice um resort spa hotel what's it called I don't know how to pronounce it I think it might be maraval no it's m i r i v okay marival is that it it sounds like it okay I feel they were saying it differently I feel like there's place is just like to put a lot of consonants together and throw a couple vowels in and say it's a place it was pretty funny though because sa wait were you at maral Lago no this is right outside of Austin wait which one's marag like they're really trying to get those tffs taken off huh yeah right when when we checked in this was like um like a wellness Resort if you will Island I was going to say it earlier sorry they handed us a little like sleeping bag pillow for our phones as if we were going to put them away for the whole time it was a p didy party what are you kidding me no it was supposed I saw videos of him making people do that none of us use them okay okay but it's supposed to be like this I want to know the time out spot Robbie's watching P Diddy videos no I'm watching videos of him of things that happened do you know who didn't know anything about it I I told Megan no I knew about it you knew that something you wouldn't watch the videos if it came out there's oh dude I'm watching I would watch it 24/7 I'd watch the like if they had the real world P Diddy Mansion yeah I'm in yeah I mean God with with yeah but M didn't know half the stuff that was going on she was like uh yeah I guess I didn't do a deep dive on you were still doing his songs at karaoke thinking it was okay she thought she thought it was a lot of uh normal stuff going on there just maybe and I'm oh like he just had like stolen goods or something he just had too many drugs anyways all I'm going to let you talk I'm sorry Meg I it's okay it's I it's a Hot Topic I get it top of mind I'm talking about sleeping bag things for your phone which I didn't realize was triggering but apparently it is yeah anyway we had a lovely time there we we ran the shoe um Ashley Mato was there and so was Jen ader and which I told her I've been calling is it genor I've been calling her genitor forever and and she introduced herself and I was like just so you know I've said your last name wrong this entire time sounds like a Transformer something I gotta I gotta tell her Jor is so much cooler than jater that's no it actually does s it sounds like a Pokemon character really genitor yeah how many how many hit points do she have so it was lovely hanging out with them and meeting a bunch of people um your elevation on your runs were in insane yeah so it was an interesting spot for a run Retreat cuz there wasn't really anywhere to run there there's no way this is a run retreat was like a a quarter mile Trail is like half mile I think Max okay so we did some Loops um and it was up basically up on a big hill so there was quite a bit of elevation dud it was like three miles and it was like 500 ft of elevation so that's so they try to keep you from escaping is that the idea well they already took it already put her phone in a sleeping bag yeah okay uh we did some yoga we tested the shoes we learned about the whole Adidas lineup it was it was fun so do you do yoga in normal life no the last 15 minutes of the class I just laid on the I was going to say what do you how do you pretend to do that I I tried and then I gave up are you I and I should maybe know this but are you flexible no I am not okay cuz like that's the worst part about they started out with us like doing toe yoga and okay try lifting up your big toe and not all your other toes oh I did it it's really hard is that like that was like the beginning of our toe yoga session so is the idea that you're just concentrating on one toe like directing all your energy towards one toe I'm you know I don't know how this stuff works I was able to do this with the toe and this I don't I don't even know if I can move my toes I might be paralyzed yeah I I'm not sure what's happening it seems to be the whole foot that's basically what kept happening to me so that was why I ended up laying on the mat and taking a quick nap but it was lovely we did it um in front of an infinity pool overlooking Austin in its Glory so wow it's nice okay yeah it was a good time all right and then the boys arrived the boys arrived into the City and oh wait I thought you were talking about the party my bad I know we were still talking about the ddy party yeah shoot all right yeah so then me and you really want this to happen I thought I was doing now um so yeah the last week's podcast showed up uh yes and plus Jared and Taylor no Jared didn't come until later Taylor didn't getent you guys all showed up eventually we all assembled Megan featherston joined us as well and um yeah we kicked it off with a fun party with our friends at as6 and then we went straight into it yeah uh woke up Wednesday morning well I went for a run right when I we landed I said I need to get well basically I procrastinated Tuesday and yeah that was silly well but we usually run when we get there but I didn't realize how late we were getting there we didn't leave until like 11:30 well that's what I was saying I don't didn't realize how late we were getting there and so I did go on a run it was pretty nice Carl and I were so happy that we had already run though I like running when you get somewhere though it just I get it like the plane and stuff travel rust cobwebs in your mind and stuff anyway so your mind we did do the do a run and then did you run Wednesday morning I did run Wednesday morning too yeah I ran that with Flores gearan from path projects and Billy Yang I was supposed to do a workout but kind of just abandoned to have a good run and uh Billy Yang had those Rayband s those Rayband recording glasses on that's not creepy yeah I know it's like I can't you can never tell like are you just are you asking me questions to have a conversation or are you trying to interview me did you ask him if you were being recorded uh I think it shows like a light on the front if you're being record I remember you got them yeah I I had them for a little bit I I tried them out one the style that I purchased I felt was a little bit feminine for my face two okay it took really bad photos yeah the quality of the stuff was just crap but the was the video bad yeah oh I I think I think and also like why like why do you need that why do you need to video record someone with your face I actually think they'll be fantastic in a couple years and I do think you're going to want to do it just cuz like right now you pull out your phone but the glasses you could talk to so you could be like you just double tap the thing and the video comes on so your hands are free so say that you're holding a shoe that's the only case I see it working is you're doing like an unboxing or eating a sandwich you're saying it'll show things in the in the lenses no it doesn't show will your eyeballs see the things in the lenses like you are using your eyes it's got cameras on the temples yeah but I'm saying I thought you were saying it was like a what do you call it VR type thing where it show I think you're thinking AR or augmented reality yeah where it shows the directions or whatever I do think that'll happen what I did like about it though you could connect it to your phone and stuff so I was able to ask for directions and Google stuff and and uh also siries stuff so you could be like hey what's the closest taco place and it would be like okay and it would give you left left right left walk 200 feet this direction I think the one thing that he said was interesting is that if you record on it kind of all day and then make it real people people who you know who are with you they're like when did you take all that video cuzz they just people are so used to having an obtrusive camera so it's kind of unobtrusive you can it's a more natural thing than having a camera front of yeah but you especially if you just color a Sharpie over the light yeah no knows just disable light I wouldn't do that at all yeah at all Meg would be like why are you wearing glasses in the bathroom glasses um but yeah so then we what' you guys do you went on a run too went we went on a run and T backtracked before I did and ran into Connor for running a warehouse and film some content yeah jar you know that guy can't not film content yeah I mean he has the hair for it so Jared was like running with me and we were trying to get back cuz we had to get to the Nike thing oh right so they were I didn't realize that I was going to be or or was supposed to be doing any content with them so we're running back and I get a text message I'm like if you guys want to do it we got to do it now so they're out on the trail setting up the thing so right where that spiral thing is the bridge we sat at the bottom of that and we did like the shoe spotting thing that you and I did yeah but honestly I just went off the rails and just talked yeah that's the way I said I'm cranky guys I'm really tired I didn't know that we were doing this whatever then this one guy who I I don't know what the guy was doing he can see that we're filming we've got mics on there's camera up the guy just sits there and starts talking us and Connor was just too nice was he a runner guy or is he just it's it's the running event so was somebody that like knew Connor well I mean it's Austin so Austin could have been a crazy person that's true true but yeah this guy just rolled up and sat down next to us he's like he's talking I'm like you're not on mic nobody's gonna be able to hear you and Conor's let you should have just gave him your mic I know and just left yeah said you're this tapped in seems to be working out because we are doing shoe spot and he was wearing super blast too okay yeah in that nice offwhite that's a good color and then I came running by I did make sure that I wore cuz that ladybird Trail destroys your shoes yeah it does I wore those um zoomfly uh six six but the ilad kip chogi color because it already looks like it's got dirt on it so I was like okay that works it's like authentic and just going to throw this out there uh ladybird Trail so much better than PR Trail doesn't even come close I think that you could name a lot of trails and be like that's better than PR I think that's my goal is to just name every Trail that's better than priest tril that would be a good map for people like like a map of the US trails that are better than most of America it's be green over here n you GNA say you ran by uh yeah when you were filming in the vomero 18 no I didn't have it at that point I was also wearing the zoom F six I wore the zoomfly 6 that day too wow what do you think yeah I like it a lot it's gr grown me the more I wear it right I agree yeah it's the best zoom fly there's ever been oh for sure that's not even close and I know we don't want to jump too far ahead but Nike right now I don't care what you think about the brand they're really starting to kill it in the daily stuff there's like three or four shoes now that I'm like it's about time honestly these are really good okay I'm interested to I haven't run the vomo vomero 18 which we then got that about 30 minutes after that run M's already got 20 miles in it I ran in this morning okay it's a it's definitely the best vomero all right and it should have been and now it's got 46 mm in the heel you know I'm like that is it really 46 yeah that's what they said good Jo for the video people yeah I got it you got it yep that's this one 46 in the heel that's what they said from 40 to 46 that seems wild what do you think how would you describe the ride M um like a neutral daily trainer it's not super light it's going to have a little bit of structure and support to it um I did think it was pretty stable yeah I mean it's got a pretty wide platform so definitely nice and stable it's it's like a Workhorse it's not like um a light fun bouncy ride but it's it's funny it's funny you said Workhorse cuz this should have been the Pegasus that's what I also I think that's what we said about the last fero too I think sure what they're doing with the peg right now like this has really nice 4 foot cushioning I do like this the layer of zoomx they I don't think they should it's misleading to put the giant zoomx here because I did think that was interesting they do that with all their shoes I know it's really a thin layer of zoomx underneath your foot oh really this isn't the zoomx react x no not at all nice you can see the line where it zoomx it actually on the back it has an arrow that says zoomx and then react oh the zoomx is the top layer I got you yeah okay but this feels really good the upper fits great the lock down is nice I even dig like you don't see this tongue around that much anymore but it's nice padded tongue it's gusseted on the sides yeah it's it's pretty sweet I think you'll dig it I haven't put it on the scale is that the scale Under Computer yeah we can try it I feel like it's away something something so yeah we're supposed to go do a run with Nike but they plan their run a little late we had a 9:30 appointment so we uh it's almost 12 ounces that's a big boy they said a game that's a chunky but they also said it's like this isn't a shoe that necessarily needs to be super light so yeah right about that um yeah so shees keep getting heavier Robbie yeah I think they people were fed up with the lightweights you know what else no go ahead oh no go ahead I was going to say but the but the ratios are getting even ligher so it's true so you take these off and like but it is interesting going to the running event we'll talk about we'll just we'll walk through some of the highlights that we saw but one of the interesting things is how messaging changes from year to year so remember two or three years ago sustainability was like everybody was talking about it and there was green shoes and Eco shoes and this and that everybody was like here's our carbon footprint do you hear anybody mention it this not a not a word once not once yeah I mean it's still like on on their Pages they'll say uh this is biodegradable this is whatever even as6 is putting their carbon footprint in the Shoe Right does anyone even know what that number means that means nothing no and the thing is it just goes to prove the point like we had said before like if the shoe feels good and will help you run miles and do that people are willing to be like maybe be sustainable in other areas of their life but you're you're making a product that you're making thousands of that is made of rubber and different materials and yeah I ride my bike to work every day so I can wear whatever shoe I want yeah that is true that's how that works even in the cold yeah it's even nicer in the cold I feel like I don't I don't know depends depends what you're wearing anyways but yeah um the so Ralphie shut the do you need me get the Lagoon pillow get the lagon Carl get the lagon pillow it's okay buddy all right um so highlights of highlights of the we doing it by day or just in general we can it honestly doesn't matter because no one knows what I don't know what day it was but let's start with the low light the low light I start to mention oh yeah every year they have an ice cream truck that we get so jazzed about soft serf maple syrup flavored ice cream it's like the most lovely treat in the middle of a Las Vegas day yeah and they showed up this year s's truck no truck I it's funny that we both went with s's truck that's how it works uh it was it it was disappointing for a couple reasons one I love that ice cream yeah and two I mean what's going on with them that they can't afford the ice cream truck anymore I don't know I guess it should be a sponsor of this podcast that will sell more maple syrup or maybe we need to do free spots for them so that we can get the truck ice cre truck we could just have a get the ice cream truck for every episode leading up to tr we'll give you free year-long sponsorship if you just bring the ice cream truck back yeah that's the deal I mean I'm in and I finally figured out that hack last year where I took the the honey Stinger waffle or the unta waffle and dipped it into the ice cream and then chunk it up and put it in man that was nice it's basically like a DQ Blizzard but handmade all right first check in man this is going to be a long podcast so buckle up anyway we're covering all the stuff from Trey and one of my favorite things to do is it like think about this you're out there running right now doesn't always feel the best but sometimes it does and the times that I really like having that Fitness is when we go on these trips so I can run with friends and get together with people so if you don't are lacking a little motivation right now think about just staying in shape so that if something fun pops up I don't know could be a turkey Tru could be a holiday 5K who knows what's happening but just uh stay fit over the winter here and uh you'll be in good shape to run with friends and have a good time all right guys element is still a sponsor of this podcast but for a limited time they're offering their chocolate medley oo that sounds pretty delicious you know it's not like the you're not going to put that in your bubbly water no you could could you you could uh you want it heated up I think yeah some hot water with either the chocolate mint the chocolate chai or the chocolate raspberry I've heard it's pretty good in coffee too you could also put it in your coffee okay would you do it before your run yeah okay some hot coffee some chocolate medley I do like a mocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also our offer is still available so you can go to element. slthe drop and get a free element sample pack do you know if the sample pack would have this chocolate in yeah ohes there you go so go get them and enjoy speaking of ice cream put my hands in that ice cream and all mixed it up we went to BJs yesterday because we're getting stuff for Thanksgiving it's a store and just had the for those you know just Costco it's the baltimor Costco yeah I feel like we need to prep that every time yeah um anyway went BJs I love I love that there was no better name nobody or nobody you know what maybe maybe we shouldn't be that let's call it 69 Club yeah uh anyway uh so we went there and we're getting we got a apple pie and I'm like I like vanilla ice cream with apple pie mhm that's a pretty American thing yeah uh so I go to the freezer to get the ice cream and they have a half gallon of hogendas vanilla okay and a half gallon I think it was a full gallon maybe it's a gallon gallon of DJs they don't they go hard gallon of hogendas and then there was a gallon of Premium whatever their store brand okay but I'm almost 90% sure it's the same stuff it's in the same looking container like it the containers look the same yeah everything looks the same how much do you think the hogendas vanilla ice cream was for a gallon for a gallon at BJs M $122 $77.99 how much do you think the in store brand was $12 5.99 dude what dude I was like how is this possible I really thought he was going to come back with the hog and do I was like knowing you did so what you which one did you get I got the low price I I can't I couldn't do even I'm I'm extravagant but that was like insulting too much especially cuz you're probably not going to eat the whole thing so was it fine and I'm going to mix it with apple p yeah I don't know I haven't tasted it yet but I have a feeling it's the exact same stuff yeah I mean I and I feel like ice cream is generally ice cream and obviously there's some that are better but yeah I mean the container looks exactly the same with just different writing yeah you're going to be fine yeah plus I predict apple pie with it I predict a pleasurable experience for dessert I'll probably have leftover you can probably come over and okay do some blind tast ice cream that sounds good I don't know the boys are in are going to be enjoying it as well so yeah all right we'll see anyway so yeah the ice cream truck was not there not there and then what other low lights were there I don't know if there were everything else was pretty standard I think some of the Riff raft that they let into the convention is a low light yeah including us yeah yeah we shouldn't be alled I will say it is it is I don't even know what it is at this point because they do just basically anyone that can fog up a mirror is led into the convention center um and so it's fine but a lot of Brands now just hide their stuff behind in cabinets and behind wall I do think it's it's not as exciting as it used to be just for that reason definitely not yeah it used to be you'd walk the floor and immediately see like wild crazy like yeah stuff that may not ever even get produced they would like just throw here some stuff we're working prototypes yeah and now it's like you get to see what's coming out in a couple months like in February yeah not even in Fall now I did appreciate some of the brands that were say what were you going to say what what you're about to say you say it you say it okay I was going to shout out the brands who actually showed all the stuff for next year I'm sure it's not all the stuff but it's most of the The Heavy Hitters who did that Hoka on Brooks Brooks tell Brooks put all their cards on the table Yeah they sure did uh I have to say that was probably my favorite like run through of all the stuff just because I felt like he was very sincere yeah he's great nille yeah so Nik walked us through uh nikil Jane walked us through the Brooks um lineup and you can see that on YouTube if you want to watch it one I feel like Brooks is actually making an effort now to really Advance their shoes where I felt like they were getting a little stale and I feel like this is a really good thing for them because they didn't wait until they were in the garbage can to do this mhm like I'm really excited about some of their product we could even have like the glycerin which one is this eight glycerin 22 yeah we're already at 22 jeez the glycerin 22 here and and I we just named glycerin Max our top Max yeah uh cushion trainer and this has a lot of similarities to it it's got that double uh density super critical foam MH in a lower the ground package so I think this going to be a good shoe I you know me I don't love Navy or blue shoes but a lot of the stuff they were showing us was really goodlooking yeah there I mean the hyperium Max 3 was there the Hyperion Elite 4 and A2 and five uh both of the shoes by the way he did give us a little bit of credit and I don't know that it's necessarily what we said in the video about the Foams I think it was more our audience thank you people for chiming in and also agreeing that you would like to see Brooks have a paback uh phone Runner and for all of those of you that were like you don't need peab bags and this guess what they're going heavy into packs and their their athletes are winning in it yeah so that's what um Dez was wearing in New York Josh Kerr was wearing and so that'll be coming fall 2025 the Hyperion Elite 5 yeah and even uh the guy that was leading the Olympic trials for the first 20 miles was wearing wearing the pabb version of the shoe yeah and and then the the the four or the five right that one's pretty well I think that's what I was talking about oh I was talking about the 4.5 I think he said they were wearing the five though oh were they yeah okay I mean it's it's a similar shoe right uh but anyways so they are and what else the hyper the regular Hyperion the trail the trail stuff everything it's looking good yeah so that's that's cool the ghost Max ghost Max yeah even ghost Max 3 even the launch everything the ghost oh yeah the ghost look good yeah like it's getting a nice update there's the I don't understand though the launch and the in the Hyperion the launch is basically their lowest entry level shoe so for years it was $100 I think even maybe until last year yeah why would you go with that over the Hyperion less expensive H the Hyperion is still what 140 yeah okay so um but anyways so Brooks was cool Hoka I thought their stuff looked pretty solid I mean the Mach X2 or Mach X3 I'm so happy they also are bringing the Bondi and a new Clifton this year like it's been ages yeah and those are a fan favorite so there's a couple changes to them some of the drop um it went from what four uh 5 mm to 8 mm someone's saying that the compression of the foam it'll even out to about a 5 mm over time but I don't think that's the truth people were some people weren't were not like that change well in the comments try it first yeah I mean I'm neither here nor there on it I I I also one of my favorite shoes from this past year was The Mach x two yeah yeah so the three so they fixed the problem which is the heel was an absolute travesty on this year's version that would have been shoe of the Year probably for us if it wouldn't have been for the heel thing absolutely but they fixed it so that's good news yeah yeah and it it looks good um I'm definitely am also excited about the x 1.2 clo lost anoun X11 2.0 yeah it's it's the Fibonacci code yeah seriously I was going to say you might as well call it BJs um the yeah the right you're going to be able to unlock the Constitution or something with a code on the back with that that number may maybe it is a hidden in plain site thing code for some map well I will tell you that it dropped an ounce in weight did it really I didn't I miss so I missed the yeah so they saying probably going to the bathroom or something yeah dropped an ounce how could you the bathroom when we're talking to Rebeca bro she's our favorite no I actually was looking at I was at the speed L you Robbie had to go eat a sandwich he was going to be hangry at that point no I would no for oh oh it was was that when I was hungry yeah oh yeah that is when I was hry we were like go eat your sandwich somewhere we'll be where did you get a sandwich the burrito burrito burrito the size of our heads yeah we found the craziest taco joint 10 10 Taco it wasn't called that taco 1010 yeah something like that have fun finding it but it's literally a hole in the wall and an alley that you think is just a bar and then you take a back door to the restaurant it it looks when you're walking down the alley it looks like you're going into the back of a restaurant yeah then you walk in it's kind of like a weird bar and then you walk through what would be like a freezer door mhm similar like when we went to Paris yeah it's like a Speak Easy style yeah 10 10 Taco I'm pretty sure that's no it's not that 10 to 10 something 10 to 10 10 T okay is it tin I'll up the adventures of tin yeah you keep you keep looking it up do and so yeah I had to eat I was getting hangry though I was dude that burrito was good it was too much burrito but it was good yeah it was definitely too much but just in case you're wondering our Taco count was pretty high this trip oh my gosh I think I had at least 20 tacos can you explain why the breakfast taco thing is just not everywhere in the US why is it just in Texas why aren't there breakfast tacos at Roo at whatever just out it's the most simple amazing Cuisine that you could ever in the morning breast Megan made herself a egg on a tortilla Tak Takara 10 to 10 you did say 10 to 10 I said 10 to 10 wait you said 10 10 can we rewind the tapes I was the closest I think Tak 10 to 10 anyway go find this little hole in the wall it's really good yeah do you think it's open from 10 to 10 I don't know that may be why like 7-Eleven yeah but it's pretty close to the convention center so it was packed yeah well it wasn't yeah this was a mistake on part cuz we ducked out faster than you and Taylor and Carl yeah yeah so we got there and there was no line yeah we just strolled right up and placed our order and then apparently the line went out the door yeah I remember saying can confirm I looked I turned around and I said oh we got here at a good time then Robbie and Carl and T showed up had to stand out in the alley wa it for 40 minutes in line no joke it was worth it yeah it was for a moment you would have been able to enjoy it more if you had gotten it when we did probably accurate Carl would have enjoyed it if he had gotten it hot yeah like a backpack bured if he had a hot carl yeah um anyway so then we ended up uh going from so hok we don't have to get the timeline but hok was great what uh what was the other one that was on on was interesting although how many yes how many Cloud Surfer shoes can you have turns out four I am kind of excited to try the uh Cloud Max yeah obviously Cloud Surfer Max or Cloud boom Max Cloud boom Max okay the one that's the that's a racer it's not a racer it's well it's a 3:30 to 4 hour marathon shoe oh that's right so it's another one of those that's aimed at I I think that's going to be a new trend is like okay look you don't want to be wearing the race Pinnacle Razor's Edge spear of the tip yeah tip of the yeah but at the same time s had the the totally opposite strategy where he was talking about the Endorphin Elite 2 and he said this is for the marathoner who runs four and a half five hours if they just want the premium product and I have to say that foam felt like it'd be fun to run in but from the Endorphin Elite too yeah or the cloud cloud boom no uh the cloud boom seemed like like it would be similar foam to what was in the cloud boom Echo okay um or maybe what Adidas uses okay um the Endorphin Elite endorphin Pro Elite too just the Endorphin Elite too just endorphin Elite it it was so spongy and and bouncy and it felt light and Squishy yeah D so when we got the adorf for elite do you think we got a early version of the shoe cuz cuz everybody else was like it's soft wonder that cuz I feel like they were the only people who didn't love that shoe and like a lot of people really loved it especially our our guy that ran like every marathon in it last year uh um floberg yeah MH but yeah the two looks very promising though ours was blocky so maybe we didn't get the right formulation but it just didn't feel great yeah all right so then there is the on so there's the the on shoes on has a trail shoe coming too that looks kind of interesting uh I forget the name off the top of my head um well Ralph's like a lightning rod over there and then we uh and then we what was the other I'm trying to think what else was cool that day could just pull up the list of everyone we talked to yeah you could I did like um what about I I really enjoyed seeing the Adidas stuff oh yeah they have fun stuff in the works we can talk about but then also the product coming looks great and I don't want to tell you I tried something that we got hyped up about last time and then I kind of blew it Prim x drung three yeah it I it boy it it looks like it could be fun again but you're too scared to say it I'm too scared to say it but I tried it on and Robbie tried it on and they made sure that we didn't run too far but it was the final product they said so well speaking of crazy and fun the Puma uh fast RB yeah RB rld RB LD yeah yeah once again so that what was interesting to me about that was I assumed that that was supposed to be a race day shoe same and we were told by Todd who's head of product there that it's actually just a fun wacky like cruising shoe yeah and it's I don't even know what's happening with it it's basically the RB just laces right yeah correct that's the LD that's the only difference Lac Lac okay I mean basically he described it as like a you want a really fun shoe to go out and run in and you're comfortable spending $300 there's your shoe and it looks crazy I mean that's basically what the cx1 is yeah it's $275 or the prime X yeah but cx1 they're still trying to tell you it's race Prime X Dr then I know what they're saying but I'm saying I I would agree it's closer to the primx strung um okay I don't know what other shoes like that like there's a ton of shoes every shoe that I loved last year everybody's like that's too expensive okay I was like well I mean I mean but the Puma Sho is why you love them I know that's that's why I'm trying to tell you what the best shoe is I didn't trying to tell you what the best value is if you're getting the best feeling out of something you're going to love it it might cost a lot uh the other interesting thing speaking of ALS so expensive the speed land speedland has a running shoe a road running shoe coming out it looked nice yeah and they it's interesting because what they did was basically what Adidas did with the Evo Pro is they have a block of uncompressed foam that they I don't know lasered out and it even has raw kind of edges to it so it's not even Ultra finished and then they uh put that underneath of they kind of usual you know insole uh yeah they're Dro in insole as as well as the um upper with a boa fit system did you try it with both the plate and without the plate I didn't because it didn't fit me so okay I tried it with with the plate and without the plate I had one on each foot and I have to say you need the plate okay and even they agree they're like cuz it's a huge stack of foam and it's very soft and it feels very soft and bounc yeah yeah but the plate all it did was kind of like the lateral to medial side kind of like stabilized it a little bit yeah now I didn't I wasn't running it so I don't know but I'm going to assume that that would help yeah I agree yeah and that's uh $300 so that's the same prices like you're saying all those other crazy uh shoes with everything like that in it you know we said there wasn't a theme this year I think there is a theme okay expensive $200 shoes like everything's going up to 180 to well because everyone's putting the the really expensive yeah phones and materials into their daily trainers and there has to be a higher profit margin on that either way it has to be oh for sure like even if you are putting in more expensive components they have their own profit margins so yeah so it's definitely like if you're hoping that you're going to be able to find those great one 120 shoes 130 but then look at the look at the Evo SL that you Rave about that's $150 shoe that's now the budget is EV SL and the SL2 pretty good pretty good price for some excellent shoes Robbie didn't didn't we name one of those the shoe of the year yeah I did I put the SL2 on there I felt like it deserved it I and make didn't even run in it we had we had we had a internal discussion about that getting the top shoe because while I think it's really good it's the other factors that play into it make it the best well that's what I wrote It's the overall so it takes into account all the things the versatility the price the the mids soole material it almost be like it's a Honda Civic versus like yeah it's not the Porsche yeah it's not the Mercedes but it is the the shoe that's going to get the job done in a really good way and a in a really good value at at 120 130 130 full price but you know like I'll bet you if you Google it right now what what's it cost let me see cuz the is always dropping some crazy sales well they're in Europe so they have those like they don't go by the map pricing you can find it I don't know what this website is probably a scam but just take your chances uh that was 80 bucks but they only have one size knocking it off you can find it at um it looks like most places it is still 130 but okay still a bargain shoe these days yeah um but the the evos is going to blow it out the water yeah true I did want to say that also mounta Coast is I feel like gaining a lot of traction not just from some of the stuff they have coming like their Trail shoe and some of the Foams that they're going to be using but the I've seen it on more people and even when I went on Wednesday morning Flores and Billy were both wearing the shoe they really loved it yeah I was out is how many people are buying it I I think a lot more I mean obvious but I'm saying is Flores and Billy and those guys did they purchase those or those samples it's a good question I mean probably samples but yeah but I don't I mean they're wearing it they have plenty of other shoes I'm sure um now you we we talked to a guy that's now doing their foam MH and now he's or he's at Mount Coast now where where did he get his start so started he was at we talked about this before but he was at Sketchers doing the super there super critical fils before anyone else was doing it and that was when was this razor it's a long time ago at least 10 years ago right uh dude I think it was 10 years ago can't be what would be 10 years ago it was a couple years before I started here that was six years ago so yeah at least eight years you're you're pre I had the razor before I had you oh yes Dad uh but it was it was longer than you think okay I think maybe now I was trying to find this yeah so okay this is the photo of the so they're using this Mala Coast is using this foam that is made from it actually takes natural gas and extracts the like methane or biomethane from it and then converts it into essentially like a biomass midso foam it's kind of a wild thing but I believe the entire so the entire midsole is then biodegradable like you could literally just throw it in the ground it'll light it on fire disintegrate it's not any oils or anything huh but supposedly it has all the bouncy properties cuz I don't think they're I mean the mount the coast shoes are pretty bouncy as it is I don't think they're going to sacrifice that so it says here let me read this it says Circle cell which is their new foam the world's first performance running shoe midsole technology to fully incorporate biomass balance biopolymer made by 100% renewable feed stock powered by our own Super critical foaming process it matches energy return a peba while offering 91% more durability so we will see if you say natural gas yeah you're not talking about like that you barbecue on you're talking about methane from animals think yeah they just hook it up right up to their anus and harvest that is that like fracking yeah jeez I think it's something like that that's why would they want to ban fracking because you just have cows farting everywhere I think that's what the science says sounds right second check in all right you need motivation you probably just ate so much you're like ah how many miles am I gonna have to run to burn off this food that I just gobbled down probably some drinks too so this is the best time of year to just kind of do some slow miles where you burn them calories and you get you know all the benefits of running and being outside and probably is going to make you feel better too so if you're a little hung over getting some fresh air is nice all right guys another sponsor of this podcast one of our favorites cherub Bundy now available in gummy form why would I take Cher Bundy make um it helps with recovery it helps with sleep it's delicious now they come in gummy form and they're very delicious yeah is kind of like a treat you snack on them all day long it's a treat that is good for you yeah uh we have jars of them at home and I've been taking them before bed which I've tried to use instead of taking my melatonin which has been working so far um but also if you want to just try them out right now they have the sample four packs of the gummies where would I get those at the feed.com ah they got everything over there our discount won't work on the feed.com but you can just get the little sample pack and then if you really like them then you can go to chundy dcom get the big jar of them and use our code uh the drop for 20% off um and so that was that was cool and I think that was like mostly the first day of what was interesting and then we the second day is that cool moved the second day yeah I think we already talked about some the second day too yeah we did uh we because we already talked about saky got pizza dude we forgot to say we hosted a freaking Q&A at the satisfi bo was that the first night yeah Wednesday night okay that was okay one of the booths that blew me away yeah and look I get it satisfy has its own Vibe and and literally it looked like coffee Baristas were going through training there like everybody outside had a beanie on and like you know cuffed pants yeah it's like you it looked like a scene from The Warriors but if they were all Starbucks bruers but like at the not even Starbucks like some underground one where you had to knock three times to get get a coffee and it like steampunk Starbucks yeah it's like there's probably more tattoos there than in the rest of the convention center combined but on on one guy's neck so it is a little stereotype but I have to say brand storytelling and packaging and everything that goes into like building a cohesive brand it's like a master class like every piece of clothing oh yeah was fit into a specific like you know it satisfy without looking at a label or anything like that and they know what they're doing sure yeah they're launching their first shoe mhm which we can't really talk about right but even that like the concept behind it and the execution was just Flawless yeah they do just the whole vibe and look and I mean they had a booth a big Booth right in the middle of the floor smack da in the flooor like between Nike and Hoka or something I mean it was prime prime real estate and it I mean just everything was beautiful I we got to talk to the shoe designer and uh the guy who's going to be heading up shoe design for uh Hoka who used to be at Solomon in North Face um and just like the product is next level and then we did get to talk to Scott jerk the number one Trail Runner of time no big deal yeah that was awesome and do you have that do you have that magazine that I got sign I want to put that in the FR yeah in my backpack cool did you get one sign for yourself I didn't but that's all right all right we'll hang it up at the office everybody will be all enjoy it yeah and so it was it was really awesome talking to him I swear everyone from Minnesota is like just born with a nice Jean well not not no I think they're born with a freaking like they everybody like think about every Runner that we know from mon yeah they're monsters athletically and also the nicest people in the world Courtney de Walter they're like Canadians almost Taylor boty and her own trail reviewer Ben Johnson Ben Johnson Dakota lorm Dakota lorm I like the mil City people I saw one of them at the mosh pit during the y' Out Boy yeah shouted out something that I regret now but um we'll get there later uh but the um whatchamacallit when we were interviewing him Robbie does an amazing job by the way I thought your questions were fun and you brought it down to like a really nice level that wasn't is that gonna be a episode here are we going to be able extract that audio and and make that a podcast episode maybe we're going to have to listen to the quality and see how it comes out all right we'll see yeah I got to ask him if he ever blew up spray paint cans in a bonfire as a kid like he's not listen nobody else is asking him that yeah I think he was into it he was yeah we had a good time me he walked up beforehand he's like when we were talking about doing the interview and I said look we don't normally do like the stand like we're not going to just be like what was your favorite race what was what time walk us through western states yeah what did you eat before that um I said we're usually very conversational he goes perfect because I you know I get asked the same questions all the time and and I go I know we just read the the possessed article and it's like I didn't want to just do yeah the same questions they were in there we did mess up with one thing though what do we oh no what' I say we didn't mention your boy Scott's Instagram page how did you not do that I I it was the biggest missed opportunity it's just when you're in a conversation you jump into it and then you're car and then you're going on and by the time you know it it's over and you just forget yeah that's the I think that's a good nice thing about a good conversation is that sometimes you just forget to ask the most the list the things you have on a list um but I actually am kind of glad didn't because I felt like it's a little awkward for him in a way do you know what I mean like I would have loved to have heard that yeah make it weird I mean well we did ask him about it afterwards yeah and he basically was like it's he thinks it's funny he thinks it's funny but he also it it for him some people actually think it's him a lot of people a lot of people it's pretty sometimes it could be harsh on some of the trail running athletes and he's like it's not I I didn't say that so they actually think that he's like ripping on Ultra and all these like wow other athlete stereotypes and things and it's it's like it's stop me I mean that dude does go hard on alra did you see the post on T though CU that hit hard that was pretty spot on that was good wait would I I saw it but which thing got you good um I don't I'm trying to remember now what my favorite slide was obviously the ultra was funny um yeah I had to go back and I forget all them something about the no someone mentioned us in the comments of it but did they really yeah that's amazing probably in a very positive way right so oh they they're ripping on the on party oh that was good I like the on party yeah they made it look like it was what's his name in in the office yeah which I hadn't I we didn't go to that it's perfect but I'm glad we didn't it wasn't a parking garage it oh that's the one yeah um apparently there's nobody there yeah I do like the close your eyes imagine the most obnoxious Runners you know they're all standing around in a big open room the volume of idle conversation is deafening everyone's social skills are below average you've just attended Trey what was a comment that mentioned us um someone was like it is is it even a party if the jumpsuit wearing believe in the Run crew or kafui don't show up no which I don't know if that was actually a that's not yeah that doesn't sound that bad that was Joel I don't know I recognize this dude from some of our comments Joel we did switch it up this year and did not do the jumpsuits we did a tracksuit which I enjoyed I thought I think it was more comfortable for two days than the jumpsuit yeah it was and I think I have a different idea for next year okay so keep it fresh nude suits mhm it's actually Saran Wrap I don't hate that we're just going to on your believe you're so doing it um the Diddy oil by the way to bring it back if you bring the Diddy oil I'll bring this I'll wear this dude why don't we just make our own brand of Diddy oil it puts the lotion on its skin yeah oh jeez a no party like a diddy party yeah I don't know by this time next year he might not even be alive so oh yeah there's no way yeah the I these shoes right here that if you're watching Youtube you know so James uh from upper void had reached out to us about these shoes and at first Sometimes some people from Asia will reach out about a product or shoe and it's usually like not a very high quality product yeah and so I'm hesitant sometimes but he was really persistent and I took a look at these shoes online before we committed to anything I was like these actually look kind of cool so if you're listening they're basically insulated mule Slippers With bulbous outsoles like Caterpillar soul but it it's like a sleeping bag upper with a little you know almost like a pull tab uh lace system yeah like a quick lace like a Solomon type situation and they're pretty comfy dude I wore them I walked to work here today and I wore them and then I I wor I thought you ride your bike every day uh or walk both green okay sometimes I do drive I have to I already caught him in a lie um anyway James came to our hotel and met us which again I was like we're real busy during Trey so when somebody that I don't know is like can I meet you and I'll come by and you're like oh okay well I don't think he said to me I just said you can this is when this is the only free time we have if you swing by the hotel and sure enough I came in for my run when we came back around 8:20 and he was there already and you messaged me I'm like he'll have to wait and I was like dude I got to take a shower I know but then you came down I came down and uh I love these things man I I really do think I mean there's a couple things I might switch up about what are you what's the point of them it's a recovery shoe it's like a it's like a slipper that you can wear outside I like I said I wore today it was what 40\u00b0 yeah feet were warm the whole way it's great I worm back from the air airport so I can't believe I'm touching because I went in the airport bathroom in here I'm going to have to wash my hands but I warm the whole way home from the thing they were comfy they were cozy you know how normally sometimes you can be on the plane your your foot expands or something and the shoes feel restrictive yeah these felt great the whole time and then yeah they're perfect for walking the dog I just slide them on so yeah they're great so here's a lesson this is a if you haven't re read between the lines I'll just spell it out for you for any of you shoe people product people whatever if you really want to get something in front of someone you got to work for it like it's nothing magical it's just going to show up and make your thing big nothing's but like I mean the same thing happened with a I say Michael from a tray TI five years ago or whatever pulled a Sho out of the bag yeah found us on the floor pulled his shoe out of the like I respect that 100% you have a 10 times better chance of getting your shoe in front of people if you fly to Baltimore and knock on my door and hand us the shoe and then you do about emailing me 55 times so I'm just saying they're all looking up your address now good luck to you necessarily my you could just say 1805 1805 yeah 1805 Eastern Avenue between the hours of 9:30 and 5:00 p.m. yeah I I would let's be a little more I'd say 10 to 4: yeah you might have to sleep over people knocking on the door why aren't they here yet but but I do respect that like I love when people go above and beyond also and that means they care about it right also the clothing I liked I think that that they had like fashion forward like clothing also like that kind of go with the shoes um I mean definitely I think there's some a couple things I would improve about the shoe but I I think right now as is it could be a hit yeah um so that was cool and then we W what else as6 only had the gel cumulus but they did give us a sneak peek of their Ray shoes and I even got to try them out right Megan wor Megan wore a secret shoe yeah and I got to say pretty excited about it now the fit was a little bit off cuz it was a prototype yeah if the fit wasn't off how do you think that she will compare to like the premium Market something like the Evo it's going to compete with the Evo that's where it sits in in weight and performance and that's my feeling I again I didn't have the correct size so but you've worn the Evo yeah raced a marathon in it did you think there was better cushioning same cushioning I don't know how much they want me to say I think you could just say if you thought it was better or same I would say equivalent if not better okay I think that would be fine okay speaking of mysteries I'm holding one yeah oh yeah mauno we popped into that booth for a hot second yeah got to see a bunch of mystery shoes well that's the thing like they got to drop the mystery I don't understand cuz they told us what the shoe was but I guess we're not supposed to say what it is so there's mystery o1 O2 O3 and o4 but they look like a shoe that you know so you're like oh is that I think this is a marketing strategy that is not it it's like when you dress a dog up as a ghost like put a sheet over the dog you know it's still a dog just dressed as a ghost it's not a ghost it's not a ghost dog yeah it's just like when you put a few polka dots on a Neo Vista 2 I know what it's going to be but I don't think this is a Neo Vista 2 see it is that isn't but the other the other one there was it was yeah but I actually ran 12 miles in this one yesterday okay I actually think wait is that not the neist maybe it is a maybe it is a ghost not a dog in a sheet I know that's the thing well I don't are we allowed to say the names of the other mystery well everyone knows the Neo Vista 2 is coming but I think this is the other one okay and I cuz I don't think it has I'm not sure if this this is the plate that the okay other at least it didn't feel like it was the plated version I also ran that shoe and it and I liked it quite a bit Yeah the cushioning is really nice the only problem I have it's a half size too big for me oh and this is a 10 and a half so and our friend Justine who works there MH when I posted that hey I ran in this and I felt like maybe it was a half size too big she said that she also feels that okay well it's also uh I'm assuming an early mystery yeah production model of that sh mystery mystery machine so I'm going to actually request a half size down cuz the cushioning on this feels delightful really okay all right mauno that's exciting to hear because you I mean I like the Neo Vista a lot so well you'll like this okay uh but you with all your issues with um sizing yeah like literally Robbie can get five shoes same brand and be a different size in each one um I I'm curious if if one if it fits you and two if you I I I have a pair at home yeah we all got them right mine fit fine by the way did Carl get these no you want these 10 and a half to see if they fit you all right he says unconvincing I did I did run 12 miles and them gross dude um I dude the also man the norda norda o5 which we should probably talk about since we wore it the whole time we were there yeah mhm I did go in a run with that on Thursday morning uh she's fantastic it's going to I mean just on Saturday their Matteo sidel or Mato that's his Instagram Matt cidel uh their their Trail athlete he took third at JFK 50 Meer ran point the whole length of the race in the shoe you know how a lot of people change out when they get to the to Toe Path he wore the thing the whole way the ls AR finished with the eighth fastest time overall the lugs weren't the um they're not super aggressive I say they're like 3 mm lugs right and they're kind of spaced apart so it's not like but it has they have the vbr mega grip Elite or something like the new vbr rubber that's not on anything else yet it's their first shoe to have it yeah um course it's pretty shoot too yeah so I T when we were at the satisfy thing too I talked to Max um max joffre's the the the dude who won the Moab 240 yeah a couple weeks ago I like he's super nice why am I forgetting his last name and uh and he um he told me I asked him how many miles he had on his a pair of o1s he's one of those guys who has like 500 miles right dude 1,500 miles he said he still would wear it but the vbra more the whole way through so the upper still intact which is crazy for a shoe with, 1500 miles but has that dyema so it's really if like I could get it resold and just keep rocking it but and so this is why and I know we talk about this but people were like oh it's a $300 shoe like dude you just paid $100 for a pair of shoes because you got most trail shoes break down at Round 500 or the uppers or something get destroyed something's going to happen or any shoe so you're you just got you could get 1,000 miles out of it 1,200 maybe it also looks great and it looks good I mean it is like I it's it's funny there's some brands that you just you just really like and I think that norta does a good job like satisfy that you immediately recognize their product it it's cohesive it all it it tells the same story in a different way based on use and I just think it's so clean and so good-looking and yeah just so well thought out I mean and I a few satisfied things and I think they're a couple of my favorite things ever um but I also understand like yeah a shirt's a shirt like you can wear a shirt well that somebody asked me so when we were in the mosh pit I was wearing the satisfy shirt with the holes in it yeah and he said is it worth it I said no it's a cotton t-shirt with holes in it right but it it's it is worth it if you buy into the whole satisfy lure hey it is a comfortable t-shirt I'll say that it is but like you but yeah it's right I get it I also that Abra comi what Olympic shirt it feels very similar and it was $40 yeah and but that that's the thing they the other piece the technical pieces like that shirt that you you wore so much that I stopped wearing mine oh yeah the uh tan one uh the western shirt or the river shirt yeah the river shirt that shirt I like the quality and the feel why cuz I wear it because like you know it's like I'll show up and then be Robie and me dressed like going Safari together um yeah that's also a great one but the at least in the shoes like with the norta you're you are getting D like they're going to outlast any other shoe like that's just for sure have you worn any of the NIS out cuz we've gotten several pairs from them um like what do you mean to run in after y' Out Boy you guys got your I'm taking phot I'm taking photos of my o5s with the y'all out boy pit juice jues yeah it looks like I Dida um the Whatchamacallit the like the o1 my original pair that I first got from them MH I wore it casually all over the place wore it for every trail run took it to Tahoe yeah run some of the faster basses runs in it everywhere I've gone the thing while it has some it was an allwhite version so it has some like discoloring from dirt MH but it's it's still super solid oh yeah I have the the satisfy one we got was which is actually the only poor build quality they had cuz there's like a tape on it that was coming off but if anyone had that problem I think they replaced them yeah they did but they uh it wasn't a structural thing it was just a cosmetic thing but bonding still uh that's the one I just wear for if I'm running in this shoe or that one's pretty pretty beat up but like just cosmetically really um anyways they I think they do a great job the o05 is like the o one but somehow better um well it's different it's there it's really lightweight I think it's like in 7 ounce range for my size 10 and a half uh a little bit seven and a half M I think mine was or maybe for yours it might be eight mine was seven okay yeah but that's incredibly light for trail for trail with a full like full coverage uh vbr bottom and like a pretty supportive upper yeah and it's a dyema upper it's a woven

believe it or not let's go all right it is time to talk about another one of our sponsors Lagoon pillows yes Lagoon sorry I was sleeping over here what did you say on your Lagoon pillow I was my head is it's like perfectly comfortable keep my head cool what's super exciting you guys have probably heard us talk about Lagoon a bunch if you listen to this podcast but they are having a huge Black

pillow oh that's a good sale yeah don't sleep on it so yeah go go to their website go take your quiz find out what the pillow is the best one for you and use the code believe to save a bunch of money anyways so that was cool the the oh go we talked about the on one uh yeah the other thing I was going to say was the Nike oh the Nike cuz there's some cool stuff there is there's stuff that we can't see I can tell you this though when I was interviewing the uh designer asley or Ashley the PM um I ask because everybody always asks is the tempo next percent ever coming back and she alluded to saying that some form of that purpose in that design of a shoe will be making a return I didn't get that I heard that the zoomfly six is your close second H watch watch watch the I'll have to watch the video again interpretation I guess that's actually that's actually what I heard cuz I watched it this morning oh you did yeah okay uh it seemed like she said it wasn't but that there will be she either the zoomfly 6 or other things will not make you miss it is kind of the idea zoomfly 6 it's already out yeah but she's saying oh no she said the zoomfly but I I think she was saying at one point what rewatched it because I when I asked her I felt like she was telling me that there was another shoe coming well no because I watched it well okay maybe but I watched it after you said that because I was interested to see what she was saying I'll have to watch and it sounded more like we have other stuff that you're not going to worry about it you know yeah I don't know they are streamlining their whole lineup which is nice so you have airbags and stuff vomo Pegasus structure and then they'll each have a premium plus a plus and a premium plus and a premium and then like the standard so right now you know already that Pegasus has the Pegasus 41 Pegasus plus which looks like the turbo mhm and then you have the pegas premium which is the one with the full length a air bubble at the bottom so that's how that goes so we just got the vomero and we got to see it but we can't really share or talk about it too much the vomo plus and the vomo premium and I'm pretty pumped and if you extrapolate the designs of the Pegasus you could probably figure out some of the things that will be incorporated into the into the both structure and and uh and the I wasn't you guys were going Gaga over some of the structure stuff dude it looked great freaking awesome I thought it was okay okay you guys were like like I was really excited about the vomero stuff I think it was also shocking to think that the structure was going to look good I think maybe that was part of it yeah and it does look really good now but here's the thing I was like okay where do the zoomfly fit into this structure I guess there's racing and maybe because the zoomfly should be with that kind of thinking zoomfly would be the vaporfly and then you'd have vaporfly would be the vaporfly plus and the alphafly would be right vaporfly premium sure that logic works the only thing I'm that makes me a little concerned about all these pluses and premiums and whatnot is that it seems almost are they performance shoes or what are they are they lifestyle shoes because it's there's a very heavy lifestyle vibe to a lot of them yeah I would say look the the Pegasus premium to me looks like a lifestyle shoe running in it though it felt like the Glide ride Max no but like Megan for example is just her premiums were here because they came while she was at that Adidas Retreat I'm excited to see what you think about them and a matter of fact I want you to run those as soon as possible we could do a first thoughts but I also have to I do I already have all my miles in it h yeah I'm interested because and that's not a light shoe just as the vomero is also not they're all coming in around 12 close the premium is is over 12 O for me but the difference is like it really does have a trampoline effect with the airbag and the zoomx that when I I ran when I pulled out I didn't feel that heavy in my hand then I ran I did a 12mile run out of the box and I was like I didn't think it was Heavy at all okay and so when I got back and I posted a picture people like oh it's a break it's heavy I was like no I'm going to go wait and prove these guys wrong and I was like whoa it's 12 and half I was like they're right it's heavy but it doesn't feel like it on your foot I got you okay I I hope people at least give it a a chance before they they just bash it out of out of hand yeah all right well we'll see for sure uh I don't know if there's any I mean Sketchers is back I thought they were dead and I thought they had a good-looking shoe what was that shoe called um I I don't know but it was wait what's the name of the new I can see it on the wall and I can't read it furiosa I think it starts in F though does it frenzy no Fireball I don't know well we'll look it up you'll hear about it soon it was actually a pretty decent looking shoe it's like a Tempo kind of middle Tempo trainer super trainer type thing if it had been the like if they said that's a Razer 7 I would have been like okay yeah but yeah and then a Max like essentially a Max Max cushion shoe that's not the max Road it's not the max road that one felt pretty good I put it on my phone yeah yeah you both tried that on didn't you yeah that was nice so I guess yes although Robbie looked the dude straight in the eyes and said it's no Max Road I mean nothing ever will be that's true it's one of the best shoes ever made I stand by that Husker do Husker don't yeah Max for six and and go run ride 11 yeah and then I'm holding right now the Solomon arog Glide three and they've gone to a super critical foam like that popcorn style I think I'm gonna like that one I do it it uh it's nice and clean looking like it's there's it doesn't look crazy um I'm guessing can you put this on a scale cuz I'm guessing this is going to be a little bit on the heavy side yes sir oh no 9.3 9.3 not bad at all that's not bad and it feels that's got some kush tell me what the stack is on that M because that's got to be like oh I don't know she give me a spec let me see it but I'm gonna say that's 45 that's pretty nice yeah Solomon all right arog Glide three you're new talk to gion about these gion um dude he was running the cross country Championship yeah that was also happening on Thursday morning yeah he's like you can just do it even though I'm from France really yeah how about cross out of our country and run your own race dude I'm just kidding I'm I'm just kidding you're very lovely human you're more than welcome gan gan that dude's cool yeah I'm always like intimidated by him like what he's like uh he he's nice in that way he's a Frenchman and he's nice but you you also feel the disdain coming off him for Americans which I don't blame him I feel he's more of a pace shamer you think so like uh it's nice that you tried running you know because he's probably like a 210 Marathon oh he's super fast he's like uh is it interesting that you like this sport since you are so bad at it it's funny cuz we were talking he ran New York City too this year for fun like I did and he was like yeah it's the best you just run it at like a Tempo pace and I'm like wonder what his like Fun Pace was and now I got to look it up it has to be a 245 like a 230 casual yeah yeah he's definitely fast no he's super cool though I didn't mean to say that about the I was just no I like The Stereotype of the French yeah no I was talking about the cross country so remember how when we were in France and we saw the fire department and they were like fit and handsome dudes uh yeah I guess we were in the supermarket say I saw the Baltimore County or Baltimore City Firefighters yeah not the same oh yeah it looks like they haven't saved something since 1989 uh certainly not a chicken wing yeah just vaping out front oh God actually I would if they were smoking I'd almost feel like okay you're you're getting used to the environment that you're in you know you're getting you're it's like it's like a heart rate training for them yeah yeah absolutely like I want you to be inhaling a little bit of smoke just in case you do inhale some while you're saving someone so that you know what it's like and you the frch days are smoking that's true they do yeah yeah that's probably why they're so healthy over there I did that there's when Jack cop when we were in Paris and he was he was smoking away yeah yeah he was I don't I'm sure that happened um Robie you would know I wouldn't anyway Terry was great we C can we end can we cap off the what how we capped it off yeah y'all Out Boy always y'all Out Boy which is always fun it's always the Brooks party I was not anticipating them to start singing so early we showed up like 30 minutes late upset that we missed Mr bright side cuz we were we were at dinner and when we got there we missed it by like a minute too that is the worst and then they took a break right after it yeah they had a break between sets oh I have to say there's one dude who tried to calm Carl and tailor down and I had to give him the wait there's a what oh you don't know about this they were getting they were getting a little aggressive in the middle and you know it's fine so when the music Started Carl who roduced us to bringing the mosh to the party last year that no one wants nobody wants but that's the thing you think you don't want it and then you want it yeah and it got there but this one guy turned around early in the in the um when the band was playing and you just Taylor and Carl start bumping people and he's like hey you guys almost ruined it last time almost I'm pretty sure they did ruin it no Dez Lyon crowd Sur was insane like it was the best we had a great time so I just looked over at him and told him how I felt about it I know and told him to turn around and like look if you don't want to be in it get out of the front yeah you're he wasn't a PR person was he he I'm sure he's somebody that I shouldn't have been yeah mean to he's definitely listening to this right now if you're listening to this or you told your friends and your friends are listening I was no part of this I was just looking from above situation if you're listening I still feel the same way wow I was I we could be friends like just not on the dance floor yeah there's a okay what's that song that was really popular there's a what on the Dance Floor murder murder was there a murder on the dance there could have been except for t look Taylor myself I don't know about Carl cuz he was bopping around but Taylor and I were down to like I felt like we had violence yeah in us and I didn't expect this from Taylor I think he was he was ready to go I think he had some stuff to drink including possibly Jagger no I think I don't think I of us had anything he was very lovely at breakfast very animated the next morning that's because he was still a hammer um back to teaching thank goodness he got the later flight originally he was supposed to fly out at 6:00 a.m.",

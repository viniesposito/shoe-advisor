  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Brandon the category manager for North America for Solomon and we have a a big brand new Solomon shoe ready for yesing yeah uh big would be an understatement for us totally definitely the biggest shoe that we've come to Market with you got a chance to try it out in Shaman uh this is the S laab ultraglide um so this launches uh February 1st um 41 mm in the heel 35 in the 4ot so definitely the biggest uh stack height that we've come to Market with especially anybody on the market that's that's very high yeah absolutely and and so when you go so high with stack we know there's other complications with it and you guys have come to try to solve that issue in a new way in anything that do knowes that's slab denotes it means it's top Echelon high performance so how how does that come together in a shoe like this so normally we come from slab um from a perspective of working with our athletes in order to achieve a Podium this is kind of the first slab shoe that we've ever built that was uh made not just for the athletes that are up on the podium but any athlete trying to finish an ultra distance race um and just finish an ultra distance race so we've got a three uh three part foam construction that we utilize here um underneath the footed is our energy foam plus so our super critical foam that we're utilizing here we use a footed of that and then we encapsulate it with our standard energy foam that we used in shoes like the slab Genesis that cordney de Walter runs in provides a little bit of stability here but uh really allows the runner to sit down and really be cradled by the firmer foam with the really nice soft bouncy foam underneath their foot so and and it's a little bit different construction than a typical uh carrier foam in a core you said it three pieces so like one side here one side here and then slipping in that really premium high energy High cushion layer right underneath the foot yeah and I think it'd be great for viewers to know that Solomon felt strongly about not putting a plate into a shoe like this yes I mean it's an ultra distance shoe so we wanted to maximize the amount of comfort that you have underneath your foot so we really wanted the consumer to be able to feel that soft cushy foam mile after mile um they've done some work underneath the foot as well so we've added in these divots that we call our release sphere technology that really adds um and helps dissipate um uh the pressure underneath the foot in high pressure areas for ultra distance athletes so really from top to bottom this has been made uh in a way that we've really never done an S laab shoe before yeah I I mean and it's going to appeal to a lot of the same Runners that Solomon has in the past and so many more people I would say the fit it's more generous uh but it also feels very performance oriented I don't want to give too much cuz I have done a ton of miles in this shoe but I mean you're you're on to something something new like big horizons with a shoe like this for it's really exciting times I mean I think we see um what consumer preferences are and what is going on in the market and um most anything we do starts with uh a goal that we have for our slab product we want to take our learnings from the slab product and and bring it to the rest of the market and everything that we do so this is um this is a really exciting time to uh to be at Solomon because I think this is a a new frontier for our s slad product to go totally and one more note on just the shoe in particular I feel like Solomon has in the past always went from slab and filtered it throughout whereas this Ultra Glide series started as the ultra Glide right and then went upward so it's a different approach in that sense it is a different approach there um so moving forward uh in the future Seasons we will have another Ultra Glide that will be the takedown to this um throughout 2025 this will be our answer if somebody wants to know what Solomon's point of view is in uh comfort and in cushioning and in long-distance racing we want it to be the SB ulture Glide we felt very strongly about uh how this is constructed um how much uh how many details and how much um emphasis was put into making this something not just for again Runners on the podium but all runners totally so we wanted this to be what we highlighted and really what we emphasized in 2025 and it's already on your athletes it's already had some pretty big podiums already um and when can we expect this so this will be out in North America on February 1st okay and at what price point uh so it's going to be 250 um part of that is the uh the very unique construction the different materials and everything that we're utilizing here but um like I said with the uh longevity that a consumer is going to be able to get out of this the miles they're going to be able to put on it everything that kind of adds up um into what we're offering here um we really actually see the value for for money here because this is going to be a shoe that's hopefully going to last them mile after mile so yeah and and for premium performance which absolutely I'm going to say this is a premium shoe it feels like a premium shoe that's just what the going rate is these days I feel like it doesn't even have to be justified anymore it's like if you have premium product that's the price you're paying and here we are as premium As It Gets and we're excited to have it in the market yeah it's a great too thank you very much Brandon absolutely thanks",

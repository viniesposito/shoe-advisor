  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers with another running shoe versus in this one we're going to be looking at two New Balance shoes the New Balance 10 v14 and the New Balance Rebel V4 let's see what we all [Music] thought the New Balance 1080 v14 costs \u00a360 or $164.99 it weighs 287 G or 10.1 Oz for men in a size 8 and the drop is 6 mm the New Balance Rebel V4 cost \u00a340 or [Music] $139.99 it weighs 207 G or 7.3 Oz for men in a size 8 and the drop is 6 [Music] mm the New Balance 1080 v14 is a daily shoe built for comfort and accessibility in the previous version of the shoe New Balance modified the fresh Fox midsole to be noticeably softer but with that came a dip in the stability and the versatility of the shoe the Tennesse v14 addresses that with a slightly firmer version of the foam and the overall midsole geometry in addition there's an updated engineered mesh upper to improve the fit and provide better breathability that also includes a good level of padding as well as a soft gusseted tongue on the outsole is a modest layer of rubber across the key areas of the shoe although this doesn't cover the full length of the Midol foam the New Balance Rebel V4 is a daily shoe that's designed for faster training while still providing plenty of cushioning the fuel so foam is a peber Eva blend that offers a soft ride as well as a good level of propulsion with a geometry that's taller and wider than its predecessor the upper is a breathable mesh that uses the Brand's Phantom knit technology to ensure a supportive fit with a good level of padding around the ankle collar on the outsole is a generous layer of rubber across the foref foot as well as strategically placed sections to the rear of the shoe so in terms of these two shoes I definitely think it's a story here of how sizing can vary across new balan's shoes now the 108 14 very much is a true to size fitting shoe for me I've got it in a UK size 8 that is my standard size now the rebel V4 landed for me in an 8 and a half and actually despite being having or having concerns that maybe it might be a little bit long for me actually having an eight and a half has worked out very well and I think feasibly for a lot of people going half a size up in this shoe should make it a better fit overall it's a bit of a similar story to the SC Elite V4 which I had in a size eight and worked well for me used it for the London Marathon a lot of my training runs I think you know it wouldn't have hurt gang half a size up in for me and if you were a little bit in in between sizes or half sizes in the SE Elite V4 I think you know it would be a similar story here with the rebel V4 so for me the 1080 v14 the more padded shoe and the more true size fitting shoe the uh Rebel V4 a lot more like the scite V4 in terms of that upper in terms of that kind of more racing profile and I would go half a size up based on my running time so it for me in these two shoes I'm size eight in the UK these are both size eights t 14 very comfortable shoe plenty of space in the for plenty of space before the big toe um I found it to be very comfortable shoe I've got average width feet and I've had no issues with this shoe at all definitely wouldn't have it in a different different size um the new Bal Rebel V4 the fit on this is a little bit different it's a faster shoe it's a little bit leaner the upper is not as uh structured as the T v14 so you end up with this sort of um soft uh looser fit to to the upper um I've not had any problems with it uh found it very comfortable and as a result it's it's a bit stretchy as well so you can sort of um press your toes against it and it will move out but I i' found a similar fit in both these shoes but I would say it's a little bit more restrictive in the rebel V4 uh so just take that into consideration but I would say to my size in both of these shoes Okay some of you might look at this versus and say that these two shoes aren't necessarily that comparable but they are both daily shoes they do fit into a similar category and for some people it might be difficult to choose between these two shoes based on the information that you get from the brands and that sort of thing the 10 v14 is a shoe that's predominantly designed for ticking off the miles it's a daily shoe that isn't the most versatile daily shoe out there it's not bad um it's a shoe that really uh is a a cushion daily shoe that's designed for doing all your milesin so whether you're going out and doing a 5k uh recovery run whether you're going out to do a 20K uh comfortable run easy run um consistent Pace run it's fine for those things it's it's a shoe there that's just designed to eat up the miles it's not really designed to do much more um and it does that very very well it's a very comfortable shoe um it has a nice balanced Mido it's an update from the Mido that is in the ten v13 and the ten 10 V3 was very very soft and some people didn't like that me it was less stable uh and wasn't great for some people whereas the ten v14 very stable great platform on it good balanc M it's a little bit firmer than the tv13 as a result much more accessible to a lot more people who maybe need a little bit more stability um and a little bit more responsiveness it's it's definitely a shoe that you can use for faster sessions than the tv13 um but I wouldn't use this for intervals or anything like that at my speed I would use it purely for ticking off the miles hourong runs 10ks 15ks that sort of thing where I'm just going out and I just want a comfortable shoe that does the job um it's sort of a holiday shoe uh if you took it away you could do bit faster sessions in it but not I definitely wouldn't pick this specifically to do those those sorts of runs with the New Balance Rebel V4 is a shoe that is designed for faster daily training it's a very comfortable shoe I actually quite like this shoe for easy runs it's a a much softer midsole than you get in the 108 v14 it um is lighter than 108 v14 it just as a result it's it's a lot quicker it's a lot poppier uh that midle um it for me me it really caps out at about 15K I do find it a little bit too squishy for me um and I wouldn't want to do longer sessions in this unless I was running really fast um in this shoe but yeah it's a little bit squishier in the midsole uh it's definitely a shoe that's designed for really picking up the pace it excels when you're going you're doing interval sessions Tempo sessions fart leg sessions anything like that where you want to pick up the pace and you want a lighter shoe on the feet um but you still want a bit of comfort in it as well um I think this I think the uh Revel V4 is more versatile than the 108 v14 if you're going up to a certain distance um I definitely think there's you'll get a lot more miles out the 1080 v14 it's definitely a more solid stable shoe that you can tick off a lot of miles Rebel V4 i i i exclusively use this shoe for shorter efforts where I may need to go faster and when I mean faster I mean training Pace I use this shoe for picking up the pace to 4 minute kmers that sort of thing where I'm actually training for a ra saw training for uh training to improve my speed this is a good shoe to go for especially if I'm not looking to use a plate for any reason or if you're if you're looking at buying a a training shoe and you don't want to have a plate in it this is a really really good option um definitely a great shoe for running faster in um as I said I actually like running in doing slower miles in this recovery miles easy runs up to a certain distance I actually think the Reel V4 is very good for those so um both daily shoes but for different reasons the outsole on these even though they come from same brand uh the outsole on the rebel V4 it does have really good rub coverage on the front of the shoe not a lot on the back um and this fuel cell mle is a little bit exposed in those areas I've done about 70k in this shoe so far it's not really got any major signs of wear or tear because this rubber is pretty good and it sticks out quite far um bit of wear on the actual rubber itself I always run um R rub down that section there but still looking pretty good 10 v14 has uh outside is absolutely fine uh but there's a lot of exposed uh midsole foam on it in about 70k running I've not really seen any wear or te on the midsole cuz it's got a pretty good layer of rubber on it but I definitely think the outso on the rebel V4 is better so in terms of my running time with these two shoes I say it's been very good overall these are very much daily trainer style shoes but these are daily trainers with definitely very different profiles I would say you know different runs I would ultimately use them for there maybe is a little bit of overlap But ultimately I think they are very different in terms of those kind of um daily trainer profiles now one of the big reasons for that is the difference in the weights the new B Rebel V4 is significantly the lighter of the two shoes the weight is more in keeping you know getting towards racer style shoes so from that point of view if you want something that feels a little bit more spritey to run in it's going to be the rebel V4 now 1080 v14 isn't a heavy shoe per se particularly for a kind of Max cushion shoe But ultimately if you want the lighter shoe then the rebel V4 is going to give you that and then when you get into the midsoles and what you're going to get from them and what they're ultimately going to deliver for me the rebel V4 getting out running in this shoe you got that fuel cell and midell on there which is a mix of Eva and peber so you're getting something from those kind of more racing Focus Shoes something a bit more lively bouncy um a little bit more aggressive The Rocker is a little bit more aggressive there I've always found I've got out in this shoe it's really wanted to kind of push me forward you know from hillt toe a lot quicker compared to the 1080 v14 which as the Fresh Foam X which has very different properties you know and very different kind of roles ultimately it's about protection and comfort it's probably you know has a has a plusher feel to it as well too you know it's not too firm on the uh rubel V4 either but it's definitely got you know a bigger stack there as well of that foam um and it's really about kind of as I said providing that protection and comfort ultimately what I think ultimately does is going to be something that's going to be comfortable over those easy runs over those recovery runs be a good uh kind of run to run longer in as well too probably more so than the 1080 v13 you know there is a rock in here it's a a more gentle rocker than the one in the rebel V4 but it's just enough to kind of help you tick over in this shoe and as I said you know if you are looking for something or a daily trainer where you know you really want something that's just going to help you kind of cover that mileage and that is a shoe you know the um 10 v14 will do that the rebel V4 just feels a more kind of outwardly kind of faster shoe a more uptempo shoe I think a shoe maybe doesn't feel as comfortable as the 1080 v14 running a little bit longer maybe you want a little bit more in that mid soole to kind of protect But ultimately it could run or work for kind of moderate to kind of uh kind of long distances ultimately but I think for me it's kind of those shorter distances those kind of shorter faster sessions as well too that's where it's really exceled for me from a kind of outso point of view I think you're probably you know you're going to get a little bit more out of the 1080 v14 they're kind of covering the same types of areas ultimately in terms of out Souls the grip has been absolutely fine for me in kind of wetter condition as well too but I think if I was going Offroad on lighter Trails I'd feel more comfortable doing it in the 1080 v14 so as I said I think these are daily trainer shoes that you know go about their business in very different ways I think if you stick to the types of runs that they work for then they can be very effective in that kind of respect but I think ultimately if you are looking for a more comfortable shoe particularly over longer distances I think the 1080 v14 is going to give you that and give you a nice feeling to kind of roll you through those runs as well too the rebel V4 a more faster feeling shoe feels like a more of a companion to the SE V4 taking the pressure running in that shoe and doing some of your sessions in this shoe and giving you it from a kind of lighter profile as well okay my verdict on these two shoes said it in the uh run test section that they're not necessarily designed for the same thing but you can use them for pretty similar things uh I think it really comes down to the sort of running that you're doing if you are if your daily miles generally are quite fast you're doing a lot of interval sessions in a week you're doing faster sessions you want something to go shorter faster to really pick up the pace re V4 is definitely the shoe to go for if you're doing a lot of longer sessions if you're doing loads and loads of miles at a really comfortable easy pace which for me would be about 5 minute km go for the 108 v14 it's just a very solid shoe very stable great for ticking off loads and loads of mils I'm marathon training at the moment I've used this quite a lot for um just just churning out my basically um nice consistent Pace very good for that and I think it's a lot more accessible to more people but if you're looking for versatility you're not going to get a lot of that from the 1080 v14 you're probably going to be looking at the rebel V4 if you're the sort of Runner that actually wants to have a shoe that you can pick up the pace properly in and do real training sessions uh at faster Pace um but when it comes to things like durability and stuff I have a feeling that the 108 is just going to be far better because the midsole on the um Rebel V4 is a little bit squishy for me and I can I can feel it being less dense than the 1080 v14 so might take with you should go for the new B 1080 v14 or the new B reil World V4 as I said these are shoes that are very different for me and I would use them very differently I think it really depends on what you want from a daily trainer style shoe if you want something that has a more of an uptempo edge and definitely is one for kind of shorter sharper sessions and also for slightly longer runs as well too and you want the lighter shoe more livey shoe I'd be going for the reble V4 if you're a little bit concerned about having a shoe that maybe is that little bit more aggressive and more kind of propulsive in terms of that ride and you want something that can still work for kind of more comfortable running can be a bit more equipped or better equipped at those longer runs in terms of protection then I would be going for the new B 1080 v14 but if I had to picked between the two shoes I think I've just had more fun in the rebel V4 while it probably lacks a little bit more for those longer runs I think for the those daily runs and the runs that I'd be going you know from of 5K 10K 15 20K this is a shoe that I think works very well at those uh kind of distances and I think for faster Paces as well too as I said the 1080 v40 is not a bad shoe but if I had to pick i' would be going the rebel V4 which is actually cheaper as well and I think you're going to get a lot more value out this shoe particularly if you want a more uptempo daily trainer in your rotation that's it from us on this versus thanks a lot for watching don't forget to like subscribe click that little bell

  "text": "a simple Do-it all shoe for a bargain price isn't that what all Runners want but manufacturers make it so hard to find constantly trying to sell us Niche shoes so that we end up spending more money well today I've got an absolute Gem of a shoe in to test out and if the rumors are true this could well be the bargain shoe of the Year this shoe joins Adidas's Legacy Adi Zero range of their high performance running shoes joining the Super Shoe adios Pro the super Speedy Tumi Sen the classic uptempo daily Boston the SL2 is a classic daily shoe where you can pick up your pace and have some fun with your runs and that's what we will be reviewing today so St relax let's get the Adidas SL2 review done as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money so I can give you that completely impartial 100% honest review let me know down in the comments some other shoe reviews that you'd like to see coming up we just putting a little list together for some testing we're going to do over the summer I'd love to have your input so let me know down in the comments and if you like these kind of videos please like them and share them with a friend and as I say let us know down in the comments what you want to see coming up right let's chat about the differences between this and the outgoing model the first one being we've got an updated upper which is now more lightweight and a little bit more breathable well that's what Adidas are telling us the second one we've now got this fulllength strip of the Light Strike Pro Adidas's premium foam that runs the whole length of the shoe and then that's surrounded by Adidas's up updated Light Strike 2.0 foam as well as a carrier foam meaning that this model is so much softer and also more responsive with these really much better updated phones and the third update is it's now much lighter as well coming in at 287 G that's ridiculous for me in my UK size 12 well let's get stuck into the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like this this is your classic daily trainer for me this is a 5K 10K up to half marathon racing or training shoe yes of course you can do some marathon training for your easy dogs I wouldn't personally want to take it out for a super long run the price of this shoe is fantastic this shoe sent me back just 98 here in the UK from sport shoes against an RRP of \u00a30 Stack Heights we've got a 36 mil stack heite at the back of the shoe 9 mm drop overall and as I just said at 287 G very very light weight for a shoe like this it's a neutral shoe the upper we've got this lovely engineered mesh very traditional feeling here the midsole we've got a lovely fulllength layer of Adidas's light strip Pro foam and that's encapsulated by Adidas's updated Light Strike 2.0 Pham treating as a carrier foam just to add extra durability into the shoe there's no carbon plate in this shoe the outsole is Adidas's own rubber outsole it's not the Continental one which you sometimes see on on most of the Adi Zero range but still pretty damn good at this price point at the time of filming and the release there are no different widths available hopefully they will be along soon we'll chat about that in some of the negatives coming up there are three different colorways available at the moment and this was pretty much true to size for me I would say if you're between sizes you're not really sure then definitely go half a sized up added us on their own website tell you to go half a size up but it was just about okay but if you're totally unsure go half a size up right let's get stuck into my lights my first light with this shoe is just the sheer versatility that you can get with it the traction surprisingly good with Adidas's own very basic outso here but it works really well this will be a really great shoe to get the majority of your training runs and potentially some races done in it as well whether you're training for your 5K 10K or half marathon or even some marathon training Mars in there as well and it's just a really fun shoe to run in it's so engaging it brings a smile to your face it's Poppy it's just got that just the right amount of softness and responsiveness a really fantastic shoe to get the vast majority of your runs done and it's just incredible at this price point as well I didn't have any slipping issues got a really good lock down at the back of the shoe didn't have to use any heel lock lacing feet just felt really secure in the shoe no hot spots no blisters the second like with this shoe is just the lightweightness of it it's Snappy it's fun to run in the mid Soul offers a really engaging ride at this price point is just incredible really of course it's not as fast as some of the assisted shoes with their rods or plates in other manufacturers but this shoe equally is certainly no slouch for that completely unassisted very traditional ride and my third like with the shoe as I've touched on a lot so far is just the sheer value that this shoe offers it really is unheard of at this sort of price point usually the Foams in this area are hard dull just a real afterthought of manufacturers Just chucking any of thing in there it doesn't really matter but added ass have for some reason added their premium phones to this entrylevel shoe and it's just fantastic the durability should be really solid here I've only done three runs in the shoe so far but it's holding up really really well and although I haven't really be able to run in the rain in this shoe because we're here in the summer in the UK and the weather's actually quite good for a change I really think it should be pretty good the build quality at this price point is just exceptional as well I've heard a few people complaining about the laces are a bit cheap and yeah they are you may may want to swap them out but for me they were absolutely fine so nothing to worry about just a fantastic brilliant value shoe that really really delivers moving on to my dislikes the shoe is definitely on the narrow side quite a traditional Adidas quite European fitting shoe here it's definitely a lot narrower than the Boston and the adios Pro and other shoes in their range as I said earlier their own website does suggest to get half a size up here and that is is what I'd recommend if you're at all unsure between two sizes but if you do have wide feet then really I'm afraid this is going to be one to avoid hopefully edit us will release a wider fitting option here which will be fantastic but sadly at the moment this shoe really is for your narrower or standard width feet [Music] people so do I recommend the Adidas SL2 well as you can probably tell very very much so I'm definitely going to be keeping it in my rotation this shoe is definitely not going on eBay we're definitely going to be shifting I'm going to enjoy putting many more miles in the shoe just perfect for someone looking for that standard traditional feel no plates no rods none of all that technology that some people love in their shoes but some people really don't yes you can pay more to get the Boston with that assisted ride and it is a little bit wider as well but for the majority of people this would be a really good daily shoe now compared to the other budget options out there at the moment two of the really good ones like the pluma pluma Puma velocity Nitro three and the rebot float ride this just offers a far more engaging ride the foam in here you're getting added as's light stripe Pro foam and that's just their top end foam that you see in their 200b plus shoes yes it's just a small Slither in there but that really brings the shoe to life it's so much fun to run in and that sort of ride is just something you're not getting at this price point yes there's a couple of nitpicky things I would like a little bit more stability in this shoe cuz it's just a little bit on the narrow side nice it's a little bit wider if if I was going to be using this for them dedicated Marathon long runs and things like that but for me at the moment this is unbeatable value at this price definitely the best shoe you can buy around about that1 price point so I'd really recommend picking up a pair before Adidas realize what they're on to here and put the price up so very much recommended now clearly a lot of you guys watching like myself want to get some exceptional value out there running which is why you're looking at a shoe like this we've got a really great video coming up next all about a load of Kit and Tech to help you prove your running when you're on a budget so check out that video up here now keep on working hard guys keep on it done and we'll see you very soon in the next one",

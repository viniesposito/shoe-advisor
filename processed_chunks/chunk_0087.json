unreal that's insane too and for snowbird too to repeat it Snowbird is a true true accomplishment and that's a wrap from Snowbird so good we're going to do a breakdown video of this race because I think I think I don't know yet I got a lot of good footage and it just played out very interestingly and so I want to break it down for you not right now I got to hit the road time to get back to those babies back to Denver I'm going to catch an airplane and bottom line is if is fun energy at Circ races it's uh shorter steeper and fun all right so if you're looking for that type of racing remember I think I mentioned this um I mentioned this three or 4 days ago if you have not found your niche in the racing world and you're just like man I don't know like I don't enjoy uh one M races around a track or I don't enjoy 50k races in the mountains or I enjoy running 100 miles around a track the key is that you just keep exploring because this is uni actually Julian the founder of this race uh he just told his story like why he started the cir series and it was because when he was getting into trail running you know 14 years ago he couldn't find any races that were shorter steeper races and he so he made it he just made it out of out of nothing the cir Series so it's Absolut I think there's six or seven of them uh great energy great meeting all the vendors uh great companies I'll give some shout outs throughout the video and oh man at the end of the day it feels good to be back in some air conditioning cuz it was toasty out um there's the first place guy he's uh he's a college guy I think or something he's young oh my goodness Good Times so I hope you enjoyed that if you I don't say this too often but if you enjoyed the race footage you know share this video spread it around Facebook Instagram Twitter I would appreciate it and it helps out Circ as well I didn't expect actually to get a uh a medal I guess because it's a us it's it was the USA Track and Field Trail championships that's why like top 10 get a medal I thought only the top three so that was kind of cool uh appreciate your usatf throwing down in Snowbird Utah seeking Beauty out there onward and upward I am not at least I don't think so no I don't believe I'm racing next weekend I think it's time to get back to training everybody all right we'll toss it to the last Snowbird race where we flew the w 5 years ago all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other there",

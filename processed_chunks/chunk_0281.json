  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers and in this latest video breaking down the best running watches you can buy right now we're looking at high-end running watches from each of the big Brands including Garmin coros Po and sunto we're going to be talking about topof the range watches here that tends to mean devices with the best specs biggest battery lives along with the most comprehensive Suites of features for training navigation and Smartwatch tools now many of these premium running watches pack bigger higher quality screens they also have the latest sensor and Hardware more rugged build with ramped up durability often they're using more premium materials like sapphire crystal displays and titanium or aluminium cases to be more resilient but also to give them a more stylish finish and to offset the size in a bid to stay lighter on the wrist these are the watches that increasingly come with eye watering price tags too we're talking running watches costing north of 500 generally and some getting perly close to ,000 pounds now we've tested and considered names you might recognize from the Phoenix the Enduro from Garmin to the Vantage V3 and the grit X2 Pro from Polar the choros vertic two s is in there and I caught up with run testers Nick and Mike to get into the pros and cons and to pick our favorite so watch on to find our top picks of the best high-end running watches so then we're going to kick off with the Garmin and in this we've got the Garmin 03 we've got the Garmin Phoenix 8 with all its Myriad options between solar and AMOLED and we've got the Garmin 4Runner 965 Nick do you want to kick us off with the first of these let's have a look at the Phoenix 8 to begin with why is this one made it to the list and I think I guess we should address the fact that there are lots of different options within this category as well yeah I think we've all tested the Phoenix 8 AMOLED there were three different sizes we actually all tested the largest size I think but you're getting a similar experience across the AMOLED ranges and then the solar ranges probably are more similar to the Phoenix 7 Pro and the Enduro 3 but with all Garmin in this highend category you're getting some features here that you just don't get from other watches and Garmin has been I think quite dominant in the highend category for quite a while as a result because it has I think the best navigation tools it's got exceptional maps with loads of nifty features like Klein Pro you're getting really intensive training analysis which is the same across these three Gins and then the phoenix8 then stands out by having a mic and speaker and a dive proof design new user interface that you're also getting the uro 3 but not on the 4un 965 I don't think it's kind of an in between an old 4Runner and a Phoenix Software but yeah the Phoenix 8 is the top watch in the line now with the AMOLED or the non AMOLED option with those extra Smartwatch features and that's basically what Garmin is creating with the Phoenix I think is the aiming for the ultimate Watch the watch that can do everything you've got the best sports tracking they offer the best navigation the best training analysis the best smart features they offer Allin one watch at an incredibly high price but you're getting everything and it does stand apart I think from the crowd within the sport watch Arena because of that it's just whether it stands apart enough to justify you know spending the extra on it compared to other high-end watches or even older watches we have picked this as one of our best watches of the year so clearly it's a standout but Mike within that kind of feature package what is it that you think sets it truly apart from the watch like the Enduro Al the four and a 965 I think it's it's fundamentally giving you the best of what Garmin has to offer that's ultim and if that is what you want from a running watch then ultimately this is the watch that's going to give it to you and I think we've spoken about the fact that you know with this move to Amo displays you know that compromise you ultimately may think you you you're kind of making on kind of full kind of fully-fledged SmartWatches that have am displays you're not really making that with the Garmin Phoenix a and if you are going for the solar charging version as well what we're seeing with that is that you know G is able to kind of you know enhance and improve the ability of that technology as well too so there's Innovation happening in the Phoenix range as well as well as kind of consolidating it's already done very well in its Phoenix watching watches you know giving you that very good core experience but ultimately making sure that you're you know you're not making a lot of compromises here and that's ultimately why it's going to really stood out for us I I suppose then the step up on something like the 4965 is the design you're getting this steel or titanium watch a really rugged watch of a sapphire screen if you get the Sapphire model and you know it's heavier it's biger but it gives you that more Adventure proof watch and then compared to uro 3 gin hasn't brought the smarts to that and you don't necessarily get quite the top end experience of the Phoenix 8 well still getting a top end experience but he's almost like gar is trying to give you those three options and then Juro 3 then extends the battery life a little bit although fenix8 is pretty much a monster on that front as well but yeah there's like it's like three little niches Within These high-end watches for G you've got the lightweight 965 that's a bit cheaper like much lighter much smaller very geared up for lots of sport and then the more adventurous Phoenix and uro and then the Phoenix then adds in all those smarts as well I guess at times when you actually sit down to kind of review this and you go through the list of features and how comprehensive it is for the Phoenix 8 there is so much that you could kind of test and compare for me the standout thing for the Phoenix 8 was getting battery life that you're not sacrificing too much for that AMOLED display which has always been a bit of a consideration for me but running them side by side at the uro 3 and the Phoenix 8 AMOLED 51 mil there wasn't really that much difference in terms of the sort of weekly training drop off now if we move on to the Enduro I think one thing I do like about the Enduro is the sort of slightly more lightweight build that it just feels a little bit more comfortable on the wrist if you're looking for all of those kind of mapping and navigation you're looking for that kind of full Suite of of tools outside of the Smartwatch tools but you want something that's kind of lighter and slightly more easy to wear 24/7 with a little bit of extra battery life that's where the Enduro really has the appeal for me I don't personally necessarily have to have the AMOLED screen I think it's a really nice to have so if you're willing to forgo that and you don't mind having some of the extra Smartwatch smarts the voice activation the uh The Voice tools the voice notes all of that kind of stuff then I think the Enduro at the price actually now kind of for me represents potentially the best value Garmin in within this kind of top end bracket yeah I think Garmin did exactly what they needed to do with the uro line with the third version they kind listen to what people want from the uro people want that battery life they want a rugged but ideally lightweight design they're not looking for smarts I think they could even go further with the uro 4 and strip out music entirely and things like that and just really focus on you know Maps battery life accuracy you know reliability in tough conditions and then they brought the price down which you just don't see anywhere you know watch is certainly not with the Phoenix 8 so yeah I think thejo 3 was a a real you know win for the year for Garmin because it did all those things which is the right thing to do for that line and actually now makes it different to the Phoenix where I think the previous model was kind of oh it's like the Phoenix 7x plus you know now it's different and then obviously we've got quite a drop down to the Garmin 4 and a 965 in terms of price Mike what what kind of things would people be buying the 965 for over and above the other two I think fundamentally what you look at at 965 and we've talked about design and it's you know if you are not the kind of person that wants this kind of big hulking watch on your wrist but you want the functionality of a phoenix or an injury that's ultimately what you're getting you're obviously getting the am display was the first one of the first Garmin Foreigner watches to have an Amal display as well too and despite it being an older watch it still very much kind of holds up and I think will hold up for a lot of people in terms of the level of training and the mount you know they're going to be using this watch it's giving you that good mix of Smartwatch and sports watch and running watch functionality now it is running on slightly older software which uh you we're now seeing on the new Phoenix and the injo 3 and you know fundamentally won't be roll backed but I don't think in ter in essence you are going to be or a lot of people are going to be missing much from what we're seeing from those changes with those two watches and I think if you wanted things like mapping and navigation that you're going to get on those more expensive watches and I'm going to play very good again core run tracking experience and that kind of mix of Smartwatch and sports watch and that's kind of what the 965 is going to give you in a slightly less durable design But ultimately at probably a more likable um price that's you fundamentally is going to probably be a lot more affordable going forward as well too so you're sacrificing the screen's not quite as um as durable as you'll find on the the Phoenix 8 and the Enduros right but you'll also sacrifice quite a chunk in battery life I think the max accuracy battery life for the 4 and a 965 19 hours in that mode so a big drop actually that's one of the I think for me is one of the major sacrifices if you're going to come down to this I do think for some people this will be a watch that has a styling that'll appeal more to them than the kind of big Hench kind of rugged looks of the adventure watches and I think it's actually a really goodlook watch it's it's one of my favorite within the 4Runner range Nick what what do you think yeah I love this watch and I would say on the battery live drop off I think that really differentiates it between them because I think if you're looking at day-to-day use the 965 last pretty good it's like six or seven days as named watch it's that single activity where probably You're Expecting the people who are looking at those Ultras to be looking at the more rugged watches that then have that single activity you know massive time even in the most accurate mode like the Enduro and the Phoenix and that's kind of different the 4 965 feels much more like you know more a marathon as watch you know doing lots of training you want a lightweight watch it's still got the biggest screen the same size screen in a in a small design I love it it's probably the one I prefer at all of them because it is so lightweight and I have skinny wrists and stuff like that but yeah and what you lose you know you do lose on that single activity but day to-day the battery life drop off is still there because the Enduro and the phoenix8 now lasts so long but for the size of watch you get a pretty good kind of day today amount of use out of it and just really yeah feels like a Road Runner's Watch you know I have scratched the screen and running an ultra vit and I did Venture onto the trails with it but only a little scratch it's still usable but you do you do sacrifice that kind of thing with it but you get a lot a much lighter watch that's easier to sleep with for sure so that's the Gins we've also got two polers on this list we've got the polar Vantage V3 which was the first uh polar to bring an AMOLED screen and then we've got the polar grit X2 Pro obviously a slightly more rugged design essentially what you're getting with these two watches is the same Suite of uh software and features and tracking across kind of your training performance navigation and the kind of slightly limited sort of Smartwatch tools that you'll get you're just differentiating these by the design the build the materials and the battery life so Mike give us a quick run through of uh how you kind of split these two up if people are thinking about them well I think you kind of mentioned it there I think I think which which is good actually and what we're seeing in Polo's range particularly this year is that it's really trying to offer a consistent software experience across its watches which I think you know that's something that you want to see you want to see as much as you see in that kind of Cheaper watch you do in these kind of more High you know expensive high-end watches so you know it's h it's playing a bit of catch up ultimately in terms of the competition so you know we're finally getting kind of mapping the M mapping support we've kind of wanted from these watches you're obviously getting the Amed display there as well too and ultimately giving you that as we talked about that battery life that you know feels like it's it's worth having am a display and you're not having you charging it on a regular basis I think a lot of things that polar has doing really well outside of its um kind of run you know core run tracking experience which is very good and very solid overall I think we've we've all kind of shared a very good experience with it is that it starting to look a little bit more you know from a training analysis point of view looking in terms of recovery you know looking a little bit more on sleep I I think for me it's probably the most reliable in terms of sleep tracking you know no device is perfect from that point of view but I think in terms of running watches I found for me personally the the sleep tracking has been very good in terms of using that information to guide you in terms of you know recommendations you know there's a lot happening from the training analysis point of view I think ultimately you are just looking at the designs from these two watches very as I said it's it's very much about being that having that consistent experience from a software point of view and a performance as well too you obviously getting that new Elixir um kind of sensor array which for me I don't think it's quite delivered that you know upping in kind of performance overall but I think in terms of it bringing in new metrics that Polo can look at from a day-to-day basis and allow that to inform what you you know better and guide you in terms of what you should do and what your data might be telling you I think you know it's a step in the in the right direction for Polar ultimately and that's kind of what we've seen with the vage V3 and the kind of more rugged grit X2 Pro and we've also got a little bit of boosted durability with the grit X2 Pro obviously it's a built to be that kind of more rugged in some ways it's sort of designed to feel like a competitor to the Phoenix 8 but maybe doesn't have that kind of full capacity or full capability that that watch does Nick if you're thinking about the differences between these two what what are the preferences that you found within the Vantage V3 or the polar git X2 Pro that would sort of make you choose one of these above the other yeah it is really that difference design it's it's a bit like the 4 a 965 versus the Phoenix 8 you've got that lighter Vantage I think it's a nice design for me it's not so chunky on the wrist it's maybe a little bit less durable but it's still you know pretty pretty long I not any problems with durability on the Polar I think other than that kind of build quality and this little bit ticking battery life with the uh with the gex pro it's it's really very much the same experience and that is a little bit you know good thing but I do think that is where polar lacks a little bit in this high-end category is that the it's a bit slightly tired I think their user interface and their General software I think needs a bit of a refresh just slightly award watches to use a little bit more than other brands which are updating quite a lot quicker I think they're releasing software updates and there lot of little things I find when I use a polar watch that are just a little bit harder to do than on other sports watches um so I do think uh they they need to catch up a little bit on that and refresh it a little bit and like I said I think problem more I think they have now is they've really got the fundamentals in place now the maps are there they they've now got accurate dual band GPS which they didn't have or they introduced it with the ignite line and they've got you know an impressive backup software system that people have liked for a long time in poaf flow I think they do need to refresh that as well a little bit though but I do think they don't have all the features that g offering and they are resolutely sticking to quite high prices polar and I think that is their problem in this high end category is if you go toe-to-toe with the Phoenix 8 or you know even the Phoenix 7 frankly you've got to produce the goods and I still think they're struggling on that front a little bit other things there are some features that I think that are quite unique to PO that I really like you know I like the fuel wise fueling recommendations for sort of planning and racing strategy particularly for Ultra I think it kind of simplifies that process I quite like Hill splitter as a feature where you get to see your you know your Hill um segments broken down after the event to see your climbing descents and your speeds and that broken down there are little bits of kind of unique kind of polar features which I think are smattered in there but overall it does feel they are like they're a little bit lightweight and I think that also translates over into the Smartwatch tools you know you're there's no offline music it's got music controls and there's just a few bits that at these price points you now kind of expect to have yeah and and the battery life is very good for singal activities but they they polar Watchers just do drain fast outside this activity so even if you you know can go and knock out one of these Mega Ultras you run Kieran you're still going to have to charge it you know every five six seven days so um it's yeah that that I think that longevity doesn't you know help with the kind of again comparisons to other brands which is that's the hard thing of all these things like you're being compared to very best watches in this price bracket so it's hard there's one other thing which I've noticed as well which I only spotted this time around polar when you get to 9% it stops you doing a workout right yeah that's bad that's really annoying yeah yeah that's really annoying so you've already got 90% capacity it might be I want I want to go back and ask them whether or not the battery life estimates are based on that 90% equals the amount they've they've claimed otherwise you're just losing but anyway that's a bit that's a bit annoying they kind of just slowly shut things down and stop you using it a certain point 9% on the ver on the vertx 2 is like three or four days well yeah I me this yeah yeah exactly you can still go for long so anyway yeah speaking of the vertx 2 we do have the choros vertx 2 s on the list now I think one of the main things about this when it first came out was we thinking going to get a more compact vertex but the S doesn't mean small what it probably means is that it's done a small step up from the vertic to so it's pretty much the same watch we've lost Mike Kieran we've going to make that clear now Mike's gone he uh he will not talk about these last two watches he ran out of battery ironic given the watch you're about to discuss actually he's he's out of battery we we can't record again we've got to go I thought he threw his mic against the wall and just strolled out he's done enough two watches left to go we've got the coros vertx 2s got the sunto rose C up the coros verx 2s I think one of the main things to say about this straight off the bat is when it first came out the S we all thought was going to mean cor was going to produce a slightly more compact rugged watch which I know a lot of people would actually like they want some of the same features they want the same rugged build but in something that feels a bit lighter on the wrist that is not what happened the S kind of stands for in my head like a small step on from the chorus vertic too but essentially what you're getting is pretty much the same with a few upgrades Nick what are those what are those key upgrades that we've got just a little accuracy boost you know mainly in the GPS the vertex 2 was I think the first multiband watch we tested certainly the first one I tested seemed like it was be very exciting didn't really deliver the kind of GPS leap that I was hoping for they then saw with things like Garmin watches and sunto watches and now vertx 2s is a very accurate multiband watch on GPS I think the heart rate accuracy was meant to improve as well I didn't notice that so much in my testing um and other than that you have pretty much the same kind of package and that is one thing corus does across his whole range is you get the same kind of package in all of its watches uh really like even right down to the PACE Pro and the pace 3 you're going to get very similar kind of training analysis and software it's just the vertx 2s is the Beast the one that can survive in all conditions take it up mountains Smash It repeatedly against rocks and nothing will happen and and then Mega battery life right I think I is this the most long-lasting it's just for me it did Outlast the injo and testing but it's it's pretty close but it's crazy longlasting isn't it it's got you'll get 43 hours for this in Max accuracy mode so it's not quite in Duro but it's still really good and if you put yeah it's one of those if you stick it in a Cupboard it's got that Nokia thing where it just won't die the other thing it the battery life actually does come down a little bit against the vertic to which is interesting they've lost a little bit like other things that aren't here obviously there's offline M or something there is here but there's offline music but it's a bit of a faf there's no support for Spotify or dieser if you're looking for those things that's a bit of a question there is no flashlight as well so if you're thinking about being out there hasn't got that GAR kind of fedix sort of flashlight but it's a solid solid kind of reliable watch for the most part I yeah I really like it is definitely a step on for me from the vertic 2 though again I think if you want you know you can look back for deals of the vertic 2 and you're probably not going to be that disappointed yeah I I think it's it's it's good one I think what you're getting in terms of value with the vertic to us is incredible materials like it does come in a bit cheaper than you know the other watches in this category if you're looking at titanium Sapphire models in particular unless you find what is on the sale and yeah I just think it doesn't really offer the same full experience you get from Garmin in particular you can certainly find previous models of the Phoenix and that kind of thing at the same kind of price that that that I think it's just a struggle here I think corus is much more competitive at the lower area but if you are this is a really good watch it does the job it's very Hardy it's longlasting like again this is one that on day-to-day battery life will just Outlast other watches because it doesn't do so much in between activities and you know it's really good watch deserves its place in this category but it's one that I think the full package isn't there to compete with G you've got Maps but the navigation tools aren't as good you've got music but you can't link up to Spotify like you say so you always end up I always end up finding like albums from when I had digital files so in my team it's like the Arcade Fire like original album gets brought out to test and stuff like that so not quite there on those kind of features but there on accuracy long lasting and rugged design I guess last but not least we have the sunto race which I think in many ways as out choros choros and what it does you know it's coming with a really good all round package you know outad screen dual frequency GPS it's not the lightest watch but it's got quite you know sort of nice s premium build and it comes in a really competitive price point which is dropping even in the deals as we speak which is making it even more you know difficult to dismiss again it's not the most fully featured it's not the most capable watch on this list there are gaps uh the UI I think for the software it's not as smooth or as easy to use as some of the other devices but when you start to factor in the price and what you're getting turning this watch down is becoming more and more difficult right yeah I mean we gave suo like they didn't win brand of the year or get runner up in our recent Awards but they got a nod because they just brought out really cheap amazing watches and it's like the thing that we've been crying out for Browns to do is like you can't go toe-to-toe with Gino features because they've been doing it a lot longer and they're just nailing all these features so you need to pick some features the essentials the key ones nail those coming at a lower price and that's how you compete and it's exactly what sunto did they got incredible GPS accuracy like really good multi accuracy they've got good maps on there they've got good training analysis it's really like very much the training Peaks style training analysis that's familiar to lots of people and it's a watch that it's not actually my personal style but I can see it's a good-looking watch and some people really like the look of it with that kind of beveled like metal ring and a really really you know rugged design at that lower price so it's ticking a lot of key features and really good B life as well I think both in terms of single use and day-to-day use it is like going to do the job so if you're looking for a really focused watch in all those key areas which are my key areas like I'm not so worried about the music and stuff like that then it does it really well and sunto has started to really up the pace of its updates to improve things like things like the little bits of lag they had in the software and in general just little complaints there are certainly still complaints with the UI for sure the way they do things like guided workouts is beyond me I don't know why they do it like that but it's all there and it's now really competitive price again less competitive when you start looking at reduced garments but you know on RP it's the one that is offering tremendous value in this category and it's just it's just great to see Brown doing this because we I think we agree this is what you what have to do like until you can put the years of work Garmin has put into all these features to make them very easy to use and all their smarts and stuff you've got to try and compete in other ways and price is one of them it was a welcome return for sunto like a bit of a return to form in many ways it's kind of brought them back into the equation they desperately needed something and I think with the you know this and the the race s which is the smaller one there we should also say there is a titanium version of this so you can go even more kind of Premium materials if you want to and a bit more durability and kind of rugged build if you want to sort of scale up for that but they've they've definitely kind of rein inserted themselves into the conversation in a way that I think is really commendable and hopefully we're going to see more from them so there you have it that's been our Deep dive into the best high-end watches the premium watches those top price watches that you can buy from all the brands hope you found it useful give us a like if so if you're not already subed to the channel why not get stuck into that if you're after a more affordable watch I'm going to pop our guide to those sort of more wallet friendly watches up on the channel right now go and take a look at that otherwise thanks for stopping by and until next time happy running people",

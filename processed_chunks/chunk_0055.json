  "text": "[Music] we're doing it again dgr yes we are doing it again amazing another year is in the books and tough year difficult year hard year challenging year however you want to say it it was a hard year for the deor clan all right and but we made it through that's the key is that we're all going to have hard years we're all going to be challenged but you come out the other side a different person a stronger person um and a person that's ready for the next challenge cuz you know it's going to come because why we're human beings all right so thanks for sticking with me through thick and thin and I realized listen hundreds thousands H maybe tens of thousands of Runners have you know said I'm not going to watch Seth's YouTube channel why two reasons really but it's okay why he doesn't do a daily Vlog anymore and he doesn't do shoe reviews anymore and the reason I know this is because you email me you comment below and that's okay but but but but but but I want to make the point I don't want you to be a runner or to seek inspiration for running because of me I want you to seek your inspiration your motivation to be Runner because of you because of what's inside of you and I yes I just ordered my own copy I've read the book before in college but I I don't actually own a copy of once a runner many of you have read it it is the quintessential novel for runners once a runner great book and it really speaks to the uh experience that we runners go through as human beings on this Earth that once you're a runner once you've discovered the the lore of running the Allure of running the uh just the the the grit and the the uh yeah the grind of being a runner and how much you want it how much you seek it out every single day to be a runner it's um it's something that you just can't explain to most humans on this Earth in fact many people on this Earth will think you're crazy if you're a runner and that you run every single day but once it's in you and it might take it might take a year it's probably going to take five years it's probably going to take a decade and yes uh I started running in 1997 all right and many of you know the story I was a soccer player growing up but I was a small soccer player so I couldn't kick my legs I could run all day I could outrun anybody on the soccer field but I couldn't kick the ball hard enough to get to the goal and So eventually I decided you know what we're just going to leave the ball behind and we're just going to run and run and that's when I joined my cross country team in in Middle School in seventh grade in 1997 I tell that little backstory to encourage you is your Discerning your goals and yes I'm going to pull up my goals here from 2024 and 2025 on my computer here as you're Discerning and figuring out your goals for the new year um it's important to remember that it might take you time to discover what should my annual mileage be what should my annual uh racing goals be what should my annual goals in the gym be okay what vertical goals all of that and I guess why not let's dive into it right now from 2010 to 2017 I was starting a family I was getting you know getting married starting a family you know doing my own work uh and but you know moving into the old house and so I actually wasn't running very much maybe 5 to 800 miles a year no joke but here's the graph on your screen when the Vlog started and thank you if you've been watching for eight years nine years on this YouTube channel it's been a long time here's the graph all right so slowly I've been dialing in and again I just want to encourage you if you're a newer Runner especially it might take you two three 5 10 years to figure out what should my annual mileage be what should my annual vertical gain be what should my routine be in the gym it just takes time inconsistency so all right so keep going keep going don't stop oh yeah question of the day what were your running goals for 2024 how' you do and what are your running goals for 2025 sound good I cannot wait to read your goals down below in the comments so here are my goals from 2024 I had eight of them and I think I hit four of them all right so core crushed it Mobility not so much oh I got to work on it in 20125 three fktsgi my brotherr we live in Colorado we've got 58 mountains that go above 14,000 ft of course that's going to be like the that's the Pinnacle that's what we that's what we love to do there's the footage on your screen like it's amaz like we crushed it I I can't even explain to you how many fktsgi in uh 2000 like we nail we it was a little ridiculous actually how many mountains we ran but anyway there you go we crushed uh gold number three for 2024 uh win One race good check mark we actually won two races in 2024 PR my birthday mile nope so the family and I had a tough year we just had a tough year and what am I always saying on this channel life is part of running running is part of life all right so they go together and sometimes you get a curveball and it's a curveball that you swing in a miss and these circumstances that came up in 2024 for the family they were out of our control and that actually makes true love and I feel quite a bit better it's like we didn't it was out of our control is that's just I'm just going to leave it at that so when I'm reflecting on my PR my birthday mile also goal number five uh sorry goal number six uh 4,31 miles um I came up short for both of those and sometimes life I just say gets in the way and that's what happened for us in 2024 however today when I'm recording this I did hit goal number seven 341,000 vertical feet the most vertical feet of my entire life as a 39-year-old I feel really good about that and then last goal goal number eight Road Marathon PR I did not hit it nope didn't hit didn't even attempt it didn't even run a road marathon in in excuse me in 2024 that is okay so it was a good year but it wasn't a great year all right and I'm excited for the new year to put the challenges in the rearview mirror move ahead and I hope for you out there as I read your comments down below if you didn't hit your goals in 2024 bump it up bump it to the next year bump it to 2025 and who knows maybe you'll hit a goal in in the new year that you didn't hit last year all right that's okay uh they roll over and you're going to see there they are on your screen all of them together and yes the least is first the least uh exciting is first uh core strength Mobility I'm putting them all together now why am I putting them all together this year versus last year I split them up core strength Mobility because I actually like going to the gym I go three times a week I'll make a vlog about that very soon why I'm doing that in the New Year actually I've been doing it the last 6 months but I like the core I like the strength work I don't like the mobility work it's like I lo it so if I'm going to go to go to the gym that's like a treat for me I like going to the gym I like I like working in the gym but do I like doing the mobility I do not so if I'm going to go do core and strength I've also got to do so that's why I'm lumping them together because I got to keep myself accountable that way does that make sense I hope it does there you go that was goal number one goal number two three again fkt we're just keeping it real uh I won two races in last year uh the goal is to win three races next year I like to be competitive and yes I will be turning 40 in the new year and so I'll become a master's Runner but but just all right quick Side Story here's footage from Utah about seven months ago and I was looking around the starting line and I was like wait a minute I'm racing 20y olds I'm I was actually racing 19y olds these kids could be my kids these kids could be my kids I think I took sixth or seventh in the race so I did okay it was very competitive but anyway it's like not getting any younger I'm going to become a master's runner in 2025 and I want to win through outright I don't want to win my age group I want to win it's just a competitive nature inside me keep that spark going and I hope you've got a spark for you maybe it's not to win a race outright but think about like what gets you going what's the spark inside you that gets you excited all right so keep keep it maybe it's Health just Health lower your cholesterol in 2000 whatever it is uh that's the spark that and so that's my spark for two thou for 2025 yes PR the birthday mile I'm not giving up on it I am not giving up on PR the birthday mile 4,400 miles in 2 I I know I can get it because it's based on history The Last 5 Years and what true love and I went through in 2024 all right so I know I can get that one goal number five goal number six 350,000 vertical feet we're going to get it in a half marathon PR and uh on that half marathon PR um March or April all right so I'm not going to announce yet which race I haven't even registered I'm still researching sea level half marathon PR lifetime half marathon PR in March or April 2025 that is the last goal for running goal for the year onward and upward thanks for listening I hope you hit your goals and if you didn't roll it over don't be afraid to roll over your goals to the New Year all right of course we'll toss it to last year's goal Vlog from 365 days ago don't give up don't give up don't ever give up keep it rolling all right so right there right there I love you all what a great year all right what a good year and what a great year we are about to have in the New Year all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

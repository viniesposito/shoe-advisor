  "text": "[Music] all right so this is our first time doing a live Q&A like this I think so we'll see how it goes it'll be probably a train wre to some degree but if anyone wants to come in and hang out sit down over here it' be way less awkward so you should probably do that thank you it's like a p like a campfire type situation over here nice and cozy without without banjos yeah yeah I mean it's a little bit of uh a little bit of that but um we're excited to talk to Scott today Scott welcome thank you it's great to be here yeah um and if anybody I think we we'll do a little bit of an interview and then we'll do a Q&A afterwards have if you have any questions I'm sure there's burning questions of everyone in the crowd so if that sounds good we can just kick it off good all right all right so we're here with uh cover i w say Cover Girl I guess cover boy Scott jurrick cover cover man last time I checked anyways yeah on the uh the newest cover of the possessed um number 58 number 58 z i I like to call it a Zen even though it's more of a newspaper Zen but um I'm excited to talk to you Scott I read the interview we both read the interview and uh glean some useful information about you and your background and growing up so maybe let's just kick it off that way where tell everyone where you're from where your roots are I feel like that's pretty important to where we are now so uh I'm originally from northern Minnesota and uh I'm basically up near Canada like I was closer to Canada than I was closer to Minneapolis St Paul so Northern Minnesota we take pride in being Northerners and we're kind of like we do our own thing I grew up total redneck hunting fishing I know it's crazy people think you know this vegan how how was he a redneck but I grew up hunting and fishing and spending a lot of time Outdoors like waiting for fish to bite in the middle of the dead of winter so so I got to be honest I read that in the article and my goal for today was just to turn this into a fishing podcast so I talk fishing I don't know if we can do that but I did want to ask what species you would fish for as a kid what were your favorite things to catch anything that I could catch I mean I literally would do that like I love catching I mean walleye are amazing northern pike is probably a nice but we used to go out in this little tiny boat and sorry all you fellow vegans I'm going to talk a little bit about fishing but um cuz it's some of my like Fondest Memories like spending time outdoors and even though at the time was a kid we'd sit out in this tiny boat on the out and anybody knows Lake Superior I grew up about 20 mi from Lake Superior oh wow it's this basically giant ocean that's freshwater and we would sit on this tiny little boat and just hope these like salmon and trout would bite and when they did it was I I knew I I wasn't even able to like pull them in that's how like strong they are and like yeah we'd go out but the the craziest part was actually getting out there and hoping that we wouldn't capsized like yeah my uncle was wild and crazy I just had yeah wild family members who just like take us out and do this stuff and I was like whoa like are we going to capsize out here so like looking back in hindsight do you feel like that that kind of wild Spirit of northern Minnesota is embedded in you and whether you knew it or not was part of your DNA that came out in ultra running and trail running I do like to C I think part of my background growing up where I did like out in the woods away from all my friends 5 miles from town uh I learned to just like find joy and spending time in the Backwoods and just building forts running around on the trails that I would build tree forts you name it like it was my escape and it was also like my refuge um so if you could have both things it was like a pleasant spot and then just times where I'd like lay out in the woods and like you know mosquitoes would be biting me like crazy but like it just it was like home and it just formed me I think it helped prepare me for a life of ultra running yeah it's kind of interesting because when I was a kid and doing Forts and doing all that stuff out in the Backwoods I was also getting into trouble like it wasn't necessarily all you know Stephen King Stand By Me uh kind of stuff how did you get into trouble back then and what what what was your driving uh way of having fun out in the woods you know I wish I grew up in a military family so like I a lot of my family members including my father they weren't cool like you knew was going to hit the fan if Dad came home and like you know stuff had burnt down like but playing with matches I was a pyro like I love to play with matches and so I feel you if I were if I were to get in trouble it was probably like starting some on fire and but I also had grandfathers and uncles who would start stuff like we'd have these crazy bonfires like we we burnt our trash in like metal barrels and stuff like that so stuff that's not like cool anymore but I I also had to burn my trash as a chore for a child so that shows you where I grew up to uh did you do pallet fires where you took old wooded pallets and piled them up see we didn't have access to those it was just like find any piece of wood could throw it on and just keep it going and yeah we have and as a kid it was like so much fun I just remember that I feel like blowing anything up as man I'm really uh I allow to say this publicly uh I mean you just take you know take the spray paint can throw it in the fire see what happens I mean we used a lot of flammable liquids to get things going yeah so but yeah spray cans were definitely that was closer to bomb explosive category and explosives weren't quite as cool see this is a running podcast by the way we are uh covering all things running which you know you got to you got to have some risk and danger when it comes to trail running depends depends where you're at so I think it's all part of the equation um so yeah and so you grew up in Minnesota you got into trail running you you did trail run as a kid but then you kind of took a break or found your way back to it in a way um how did it come back to you I guess the biggest way it came back to me was I I would run as a kid out on these Trails but only pretending I was like on a horse and I I was always like I was always a Native American like Indians were the coolest my mind like the Cowboys weren't as cool sorry all you Cowboys here in Texas but I see those bu eyes I um yeah I just it always resonated with me and I would just remember like that joy and that Joy didn't come back again until after all the years of playing team sports where we'd run laps for punishment and even the cross country races I did at in fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade which I came in second place the cross country coach was always trying to get me to come out for cross country and I'd be like nah I'm not going to do it like just not just didn't love it and I don't know whether it was because it was a punishment activity before but it really wasn't until I got into college and I had some friends who like they were hippies they were outcasts they were characters and they showed me like the way in terms of like trail running can be fun and then some of them told me about these ultas and it wasn't until I maybe connected my past and that joy that I had as a kid and how I played with this activity now that was no long longer punishment those long hours of Nordic ski training is really where it resonated with me we go for 3 4 hours and I was like very close to what I did hunting and fishing like spending all day out in the woods yeah you seem like a really nice guy and you're telling us the stories about how it was fun to be out there on the horses and running on the trails none of that sounds competitive at some point a competitive switch happened like how did that come about are you like a really nice guy and then as soon as this gun goes off things change I had polish grandparents who lived through the Great Depression so they definitely were hard asses my dad was like so I think competitively like it was like okay how fast can you stack wood how fast can you like do so we do like just I guess like hard labor games and that's how I got my competitive mode and so yeah I seem like Mr Nice Guy but when it comes to like a race or a competition I see my daughter right now I'm just like holy like how did she get so competitive cuz I swear to god like people think like Scott jerk's grooming his daughter and like my wife is like cuz she's like Japanese American they're just like turning I I like to say my kids are polish Samurai and like they have this stubborn and like just hard like compe and I'm like I'm not doing this but I have to like nobody believes me but like that's how I just it was imbued in Me by having grandparents who made me do the things that I didn't want to do all the time and be like I don't care if you want to do this you're doing it now and like there was this competition of like okay I'm going to do it and it had to be done right and just like that trial and that that's where the competition came and it it was like later it was like to prove a point and those of you know like for better for worse like I don't know I used to do stuff I'm not always like proud of but like we used to talk all the time I remember on Race courses like back in the day I talk about ultr running as being you know how is out in the audience and I like we used to talk so much and like just give each other a hard time and nowadays it's like oh you can't say anything like that cuz that you know you can't say that I mean obviously people say anything they want online but um there's too much Mr and Ms and Miss nice guy kind of attitude so I mean I spend a lot of time listening to Jenny's voice cuz I listen to the north and it's kind of uh interesting to me that you guys are so close and you do all these things together is there is she want to be as competitive as you are in support of you like is she pushing you she definitely does like it's so funny like for her own self though like she's so like people are whoo she's super hard on SC like you know she wants to like see me go to the brink and then sometimes she's like whoa like maybe we push them too far um but I do appreciate it in her and then she's also somebody who she doesn't like to hurt herself as much like she can do amazing things like she's a we're talking about like talk about cut off or like basically get under the the time limit type of individual and I've seen her go to some places that are just as hard of the things that I do so I think she knows like what that takes she may not want to hurt as much or like maybe she just wants to hurt longer for the stuff that she does like get her money's worth but it's so funny cuz yeah she can be sometimes some just like damn like you're so hard on like but it's that I think that tough love sometimes and then turning that off and being somebody who can be there and I think that's always that fine line that we try to like practice in life and I mean we're all learning about that and like how far do we go and when do we pull back and yeah it's like this give or take and this balancing act that you do because yeah so one of the things you talk about in the interview um of possessed is this idea that you've gotten older you're past you're you're not winning Western State seven times in a row anymore uh and you're moving into a different phase of your running career or what that looks like as far as challenges or what running or trail running or ultra running means to you and can you tell me about how that transition happened was that a natural thing or is that something you had to be intentional about and choose like a path that you had to choose to go down or did you kind of was it something that happened naturally where things just kind of fell together that way well first off I mean didn't you read the magazine like I'm still winning Western States yeah oh I forgot I'm sorry it must have been a bad edit that I got so yeah my bad no um no I'm not reincarnating myself as uh young Jim Wamsley but uh yeah it's a good yeah there's some conspiracy theories out there you might be living in multiple timelines that are parallel um but to be serious and answer the question I think it really a lot of times people use the word retirement and like there's an end point and obviously I know like I'm not going to win Western States again that's not that's not going to happen um nor do I like want to necessarily run that race but there comes a point where not the writing is on the wall but for me I started to get you know what what do I do next do I need to keep striving I started second guessing myself and I think that's a point where not the big RW in terms of retirement happens but you for me it's like I made peace with like where I'm at as an athlete as well as like do I want to go to those places anymore and it's like that's not a good place if you're try like I went back to Leadville I think in 201 this is where Jenny will get me like we WR about it in north and like she was like whoa where's the Scott jurich that I am used to seeing like who just like fights it and I was like fine just like phoning it in and just like cruise on in I'm like I'm good like whatever happened she was like no way are you doing this and for me I think there's that fine line of like being driven to do something but then if you second guess it yeah um it just started to be like not as fun and I was like not trying to do things because I needed to do them but I just didn't have my heart in it in the same place and that that's a hard thing as a top level athlete to be like I know I could still do these things but I'm starting to second guess why do I do this why why do I keep doing this when I could like Cruise in or I could just keep running on the trails and you know doing the fun things I love to do with this sport um so that's I think I didn't make a conscious decision but more like okay my heart is in the game that's why doing things like the Appalachian Trail it's like finding things that still Peak my interest that encourage me to go to the lengths that one needs to go to yeah can we talk a little bit about ultra running in general because back in I'd say in the preborn to run days there wasn't it wasn't as big of a sport as it is now there weren't as many people out there doing it matter of fact you could probably count the people on one hand that were doing 50 to 100 miles and more uh races and now you look and it's almost like it's the evolution people run a marathon they do a 50k the 50 mile 100 what's the biggest change in the sport that you've seen and where do you see it going in the future knowing what you've seen in the past yeah I was talking to Hell ker today a little bit about like that in terms of like where is the sport going like is it continuing to grow in Skyrocket like it has or are we reaching this like Plateau or like es and flows of like you know how many people want to do this stuff I let's be real it's not easy to go out and run 100 miles regardless of you're trying to just you know make the cut off or if you're trying to win and so I think for what's most I think different I mean I don't know I mean to be honest I don't think anything's really changed there's a lot of peripheral changes and like window dressing that's changed but at the core the sport is the same cuz if you want to run 100 miles a you're going to work your tail off and B it's um it's not for everybody and if it you know it's going to grow but I think it's still going to be the special thing that we hold on to and I think that's that's the magic there is letting people discover what what's out there for them like what is and we're all going to keep ask I mean I'm still asking that's why like I don't even like to say I'm totally retired because like what is out there in the sport that I'm still interested in what how do I want to so I want to it's a lifestyle and I think more than anything regardless of all the things you know people gripe about oh the races are getting too you know too big there's too much money in it now um on the competitive side like oh we got a drug test now there's like money for athletes and then on the other side be like oh race directors are getting money hungry um and everyone gripes about getting into races is so hard like those things are happening but when the start gun goes off it's still the same Sport and so I like to look at it there's a bright future still with running and it's still going to be out it's still going to be Fringe I think that's what possessed magazine is is highlighting it's very Fringe like again I mean everybody's not going to I know Born to Run made people think they all want to run ultramarathons but not everybody is actually going to put the time and effort and I think that's the beauty and the magic of running in general is that something is going to Spur somebody to get off the couch do something different do something they never thought in their Wildest Dreams whether it's running 100 miles or running around the block and that magic is out there for everyone and it's so accessible too all right so I'm guessing like with you going from a competitive mindset and trying to run these races as fast as you can it's kind of like head down and cruising and and just doing that what are some of the things that you've learned like in maybe slowing down or approaching races differently like what is the next step if you can give somebody advice who's going from highly competitive to maybe finding like joy in doing something like the Appalachian Trail or something like that I mean I don't know if I've got a great answer for that because it's different talking to somebody like say Jim Wamsley like like what I remember talking to him a couple years back and he was like yeah I don't know if I want to do this I don't know if I want to like you know win Western States seven times like everybody's in it for something different like some people are like hey I want to get the best out of myself for four years 5 years 6 years and then maybe do something else and like come in and out of it um so I think it really really comes down to like what what do you want to get out of it at what point do you segue and I don't know there Leed to be for me for me it was I don't know like it was fun just playing it like trying to crash and burn like one of my mentors one of my heroes was uh Eric Clifton and Eric anybody knows Eric Clifton or heard about him there's just all these characters Eric was the guy who showed up in like 5K racing Flats after running on the track Barefoot for 10 mies that was his thing every year Mountain Mass Mountain masus he would run on a track for 10 Mi Barefoot and then show up in his racing flats take it out at like you know 5:30 Pace running a 50 mile and granted we start on a road but he would like literally like as if he was going to run a marathon or something shorter and he would just go out go For Broke and so a lot of us played with that like going for broke and just Hammer from the Geto try to hang on and see how far you could get and then you get more strategic over the years so for me it evolved into like trying to be more strategic learn more about like what I could do with my body what I could do in training what I could do for fueling nutrition hydration and just like put all of that together so I got to I think there's the Ethereal like metaphysical side of ultr running and I was way into that aspect but then I was way into the science too so it's funny like now things resurface like you know hyper carbo loading or carb you know in hyper carb consumption whatever you want to call it like that was stuff that I was tinkering with way back in the day cuz a lot of people wouldn't eat a lot and I was people are like who you're eating all of that in an hour and it was like we were we were doing this stuff so we were experimenting a lot and I think that's what was cool about it that's amazing um so we'll uh start the Q&A here in a little bit but I did want to ask you you know obviously you had your little your playlist from when you were younger in the in the magazine so you get threw out some of your uh Glam Rock hair metal hits uh from the from the 80s what since we are operating on a karaoke style machine I'm not going to ask you to do karaoke but if you were to do karaoke right now what would be your go-to song like from that era any any song Oh any okay all right I thought you were going to like we will judge you if you say a Taylor Swift song I me throw out some Twisted Sister or like Quiet Riot like it was definitely a throwback so again Jenny was really worried like everyone's going to think who reads the magazine that I actually listen into this stuff um and I know there's a big yeah Metals having a Resurgence but um I wouldn't be able to probably do that but maybe I maybe I could throw down on some of that I would say my go-to for karaoke is Painted Black okay Stones classic and uh I know it's seems but that's my I was going to say d Snider On karaoke might be a difficult ask so you might want to yeah painted black seems a little more doable than some Twisted Sister but all right that's that's my gotoo but I have you know I have others you know that I can all right have to we might have to find a karaoke bar in Austin so someone give us a tip on where to go um and last thing well I have a personal question I grew up near the application Trail my parents still live there so every now and then uh I'll hit it up but this is in Pennsylvania uh any tips for trying to run on a trail that's actually just a pile of rocks because you did 55 m a day on that section I think around that which still blows my mind so if you have any tips especially for someone with terrible ankles it would be much appreciated yeah Rock Sylvania as it's called um yeah you know I actually had my best some of my best I did 59 miles um as like my high in in rock Sania and I think really it's just about like I mentioned like going for broke and just like going for it that's I'm a big believer and like sometimes you just got to throw yourself into the fire that's what Ultras are all about I do I can't I literally can't even I would say yeah throw yourself Into the Fire and you just you got to do it repetitively like the only way you get confident on rocks and there's no doubt like there are stretches in there where you just like it's like it literally is nothing but a rock file I mean there's there's Legends where they they they talk about all the Pennsylvania like Trail clubs would actually go out with wheelbarrows and actually take the Rocks cuz if you look at it Carl Meltzer would just be like dude if you look at it there's rocks you know right down the trouble there's none here there's none there just down where they put it like that's what's so confusing is that the trail is just rocks but they everything around it so he's just like and so there's I don't know whether it's Urban myth urban legend whatever you want to call it there's literally like it just seems like they've taken wheelbarrow loads of rocks and just thrown on there you know every which is cool about the at and we you know again what Ultra culture and Trail culture is is these like stories and characters and like everyone is proud of their section of the at and it has like reputation and there's so much tradition and that's what I love about the sport uh ultra running trail running is that there's this history and tradition behind it and I think that's lost nowadays with social media it's like what if it didn't happen the last year 2 years or even sometimes the last month it it it's forgotten so it's like you got to bring that back so I would say just get out there more practice on it all right subject yourself to the Rocks it's got to be like Mogul like it's it's Mogul right you get better at it and the more miles you have on your legs after a while you don't care the more times you fall the less the less you actually care about falling than yeah work on it work on it I'll send you my hospital bill uh Q&A time yeah let's do it all right who's up any questions anyone or we'll take roast we can take roast yeah yeah we de saw com kind of excited about sport what races are you about what long trails are you still curious about um so the question was what what am I most curious about um I guess being embedded in the community that's why I go out and help friends or guide blind Runners like I get excited about seeing it from a different vantage point and to me that's so valuable I think there's so many athletes like they stop doing their their passion or I guess some people look at as occupation or whatever art but for me it's like I still want to be embedded in I want to be embedded in it you know till the day I can't anymore I was hanging out with uh Rob McNair those of you from Southern California may have heard of uh Rob McNair he used to hold all the 50k course records down in SoCal and he's from Huntington Beach and I saw him at Havalina he's 70 years old 70 years young 70 years young and he's like gosh Scotty I remember when you know you were 20 I was 40 and we'd just be like hammering each other and like that's the stuff that I you know he's got like a broken back fused spinals columns and sections and he's like out there helping a buddy and he's you know doesn't he has a flip phone no texting and it's like stories like that like connecting with it and reminding myself what I want to do with it so the things that get me excited um I was helping Jeff uh Browning so Bronco Billy out on the CT I've always wanted to do the CT it's like it's my home course in a way um so there's there's a lot of those things where I'm like I just got to make it happen you know I turned 50 recently and like the writing's on the wall like okay if I'm going to do these things I got to do them now and so it gets me fired up and then Hela came out for a week of jerk boot camp in Boulder so over five days we ran 80 miles and I'm like okay like I can just rip off 80 miles and I feel pretty good and like gets me excited so yeah there's more to come so yeah next someone has a question they're all silent yeah you're you're a really good writer spot who was like you have any literary influences who do you look up to when you're writing can you tell us a little bit about your process writing and what inspires you yeah it's a good question um I don't know sometimes I think I'm not a good writer it's like not it's it's not what I like went to school for like whatever but I've learned how to like love the process so for me sometimes and the more writers I talk to I'd be like this is so hard this is like hard like I'd rather be out running than doing this um and I think that's what intrigued me is the process is so hard for me um I didn't grow up with this like literary bone so I like throwback to college I loved reading like dovi like like it it's hard stuff but crime and punishment I used to read that stuff like I don't know maybe again I'm from Northern Minnesota so I could relate to like stories like that but um that and then but when I was out in the Northwest Tom Robins he's one of my favorites like he just weaves these stories that are just so wacky in wild and I think having lived in the Pacific Northwest it was a lot about Seattle and these just crazy story lines that converge um like super cool so I I think those would be like two of my um writers I know they're in opposite ends of spectrum but Russian literature versus somebody who writes like wild wacky fiction um but I think more than anything it's I I remember when we were writing North I'd come home after 4 hours at the coffee shop writing and Jenny would be like what you got a page and a half for 4 hours and uh it's a lot like running Ultras it's like this slow tedious process and when you come home with a page and a half you know like maybe half a page is good and it can be just really like a grind to get there but I think that's for ultra running as Tommy but I love when things do flow and it's like okay I wrote some good there and then the editor like comes back like oh actually it's better to do this so it's like this tinkering with like a process that's fascinating for me but it's hard to sit in front of a you know typewriter write on paper um and so I respect writers and then some of my buddies who like write like full-time that's what they went to school for they're like nobody likes this like we all we all hate deadlines I'm like but you guys must love writing like you know it's just like musicians like you must love playing music you must love writing music and a lot I have not yet to find a writer who says I love to write like I think they like when they're in the flow state of getting it down but yeah it's fascinating like I I don't know maybe there's somebody out there that loves it but it it's hard work it's it's really like just mentally draining but um it's still really cool so those of you who write like hats off to everyone who does it cuz yeah and to be really efficient now it's like everyone expects you to write really quick yeah um I remember doing pieces for the magazine actually um and just being like Oh God this reminds me of being on Deadline mode cuz we were we pulled pulled this off very quickly and I had to write a recipe a playlist and like put together these like intros and I was like oh man like this is like and with a big deadline of like looming out there so um which I appreciate like if you don't have deadlines you don't get done um and yeah you just got to go pedal to the metal sometimes all nighters and that's what Jenny and I did on north um so it was a lot of yeah I don't know how we stayed together after that like I think the at was way easier than uh writing that book like am yeah don't um don't write a book with your partner or uh spouse because or or if you do if you survive that then you've got something good all right should we wrap it up Max Max got yeah all right thanks Scott um I just have one question about looking back on your career is there any like one specific race that you're most proud of or is it like just the consistency of the results of Western States for some many years or is it the setting the record on at on the at or is it maybe some race that would really expect but looking back like I guess what are you most proud of from your it's a good question um cuz after a while things kind of like blur together and when you have a long career and you you're able to like turn out results um I think sometimes I like how do you pick one um but I'd have to say like on one Spectrum the at was on another level because battling and like working with the trail and working with all these things that were happening and being able to pull that off like it's just it was like it was like an epic Tome versus like Western States like I'd have to say 2020 I mean sorry um 2004 when I set the record because for so many years I was trying to chip away and when I look back at my early times I'm like damn that's so slow I I look back at it um but it was the process to get where I got to get to 20 2004 when I got down to 1536 and I think that was so special because you know Dave Mackey was pushing me like it was just on paper it doesn't look like it was an epic duel but um we really pushed each other along with the other athletes out there like Hal was running that year I mean it just kind of all like sometimes comes together and that race um despite it going up and down um things came together and yeah Mike Morton was a big hero of mine and be like yes another non-california male to win that race is uh super cool so got to say that one but even my first 50 mile like I I credit that even though though it wasn't like this Pinnacle of my career it got me to where I was you know where I am today really like if I hadn't run that 50 mile the Minnesota Voyager and just been like why why would I ever do one of those it was horrible like finishing that race say like okay yeah kind of cool but that sucked like and finishing second you would think like oh man you finished second like you should be psyched I remember just being like no way never again um but I got a credit it's like it got me out there and doing something and it was all the wacky Northern minnesotans that that did help me as well just like you got to do this thing um so yeah with a family that was saying like why would you ever do like they were just like why would you run 50 miles through the woods like they just did not understand that I think I actually got to run a 50- mile with Hal uh in California for the north V Challenge and uh it was it ended my wife's she did her first 50 mile and her last 50 mile on that course so it we weren't ready for it I mean no one is I think it can only be so ready for these things and that's what's so magical about the run but specifically the ultra run and 50 miles so yeah if you shared a course with Hal like 50 miles like when I say shared a course he like finished when I that's right you shared it though you you were still out there yeah and I think that is the beauty like I think you know ultra running is at a Crossroads roads where maybe the elites won't always be able to like just with numbers and such be able to run the same day like we might might see some of those changes um I'm just kind of thinking in my mind like where I possibly the sport might go but you're still going to cover the same course and that's pretty cool but how do we like get enough people on the course so that you can still battle fact Trail runs right how many people can get out there on a single track exactly and uh Everyone likes to be but it's not like a Boston Marathon where you can run you know tens of thousands tens of thousands of people or a New York City marathon like it's just it's not as conducive to that so do you have to two days of racing do you have to have separate I don't know it's it's a real turning point I think in our sport but interesting yeah that's for another day maybe that won't even happen in my lifetime I that it will the cool thing is a lot of people want to keep the same and I think there's Merit to having some things the same but I think the sport I never want to be one of those old guys with the sport being like oh man I remember back in the day like why do they have to do that like they ruined it like I just it's going to evolve um I don't know I'll be the grumpy old guy okay I'll let you be the grumpy old guy all right so um I think we're ready to wrap it up I want to say thank you to satisfy for bringing us together thank you Scott this was a lot of fun really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us and uh really appreciate satisfi letting us have this opportunity so thank get get a copy of Poss too yeah I think everybody gets copy right everybody should get a copy not to me but I think everybody should there's some really big pictures of me so be careful sometimes I'm like whoa like this is I actually brought all the way from Baltimore to get you to sign it and I left I have it in my backpack all right I think we can make that I think we can make that happen I like that um so thank you not that anybody wants to have

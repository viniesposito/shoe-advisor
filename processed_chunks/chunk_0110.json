  "text": "really looking forward to that section oh we're so busy see the stadium oh [Music] God hello everybody and welcome back to the channel welcome to the center of Madrid we are here on New Year's Eve for the biggest Athletics event in the whole of Spain the San Sylvester vaticana at 10 km race there is a big Mass participation event which is heading off now around 40,000 Runners heading through the streets of Madrid I've managed to blag myself a spot in the elite race although clearly not Elite but you're allowed to run with them if you're a little bit fast that's okay I've got about an hour before that goes off chasing all of these Legends through the streets of rid I'm absolutely pumped for this one it's going to be an amazing event I can't wait to bring it to you just sit back relax let's get this 10K done [Music] right guys we've made it to the start line now and yeah my nerves are building I'm not a 10K Runner really I much prefer the half marathon and Marathon distance but I shouldn't have really said what I said in the intro that I bled myself a time away to get in on this Pro L because you can't I just entered like everybody else of course if you are a sub 39 minute runner in the last year or so as a man or a sub 45 Runner as a woman you can race with the elites here on the start in this separate event that happens just after what they call the International Event so I actually bizar did have a qualifying time because I did how to run a sub 40 10K video so could use that to enter this event but I we wanted to do this one for so many years this is the 60th running of this one and it's just huge in Spain I say the one of the very biggest if not the biggest road running event in Spain way bigger than the Madrid Marathon for example yeah let me know have you ever heard of it I bet so many people never have the rumors are it is amazing so I can't wait to take you through this course today right guys everyone behind me started to do all their warm-ups now which is what I need to go and do get this body ready to run 10K as fast as I can while carrying a camera and lights and microphones and everything but it's pretty cold here probably about 4 or 5\u00b0 it's about 4 hours before midnight the race starts at just before 8:00 and then we're going to be seeing in the New Year here in Madrid what's your YouTube channel uh Ben Ben Parks Ben parks where are you from lond yeah yeah in London what's your time are you going to do it 30 uh about 35 [Music] hopefully all right it's time to go racing I can see that massive Hill that is coming up at the start already but it's only about 400 m and then it tips downhill for about 8K really looking forward to that section oh we svest B 2024 we are this climb for 400 very hard meters and then let's enjoy that downhill come on so busy around the corner now down it's okay about too busy to go any faster than that he we're settle into it go Ben us like 10 years ago something like that thank you me we shouldn't be have to talk we're not going fast enough let's go good luck first okay back where I did my intro what's it going to be 3:51 no near can't I can't go any faster it's super just two of many fast runners in Spain this downhill is crazy I've never run down a hill in a road race like this this K looking at 327 at the moment not going too fast this is so steep typical Runner always complaining too fast too slow we'll lock into a rhythm in a back second K 3 at 24 it's all right now we're climing can't believe it's a fifth done already love this so used to Long races the route is pretty much a straight line all through Madrid what a city and yeah quite downhill this K 320k pace and I'm chatting that's not cuz of my fitness but that's all right it's cuz it's quite down [Music] here big crowds out K3 322 coming up to 4 C 320 C average PA at the moment 329 but it's not downhill for much longer halfway at 8K there's a really bad Hill not looking forward to [Music] that halfway Marco coming up 319 okay halfway in about 17 20 maybe a couple of seconds over pretty good it's not a bad for I cave time for me moment okay to [Music] go 325 lap six k6 done getting hard now there's a bit of a climbing that one only 2K to the dreaded hell got to put some time in now with a bit of effort and try and save a little bit for that [Music] here what the Spaniards do when you Eve come out and share for people running come on Spain Tero Tero [Music] [Music] 327 K8 now the dreaded [Music] H this is horrible God giving it more guys light you like see me suffer as I'm suffering as a guy dress as the Grinch Mac absolutely Ma I know you man halfway up God never ending come on oh I can hardly breathe that has kooked me come on the final C going into the final kilometer and up that big climb my calf was becoming increasingly sore I slowed down a little just trying to maintain everything and get to the Finish Line then coming to the stadium it went from sore to we've got quite a big problem here lots of Runners started to overtake but I was still running still moving but knew I was in trouble then just before the final Corner oh no no no no half's gone H's gone no oh God 100 me a guy C just went are you okay don't know well there we go guys that's a new one I've never hobbled and walked across a Finish Line before not how I wanted to end the race but still super happy with the time I'm not sure what it is I'll put it up on the screen now the official time from the race and yeah it might be I don't know how bad that is I'm going to head back to the hotel and uh get some massage on that and and see what it is it could just be a bit of cramp it feels a bit worse than that unfortunately but we will see we'll see so that's it guys

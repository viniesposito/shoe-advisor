  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video we're going to be comparing the Nike Pegasus premium to the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus [Music] plus so the Pegasus line now contains three shoes it's part of a restructuring of Nike's training range where they have the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers like these the vomero line which is cushion shoes and the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus pre prium sits at the top of the Pegasus lineup ahead of the Pegasus plus with the Pegasus 41 being the standard entry level model I guess so they come at A Rang of prices like I said a pegasus 41 is the cheapest shoe it's \u00a3130 or $140 Pegasus plus is \u00a3165 or $180 and the Pegasus premium is \u00a3185 or $210 then it comes to the weights the Pegasus 41 is 291 G or 10.3 o Pegasus plus is the lightest shoe in the range at 257 G or 9 oz and heaviest shoe in the range is actually the Pegasus premium which is a beefy 328 G or 11.6 Oz all those weights are in my UK size 9 shoes which is a us10 they've all got a 10 mm drop the kind of classic Nike 10 mm drop across the board when it comes to stack IES the Pegasus premium is the highest stack shoe it's 45 mm at the heel 35 at the 4ot not sure on the exact specs on the other two shoes but they're lower than that I think the Pegasus plus is probably the lowest stack shoe but both it and the Pegasus 41 seem to be just under 40 mm at the heel when it comes to design with the Pegasus 41 you have a react x midsole with Air Zoom pods in there the midsoles very much the key differences between the three shoes they've all got a blend of kind of three materials but like I said with the Pegasus 41 it's react X foam Air Zoom pods engineered mesh upper lots of padding on it and then a waffle tread out soole then as you go up to the Pegasus plus you get an improved midsole foam it's all made from Nike's zoomx foam this is not the softest version of zoomx I've ever tested this is the bouncy foam you see in their best shoes in general but it is a more responsive and lightweight pH then the stuff in the Pegasus 41 then you have a fly it upper and then a rubber out soole again you got that kind of waffle tread pretty good coverage on the shoe as well then stepping up to the Pegasus premium there's a whole lot going on in the midell here you've got three different materials basically a blend of the materials used in the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus you got a top layer of zoomx foam with a layer of react X foam going from the heel to the midfit at the bottom and then in between those you've got a full Air Zoom unit which is a first and Nike shoes is a very responsive material obviously it's quite eye-catching design as well you got engineered mesh uper good amount of padding there and then again waffle outsole good coverage on the bottom of the shoe [Music] there comes to fit of the three shoes got all of them in a uk9 which is a US 10 that's the size I use across Nike range and have done for many years have done in many models of the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus turbo and they all fit me really well got a good hold around the he and midfoot enough room in the toes wouldn't say there's much of a difference in fit across the three shoes they've all got fairly padded uh heel collar on the back there and tongue and a good amount of room the toe so I'd stick to your normal running shoe size and the same size across these three [Music] shoes so Pegasus lineup these are all meant to be responsive daily trainers kind of catering for different price points different styles of running perhaps of different preferences and ride feeli they've all got kind of Fairly classic Nike silhouette with that 10 mm drop fairly narrow design not the most rocked shoes all around and it's really the mix of materials you have in the midsole here and the much higher stack height on the Pegasus premium that creates a slight difference in ride feeli so I've run about 50 to 100K in each of these shoes using them for a mix of daily training I've done some short runs where I've been wearing two of the shoes at the same time to kind of directly compare them and certainly I have thoughts and we'll go into those thoughts now we'll go for the shoes in turn let's start with the the Pegasus 41 which is the classic Nike Pegasus it's you a really good model of the Pegasus I think this is a really good mid-range daily trainer that will suit lots of Runners hasn't got the most exciting ride underfoot the Foams in the midsole are kind of comfortable but they're not very responsive especially under the forefoot there but it will work for lots of Runners it's the most stable of the three Pegasus shoes for sure the widest and the most stable it's not too heavy for such a cushion shoe it does offer pretty good blend of comfort and a bit of Versatility for daily training it's not a shoe that I've Loved going fast in particularly myself but you can do a bit of uptempo stuff and it's certainly going to be a durable shoe you know it's in line very much with lots of mid-range trainers from other brands things like the sakon ride 17 the ASX no blast 5 those kind of shoes it's not going to offend many Runners but it's also not going to give you you know a particularly exciting feeling under foot and you do get more of that if you upgrade to the Pegasus Plus plus simply because of the improved foam in the mid soole here so got quite a similar design all around 10 mm drop fairly similar looking shoe little bit narrower the Pegasus plus and with that better foam in the Mido just makes it a fair bit lighter all around and as a result you get a better shoe in terms of Versatility Pegasus plus is certainly the one of these three shoes I would view as the best for faster running I enjoy doing know a wider range of daily training in it I think it's got the pep for kind of tempo runs interval sessions that kind of thing it's still not a really far shoe it's not like a super trainer like something like Nike Zoom fly which is a plate and just you know a more sprightly design all around but you can pick up in the pace in it it's got a nice natural feel on the foot and certainly of these three shoes is the one I'd be looking at if I was looking for you know a really versatile all round shoe that has a bit of speed there it probably Compares best to lightweight plate free shoes from other brands like the Hoka Max 6 New Balance Rebel V4 that kind of thing to show you can do a lot of different running in because it is still cushioned and comfortable enough four easy runs long runs the kind of stuff you do in the Pegasus it's not quite as wide and as stable as the Pegasus it's not quite as cushy on the I'd say at the heel but it is still very comfortable and I enjoyed going long in the shoe uh without any problems and you've got quite a similar ride to the Pegasus 41 with that 10 mm drop kind of snaps through you know you get a little bit of 4ot discomfort sometimes over long distances because they are quite thin under the 4ot because of that 10 mm drop but still a comfortable shoe and one that I do think is the most verstile of these three the Pegasus 41 to the Pegasus plus is quite a natural progression you've got a similar style of shoe just with kind of better materials in the Pegasus plus which you pay a bit more for but then the Pegasus premium is something quite different to the others like it's got a lot more foam Under Foot you've got a bouncier design for sure this is the bounciest Pegasus for sure you've got a really much more responsive feeling under the for foot cuz you've got much higher stack there so you get more comfort with the Pegasus premium under the 4 foot and a lot more response as well like it does give you a really bouncy ride I was running with this shoe at the same time as the other two you do get you know a lot more lift off that 4 foot but the trade-off is that it's a lot heavier this shoe and that's noticeable as well like I have done some faster running in the Pegasus premium and it just feels more natural to do it in something like the Pegasus plus because it's just a lighter shoe it just feels easier to up the pace in this like when you get into a nice flat stretch of road or even a mile downhill you can really bounce along and cruise along very merrily in the Pegasus plus but the weight certainly holds it back and I don't think it's necessarily uh the most well-rounded daily trainer because it's also I think the least stable of these three shoes and it's not just because it's the highest stack height of them but it's also got the narrowest pinch Point around the midfoot which I think is quite a strange design uh Choice from Nike given that you've got this High stack of Foams does mean it's ever so slightly wobbly underfoot like I'm a neutral Runner and I still found you know I was pronating a little bit in this shoe compared to the others and I think if you are someone who needs a bit of stability I'll definitely avoid the Pegasus premium of these three shoes the Pegasus 41 is certainly the most stable so it's definitely the most interesting ride of the three and it's probably a little bit more modern and different to the other Nike shoes because even though it still has that 10 mm drop it does feel a bit more rocket and you transition a bit more smoothly in the Pegasus premium I'd say and having that thick chunk of foam under foot is very different to other the Nike shoes which like I say often because of the 10 mm drop can be a bit thin under the 4 foot compared to lots of more rocked or lower drop shoes on the market Pegasus premium you know has that extra cush there gives you a nice bouncy feeling there gives you a more protective feeling on long runs but yeah the trade-off is weight and also unfortunately stability I would say so this is a shoe that probably lines up more with Max cushion Cruisers from other brands like the Brooks Glycerin Max uh the hoker Skyward X or the puga Puma mag Max it's not really a super trainer per se like one that you'd use for a bit of everything that's the Nike Zoom fly for sure and in this range it feels like you know you've got natural step up from Pegasus 41 to Pegasus plus and something quite different on top of that which you know will probably really appeal to some Runners but I think we'll have less broad appeal than these two shoes the Pegasus 41 and the pegus plus are a pretty good reliable work or daily trainers pegus premium is something quite [Music] different so it comes to my verdict on the Pegasus range I think the Nike Pegasus plus is the best all around shoe in the Pegasus range these days it's the one I'd be picking up if I was looking to add a shoe to rotation or if I was looking for an all around a shoe to do a bit of everything in like it's it's pretty comfortable it's lightweight it's fast it's nippy it's got a nice you know Snappy ride to it you can do bit of everything in it and it like I said it's quite a natural step up on the Pegasus 41 you trade off a little bit of stability and width and comfort at the back of the shoe but you still have a comfortable shoe here it's still pretty stable and you get a lot more response out of the zoomx mile you get a lighter shoe and just a more accomplished all round shoe so that's the one that I think is the best shoe in this range think if you're a newer Runner or you're just looking for a comfortable and durable shoe for easy runs then the Nike Pegasus 41 is a really good choice as well it's a little bit cheaper than the pegas plus it's a shoe that always pops up in sales as well and it's quite a nice shoe as well in terms of looks so you can use it for walking around as well which is good and yeah it's a good shoe as well it's like it's not as responsive and fast for sure it's not a shoe that I view as particularly first time myself it's a very solid all round shoe and one that will work for lots of Runners so I would say these are both pretty good shoes that could find a spot in most people's rotation and the Pegasus premium is something quite different so I think it's not the shoe I'd recommend buying purely from a running perspective for sure if you love The Look of this shoe and you want a shoe that you can use for lifestyle use and the occasional run it will do the job of that just be a bit wary of that stability if you also just want the bounciest liveliest ride possible out of these three shoes then it is the Pegasus premium it's just the tradeoff there is very much the weight so if you're looking for the most fun shoe I guess to do easy runs that kind of thing then it is the Pegasus premium but if you're looking for a more of a Workhorse trainer to do those easy runs and other runs as well then yeah the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus plus I think you know certainly more Compass running shoes and a fair bit cheaper but this is you know it's a bit different especially for Nike with that extra foam under the under the for foot there you are going to get nice bouncy feeling there it is fun to running yeah just got those concerns about weight stability and indeed price so the other shoes I think are probably more natural fits for most Runners and like I say of the three my favorite is definitely the Pegasus [Music] plus that's

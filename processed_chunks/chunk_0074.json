  "text": "[Music] these are the fun moments when the path you are on as a runner isn't as clear as you might hope for whether you coach yourself whether you work with a coach either way you got to make decisions you might have two three four five doors in front of you that you just have to analyze and figure out huh I went down this this door this path and it it didn't quite work AKA last week on here on Peak I didn't keep up with Joseph that's right he took off and my legs didn't quite have the juice didn't quite have the the the power to get up that mountain as fast as him so now where it becomes a a riddle and riddles are fun that's it's like the last seven days I have thought way too much about the Tinker I'm always talking about the tinker and what can I do differently which door can I choose in the next seven days to make the results a little different for today for this morning that's the fun part of training of running and I hope I just hope that you can get to that point in your training in your running uh you know may it might take you a couple years it might take you five years it might take you a decade before you feel comfortable enough to make those decisions for yourself knowing ooh okay didn't quite work out this week we're going to we're going to we're going to go through this door and see if we can change uh change the outcome so that's what we're doing today it's been a fun week of I'll just say it trial and air or air and trial you know Belford two weeks ago here on last week we got Belford hereon was great but not I wasn't I wasn't at the I wasn't at the level all right so go to Elbert the tallest mountain in Colorado this is the North Trail the South Trail we got earlier in the summer it was beautiful it was amazing but it was a very simple Day meaning the time was pretty pedestrian for Joseph and I to go go after together the North Trail is not it's the opposite it is the doozy it is difficult it is fast it is steep 177% grade about 4.6 mil to the top about 4,300 you can tell tell I've been I've been analyzing about 4,300 vertical feet let's get after it get these shoes on get through beautiful Leadville Colorado and uh see if we can't track down Joseph in the High [Music] Country yeah I think you know it's it's basically 105 flat yeah and uh if you uh same deal if if you feel good you go if I feel good I'll go if hopefully we feel the same yep but okay no I think we I think we nailed the weather day yeah this would be great so okay count down yeah three two one go [Music] [Music] [Music] h that's crazy [Music] he [Music] he [Music] [Music] can I kick some ass let's go [Music] [Music] sh 105 you good thank you enjoy kill it enjoy yeah butter my bread w okay right I'd do that you'll never see me ah that was good told me that maybe you're just not going to be able to ever run again and I'm like I'm okay with that's okay hiking is just great well we were close right just like so I don't know we'll have to have a discussion about I don't know if stra will give it to us yeah but I think fkt so I was thinking on the way down in uh Discord I could ask some like math Wizards yeah to like use the difference in distance and the pitch and the final times yeah so I think we like we might have been 10 or 15 seconds short yeah but we ran A4 mile further right like I think I had 4.88 yeah maybe 4.9 and it was and it was 4.6 totally yeah so that's if I'm doing the math right on my watch that's a quarter mile basically yep so I think those switch backs where the new Trail is I think it's I think that's basically where it's adding on yeah most of the I mean I think it's noticeable how that was probably oh yeah and then and then also tell the people whoever the math Wizards are um like on my watch so yeah I think that's the key met metric maybe is is the 13 my watch said and I trust Garmin but once we get back to service but my watch said we average 1330 a mile yeah and I know from straa my fkt was 1406 what you what we got today was up in the uh lasportiva Captiva Captiva all right Mount Albert 14,433 think yeah sounds bad right tallest mountain in Colorado so we got Captiva I went with the pulsars yeah it did well and um hair of our chinny chin chin uh razor thin margins yeah there's kind of layers I feel like there's layers to uh fkt efforts totally yeah there's where it's like you know some mountains that have never been touched and then there's some mountains that are very popular that's what this one was today right yeah popular mountain in general and very popular Mountain for fkt some of the names that have yeah gone after the times it's pretty cool to see yeah be a part of that list and uh yeah it was it was close we so as usual we don't have cell service right yeah I can't tell yet so we don't know we don't can't give you an answer with respect to if we got it or not but it was fun and uh we just rolled from the beginning right yeah it was fast off the gun and there's some fast sections below tree line and yeah really fun day there was some good people out there the trail comments be hilarious butter my bread I don't know if you heard it on the little camera but we whoever you were hopefully you see this uh thanks for getting a little butter my bread on there enjoy K it yeah someone said that there were Flames coming off our feet oh nice someone said uh I didn't hear that someone said uh save some oxygen for us oh really that's we some good ones that's good that's good yeah just I know and uh a little windy on top it's just just perfect temperature pretty much the whole way but again we're talking like I said last week it's just seconds cuz all these all these uh all these fktsgi yeah shout out to everyone who's gone after this time Noah Killian back in the day Anton Anton Sage yeah a lot of uh a lot of stout Runners yo yeah I mean it's just been like if you look at the top 10 maybe I'll put it on the screen it's just like it's like the best yeah and something that's cool about fktsgi I don't know if they're making the trail faster but they're definitely making it better and more sustainable it's for long term it's like the work they're doing is incredible I if I can find footage basically they're adding steps and retaining walls and it's totally necessary because hundreds of people almost hundreds of people go up it every day so you have to control the trail and but you have to do the good old stair stepping as well yeah and the quads yeah stair stepping the the uh it's a little bit added distance now which will be interesting to kind of break down and see like you know when the trail is fully fully done like you know what it really looks like I think I had like 4.88 4.9 basically to the top from so we'll see again once we get back to cell service but it at the end of the day it's all about the stimulus yeah abely brick stacking those bricks and it just is were working pretty hard it was a lung burner you probably heard the uh heard the breathing at the end there so yeah fun day and now we go to Italy yeah last uh last hard effort and I think we're ready this might be the last might be the last Vlog before Italy but if you're watching in Italy maybe we'll see you there in Northern Italy so Casto yeah oh man all right good work cool the socks shoot you okay oh yeah the sockss are perfect nice yep had to bring the fast socks for this one yeah I know be able to dive in to the fkt on the tallest mountain in Colorado yes we have 58 Summits that rise above 14,000 ft but I can't dive into it now because I got to go catch an airplane that's right there's the passport Joseph and I are heading to Italy for for races this weekend in Casto Italy Northern Italy uh I'm going to do a VK on Saturday and then a half marathon on Sunday and I know this is might be a little disappointing that we're not going to really break down uh what happened on Mount Elbert but I just got to tell you there's a lot of layers to there's layers to this thing and it's fun because guess what it's connected to history tradition uh experience and um people you know like real legitimate mountain and Ultra Runners from across the United States but especially here in Colorado who have put forth very Valiant efforts on Mount Elbert all right 14,433 ft above sea level that's a summit of Mount Albert and let's just say Joseph and I put forth a very good effort today but some other things some other actions that's a better way to say it some some other actions were also put forth on Mount Elbert literally at the exact same time that Joseph and I were on the mountain all right and I'll just leave it at that and so probably in a week from now 10 days from now once Joseph and I are back from Italy again we got to go to Italy go race and once we're back I just don't think I'm going to have the time to really dive into what transpired on the mountain and what we witnessed all right I'm going to leave it at that it was very good I will say it was a PR for me Joseph I'm not sure if he's act I don't think he has actually on that particular Trail the North Trail on Mount Elbert I don't think he's ever put forth an fkt effort and that's what we did today and so that was my probably third third or fourth effort in the last five or six years on that mountain and it was a PR so that's good but there's layers layers to this story and it's fun and dramatic quite quite dramatic oh my goodness all right I'll let you dig into it if you want to over on straa all right we will uh we will toss it to the uh f KT playlist right there sorry I can't give you more answers but I got to we got to we got to get off to Italy all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

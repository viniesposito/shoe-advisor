  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run and this is Robbie with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and you're listening to the drop our weekly podcast about all things including running mhm mostly the all things part yeah exciting week some of the running yeah we've got I I know what it is but these new mics I'm always like it's never quite right yeah it's literally the best it's like exact you could put it exactly how you want it no like I wanted to I want to push it that way a little bit press the uh the filter the on your mic Meg what the foam the foam thing press that the whole way down yeah it's not the whole way down there you go now that everyone has heard weird noises yeah we're good to go yeah um despite everyone saying they were Revolt if Ralphie wasn't on this episode he couldn't come into the office today but he's doing fine we didn't we didn't want to risk him with Chad coming in to do his big guy shoe pcks we thought he would go nuts and oh be out of sorts and then now he'd be like on Megan's shoulder like a parrot yeah trying to hang out so yeah we just decided yeah so now he's just home alone he's setting booby traps up he is probably I was like big we should leave him a nice chew toy for him to hang out when she's like he won't use it he'll be in anxiety the whole time we're going gone yeah he just sleeps or has anxiety the whole time we're gone but that's does that even mean if a dog has anxiety dude they used to make us give him pills for it and then I was like this is too much now mag takes the pills yeah yeah Thomas got into them before his last marathon trying to I had such high hopes for Ralphie being a running dog yeah and then you broke him you tried I did wait why didn't that work out he would run with me he'd like doing like a mile Thomas took from one mile to eight miles no no no no I I bumped it up to four then I bumped it up to six uhhuh and then when I did eight he was like no never again we got to we got to about four miles out and he sat down and just was like not for me sounds like my kids just we bought one of those um like dog running leashes that you tie around your waist and one day I tried to go out for a run with him in the afternoon and he like saw a squirrel or something and it just the whole thing just broke in half oh so yeah but he was done running before that like I I would even go get that leash because we got a replacement one and I would go get it and he would just sit down be like nope man anyway so he just become a lazy bum then that's emmo always he gets skinny when we take him to Doggy camp and then he comes back and loads back up nice it sounds like me going to tr and then it's the opposite the opposite effect do you think we should tell everyone what we're doing with the Monday podcast for the remainder of December SL beginning of January yeah cuz honestly I don't even know so go for it so everyone who listened to the last Mondays heard Taylor Bodin chat who is going to officially become part of the team in 2025 uh and for people who maybe don't know all of our backstories we will be interviewing each other oh I didn't I actually know we were doing that and Publishing that on Mondays yeah but but that's for do you think we were doing with you is that on the schedule for today it sure is oh what time it was on for 1:30 but we can adjust it Oh I thought that was just the drop in general like I thought that was this episode well could be okay could be all right cool well man and now I have to get my head straight I'm G to ask some really tough ones get ready have to see what kind of tall tals I can come up with I feel like it'll be okay all right it should be fine and then uh I mean we've also got we could give updates on our weightlifting now oh cuz I know people are dying is Carl putting up the first shots right now photos whole body they do not go up until until something looks better yeah seriously did you take the photo Robbie uh I actually did oh wow um but it's horrible isn't it yeah it's a site for Sor eyes for sure I would wait I think it's the opposite a sight for Sor eyes a sight for Sor eyes means that like oh site for Sor eyes is a good thing yeah like oh you're a site for Sor eyes yeah what's it sight for un a sight for health eyes it it like that like mine would be blinding I wish I was blind so you have cataracts yeah that's what yeah site for cataracts site for cataracts um well yeah instead of update it's probably more of a Down dat I feel like the first week the first session I was absolutely destroyed I did you never do for the record I don't do anything I was going to say I'm the laziest person out there outside of running activated parts of your legs that you don't activate normally yeah I don't think I think they were in hibernation you had me all worried like I went and I was like totally freaked out that I was going to get crushed no I thought I figured you would be mildly okay yeah I am yeah I there's no uh from I've R been running somewhat healthy so I figured I'll just let it ride and see what happens and I well I figured out what happens when you weight lift and I was couldn't run for like 3 days but think about the potential now once you get great at weightlifting you'll be so strong and then running will just be so easy I don't think it will be I think it right now I'm just maintaining it's like I need this to maintain like it's not like I'm going to weightlift and all of a sudden become a great Runner I think it's just to keep me I see what you're saying keep me running yeah I but then we went at the same time the other day and can't really th it reminds me of when you first started running every time you go for a run there's a new injury do you know what I mean maybe not okay I don't know I was tell Meg like I feel like what they're doing to us now is like we're trying to learn how to run and they're like do a lap and we do a lap and they're like all right good job yeah yeah yeah yeah they're like here's like I don't think they put in negative weights I think they had to cut parts of the bar off to make it lighter for me I think there's like removable Lego pieces from the bar and they're just like taking it off here you go here's 20 lb just give that guy just just the bar they're doing the like less than the bar but they're doing the 5B increments on you right yeah I mean it was a broomstick with uh marshmallows on the end but I tried not to look over I just I was like I'm just GNA let Robbie do this thing I'm not g to look over yeah but I don't know so we'll see the now the I have like a hip flexor thing going on so the squats I couldn't do the whole way cuz they would pinch it or whatever did they not like for me they're putting like a little bench with a little spacer for me to because I can't go really deep in my squats yet oh okay so I go down and I touch it with my butt and then come back up yeah do are you not doing I didn't have that no um like what are you doing like is yours just freeballing it yeah I feel like that's not the term free butt in it yeah but yeah people do I can't even imagine the the absolute agony that people who weight lift are going through right now listening to this yeah by the way I Googled in my prayers I Googled what's the opposite of a sight for sore eyes and there's a lot of really good ones but I think my favorite is mon monstrosity oh a monstrosity yeah yeah does that feel right I mean that's just a word that's not a saying yeah oh no yeah they're all just words oh so it's just saying that's a synonym for it it's an an antonym oh an antonym iore horror good blemish hidey deformity yeah that's all act descri sight that's the one that's the my weightlifting journey in a in a nutshell yeah but yeah so there is no official Opposite of sight for sore eyes I think that's just a saying all right cool I mean the the only thing I hate about the squat is that I have to get my shoulders back real far and like where they want you to place the bar and it kills my shoulders like it's not not the weight of the bar it's the flexibility I don't have in my shoulders so I open up my chest and the bar is holding it back like that he's like especially especially the shoulder that you blew out yeah and didn't ever actually get physical therapy for that's the one he's like it'll loosen up you're like no trust me there's no loosening the cartilage is I go back tonight okay yeah have fun I will are you on once a week twice a week how are we doing uh twice okay but I think think I'm cutting back my running mileage as far as like I'm not doing marathon training I've resigned myself to I'm not doing the spring training for a marathon but fall maybe maybe so are you just going to run a marathon without training yeah I thought about CU I do I wouldn't hate doing like a 50k but I'm yeah I love that race but the worst thing about it is that you still have to train for it isn't that why it always sells out and then you can still get in like a few weeks before cuz people are like for that yeah it's like I want to do the Race part without the training part I want all the glory and the beer after that race isn't that fun that's the thing it's not like a great it's not like I'm doing it for a time or for I just want to do the race but to do 32 miles or whatever 31 miles you still have to do long runs unless you want it to really really suck after the third time I did I said I'll never do it again and then I ran it five more times cuz friends would sign up and you'd be like okay we'll do it cuz we used to have like a a party and and people down for it and so I was like well I might as well I don't want to be the only one who didn't run yeah and every time right around that second Loop where you're going back in and you can you know when you can hear the finish line but you know it's like six miles away mhm they kind of come close I'm always like why did I do this this is the worst is so bad but like you don't have to like when you're trying to race a marathon I feel like you have to incorporate a lot of speed work like for that you just log a bunch of Miles no you need health that's the problem though I I don't want to log a bunch of Miles okay yeah I don't mind the speed work I like the speed work that's fine uh I don't like the it's just I just don't have enough time I'll be honest like the to do the long runs every weekend and then 48 mile runs during the week it's just like with family stuff and everything else and if if I'm doing weightlifting I feel like the weightlifting will be more advantageous to My overall physical fitness than doing two more Six Mile runs or but that's the thing like I run in the morning so the weightlifting doesn't interfere like that time isn't like extra time to me CU I don't run in the afternoon yeah so it's like I'm just adding no even if I run in the morning it's still like I it's just it's just it just I end up hating running I'll be honest okay so let's not do that yeah um but anyways so maybe in the fall okay I just don't feel like doing it right now be h what about grit you're going to have to get lots of miles in January anyway yeah I I mean I just I just fake it he's going for B baby seal okay what is that 25 no one's checking those grit stats I know that personally don't say that um yeah 25 we'll do 20 I mean I could do I'll do a 100 do 100 yeah maybe a little maybe more than that I don't know Rio you're you're finicky you always changed you could get into and be like you know I'm really enjoying running right now yeah it's just just depends uh but I felt like even in the fall I was juggling I was really like trying to put pieces in like the running pieces in and it was a little bit stressful are you still working with your running coach yeah okay so he's been cool cuz he's been like knows that I'm crazy like mentally like you said I'm always just uh trying to figure stuff out and so but he's working with me to build a plan cuz in my mind when I when I think about running coaches I always think oh you got to be pushing for this goal you know what I mean otherwise what the what the hell is the point of having a coach yeah but it's also i' never considered it's just meeting you where you're at and making therapist running in a and making running what you want it to be you know what I mean well I mean while incorporating some stuff to help you get better we're you know we we still work with the coach right now and it's not we're in between like training for London wouldn't start until January yeah so I was kind of like well why you know what do I need a coach for it in between but the he's actually been working on our fitness and making sure our leg turnover is good and I actually have really enjoyed this part of training because I've got a training plan it's not like totally aggressive like I'm averaging like 40 something miles a week and it's just like the long run is like 12 miles but then I'll have like a 10 mile run the next day or something like that um but it's not like those long grinding yeah yeah runs and so it's just like it's fun and to watch kind of like the fitness grow during this time where it's there's no pressure MH to kind of for me it takes some of the like stress out of running yeah part of it though is that I do need a goal also to call me accountable so it's kind of like I don't know how to juggle those two maybe half marathon goal will be nice well you could do that but like my goal right now is just like I want to be able to go out and run with people and not be totally out of my depth yeah I also kind of Miss here's the other thing that I told him I kind of miss running with people because when you have work prescribed workouts and stuff you you're just like well I have to do that workout I can't run with a group cuz I have these Paces thrown in and that kind of drives me crazy see I thought I was going to do that with the faster basses and doing the Wednesday night run I was like I've always you know I can do that the health I went a couple times I'm like I don't want to do this I don't like running at night and man everybody there is like throwing down yeah hardcore on those Hills Robbie there's 151 spots available and have 50k just saying okay nice if you wanted to do it let's see what's the least amount of training I can do to get by it's March 22nd I'll ask my coach that what's the least amount of things I can do to run up 50k I bet you could do 10 and 12 Mile runs long runs back to back that would probably do it yeah I still don't want to do that okay okay so maybe this is out we should do let's see how bad it can hurt by doing just Max 10 mile long runs on the weekend yeah that would be horrible I don't know this guy Daniel wrote in though with a good idea for grit and I think we could implement it now for winter grit I did see that yeah I if we do like a week Challenge and it could be something like uh you know take a photo of this or or you know just different things that we could do like a weekly challenge and then have a prize for each week yeah that'd be cool like finding random things like you do on the ground or make us like hit someone in the face with a snowball that's feels less nice all right build an but if but if you video that yes the least run with the least amount of clothing in January oh tank tops and shorts and 30\u00b0 yeah like it would be least amount of clothes coldest weather make get some nssw stuff what I was thinking there's some freaks out there too many PE too many dudes without shirts are going to be running around and loving it it'll look like a choy choy Winterfest we have to change the name Joy to the World yeah nice yeah absolutely oh man just trying to think of other things uh anyways but yeah that that's a that's a good idea I like that yeah we'll um we'll brainstorm on it and if we can get four really good ideas together we'll implement it this year in January for grit speaking of winter we we got some new tracksmith believe in the Run bright and Basse layers yeah believe in the Run brandit bright and bass layers for sale that's definitely my favorite winter long sleeve I don't know how many we have left we oh really yeah no way they they we just did one story and a lot went so I think half of are gone already wow yeah so if if people want them we'll put up a thing in here but if people want them they get better act fast cuz it was limited sizing that we are able to do anyway that is the best piece of winter running gear you can buy pretty much and I have to say the print looks amazing it looks nice although tell everyone what you're getting to wear this winter Robbie that's from tracksmith uh oh they have this what is it a jumper onesie a onesie onesie bib a bib so it's the is it the turnover tights but a bib version yes I believe so and I'm 100% going to wear those I don't know how it looks like to you know how you got to take everything off as a whole ordeal it's like when you wear a jumpsuit as a lady sorry it's the N obviously the ndo bib yeah and it looks like um sort of a cross between your running tight and a cycling bib or like or like your ski gear yeah like your like isn't that isn't a B what you wear when you're skiing uh yeah pretty much yeah as somebody who doesn't ski I agree with you 100% I feel like I used to wear those you know I've never gone skiing ever what do you know that I was actually on have you been snowboarding like the one sport I've never tried I've gone snowboarding like eight nine times yeah so I have done okay that feels a little better I grew up skiing yeah so I that was my it was one of my major sports did you see Lindsay Vons coming back it well she is out of retire uh she's skier yeah oh yeah she was like really good she Olympian yeah very good like the best she's pretty good I get her mixed up with peekaboo Street remember her yeah what peekaboo I don't know who that is peekaboo street from back she's like a 90s yeah she wasn't as good as Lindsay Von though all right first check in this one's going to be a weird episode for you so buckle up uh I I should say that every week but this one feels particularly weird so hang in there we'll probably get around to something you enjoy listening to at some point we'll see you in a minute all right guys let's talk about our sponsor Lagoon pillows all right let's do it we've been using them for years now still my favorite pillow ever and now's a great time to gift a pillow do you ever remember sleep without a legon pillow under your head I mean when we travel and it's not great yeah I I felt like the last hotel we were at it was almost like someone rolled up some socks and put it in the pillow to give it the stuffing socks and rocks yeah yeah well if you want a really great pillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com there is a quiz right on that page just hit the button fill out your information say what you like what you don't like and it'll populate the perfect pillow for you and if you use the code believe at checkout you can also save do the Winter Olympics get you guys as excited as the Summer Olympics no yeah it's really hard dude when I go through the channels and you're like looking and there's figure skating or even that sport with the curling curling MH I mean the only thing that I'll stop and watch I really kind of like the the loue L is cool and like is it because of that movie cuz only for the yeah the Jamaicans are you are you hoping for the Rex like watch I like the Rex but I just the amount of speed and it just looks so cool like you know they go they're like flying it's like a bullet wait they wreck on those oh yeah yeah I wouldn't want to but they do jeez I like that decapitations i' watch downhill downhill skiing I enjoy you know what the uh downhill skiing is pretty awesome what about like the I mean the snowboarding is pretty cool now they have it yeah I mean after a while though I'm like oh cool you did a loop you you did a they did trick cool I think the best one to do would be the the biathlon where they have to shoot stuff and then ski yeah but you would just like to shoot stuff yeah minus the scheme yeah yeah just I'll just walk there um they but the the calming your heart rate to you know from going all out effort to then like settling your heart to get a perfect shot that's an incredible skill it is pretty sick and it's also I like I like the sports that are based on like that was a survival thing it like it was I think we talked about this how track and field the field portion is just War tactics yeah that's it and I love that kind of stuff I'm surprised they don't have drone flying in track and fuel by now oh jeez just that's that's the newest version of track and field speaking of shooting though we had a guy from Maryland from talson oh yeah with the Gilman of all places so for those of you listening who don't know Gilman where this kid Luigi was from this is like one of the most prestigious high schools schools in it's it's K through high oh it is yeah one of the most prestigious schools in Maryland yeah like it it used to be like a joke like those guys all there like a fraternity once they left there that like they'd all go work at like the financial places and stuff like that but I mean that school's been hit a couple times cuz they had a little thing with um little little problem with a teacher a couple years ago yeah and now now this I this isn't yeah their PR needs to step it up we went to the we had a cross country race there for the kids a couple months ago it's a beautiful campus yeah it's ridiculous look like nicer way nicer than my college campus yeah right but it it was crazy cuz I was Googling remember at work that day I was Googling Gilman tuition like hours before this guy was caught and before we even knew that he went to Gilman or anything cuz we were just talking about private schools yeah yeah why would we talk about Gilman we know something cuz I ran into that person that you knew his kid goes there and uh I was like oh man I hope they're not connecting the dots on me here 35 Affiliated $35,000 a year for uh for elementary for elementary 38 for upper upper yeah is that what they call it what what are the Richer what are the rich people call it Upper School upper class upper School Upper School yeah Callison oh college preparatory yeah Preparatory Academy it's a beautiful Campus A lot of people use that track because it's a great track in you're able if you get there before I think I think it's before 8 a.m. you can run on the track it's a it's fantastic condition and uh a lot of people would like I used when I lived out in the county I used to it was exactly like I think one or two miles from my house okay I would run over there for my warmup do my track workout and run home so it's it's just a fantastic campus and everything but to it's kind of like it's so weird when a big thing happens and you're like I feel like that Meme of um Leonardo Caprio where he's pointing at the TV there that's us yeah it's like yeah of course it that's a thing in Baltimore that's what we're known for that crabs and The Wire yeah we're really doing there has it has to be murder involved in some way yeah um but yeah that's that was a that was a wild thing to happen uh speaking of wild things Robbie do you want to tell everyone why we're recording on Wednesday instead of Tuesday oh yeah because I woke up well I didn't wake up I I eventually you did oh yeah I did do that too took my kids to school came back my wife was going to take the car to work someone broke into the car last night or whatever sorry not broke into the car she forgot to lock the doors which wait it couple of weeks ago yeah which also happened two weeks ago or a month ago it happens quite often I'll say that how's the relations at home right now what oh it's fine here's the thing I do it too so I'm like I can't really call out judgment but you know if you're getting the kids out of the car and a lot happen grocery whatever I get it and but we don't have any we don't keep anything in our car so there's nothing to steal so that's why if somebody gets in our car it's not a big deal that we didn't unlock except for your manual dude you didn't replace the manual right yeah still haven't gotten that back still looking through the neighborhood for that one um and then so anyways somebody popped a steering column and tried to guess steal a car but it's not a hondai or kia so you can't just like stick a screwdriver in and start it um but nevertheless I thought all was good because I I mean the battery was dead so then I charged it but then the um and it ran and everything but the locks if you try to lock the doors or whatever it just they keep unlocking Non-Stop and the key fop doesn't work cuz I think there's a you know a safety feature on the ignition that disables everything if it's tampered with and so now I got to go to the freaking dealer and tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. and get that try to get that figured out which I'm sure it's going to cost like four4 or $500 probably well you just for someone to look at stuff sometimes you know the clock starts going yeah oh yeah I mean just putting the wheels in the parking lot is going to be 100 bucks ah so that's it so that was annoying and then someone was trying to scam me through text yesterday and then Seafood dins no but they were like you do you remember you exchanged pictures with me and he's like I probably did I was like trying to recall who that was and exchanged phot did you engage in in conversation oh yeah I kept it going for like dude as soon as I see that I don't know the number no I flipped the script on them oh cuz let him know that it's a working phone number they sent me like a stock photo of some random uh did you send one back no man but they I I was messing with them they're like you need to tell me the truth or whatever and I said I'll tell you the truth if you go get me an Apple gift card for $100 and then give me the code did they do it no but I kept like just using that line of uh and then I just cut it off you seen the AI grandma that they built in the UK to handle like phone scams I think I heard about this like keeps him on the line she's like now you want me to do what it's like he's like you they had recordings of like the scammers on the other end just yelling at the old lady you know the sad thing about this is that about that is that a lot of the scammers are in basically slave or slaves in like Myanmar and Cambodia and stuff so they're in these compound where they got tricked into basically work they thought they were going to work as a like a real job and they essentially get kidnapped and they have to buy back their freedom by raising so much money through these scams so if they don't do so much in a day or whatever see but why would I let a good earner go and that's well that's the thing is they don't really they keep telling them that okay but then they drag it out did you see aliens Romulus um is that a SC is that about a phone scammer no but they you are on this off Planet working on the mines there and when the girl is like I think I'm almost filled my credits like they're like no you got to keep going yeah so it's pretty much the same thing so I always feel bad kind of leading them on because I know it's most likely just somebody who's trying to work their way out some weird death you're too you're thinking about this too much here's what happens when someone texts you that you just go report junk and then you move on I know I know like I don't I like to pull the thread see what happens yeah but like you're making up a whole story about this young C Cambodian fella trapped with a G you don't know um but yeah it's anyways that's a whole different thing yeah so that was the oh and then I had a sorry last thing there was a contractor doing work on my house and you know they subcontract out to other their workers and he was installing this door on basement in the back of the patio and I had to correct him like four times on the work and make him redo it because it was bad work and I was just so mad because how did you know it's bad work also where did you find this dude well the guy the contracting company is good so they it turns out that it was like somebody who they were training and it was like his first his first day by himself how how did you know he was doing it wrong though oh because it's a simple it's a pretty easy job just to stalling door like so I mean it wasn't flush with the the wall like all this stuff and I'm just like dude I I I could do this by myself if I had the time um and so I just had to make him correct it over and over again but wait if you had the time if you weren't talking to Cambodian telemarketers well I don't do that for my whole Saturday that's only from 8:00 to 10: a.m.",

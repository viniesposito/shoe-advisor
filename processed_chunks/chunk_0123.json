  "text": "I purchased the alphafly 3 back at the start of the year and I've put many hundreds of training miles and also a couple of races through the shoe as well so I thought it was time to sit down and give you my completely unbiased thoughts on the shoe and to see how well they are holding up after all of those Mars I've done 200 training and racing Mars in this prototype colorway here and I've also done one marathon in Berlin in this shoe here we're going to be answering those all important questions today how long are these shoes holding up what the phone feeling like after 200 miles and can the Everyday Athlete really benefit from a shoe like this or is it just for those Elites because as you'll have seen the world records for the women's and the men's Marathon are now being broken in Chicago with the alphafly version 3 right let's get stuck in the review first thing we're going to chat about the differences between the alphafly 3 and the alphafly version 2 so when Nike launched alphafly version 3 it came with a completely new redesign there was a big weight decrease as well for me it was 30 G lighter in my UK size 12 the arch on the inside is a lot less pronounced version two people are getting some big hot spot issues in here and some soreness on that inside of the arch that is a lot lot better now and now you've got this lovely continuous midsole which just makes it so much smoother through the foot strike and you've got a little bit of a wider carbon plate for some extra stability in there as well well let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like the alphafly version 3 this is a road racing Super Shoe that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines price-wise this shoe sent me back a staggering \u00a3285 we'll put it up with the other currencies up on the screen now stack cut at the back 40 mm right at that legal limit we've got 8 mm drop over all this is coming in for me at 269 G for me in my UK size 12 so nice and light that's what we like to see this is a neutral shoe and it has this lovely atomknit upper super breathable get some fantastic air flow in that as you start to pick up the pace midso we're talking Nike's Flagship zoomx midso with two Air Zoom Pods at the bottom of the shoe here to give you that extra propulsion we've got a ful length carbon plate running throughout the shoe with the outsole of the shoe we've got a lot of rubber up at the front here to give you some really good grip mainly for your Forefront and midfoot Strikers rear foot Strikers going to be a little less grip there's nothing there at the back of the shoe just some very small rubber units here there are no different widths available there are men's and women's different fits and this shoe was true to size for me right let's get stuck into my likes my first like with the Ally is the super smooth ride with this updated midsole you're getting a lovely buttery smooth transition through the foot strike there it's a lot less Slappy than version one and two because cuz it had that sort of bit missing in the center of the shoe there the lightweightness of this shoe you really notice that as well when you're going from version two to version three if you're a heel Striker this is going to be a lot smoother through that whole foot strike compared to version one and version two my second like with the shoe is just so comfortable at all Paces previous version of the alphafly they were just so clumpy at those slower Paces when you're warming up and easy pace and now this is comfortable at all Paces this new breathable upper is fantastic that sock like feel really good lockdown in the shoe as well I've had no issues with any blisters hot spots anything uncomfortable even at the back end of the marathons when I've been racing the shoe absolutely comfortable from right from the start the middle and all the way to the end previously I've always reverted back to vaporfly version 3 cuz it was just way more comfortable but with this update here this is now a little bit faster than vaporfly for me and with that Comfort aspect of as well it's the one I've been reaching for for my races my third like with this shoe is the surprising that what I've called this video is the surprising truth the durability has been really good this shoe has now done 200 miles in it a lot of training miles getting ready for Berlin and then I raised Melbourne in the shoe I did actually get a new pair for Berlin cuz I was like oh they say it wasn't going to last very long I better get a new pair but I actually went faster in Melbourne with my old slightly more bashed up pair that a lot of Manufacturers would say has passed its better days but for me I had a fantastic run in Melbourne it really has held up really really well I like a lot of people get frustrated by manufacturers saying these Super Shoes are only going to last 100 miles of perfect running and then after that you need to Trop and change them in reality I really don't think that's true if you're an elite athlete you've got unlimited amount of shoes to choose from Yes it probably is going to make that like .05 little bit of difference right guys out here on the ten path got a speed session to 7 by 3 minutes getting ready for Valencia on my left foot I've got my 200 mile pair of Al 3es on my right the Nearly New Pair just done at 26 miles of Berlin marathon and that just want to see how they feel how they compare how that Popp that springiness that bounce and see what it's like between the two shoes have they lost it are they now dead do they need to be retired I don't think so I think they still feel fantastic but going to go through these three minute reps here and see how they feel going to be doing these around 10K to half marathon pace [Music] it's really hard to tell the difference there is a slight difference the good the newer pair feel a little bit more stable the airpods just have a little bit more life left in them they haven't been compressed and crunch quite as much as's the pair on the left but really very very marginal I think most people could easy Run 3 to 400 training and racing mares in their shoe absolutely fine wear wise on the bottom of the shoe I've just got a little bit of wear on the outso here where I land and then I sort of roll inwards through the foot strike there it's a little bit worn down at the front here but what's important with these shoes is how the foam feels how that's holding up and I really feel there's so much life left in this shoe and we carry on getting ready for Valencia by doing a lot of training Mars in their shoe it's far from done and then my fourth like with this shoe is just how stable this shoe is for a maximum stack height shoe that super wide carbon fiber plate you've got in their shoe just feel really confident when I'm cornering and things like that when I was in a couple of these races we had to do some 180 turn backs I just felt super confident going to that didn't really enter my mind that I might roll an ankle or something like that which you can sometimes get with these Max stack height shoes the grip is much improved on this shoe I haven't run in the rain in this shoe yet been very lucky mainly training in the summer but when you go through some Aid stations and things like that where there's water bottles and stuff all over the road when I was going through that the grip felt super good when the roads did get a little bit wet but as always on the channel here I want to give you that completely honest review so there are a few dis likes and let's get stuck into those now the first dislike with the shoe is it still just a little bit noisy nowhere near as Slappy as the older shoes I'll put up a little bit of footage now this is Midway through the Melborne marathon in a really quiet section and you can just hear how loud this shoe is when you run along for some people they don't like the amount of noise that these shoes can make not as bad as the old one but it's still a bit noisy my second dislike is it's still a little bit on the narrow side through the midf foot it's been absolutely fine for me I did have a few issues with the earlier shoes and it's much improved through the midot Section here but it's still just a little bit on the narrow side and you do notice that and then obviously price has to come into it in the UK this is nearly \u00a3300 but with how well the shoe is holding up as I say you're getting some good value here and I think if you spent some time on some lights like Vinted or Ebay you could probably pick up a used pair for not a lot of money and have many happy training miles in this if a pair's only done 100 miles or something you can pick that up and it's going to feel absolutely fantastic so what about a rotation what can I pair this up with well if you want to stick with an Nike range something like the Vero 17 or the Pegasus Plus for your everyday runs and then use this shoe here for your key workouts and races if you got a bit more cash to spend you want a three shoe rotation it's a bit of a debate whether to get something like the vaporfly 3 which is a little bit lighter a little bit snappier and it could be a good option for some faster speed work at those 5K and 10K page that's when I'd probably like to whip out the vapor 53 if I was doing a 5k or 10k race it's just a little bit as I say a little bit lighter and snappier type of shoe there be still really good in this but this is really that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines or potentially you could dial up your recovery runs with something like the Invincible version 4 is launching very soon I'm kind of checking the Nike website every day for when it's dropping so get subscribed to that we'll get it in and we'll give you that review right conclusions and Final thoughts obviously I've really enjoyed running this shoe it's been fantastic but who is this shoe for and I think because this shoe is so smooth so comfortable but not overly aggressive it really does mean a more intermediate Runner can benefit from a shoe like this so many carbon shoes out there are so stiff and so firm you have to have that like Elite level leg strength to get the most out of the shoe but for me that hasn't being the case here I feel a lot of people can benefit from a shoe like this there's no Bild big Breakin period and it's really going to be popular with a lot of marathon runners regardless of their ability so is it recommended definitely I recommend you check out my full Nike lineup video we link to that video which is going to be up here next if you want to check out my whole Melborne Marathon video that video is down here where I use this very shoe to run in so that's it guys I'm off to get some more training miles done let me know your thoughts on the alphafly version 3 keep on working hard keep done we'll see you very soon in the next one",

  "text": "this year I spent \u00a3 7,952 buying running shoes to be able to test here on the channel to give you those completely honest unsponsored reviews and that's about just over $10,000 for our American friends and of all the pairs I've tested along the way there have been some absolute bangers out there that I've really enjoyed and carried on using after the videos have gone up from that initial testing so that's what this video is all about the best of the best all the shoes that we buy here on the channel to review and test I buy 100% with my money so just want to say a massive thank you this year to everyone that supports the channel likes our videos comments on the videos checks out my website benp parks.com buys running hats technical gear our festar rated plans I love hearing all about your stories your successes with the kit and the plans and the videos as well so thank you so so much so in this video we're going to be going through the best daily the best speed shoe the best race shoe the best Max stack recovery shoes the best long run shoes the best budget shoes the most comfortable shoes the best for heavier Runners the best for beginners and then finally the best overall so make sure you stay tuned for that feel free to move the slider around in the video everything will be timestamped so starting out with the best daily shoes and the Nova blast 5 but what's a daily shoe all about these really are shoes that do it all pretty well great for those daily Mars for people that just want to maybe just have one shoe in their rotation or it's going to be a staple of a big shoe rotation as well the shoe where you're clocking up most of your miles and this was a late entry this year it's only just come in the number five Nova Blast from aex set me back \u00a335 a 41 mil stack cut at the back 8 mm drop overall 300 G so nicely on the light side new updated midsole with the FF blast Max sizing wise what worked best for me was going half aze down right starting out with my likes a really smooth stable ride with this one it's very bouncy it's very cushioned it looks after the legs well on those longer runs a true daily trainer the shoe's really comfortable at lots of different speeds second like really good value at this price segment it's well put together good build quality as well and should last a decent amount of time third like comfort with the shoe again really good I'm really liking the new lacing system they've got on the Nova blast 5 giving a really good solid lockdown and again with this partially usted tongue in there that's not moving around and providing any irritation it does feel a little bit wider up front here so if you've got a wider foot you're going to Rejoice here a little bit of extra material just really comfy straight out the box and some good breathability as well my next like is you've just got a lot of cushion here versus the weight of the shoe sho's quite nice and lightweight but you've got lots of chunky foam here to look after the legs it feels really lightweight on your foot as well so kudos for aex for getting this around for me around about 300 G my fifth like is the true versatility of this shoe just very easy to run in no fuss really simple and again really easy for me to recommend it just gets on does the job no matter what distance or Pace is on the plan it's going to look after you pretty well in terms of what I don't like about the shoe the dislikes the wet weather grip real shame at this time of year as well it's just surprisingly not good the version four of this was equally as bad and unfortunately they haven't changed the compound of the rubber on the bottom you might be slipping around a little bit with this shoe in the winter but in the dry and in the summer you're going to be all good so in summary the Nova blast 5 one of the best all rounders out there a really great shoe at this price point whether you're going to get your bolt training in or you just want one shoe in your rotation to do at all if you are worried about that winter grip let's have a chat about the aded ass Boston that's coming up next so my next best daily shoe of the year is the Adidas Boston version 12 got some really good winter grip on the bottom of here so you don't need to worry about sliding round without us this fantastic Continental grip but this shoe sent me back \u00a3140 38 mil stack out at the back 7 mil drop overall for me 318 G little bit heavier than the Nova blast but still not too bad midso wise we've got a layer of the ultra light light strip Pro added asses at premium foam and then a layer of the light strip 2.0 Eva and it's also got some glass fiber infused energy rods in here kind of like a play added as his version of a plate with these rods that run through the shoe sizing wise these do come up a little bit big for me I ordered my usual UK size 12 had a bit too much room at the front of the shoe probably due to the very minimal amount of padding at the back of the shoe but yeah that's just me I'd recommend going half aze down right let's have a chat about my likes starting out with that excellent grip that Continental rubber outsa really fantastic for wet weather the second like here it just delivers that fun engaging ride it's really happy to pick up the pace probably a little bit more than the Nova blast because of those rods you've got running through the shoe the ride feels surprisingly fast it feels like you spent a lot more than 140 to get the kind of speed that you'll be able to pull out of this shoe this update here bought that slightly wider base so stability again surprisingly good in the shoe this is a shoe I could definitely see someone racing a 5k all the way up to a Marathon distance so true versatility and then my final like with the shoe it also feels nice and lightweight on the foot the cushion really helps with those longer runs and as say pretty wide in the upper which is really good for an anad shoe normally they do come in very much on the narrow side but the Boston don't need to worry about that plenty of space up front in terms of dislikes with the Boston just that minimal padding around the heel that's just kind of what you got with this update it didn't cause me any problems i' just like a little bit more Comfort there for my longer runs some people might get some heel slip and the tongue is just a little bit on the short side so you can't do that heel lock down lacing I didn't have any issues with it it just something that might well happen but in summary with the Boston just a great all round daily shoe it's got that more assisted ride compared to something like the Nova blast it's not quite as comfortable as the Nova blast but it's definitely slightly faster and you're going to pick up the pace a little bit more with the Boston but if you do want to pick up the pace a little bit more than that let's have a chat about the best speaches of 2024 right we've got a couple of speed shoes to chat about now some very different types of speed shoes as well these are for when you want a nice Snappy fast shoe for doing some of your workouts in for your faster efforts your tempos or your thresholds or maybe some shorter races as well although really you can do a lot of different racing in these shoes there really are those shoes that are just that one down from the allout Super Shoes starting out with one of my very best shoes of the Year stay tuned to see if it makes the best shoe of the year the Nike Zoom Flight version 6 this has been an absolute joy to run in this set me back \u00a315 really big maximum stack cut at the back 42 mil so just over that legal limit 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise getting a little bit heavier now 322 G midsole wise we've got a couple of different Foams here on top we've got a nice layer of Nike's Flagship zoomx midsole and then underneath we've got this EVA foam which Nike called the sr2 foam that's a little bit firmer but adds a little bit more stability and also some really good durability and support in there as well there is a carbon fiber PL PL in the shoe Nike call that a fly plate and that sandwich between those two layers of foam and this was true to size for me right let's chat about the likes there's quite a few to get through here the first one being the comfort that this shoe offers really fantastic the heel counter lock down really good good amount of padding at the back of the shoe so you feel nice and secure no issues with any sort of slipping good amount of width up at the front of the shoe as well really comfortable for those longer runs could certainly run up to a Marathon distance in this shoe it just has that all day Comfort feel about it second one speed wise I've been really surprised at the speed I've been able to extract from the shoe version five the one before this was super chunky really heavy this one is lighter and it just feels and is a lot faster as well the rocker at the front of the shoe here just gives a really smooth footstrike really smooth turnover and I actually found myself always looking forward to the next rep the midsole mashup that you've got here with those two different Foams it's just really responsive and so so bouncy you really feel like the shoe is just propelling you forward you could Cruise along at those Marathon effort Paces for a very long time the plate isn't super stiff you don't really notice it too much and it really helps with that stability in the shoe as well and I'd really say this Sho is only slightly slower for me versus my alphafly and my vapor fly and they're much much stiffer and of course much more expensive as well my third like with this shoe is just the True Value at this price point it appears to be really quite well well built and durable the out soole really really good great grip on this outs soole is just not wearing at all at the moment and I was carried on running the shoe well after 100 miles which is really impressive given the amount of fast running I haven't done too much jogging in this shoe most of the time I've been doing my speed sessions those fast running efforts as well and carbon plates at this Price Point again pretty hard to find odd that Nike have kind of pric this very competitively but I think they thought they've got a real winner on their hands here they've got to launch this with an attractive price point to real sort of say their back on the scene and a lot of people check up and notice just how good this shoe is at that price point but as I say it's not all likes a couple of dislikes three dislikes to go through actually the first one with this waffle outsole Nike's waffle outsole is just a little bit noisy again it's just something to note here if you run by yourself it doesn't matter but if you're a little bit self-conscious it might be a little bit noisy but you're getting some really good grip in the shoe there as well the rear stability it's just a little soft at the back of the shoe that might put some heel Strikers off for me I'm a midfoot or 4ot sort of Striker so I haven't really had any issues there and thirdly I don't know let me know what you think down in the comments it's just not the prettiest shoe again does that matter if we're running fast let me know your thoughts but in summary a really good option for anyone training for a full Marathon or a half marathon to do those speed workouts those longer run workouts with those race Pace blocks in also a good option for racing for people that don't want to break the bank and spend 200 plus 250 I think the alpha FES are \u00a389 and absolutely crazy that's not available to everybody so again a really good option for a significant amount of change just a great value shoe a lot of tech and a really good price point right let's look at something a little bit more lowkey which was the socy Endorphin speed 4 so I got the socony shoe in In This Very vibrant colorway earlier on this year used it a little bit through the summer there's a much lower stack heite lot more ground feel you're going to get in this shoe compared to the Nike but starting out I paid \u00a3180 for this shoe little bit on the expensive side for this segment stack cut at the back 36 mm 8 mm drop overall weightwise a lot lighter though 285 G really can pick up the pace so well in this shoe we've got soers power run PB foam here a nylon plate so it's not too aggressive not like that full stiff carbon plates that you get sizing wise this was good this was true to size for me starting out with my lik's really versatile shoe I actually put this shoe in my sort of big daily recommendation because you can jog around in the shoe just as much as you can pick up the pace in the shoe as well so it kind of goes between the two categories you could easily go out for an easy run with stries Tempo runs track sessions and even races for me i' say up to a half marathon personally wouldn't want to do a marathon this I'm sure some people have but for me up to a Half Marathon distance I just personally want a little bit more cushion in the Foams there for a Marathon distance and then I'm really liking the plate in this shoe it's not super aggressive it feels really nice at those easy running Paces so for your warm up and cool down and just jogging around between reps as well feels super comfortable there and my second like with the shoe we've got a touch on it because it's so lightweight it's Nimble it's Snappy but also really stable as well just got that fast engaging ride good ground feel for those people that like a little bit more ground feel that's what you're going to get in their shoe for a fast park run fantastic grip on the bottom of the shoe as well good stability in the corners it the lock down it holds your foot nicely in place but let's have a chat about a couple of dislikes for some people this is going to be a little bit too firm I'd recommend then going for that Nike option if you want that super soft super bouncy super squishy responsive type shoe go for the Nike if you want a bit more ground contact feel again it's still responsive and it's still py but you just don't have as much sort of range of motion in the cushion you don't sink into the foam as much with this shoe so there maybe a dislike maybe a like I never know what to say in these things it depends what type of shoe you're after but because of that flip side I think it's probably a little bit too firm for that Marathon distance for me I'd like a little bit more cushion in there so better suited this shoe 5Ks 10ks half marathons you're going to really enjoy that lightweight nature of the shoe but in summary who do I recommend the sakon Endorphin speed 4 it's a really great option for someone doing a lot of speed work a lot of tempos lot of thresholds anyone looking for that lightweight shoe that isn't probably going to be into their marathons too much or anyone just looking for that lightweight Snappy shoe that they can really pick up the pace and run very fast with a high Cadence in as well but probably just steering away from those super long runs or that marathon training right let's have a chat about the big Racing shoes of the Year those Super Shoes starting out with the shoe that I think I've raced three marathons in this year which is the very lovely Nike fly version 3 so this set me back \u00a3285 I probably bought it on sport shoes with a bit of a discount code but that's the RRP anyway stack C at the back right of that legal limit 40 mm 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise a staggering 269 G so lightweight for the volume and the amount of foam in this shoe mid wise we've got a full chunk of Nike Zoom X foam here two Air Zoom Pods at the front of the shoe and a carbon fiber plate that's running throughout the shoe as well sizing wise all good here this was true to size for me starting out with my likes it's just a super smooth ride that you're getting in alphafly version 3 versus 1 and two 1 and two were just a little bit clunky this one is so much smoother through the footstrike it's very lightweight especially given the size and the bulk of the shoe if you are a heel Striker this shoe again is going to be a lot smoother than vers version one and version two my second like they've just dialed up that Comfort again in version 3 just a little bit more the breathable upper you're getting so much air flow through this shoe you're getting a really good solid lockdown with this fly knit upper it just hugs the feet so well just like you've got an extra pair of socks I've had absolutely no issues with any blisters any hot spots or anything uncomfortable at all no discomfort during any of my marathons or training runs and I did have plenty of issues with the alpha 5 1 and version two especially just here on the inside it's just a little bit too built up and I was getting some rubbing and irritations there for me that's definitely gone away with version 3 just finding a little bit faster than the first two versions and a little bit more comfort as well my third like with the shoe is just the durability that this one offers I think I did my review of this shoe after 250 miles and I was just really surprised at just how Poppy the foam was holding up how popular the airpods were it just wasn't slowing down even after those 250 MI of course I was getting a little bit of wear as we're now getting on this pair here and I've done about 100ks in this shoe that's always going to happen but it just didn't feel any slower when I had a brand new pair on one foot and myly older pair on the other they both felt really surprisingly good I really think most people could get about 3 to 400 miles of good happy training miles and racing miles out of this shoe and really don't listen to all the manufactur saying you're only going to get 100 good K they just want you to buy more shoes they really do last a long time this dislikes really still a little bit on the noisy side I'll put some footage of me running the mabor marathon here going through the park you can just hear the shoe again if you're a little bit self-conscious they're a bit Slappy that's just what you get but they're super fast my second one they're still a little bit on the narrow side through the midfoot so if you have got a particularly wide foot through that area you might still be getting a little bit of irritation but those tweaks they made were all good for me and then yeah just the price this is pretty much the most expensive running shoe you can buy I know added have got their one at \u00a3400 I don't think anyone's really entertaining that you've really got to be an elite athlete to get the most of that anyway but nearly \u00a3300 the alpha fly it's just a lot of money but for me it's the fastest shoe that I've run in this year especially over those half marathon and Marathon distances but I didn't do all of my races in this shoe we did actually reach for another shoe just here that's being pass to me done a lot of training Mars I actually ran New York marathan last year in this shoe but this is still the current shoe from Nike and I ran London marathon in this shoe and I ran Boston Marathon in this shoe earlier on this year pricewise this sent me back \u00a3240 stack kite I said we going the wrong way around Stack kite 40 mil stack at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and Weight Wise are very nice 252 G so it's a little bit lighter than the alphafly but it's a lot lower volume overall we've got Nike zoomx from midsole and we're getting that all important carbon fiber plate and this was true to size for me well let's have a chat about the likes of the vaporfly starting out it's very very fast because it's a little bit lighter than the alphafly it just feels a little bit more Snappy you're getting loads of springiness and responsiveness from the plate in the shoe it gives a really engaging ride as well it really feel like the shoe is out there working for you it's also very comfortable probably the most comfortable racing Super Shoe that I've ever probably it is the most comfortable racing Super Shoe that I've ever run in so many of the Super Shoes in this category are very aggressive very stiff and pretty uncomfortable as well with minimal padding but again this shoe it just works it's super lightweight so it doesn't have a lot of excess materials in here but for me it's just been comfortable right at the box and I think I've probably must have done around about 600 K in this shoe so far and it's been comfortable through every one of them and also with this shoe it's really the most versatile Super Shoe I think out there at the moment for me I could run 5Ks 10ks half marathons and up to the Marathon distance with the alpha flly because it's a bit heavy a bit more of Cruiser it doesn't have that sort of turn of pace because it's a little bit heavier but with this you're getting that I really feel the airly is better it just lasts longer it looks after your legs a little bit better in the Marathon distance but for the shorter distances this is where I'm going this is where I've been using this shoe just an absolute joy to running and it's also significantly cheaper than the alpha as well dislikes with this shoe I really feel the shoe's best at your race Paces it's not the best shoe to be running again no super shoes really have that sort of ability to run around jog recovering easy run Paces in so maybe I'm being a little bit harsh there but these shoes are so comfortable and so Poppy and so much fun at your race Paces not a shoe to be walking around in or jogging around in or anything like that but in summary slightly more versatile option than the alphafly better suited to those shorter race distances 5Ks 10K half marathons with the alphafly is just a little bit more Marathon specific and vaporfly just a little bit more on the comfortable side and obviously a little bit cheaper as well but once we've done our races then it's all about Mac stack and Recovery shoes to look after those legs so let's come on to our first entry in the video from Puma now I really didn't think I would enjoy this type of shoe but I found myself reaching it so so often these are kind of my Monday run shoe after a big Sunday session just to help my legs recover and look after the really well or whenever I've just going out for a very long run for a 30k run or something like that this is the type of shoe I really like to take on those runs when I'm not going to be picking up the pace so starting out with the Puma mag Max Nitro quite an expensive shoe here especially for Puma \u00a3170 stack height a massive absolutely crazy 46 mil stack at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop over allil and as you going to see with the both these shoes here a little bit on the heavy side obviously for the banner bulk in them to look after your legs 366 G mids soole we've got Puma's ful length nit TR foam midsole and the sizing was true to size for me lik wise with this shoe Ultra grippy pumer grip on the outsole been fantastic especially as I've got this shoe during the winter time it just hasn't let me down once many people now say that pumer make the best grippy outso on their shoes and this one I can't disagree with that it's been fantastic also surprisingly stable You' got to have confidence in the corners when it comes to these Mac stack shoes people worried about rolling things like that but this shoe you haven't got to worry about that the stability in this shoe from the phone because it's slightly more on the dense side here so you don't feel like you're wallowing all over the place this is a little bit firmer than most people might imagine it doesn't have that super soft super squishiness stay tuned for the next shoe if that's the type of thing you're looking for but it's got that just right amount for perfecting that long run performance and touching on that stability as well your feet actually sit slightly below the top layer of the Mido it's has this almost like sort of V running through the middle of the shoe so they just stay so firm and so planted in the shoe don't worry that doesn't sound comfortable but it really is and then the energy return from that microfoam Mido surprisingly good and you can pick up the pace a little bit more in this shoe then you might realize again it's not going to be the shoe you're going to be watching doing your speed sessions they are very bouncy for sure but you really don't notice this bulk and the weight quite as much as you might imagine but touching on a couple of dislikes with the shoe again slightly expensive for a puma shoe usually offer some really good value the price point of the shoe it's fine it's just not the usual Puma sort of value for money that they're offering and second it's just a little bit on the narrow side but if you got pretty standard to all narrow feet you're going to be absolutely fine but wif footed people should avoid you'll be all right in the next one though so summary of the Puma mag Max Nitro just very wellb built longlasting shoe it's going to absorb a lot of that impact on those slower Pace run those recovery runs or those long runs where you're going out all easy and just really great grip on the bottom of the shoe so you don't need to worry in these winter months also very stable good for heavier Runners here and we have got a section all for heavier Runners coming up later in the video but if you want something a little bit more super soft super squishy then have a look at the hoker skywood X this is just crazy I feel like an absolute giant walking around in the shoe and running around in the shoe you need to check Bridges when you're running through them but anyway this is the Hocus skywood X sent me back \u00a385 48 48 mm stack height at the back of the shoe they've got absolutely no ground feel in the shoe whatsoever you got a 5mm drop overall 378 G which I'm pretty sure is the heaviest shoe I've ever reviewed but it's the type of shoe where it doesn't matter too much no one's really concerned about the weight of the shoes in this category here midso wise we've got two layers of midso foam here one layer of hok's Premium super soft peber foam and then one layer of their super critical EVA foam for that durability so this soft foam with the peber for that squishiness that softness that bounce Eva for that durability so it lasts a long time and we have got a carbon plate running through this shoe that's not really in there for any speed it's in there to help with that stability with this amount of foam you'd just be like almost like you're drunk C there wallowing all over the place it just binds that all together to give a nice stable ride sizing wise it was true to size for me now what I really liked about the shoe let's have a chat about those likes it's fun it feels really quite smooth despite all that bulk in there I think that carbon plate is just helping with that smooth ride and it also feels pretty good quality as well great for longdistance walking or anyone being on their feet all day as well for me it's been the shoe I'm just reaching for my legs are really tight I'm just enjoying that squish that softness that this phone provides it's also very much on the comfortable side again as you'd want for this type of shoe good lock down no hot spots or any blisters like that really nice support at the back of the shoe dislikes with this shoe it's really hard but it's just obviously it's heavy and it's bulky it's the heaviest shoe I've ever worn it' be nice if they could strip out just a little bit of that weight but we've got some good rubber on the outside here again absolutely no problem running in the winter with this this out soole so yeah it's hard to really pick these apart and say these shoes they're too heavy because they always going to be really you just got to bear that in mind when you buy them they might feel a little bit on the heavy side let's a little summary chat about the skyex as with the Puma it's been really good for those recovery jogs the Mac stack that really soft foam looking after my legs when they're just feeling a little bit battered on those Monday mornings the pummer got a little bit more firmer feel to it that's the shoe I'd be reaching for for my long all easy runs the sky X again you can run long in it of course you can but it's really a lot softer a lot squishier a lot more compression you've got going on here but still it's really stable and just really good fun to run in right let's have a chat out some more dedicated long run shoes when we're doing that marathon training sessions we're going out for long steady efforts picking up the pace over the long runs starting out with one of the shoes that's definitely a contender for sure of the year so much lighter than those last ones the absolutely lovely as super blast version 2 this is my second pair luckily I've managed to secure four pairs this year but you've really got to know what you're doing when to log on to websites to buy them because it's the most in demand shoe this year without a doubt this shoe sent me back 200 stack at the back of 45 mm but an 8 mm drop overall weightwise so lightweight 288 G amazing for the amount of foam you're getting midsole we've got mostly asx's FF turbo foam which is classic most premium foam this is what they put in all of their high-end ra shoes there's no plate in this shoe and then sizing wise I did go half a size down I went half size down in version one and again in version two I did get two sizes when I first bought version two to see if they corrected the sizing but nope still went half a size down and it was absolutely fine right likes with the shoe it's just so so versatile I definitely could have put this one in the daily shoe category as well but long runs where this shoe really sings a shoe that really can do it all Races speed work easy runs long runs this shoe could feature in any of the categories in this video and it's also so comfortable as well this is the shoe that I reach for 90% of the time when I'm not testing other shoes second light with this shoe just so lightweight it's just amazing you can pick up the pace so well in this shoe if you're just out there and you think I fanty having a bit of fun today on easy runs you want to do some strides or just think I'm going to do a bit of an impromptu fart Le if you are doing some marathon training long runs with some 5K marathon pace blocks in it can do it all it's so versatile and also yes \u00a3200 for a non-plated shoe is expensive but it's been so durable for me as well it's holding out surprisingly well we can easily get 1,000 k out of this shoe no problem at all 600 miles if you're a little bit heavier probably a little bit less a little bit lighter potentially a little bit more as well but really durable the upper is holding up fantastically well this is what it looks like after this is probably around about 600 K I've got in the shoe plenty more I can do in this one dislikes wise just super hard to get hold of and yes it is a little bit more expensive but the versati makes up for that also just have a quick chat about the grip on the shoe I haven't actually got this on my notes here but after the Nova blasting with the grip problems the grip is not too bad on this aex have a different compound of rubber on the bottom of their shoe and it's okay you're going to be all right in the winter I wish they take it off here put it on the Nova blast Mak it such a better shoe it's not the best don't don't get me wrong you know it's not like the Puma grip or the Adidas Continental grip but it's okay you get by you don't need to worry about it it was a really good upgrade on version 2 versus what they had on version one but in summary a lightweight Max cushion shoe that can handle every different type of run brilliantly expensive but it's so much damn fun and it will last a long time as well definitely a contender for sh of the Year stay tuned for that right let's have a chat about another long shoe surprisingly even more expensive than the super blast but you're getting a plate in here and that's the shoe I had in over the summer the New Balance SC Trainer version 4 the trainer version that goes with the SC Elite a shoe I didn't really enjoy but I really enjoyed the trainer version so much more comfortable and just a good all round training shoe but anyway this set me back a quite staggering \u00a3230 it really is probably the most overpriced shoe here but I've really enjoyed it 40 mm stack height at the back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall 325 gam so what's that a good 40 odd G heavier than the super blast and you really do notice that difference midso wise we've got a mix of peber and Eva Foams here from New Balance just a good compromise and that softness that responsive and getting that durability in the shoe as well and then that carbon fiber plate in here which is a little bit on the stiff side but not too bad just adding a little bit of rigidity and stability sizing my TR size for me likes wise with this shoe just really comfortable straight out the box comfortable on those long runs just for those time on feet again when you want to pick up the pace during those long runs this is an ideal as New Balance say training shoe for those marathons those half marathons and it's a really great value shoe if you live in America for some reason this was so much cheaper in the states for any people from Europe if you're going to America then definitely look at picking up this shoe you're going to save a good amount of money if you're out there dislikes just the price really that's the only thing I can silly say if you're in the UK or Europe and I think in Australia it was absolutely crazy and it's quite hard to recommend so this recommendation really is just for our American friends only but if you got the cash and you want to spend it her might to stop you it's been a really good trainer for those long runs a slightly softer option than the super blast some people find the super blast a little bit on the firm side I actually quite enjoy it without amount of firmness but if you want a more of a softer ride again this is the type of shoe you should be looking at it's also a dam easier to get hold of than the super blast which is permanently out of stock right not everyone's got this crazy amount of money to spend on shoes so let's have a chat about some good budget options out there we've got a couple of really good options perfect for anybody starting out in the sport or anyone looking just to save a few pennies and just want to get some really good value and durability out of their running shoes as well starting out with the anadas S SL2 one of my most surprising shoes of the Year this sent me back just an amazing \u00a3110 that I think I even got this one special for \u00a397 when I actually bought it 36 mm stack height 9 mm drop overall weightwise so lightweight 287 G we've got a layer of Adidas's super premium light stripe Pro and then that sandwich between two layers of their more durable Light Strike 2.0 foam so you're getting that durability with that foam a little bit of Poppin with the Adidas light stripe Pro sandwich between them and unsurprisingly you're not getting plate in the shoe at this price point these do run a little bit small so I definitely recommend going half a size up here I got my normal size and they were just about okay but if I was getting them again I would definitely go half a size up my likes with the shoe it's lightweight it's Snappy and it's good fun it brings a smile to your pace when you run and that's what running should be all about the midso off is that really engaging ride and a really good turn of speed you're getting here of course it's not as fast as the shoes with those rods and those plates or full length of the premium Foams as well but it's still pretty good it holds its own weight surprisingly well it's punching above its weight I should say surprisingly well my second like with the shoe just of course the Great Value that this shoe is offering usually Foams at this price point are just so dull and hard and just unengaging and normally I can't wait to get them off my feet with this one I actually enjoyed it and I carried on using it cuz I couldn't believe just how good it was add as for some reason putting that layer of the most premium foam in the shoe has really just bought it to life it's made such a difference with this shoe it's so good to see ad putting that into their entry level getting people interested in the brand so many people are going to try this shoe because of the price point get them interested in the brand and then they will spend a little bit more potentially on the Boston and all the pros later down the line as well so it's a really good move I think from Adidas and thirdly really good durability with the shoe the outsole you're not getting the continential grip but the out soole was surprisingly good good amount of grip from Adas own rubber on the bottom of the shoe and then touching on a few little dislikes here it might definitely be a little bit too narrow for some people average to narrow size footed people you're going to be okay but if you got a wide foot I'm afraid this is going to be one to avoid also it's a little bit unstable in the Corning just because of how narrow it is but overall an excellent value shoe here for a lot of people when they starting out or a lot of people that are just a little bit more budget conscious out there you're going to be able to get the vast majority of your training done in this shoe which at this price point is really fantastic but there was another really good Contender out there early on this year and that was another shoe from Puma which was the velocity Nitro version three so this shoe sent me back \u00a310 36 mil stack at the back of the shoe 10 mm drop overall Weight Wise 336 G midso we have pummer standard foam here they Nitro foam and there's no plate in this shoe the sizing was true to size for me starting out with the likes with the shoe just really comfortable right from the off lots of padding in this shoe the laces hold the feet in position really quite nicely secondly surprisingly again really quite a versatile shoe the Nitro foam is fun and bouncy it's a good all round daily trainer and you can definitely run at lots of different Paces in this shoe third like really good grip the pumer grip as we said earlier with the magmax absolutely fantastic also really good durability regardless of the price this is a really good solid winter option and then fourth like you've got to talk about the price here as we did with the SL2 it feels a lot more expensive than it actually is really surprisingly good build quality with the shoe as well you can also pretty much always get the shoe a lot less than RRP so just absolutely mind-blowing value dislikes wise the standard width again unfortunately with both these budget shoes they are a little bit on the narrow side but overall with the Puma just a really good value shoe massively underrated massively underpriced as well in my opinion as I say you can usually pick these up for a lot cheaper than RRP very similar to the Adidas but a little bit more on the firmer side little bit more ground contact feel you're getting in this one so if you want a budget shoe option a little bit more squishy softy bouncy go for the Adidas a little bit harder a little bit more ground contact feel but a little bit more responsive then look at going with the Puma Right Moving On Let's have a chat about the most comfortable shoes of 2024 when speed isn't everything you just want something to cruise along with to look after your feet just wrap them up in some cotton wool in the most comfortable package that there is then these are the shoes that will do that for you so starting out with the aex GEL Nimbus 26 in this very vibrant canary yellow colorway that I had earlier this year the purpose of this shoe just those easy runs and those recovery runs a little bit on the expensive side this sent me back \u00a380 although there are a lot of deals on this shoe at the because version 27 is due out sort of early part of q1 of 2025 stack cut at the back 42 mm stack kite 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise little bit on the chunky side 373 G for me in my UK size 12 midso wise we've got asx's FF blast Eco plus and sizing wise it was true to size for me now starting out with the likes it comes in three different widths Hallelujah for those wider footed people standard wide and extra wide as well the upper super comfortable super soft very stretchy tongue as you can see in the video here Ultra breathable everything about this shoe has been engineered to be comfortable it's actually marketed as the most comfortable running Sho of all time it's quite hard to disagree with that but it gives a really nice lock down here no overheating no hot spots no blisters or anything like that to worry about dislikes wise again it's just not going to be the most versatile type of show there really ideally this is dialed in for those slower Paces those recovery run Paces easy Pace runs just when you want to go out and just have something that just going to look after your feet really nicely there's not much pop in this shoe so don't expect to be picking up the pace too much of course if you need to you need to run for a bus you can of course you can but it's not going to be the type of shoe that you're going to want to have on those for races or speed sessions or anything like that if Comfort is your main priority then look no further than this shoe this was my recovery shoe for the definitely for the first half of the year before I got the skywood X in and the Puma magmax and then I sort of went a little bit more down that route but one shoe from New Balance that's just being handed to me now was the New Balance Mo version 5 this is definitely I think this is going to be the softest squishiest shoe I have ever run in the foam here is absolutely ridiculous you'll be melting into the foam and into the road as you run along this one this shoe for me is just simply purpose wise all about recovery and looking after your legs you really can't pick up the pace too much in this one price-wise 140 so not too bad as they go St Co at the back we've got 44 mm of new balan's Fresh Foam x midsole 4 mm drop overall 374 G all these shoes are around about the same sort of weight in this category Fresh Foam X mids sole here extra soft extra plush this really does feel like you're running along with marshmallows under benath your feet this was true to size for me now likes with this shoe very comfortable but also very very soft a great option not just for runners but for anyone wanting all day Comfort out there people that might be walking Long Way working retail working in a medical envir anything where you're going to be on your feet all day this will really look after your feet fantastically well second like with a shoe just a really good width and good surface area on the bottom of your feet as well so do feel surprisingly stable in them you can have a little bit of confidence in the corners but you will be sort of tipping a little bit over to one side with just how soft this foam is you've also got a really nice rocker at the front of the shoe is a very nice smooth ride in terms of dislikes with this shoe the upper is quite thick potentially some breathability issues getting some air flow through the shoe there that's not really going to affect anyone at the moment but in the summer it might well do and really this is just an easy and Recovery run shoe only as with the Joe Nimbus the foam is really so soft so you're not really going to to pick out the pace too much in this shoe but this one is even softer Joe Nimbus very soft this one very very soft the softest shoe I've ever had the pleasure of running in but perfect for someone that loves that soft marshmallowy feeling in a shoe \u00a340 cheaper than the gel nimus so that's not bad too right let's have a chat about heavier Runners so we put a video earlier out this year all about the best shoes for heavy Runners and it did really well so thank you to everyone that checked that one out just perfect for Runners looking for a little bit more protection from the road some Foams that aren't going to bottom out and some good extra durability because there a bit more Force going through the shoes here so they would last a long time we've actually had some really good options come to the market and these are our top picks the first one being Nike zoomfly version six that's right at the bottom our P but this shoe we had here we'll put the time stamp for when this appears early on so definitely check that one out as well as the Puma mag Max two really good options there for heavy Runners again we'll put the time stamps up on the screen now but another really good option out there for heavy Runners is the Brooks Glycerin Max which we had in through well actually quite recently in the Autumn and I really enjoyed running in the shoe perfect for those easy runs those recovery runs and also those long runs as well this shoe sent me back \u00a380 45 mil stack at the back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise again all kind of roughly the same 375 G we've got Brooks's DNA tuned cushioning two different types of nitrogen density within this foam got some larger cells at the back of the shoe perfect for those soft little Airy sort of Landings and some smaller cells at the front of the shoe just for a little bit more of a poppy toe off through that foot strike and sizing wise this was good this was true to size for me so what did I really like about the shoe the first one being it's very smooth and stable through the footstrike the mids soole is a little bit firmer than you might expect quite super blast type feeling with this shoe but this is so much heavier Unfortunately The Rocker at the front of the shoe is really nice and smooth just helps with that transition through the foot strike and just helps disguise the weight of the shoe really quite well second light with the shoe comfort-wise again really good here so much cushioning around the heel really giving a really nice lockdown third like with the shoe it's just very well put together a really good quality shoe something you always do expect from Brooks and my fourth like with the shoe it's really good in larger sizes some heavier Runners bigger people bigger framed people this goes all the way up to size 14 and have a really good generous width at the front of the shoe dislikes with this shoe it's really ideally only good for that easy Pac running heavier Runners if you want a good race shoe look at this one or the alphafly as well but the zoomfly 6 and the alphafly be perfect for some heavier Runners that want that allout speed Tu but those daily miles this is where you're going to be getting a lot of your good training in so in summary with the Brooks that 45 mil stack kite really good op option for those heavy Runners you're not going to be bottoming out this foam here and it's definitely going to last a long time as well some really good durability really liking the rubber that Brooks have put on the bottom of their shoe again some good winter grip on there as well and the fact that it comes up in some larger sizes as well and that decent width means it's a really nice option right let's have a chat all about best shoes for beginners if you're new to running and looking for your first pair of running shoes you want something that's going to be really nice and versatile something you can run on the roads run on the treadmill maybe a little bit of light trail out there as well lots of different paces and something that's course going to be really nice and comfortable and off some good longlasting value as well you're probably not at this stage so dedicated and invested in the sport to have a big shoe rotation or anything like that so I think the best options here would be looking at something like the novablast version 5 it just ticks so many boxes for that doit all shoe at a pretty good price point as well for people that don't want to break the bank again we'll put the time stamp for this one so you can go and look at the full review there another great option at that even cheaper price point the Adidas SL2 again time stamp is up on the screen now go and check that one out there again both these shoes really good price points really good versatility they're offering you can get so many of your runs done in them and potentially have a good race in them as well it's really going to get you invest in the sport with some good quality kit that's going to last a long time we do have a dedicated full video which we made before these shoes actually came out so you want even more options on some good beginner shoe options then we'll link to that down below and up here as well right here we go the best of the best the best overall section of the video before we get stuck into that let me know down in the comments what has been your best shoe of the year what shoe have you bought and it's really bought a smile to your face share and help out the running community and let everybody scroll through the comments and see some great options out there as well I think the second best shoe the runnerup shoe of the Year for me has been the Nike Zoom Flight version replaced a quite frankly terrible version 5 in my opinion this one I got it in and I just wasn't that excited to go out for running it and as soon as I put it on as soon as I started in those early CES I was like there's something very very special going on with this shoe I quickly got over the slightly odd quirky looks with it and I say I've done so many training sessions a lot of the time I've just put this shoe on instead of my Alpha F instead of my vapor fly don't want to put 20 miles on that and I've just been amazed at how fast this is amazing how fun it is we've had some really good times together so that's been my runner up shoe of the year but yeah maybe a little bit predictable and maybe a little bit more a little bit boring I don't know but this oh Sarah just smashed the microphone hopefully you can still hear us now but yeah I really can't say anything other than the super Blast 2 for my shoe of the year unfortunately with the availability issues it is still hard to get a hold of but it's so light it's so much fun and it is that shoe that if I could just run in one shoe for the rest of my life then this is what it would be it travels with me wherever I go if I can only take one shoe on a plane on a trip or on a train this is the shoe I'll be taking it's comfortable to wear casually and just whatever you do in it it just delivers an amazing fun engaging responsive ride and it just makes me feel quite happy so that's my shoe of the Year let me know your shoes of the Year down in the comments below hope you've enjoyed the video got so much shoe content coming up in 2025 really excited planning those videos out and finally thank you for myself and Sarah everyone that supports our videos so I hope you've enjoyed it that's it guys keep on working hard keep done I'll see you in the next one",

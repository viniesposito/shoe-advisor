  "text": "hey Tommy for run testers and another versus with the New Balance morv 5 this time I'm comparing it with the Brooks ghost Max 2 let's have a [Music] look the New Balance more V5 cost \u00a3140 or $154.99 it weighs 306 G or 10.8 o for men in a size 8 and the drop is 4 mm the Brooks ghost Max 2 costs \u00a340 or $150 it weighs 308 G or 10.9 o for men in a size 8 and the drop is 6 [Music] mm the fifth version new balance's Max cushion shoe receives a number of updates aiming to improve on the popular V4 the biggest of those is a new midso composition using the same soft foam found in the 1080 B13 and a slightly increased stack height to counter the updates there's a noticeably wide base to ensure plenty of stability in the shoe the more 5 also sees modifications to the engineered mesh upper design to improve both the breathability of the shoe and the padding around the ankle collar and tongue and the outsole sees a complete overhaul with less rubber coverage which does leave more exposed sections of the midsole the more V5 also comes in three different width sizes the ghost Max 2 is a Max cushion shoe focusing firmly on cushioning and comfort for daily training miles like the ghost Max it uses a wide base to provide a stable ride and combines that with a Glide roll rocker design to promote a smth smooth Heel To Toe transition for cruising through miles the biggest update in the ghost Max 2 is the new nitrogen infused DNA Loft V3 midsole working alongside the rocker to improve the softness and comfort of the ride as well as decrease pressure in the heel and forefoot the upper is made from a flexible breathable mesh built for comfort and breathability and there's a generous layer of outso rub for grip and to improve durability the shoe also features raised sidewalls for additional support he so the fit for me in both these shoes I'm size8 in the UK these are both shoes designed for Comfort they're both shoes that have plenty of space in the forefoot very comfortable uppers uh plenty of padding more padding uh for me in the Brooks ghost Max 2 than the mor 5 but both have a good level of padding and they're very very comfortable to wear I've had no issues in either of these shoes uh in a lot of uh running that I've done in them um and I would definitely stay to my size in both of these [Music] shoes okay okay so let's start with the New Balance more V5 so the New Balance Mo V5 is a shoe that I've been looking forward to for quite a long time I've been a massive fan of the V3 and the V4 um and the morvi 5 has a few changes to it which I was a little bit worried about when I heard about the new shoe um but I am a big fan of this I've done a lot of running in it you can see it's quite muddy because I've been doing a lot of my marathon training longer sessions and easy runs and stuff in this shoe um the biggest change of this shoe is that it uses the same M foam um design that is in the 108 v13 now in the 108 v13 that midsole is very very soft and some people don't like that shoe because it is too soft um it the problem with making it soft means that it is less stable uh but also is not as good for longer runs because you end up sapping a lot of energy and it doesn't really give it you back it's not like a bouncy midell fo it's just a soft um marshmallowy midell foam that sort of sinks you into the ground and just deadens the impact of the run it's very nice for easy runs and Recovery runs where you're not going too far but if you were to do like a half marathon in it you'd really feel the the lack of um any sort of responsiveness or bounce or energy return in that shoe um so I was a bit worried about the midell foam in the mo V5 because I thought if they're using this the same mid cell foam or a similar midell foam design um I'm going to lose what I liked about the more V4 um thankfully even though it does have this new Midol foam it doesn't deliver like the 10 v13 and very mind I love the T 10 v13 um I just don't think it's very versatile and I can see why some people don't like it um the midso in the morvi 5 it doesn't feel like that midso f it is a bit it's denser it definitely feels like you get a little bit more back from it um I have done uh about 90k in this shoe so far and uh I've done a three-hour running it as part of my marathon training and it just felt great it didn't feel sluggish it didn't feel like it was making me work harder to run in that shoe I definitely wanted another 3-hour run in uh the 10 v13 this felt great I just didn't really think about it on the feet it just very comfortable rolls you forward nicely it's not got the most pronounced rocker in it but it has got a very comfortable uh sort of transitional um design to it so uh it's a shoe that if you put it on and go for a run you're going to enjoy that that run that's that's why I like the more V5 I'll go out for um a run and I might not want to go for a run but I'll take this shoe out because I know that it will mean that I'm at least it's comfortable and I'm not going to be out running in a shoe that is I'm not enjoying so it's very much a comfortable enjoyable uh shooter to run in but it also gives you a little bit more a little bit of energy return in it really like the mid it confesses really nicely and comfortably but still gives you a nice um um transition and and smooth uh run when you're out in it so really big fan of the mor V5 and um the update to that midsole I think is a really good one uh the Brooks ghost Max 2 now I wasn't a fan of the ghost uh Max one uh I just thought it was really just felt like a really solid shoe I didn't feel like I was really getting anything back from it the Mido was uh a lot firmer than what You' find things like the mo V 5 um and as a result I just didn't feel like it was really helping me uh run comfortably um for easy runs it just just felt a little bit too clunky for me uh and for longer runs just just didn't really feel like it was giving me anything back so I wasn't a fan of the Brooks ghost Max one the Brooks ghost Max 2 has been updated a bit so it feels different out on the Run uh and I'm I'm I'm I like the Ghost Mac to a lot more than the original version so I I do enjoy running in this shoe now um it the Midol foam is a little bit more forgiving um it's it's definitely still a lot firmer than what you're going to get in the mo V5 it's not the firmest Mido out there but it's definitely in comparison to the more V5 it's it's more on that solid stable side of midell Foams uh which is good for a lot of people I think it's a shoe that's probably very accessible to new Runners Runners that are very just want to go out and take off the miles and want something that's nice and solid and gives him a little bit of stability in the shoe um and uh that's a good thing to have in a shoe uh so um I've I've done as many kilometers in the Brooks ghostb 2 just because I don't enjoy it as much as the the mor V5 um but the runs that I've done in it I think it's really solid shoe for easy runs recovery runs and longer sessions as well I think a lot of people want a little bit more um responsiveness in from that midsole they want a little bit more firmness in the mid soole um when they're running longer distance this is a good shoe for it um and uh I think I can't really um give it any sort of bad bad comments about this shoe I think it's very good for everything that it does I think it really just comes down to the Mido that you're looking for in the in those shoes now the outsole on both of these shoes very very good on the Brooks ghost Max 2 there's a lovely layer of rubber on here it's very tacky uh rubber so it feel feels very sticky on the ground um and I've not had any issues with grip out on the Brooks ghost Max 2 at all uh there's not really any a lot of exposed mid cell foam either but even so that mid cell foam's quite a sturdy mid cell foam so I wouldn't be worried about it anyway the New Balance Mori 5 doesn't have as much rubber on the outsole it's fine these bits are fairly thick but there is a lot of exposed rubber on there as a said I've done about 90k in the shoe so far there are no signs of the uh exposed sections in the Mido having any issues and the rubber still holding up fairly well it's rubbing off a bit around there cuz that's that's the main bit that I run on U so it's it's coming away a little bit there but it's still looking pretty good after 90k and I've had no issues with that that more delicate mid cell foam so um good outsoles on both of them but definitely far superior on the Brooks um ghost Max [Music] 2 okay so my verdict on these two shoes you can probably guess because I think I probably said it in the um in the Run section but more V5 is the shoe that I'm going for just because I like a softer shoe uh even if uh I was going for the more V4 which was not as soft as the mo V5 um I'd still found it to be a more comfortable shoe and more enjoyable to just shoe to just sort of tick off the miles in a nice smooth um motion um but the more V5 does that just a little bit softer so for me CU I like soft shoes it's going to be the more V5 all the way I just very just found the shoe so enjoyable to run in um for the type of runs that I've been doing in it it's not the most versatile shoe in the world you're not going to buy either of these shoes if you're looking for a really versatile shoe um but it's definitely for me the more comfortable shoe especially if you like a little bit more softness in your uh midsole in your shoes um the Brooks ghost Max 2 even though I haven't picked it as my shoe out of these two um I still think for some people it is better because uh it does have this more solid sturdy Midol foam little bit more responsive because it hasn't got the um the softer Mido in it uh and I think it's more accessible as well I think some people if you're a new Runner and maybe you're you might get the more V5 and not quite enjoy the the level of softness in there uh it's not it's not an unstable shoe but i' definitely say the Brooks ghost Max 2 is more stable so it's a more accessible shoe for people a bit safer shoe if you need stability um and definitely just feels a little bit more solid on the feet um as opposed to the more V5 um so it really comes down to that but for me and it's me doing the versus I'm going to go through more V 5 because of that Comfort level and I really like that new midell foam in there that's it for me on this versus thanks a lot for watching don't forget

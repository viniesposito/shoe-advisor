  "text": "running a marathon is an amazing achievement for any human being and what's even better than that running a marathon faster than you've ever done before and setting a brand new PB or PR depending on where you are in the world and by the end of today's video you're going to be armed with loads of tips and tricks to get you that time that you want we're going to go through what time you should be aiming for the sessions that help me run a 225 Marathon how to Pace the race itself and those all important fueling options as well with my own recommendations for what to do right let's get stuck into all of the training how long should you give yourself to train for a marathon well would recommend ideally around 15 weeks that's how long all of our training plans are which allow for a proper buildup some recovery weeks those all important high mileage training weeks and then the full taper down before race day our beginner plans are just a little bit longer at 18 weeks to just give new marathoners a little bit of extra time to get ready you can check these out on my website vino.com we'll link them down below all our beginner plans are completely free to download during this time you're also going to want to pick a Target race to aim for typically marathons are either in the spring or the Autumn is that's when the weather tends to be best for Marathon running comment down below with your favorite races where you may already have your PB or PR to give your fellow Runners some inspiration of the best races some of my favorites some fast races Valencia Frankfurt Berlin Rotterdam London and Chicago I think there some really good options out there so what's a realistic time to aim for for your Marathon well there's loads of different marathon time calculators on the internet and you can input a recent race time from a different Race distance from say a half marathon or a 10K and that will give you a predicted marathon time based on that now these aren't the most accurate way of doing things and they usually tend to predict time slightly faster than what people are capable of but it gives you a good of inspiration a little bit of extra umph to get out there and really hit the training hard so if you're not sure we'll link to the Jack Daniels calculator down below as we feel that's the best one out there but setting a go time is going to look different for everybody a lot of people simply just take their current time and then just chip away at multiples of five so if you're a 335 Marathon the next logical step is sub 330 this is something you can adapt as your training progresses you may want to find a goal that's a little bit faster a little bit slower just with how well the training is going how far during a training week should you be running for various goal times someone wants to run a sub 5H hour marathon they're looking around about 3 to four runs a week up to around 30 m in that Peak Week 48 km for a sub four Marathon really talking again three to four runs a week now up to around 40 miles in that biggest week in that peak week around about 64k for that week for a sub three-hour Marathon 5 to six runs a week now up to around 64 mil in in that peak week just over 100 km right let's have a chat all about those all important long runs arguably the most important run of the week these are runs that going to help build and improve your cardiovascular system and also get the body really strong to be able to run that 26.2 miles the long runs will tend to build up progressively throughout the plan and then tap out for the longest run tends to be around about 3 weeks before race day around about 20 to 23 miles or 32 to 37k for that longest run now there are a few different types of long runs that we would recommend getting into your training again these all feature in our marathon training plans the first one being a fast finish long run this might be a 20m total run with the first 14 miles nice and easy relaxed conversational pace and then the next 5 miles of that run at your marathon gold paast then the final mile just a nice easy cool down this type of run is a really good Mar Marathon simulator it gets their legs used to pushing more towards the end of your long run gets our legs nice and tired which is how they're going to feel towards the end of the marathon so it's a really good race preparation type of run the second type of long run I really like is marathon pace blocks this is something I like to do all the time as I build up for my races my absolute classic is a 30k long run with three 5K blocks at my goal Pace with a 5k block between them at a nice relaxed conversational pace practicing marathon pace during your long runs will really help you get comfortable with what it feels like to run at this pace and you'll be able to pace yourself so much better on the day if you spend a lot of time at your goal Pace during your training splitting your runup into these different pace blocks I find really helps mentally with these long runs as well and then my third type of long run I like to do in my training is simply going out for a long run and doing these are just all at your easy Pace just banking the distance getting a good time on feet long run I tend to do these during my recovery weeks when I'm just trying to reduce that intensity and reduce that overall load as well I'd also recommend if you can doing some of your long runs at the same time of day as your go race starts it just gets the body used to working at this time and then you can practice your pre-race routine with your breakfast as well for me when I'm doing my long runs and also my races as well my pre-ra breakfast is pretty much always the same of two bagels with some peanut butter and jam or jelly if you're in America again getting these down around about 2 hours to 90 minutes before go time practice this in training there's absolutely no surprises on race day it's also a really good time to think about what you want to wear on your race day as well and wear this during your long runs and making sure everything fits together really well what's going to be the most comfortable type of shoe top clothing hat and all of that sort of stuff for three four five six plus hours potentially out there are those lightweight carbon Racing shoes going to be the best option people always ask me how many runs should they do in their race shoes and I'd always say do as many as you feel you need to do to feel confident in the shoe choice that you're going to be making on the race day putting a brand new pair of shoes out the box on race day is very very risky maybe slightly less risky if youve run in exactly that model before it's not something I would ever do so please don't do that but at least just go out there spend a little bit of time in those race shoes for a lot of people they're going do a couple of their long runs in their shoes and it'll warm up before the race so you're really talking maybe like 60 70k and they'll be absolutely still fresh as a daisy at that sort of level and you absolutely have confidence that they're going to get you through the race really well moving on to have a chat all about speed sessions now in order to run a faster Marathon we need to get the body used to running faster than your goal pace and this is where our speed workouts and our interval sessions come in these help build our fitness to increase that aerobic capacity your V2 Max basically and by improving this it improves our body's ability to deliver oxygen to the muscles we'd recommend setting aside at least one run a week dedicated to your speed sessions more experienced Runners will probably want to get two speed sessions in per week we'll touch on that a little bit later on but here's some absolutely classic examples that you can try the first one being is a progression run around about 10 km of distance the first 3K nice and easy second 3K at your marathon pace the next 2K at your Tempo pace and then 2K cooling down my second favorite is something like a 6X 3 minute session running these 3 minute blocks around about your 5 to 10K pace and just taking a 2minute very chill jog or walk between each of those reps we're also going to want to build in some longer reps in here as well another classic that I like to do 3x 8 minutes at Tempo Pace with a 2minute recovery between those blocks there again with the recovery is just walking or a very very easy jog just to get your heart rate nice and recovered now lot of people ask me should we be doing these on a running track you can if you want to absolutely fine they're great places to train I personally don't I just try save my money and go out and run on the roads in that sort of environment which is just better replicating what the race is more likely to be like but wherever you want to do them just somewhere safe and traffic free we can uh put a drink down and get some fluids on board and some nutrition then that's going to be absolutely fine now as I touched on at the start of the section more experienced Runners might want to build in a second speed session during the week for example one session that focuses on short reps like that 6x3 minute sessions on a Tuesday and then a second session with a more sustained effort something like a 20 minute Tempo they're going to have the strength in their legs and the mileage in their legs to be able to add this extra amount of intensity into the routine which then combined with those long run sessions during those Peak weeks as well will really help build that Fitness and push it up even more right moving on to another absolutely classic to get in there during the week that a lot of people don't know about or they neglect but I say it's really important in there and that is running strides strides quite simply are burst of around about 20 seconds of fast running at around about 90% effort so not all out running for a bus just below that these really helped to improve our running form and help to build some strength as well if you're new to strides I'd recommend doing something like three to four reps of this more experienced Runners anything up to around six or seven reps of this with just a very easy jog or walk in between these strides let's have a chat about easy runs now the rest of our week is going to be made up of running at a nice relaxed easy run Pace the speed sessions the long runs will put a lot of stress on the body and so that's why we're now running at a nice low intensity if every day was a speed session we would get injured pretty quickly now I want to recommend for your easy run Paces for a sub five hour sort of goal Target we're talking around about 1140 to 1245 a mile sub four runners going to be doing that easy runs around about 10 minutes a mile to 11 minutes a mile sub three-hour Runners around about 750 to 840 minutes a mile but let's have a quick chat about strength work which is a crucial part of any training plan especially important for people during the marathon and even more important for some older Runners we' recommending one day a week to this and of course more is great as well but as a minimum add something like this to a current day of easy run training and keep your rest days as rest days that's really really important to let your body recover and adapt during those rest days now we have a strength training routine which is part of our training plans which you can add on but it's just a very Basics we'd recommend getting in a routine squats Bridges lunges and planks get that into your routine and it's going to help you running so so much now race J is here we want to think about what we're going to be doing during the race how are we going to Pace it so many Runners make this mistake of going out too fast and blowing up so having a pacing plan is really important for me there's two different ways of pacing a marathon either start slightly slower than your goal pace and then speed up as the Run goes on this requires a lot of patience and control which a lot of Runners really do struggle with alternatively and what I personally aim to do is simply set off at my go pace and hold that all the way through and then final few C just try and pick up the pace a little bit more to come in just ahead of my goal time now this of course will depend on the course you're doing what the route's like if it's hilly you might to save some energy for certain Hillier parts of the course going out hard and banking that time really works there'll be a few examples of people that have managed to set new PBS and PRS by doing that but I'd always say you probably could have gone faster if you Pace it a little bit better and start nice and slowly what I recommend is using the lap Pace on your watch which if you have your laps turned on will then reset every kilometer or every Mile and just stick to that pace throughout the race now if you got some some bad GPS issues on the course such as Canary War through London or at the start of the Chicago marathon you'd have to worry about this too much because as I say it resets all the time and just keep clocking with your watch looking at that lap Pace as you go on also if there are any Paces during the event then you can look out and try and run with them running some of the pacing groups most of these Pace groups are really really good I think in the recent New York Marathon for example 95% of the Pacers achieve their goal time and help all the thousands of Runners out there achieve their goal times as well Right Moving On Let's have a chat about fueling how are we going to fuel the race this is what sets the marathon apart from so many other races with 5Ks 10ks and even up to Half Marathon distance really you can get away with not really fueling much or at all during these races but with the marathon you cannot do that so it's really important to fuel regularly throughout the race a mistake a lot of Runners make when running the marathon is they wait till they get tired before they start taking on some fuel and by that point it's far too late and you can't recover from it so what I recommend is a Rough Guide is 30 G of carbs round about every 35 to 45 minutes and do this from the start now of course as with all things running it's going to vary a little bit from person to person so we always stress to practice this during your long runs to find out the quantities and the timings that work well for you and there's also so many different products so many different gels natural gels so many different types of things you can try during your training all with different amounts of carbohydrates in them as well different textures different flavors so it's really important to find out what works for you we do have a huge gel taste test comparison video to give you some ideas we'll link to that down below as well so maybe have a check out of that if you're looking for some new ideas of some gels that you want to try out now for hydration you'll likely have drinks available every few miles on the course but look this up beforehand all of the big majors and the big races will have drink stations at a bare minimum every couple of Miles most of them is every single mile out there I'd always say drink little and often if you're thirsty have a drink it's very hard to have an exact game plan of trying to get a certain amount of liquid down for me I just run through a water station if I'm feeling thirsty I try and get something down and then carry on now if you are feeling a bit dehydrated and you need to stop and walk to get some water down that's absolutely fine make sure you get that water down sometimes it is really hard running through these things and trying to get a cup and get it down you but as I say if you need just stop for a few seconds just to get it down make sure there's no one running up down behind you you're going to block someone all of a sudden just get that down and then carry on running now you may want to use a hydration vest to keep some liquids on you and your gels as well or any other valuables during your long runs and also potentially during your race as well a lot of people like to do this just so they know they've got absolutely everything on them and they're going to be okay they don't have to rely on anybody else out there maybe they've got some special drinks or things like that again I would say not every race allows you to have a hydration breast but the vast majority do so just make sure you double check for me when I'm doing my long runs I usually just simply like to just leave a bottle under a bush come in grab that down the drink get a gel on board as well and then carry on just takes about 30 seconds out of my long run just to make sure I'm getting that fuel on board right a couple more things to chat about the next one being recovery during our training sleep is so important this is when our body is going to be making those adaptations to become that faster runner we want it be most likely you're going to be feeling a little bit tired anyway so just keep checking with yourself see how you feel try and get as much sleep as you possibly can for a lot of people after their runs they're going to want to get a nice recovery Shake on board something with a good mix of carbohydrates and proteins something like a 3:1 mix is pretty standard yeah getting something like that down within that 30 minutes after you run is really good thing as well I'm making sure you're doing a really good solid warm up with some dynamic stretches easing into all of our runs before we head out and then some static stretches after our run just to look after ourselves the thing I want to have a chat about is just talking to those around you about what you're doing communicate with your friends and family adding this whole new thing into what is probably already quite a busy schedule can be quite a stressful thing chat to people let them know how you're feeling if you've got any injuries and pains get some advice is no problem at all just to cross train for a few days just while they die down I absolutely guarantee that everybody training for a marathon will have some sort of minor injury thing to deal with during their training block yes it's quite stressful but get some helpful advice look up some advice on YouTube ideally get to see someone a physio sports massage therapist in person if you can running a marathon is an incredibly amazing thing to do also a very hard thing to do so give yourself a pad on the back for taking time to do some research to improve yourself because no doubt you're going to have an amazing time out there as I say running a marathon is hard but it feels so good when you cross the finish line knowing that you've had a really good run out there and if you need a little bit more guidance on your training then check out the marathon plans Down Below on benp parks.com the next video coming up is my full 24 hours before race day complete guide and my Ultimate Guide to long runs as well Che your pick from one of those videos that's it guys keep on working hard keep done let me know how you get on in your race and we'll see you in the next one",

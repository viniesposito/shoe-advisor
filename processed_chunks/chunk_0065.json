  "text": "just one more time for those who don't remember the Val [Music] Jan [Music] [Music] shall we go run a mountain I think we shall little fuel before the adventure uhhuh although we are out of maple syrup sad moment what are you going to do little more vertical little more all right it sounds like the weather might be changing next week so we got to seize the day huh make hay when the sun shines as we used to St in Boulder make hey when the sun shines all right onward and upward have a great day butter your bread I know I already I buttered my waffles so we should be fueled up ready to rock and roll uh ascending ascending I love ascending but we're ascending to be Colorado let's [Music] go it's baly here a nice day and no crowds I see 1 2 3 4 5 six se you never see seven cars at the parking lot [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] he [Music] love was holding all the and always me in the dark I never thought I could shake this heart until I saw your light and it's got me feeling like life is good life is good [Music] yeah life is good life is good yeah yeah in my darkest time you got me feeling like I've been walking on [Music] air left all my worries in you got me you're my mind I my you got me feeling light [Music] a [Music] puny Bey puny Beauty [Music] the no excuse mindset it's a beautiful thing especially on a HomeTown Mountain uh we're in BB and that was Mount Yale via Denny Creek unbelievable so 107 I ran 15 months ago July 2023 and I didn't even have a c a camera I took the summer off no filming so today 10450 and tip of the cap to cam cam a amazing Runner and I'll talk more about cam in a second but the no excuse mindset my legs the first half mile didn't feel awesome I'll be frank and by the way we're in we're on the uh we are on the Main Street here of buav Vista beautiful BV uh so the legs didn't feel great the first half mile and tomorrow I'm doing another mountain in about 18 hours and I almost threw the towel in today because I was like uh this time is so tough from cam I don't know if I'm going to get it today on but here's my strategy here's and this is a question of the day here in a second as well but this is what I do I I I I build a wall in my mind in my brain like literally IM literally imagine building a brick concrete difficult rebar enforced wall in my mind where I had the thought oh man maybe I need to throw the towel in on today's fkt attempt on Mount Yale instead I built the wall and said okay no more that that excuse in my mind is not going to cross this wall ever again on this run now I'm human so it'll probably pop up again at some point maybe tomorrow but instead from the half mile Point onward and here's the footage on your screen from that point onward I was golden and I started rocking and rolling because I built this wall in my mind saying enough is enough we're going for it today we drove up here from Denver let's let her let's let it rip and that's what we got done and so a tip of the cap to cam so that's anyway that's the no excuse my and sadly I know Runners not a lot of Runners but a couple I know Runners whether in high school college or even today that just make excuses all the time and I'm like no you got to stop that you're you're you're cutting yourself short when you make too many when you make any excuses but when you make excuses all the time so cam shout out to cam that's who I snagged it from today I'm sure cam will go back and get the fkt again maybe next year but uh Cam and I we have been going back and forth back and forth in races and fktsgi talented they're fast and they're they sometimes I beat that like cam beat me at the Kendall Mountain run this past summer I beat him at Pike's Peak it's like we just go back and forth back and forth but at the end of the day it's that's important you know being fast that's what we do here on YouTube and as Runners we want to PR we want to get course records we want to get ftts at the end of the day we want to push ourselves but more importantly at every single Finish Line that I've raced against k him positive mindset no excuses I've never heard an excuse at it so I just want to give him a shout out and some other Runners as well that I just you know when you have a competitor and you're like you're competing back and forth back and forth I know you guys have them out there and that's the question of the day uh what is your mental mindset when you are hitting adversity in your ftts in your races and for me it's just a nice refreshing reminder from cam to keep going and don't make excuses so onward and upward let's go let's let it rip uh time to recover from that effort see if we can come back tomorrow and get another get another Mountain under our belt going to go uh ice the legs in the river and oh it is so cold used to jump In this River uh like it was nothing when I was a teenager those days are long gone uh and then squeeze the legs with a compression sleeves get some good uh get some good food in the body all right a little snack maybe a little maybe a little uh little uh fkt treat if you know what I mean so butter to bread we'll toss it to the uh fkt playlist right there fkt playlist right there and uh I look forward to reading your strategies your mental strategies down below CU if you struggle go down to the comments if you just struggle a little bit with it and again for me I literally got to build that brick wall butter butter butter let's go let's go seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

  "text": "as a new Runner coming into the sport buying your first pair of shoes can be extremely overwhelming is it a case of the more expensive the shoe the better it's going to be what does all that running shoot jargon actually mean of course it's a lot to take everything in but today we're going to make it super easy to help you narrow down your search we've got six different options and two bonus pairs at the end so stay tuned for that to really give you a good head start on your running Journey as with all the videos here on the channel I've bought these shoes 100% with my money tested them out myself there's nothing sponsored nothing gifted nothing like that at all or we ask if you get benefit out of our videos to hit that like button leave us a comment down below share the video and of course check out my website benp parks.com where we make and sell the best running hats and Technical gear in the world so what are we looking for in our first pair of running shoes well we want something that's going to be nice and versatile something you can run on the roads or on the treadmill something that's going to be of course very very comfortable out the box long lasting and we want some good value for money here as well so you might have heard this term a neutral running or a stability running shoe and we need to work out what type of shoe is going to best suit us it's a rough guide about 80 85% of people are neutral Runners and about 20 15% need a stability shoe with their running the best thing you can do with this is go to your local running shop where they can put you on a treadmill analyze your gate and see how you're moving and tell you if you're going to need a stability sh but as a Rough Guide if you do have particularly flat arches then you may benefit from a stability shoe but if you have normal or high archers then opt for a regular normal running shoe we'll link some resources down below if you want to do some testing of this at home before you go out and get yourself a pair so if you have bought your pair of shoes online and they've come how do we know if they fit correctly it's a rough guide a rough rule of thumb should we say you should have about a thumb's width at the end of the shoe between the top of your big toe and the end of the shoe you don't want to have your toes right up against the shoe when we run our feet would expand a little bit again if you can get into your local running store test out a few pairs they're going to make sure they fit properly some online retailers do allow you to use use the shoe test it and send it back if it's not quite right so always check out the terms and conditions with where you're buying your shoes from there's a couple of terms I'll be chatting about today drop and also stack height starting out with stack height well that is basically from where your heel would sit at the bottom of the shoe the distance between that and the ground so that is going to be around about this figure here the higher the number with the stack height the more foam the more man of cushioning the other thing we're going to have a chat about is drop and that is basically that figure there that stack height the difference between that and then the stack height at the front of the shoe so most running shoes have around about sort of four up to around about 12 mm of drop it just tilts the foot forward a little bit barefoot running shoes or if you are running without any shoes on at all that would be 0o mm drop that is going to be flat on the ground but it just takes a little bit of pressure off the carves it tilts the body for a little bit helps us to get the feet nicely moving under the body as well right let's start out with my top recommendations for beginner Runners taking into account everything we've said before we're going to go through these shoes starting at a a low price point and finishing at a higher price point and at the end I'm going to go through my favorite one of these and it's not the most expensive and Chad about a really good stability and Trail shoe option for beginners so starting out with my first recommendation the cheapest one here the Reebok flight ride version five round about \u00a385 no one's going to pay that I think I paid \u00a355 for my first pair of these the stack height 27 mil 8 mm drop overall true to size for me there's no different widths available now what I really like about this shoe with the recent updates has become a much more comfortable and stable shoe really good versatility at all sorts of different distances very highly durable outsole to the shoe as well so really last and just fantastic value for that price point one of the cheapest shoes out there but also a really really good option also very nice lightweight feel for the shoe as well doesn't feel like you're carrying around loads of extra unnecessary weight now what I didn't like about the shoe it just takes a little bit of breaking in that foam takes about 20 mi to soften up get nice and squidgy but after 20 mi it really starts to come to life so yeah these shoes are a little bit more on the firm side that stack height little bit lower than a lot of other shoes but you like a little bit more ground contact feel then this can be a really good option to go for moving on to around about 110 L for the pummer velocity Nitro version three this new version has come out recently I think I paid around about 85 for these off start Fitness drop 10 mm in the shoe 36 mm stack height at the back of the shoe and yes this was true to size for me and you can get this in a wide version if you get it off the pummer website what I really liked about the shoe again super comfortable the Nitro foam that Puma using in the shoe is really fun and bouncy and it's just really versatile at all sorts of different distances the great fantastic grip you get on the bottom of the shoe this pumer grip this rubber out soole fantastic in the wet one of the really best wet weather running shoes that you can buy for any different price point at the moment and the durability of this shoe will last so long in terms of dislikes for this shoe is a little bit on the narrow side so if you have a slightly wider feet then definitely check out that wider version right moving up to a slightly higher price point now the main difference between the shoes we've been talking about and these ones is these are going to be a little bit more stable little bit more cushioning and they're going to be slightly more durable as well some slightly better materials that they're made with although really the Puma shoe we've just talked about really does perform as well as these next two shoes starting out with the hoker Clifton 9 one of the absolute Classics of the Running World now in its ninth version my shoe sent me back \u00a3130 5 mm drop with the shoe stack height of a 32 and it was true to size for me I can make this in a wide variety of colorways they also make it in the standard width and the wide width as well now what I really liked about the shoe is it was really nice and lightweight but still offering a really good amount of cushioning Under Foot super comfortable very breathable and the foot feels really secure no blisters no hot spots what I really didn't like about the shoe is it's now just slightly dated the foam of the shoe is just slightly dated it really needs ping up with a new update it doesn't feel too squishy but maybe some people will like a slightly firmer ride and this is is hooker's bestselling overall Ru and also the hok of Clifton is probably the most like fashiony shoe here Tik tokers instagrammers absolutely adore the Clifton 9 for casual as well now if you like the style of the hooker shoe you may want to check out the Max 6 which just has a slightly better quality foam in it to run in but it's just not quite as durable moving on to one of my absolute favorites from last year when I picked this shoe up in New York at the New York Marathon Expo was the aex Nova blast verion floor version two version three were absolute Classics and version 4 aex really delivered again now I paid $140 for this at the Expo around about \u00a3135 8 mm drop in the shoe stack height 41 and A2 it wasn't true to size for me I had to go half a size down what I really liked about this shoe nice and lightweight nice and cushioned the Eco foam that aex used in the shoe is really good fun to run in it's engaging it's responsive Ive and just super comfortable overall again no hot spots no blisters so much padding around the ankle and at 135 really fantastic value for the quality of the materials and the quality of the product when you feel it in your hand you're running along with it it really is a great value what I didn't like about the shoe it's just not fantastic in wet weather it has asexy slightly lower density foam which should be really nice and grippy and it works fantastic in the dry but in the wet it's just a little bit slippy but nothing to worry about too much as long as you are a fair weather Runner right moving on to some higher price point options here and now we're starting to pay for a little bit more Tech some softer more responsive Foams and just that extra level of allout comfort and the next shoe we're going to have a chat about one my most comfortable shoe of all time in a recent video we did we'll link to that one up there and that is this the aex Joe Nimbus version 26 which sent me back \u00a3180 run $160 or \u20ac200 drop of 8 mm in the shoe overall 42 mil stack kite a load of phone to look after those in joints and muscles when you're out on your run true to size for me three different widths available in the shoe the standard width which is actually pretty good I was absolutely fine with that wide or extra wide what I really like about this shoe is it's just simply the most comfortable shoe that I've ever worn from my running the foam is so soft underf fooot and the upper is really really stretchy as well super supportive at the back again loads of really nice padded foam to look after your feet no rubbing anywhere in the shoe no blisters no hot spots or anything like that and it really is a shoe you can just put on and absolutely forget about when you're going out of those nice easy jogs this really is a joy to run in the dislikes with a shoe like this because it is so soft and squidgy underf fooot is a little bit harder to pick up the pace for some faster running it's also a little bit on the expensive side as well but if you're looking for the most comfortable shoe to start your running Journey then this one is definitely one to check out right moving on to the most expensive shoe here \u00a3210 for the new balanced fuel cell super comp trainer version 2 this is also really highly rated in my comfortable shoe video in terms of drop 6 mm drop in the shoe stack height 40 mm overall this was true to size for me and there are no different widths available as you might be able to see just through here and if I click on it it has a piece of carbon that runs through the shoe that just helps and assists us with our running and I think for a beginner Runner that wants to have a look at some carbon shoes this is a really good entry point into the market what I liked about the shoe yes Supreme comfort with the shoe had absolutely no issues really good for someone that's potentially training for their first marathon eats up those miles on those Long training runs it's very stable as well and the foam is super bouncy it's really fun and engaging it puts a smile on your face as you run along it really makes you want to run really really fast as well no overheating issues at all really nice breathable upper the upper part of the shoe good air flow going through there as you run it's just a really good option if you potentially want to do some races in the future or push your pace a little bit more it is slightly on the heavy side and I can't deny it over \u00a3200 is definitely on the expensive side if you've got that sort of money that's fantastic and this shoe will really not let you down right we've got two more shoes to have a chat about the first one is a beginner Runner that's looking for a stability shoe I'd really recommend having a look at the Brooks Adrenaline GTS which stands for goto support that supportive element version 23 now this shoe sent me back 135 35 mil stack at the back 12 mm drop it was true to size for me and in true Brook style they offer this in four different widths available what I liked about the shoe super durable this shoe will last a long time and the stability elements of the shoe just to keep that Arch nice and supportive on the inside they are there but they're not too intrusive you don't really notice them too much it's just an absolute classic daily option really good price point for such a longlasting shoe as well what I didn't like about the shoe the Pham was a little bit hard to start with but it really does soften up over time so don't worry about that too much and last but definitely not least my favorite beginner shoe for someone going out on the trails this is perfect for someone that doesn't want to do all of their running on the roads maybe live out in the country side do a little bit of off-road running through Parks Forest Grass or maybe you live up in the mountains already and you want to explore some Trails do some hiking or some running on those Trails something that has a little bit of extra grip for those rougher surfaces my girlfriend has recommended these shoes to me because she is a far better Trail Runner than I am and it's the hoker quite a smelly h taking it off H got speed goat version five I've done many miles in my version of this as well but I thought it really nice she put some footage of Sarah now running in this shoe round UTMB now this shoe set had back \u00a340 4 mm drop overall 38 mm stack height and it was a true to size for her as well on the official Hoka website they do offer lots of different widths available and the gortex waterproof version if you're going to be doing a lot of winter running now what Sarah really liked about the shoe and I I would definitely agree with her the viam outsole is really grippy on this shoe vibr are a separate company that makes them outsoles and their own shoes as well and you're going to get some really good grip in all sorts of different weather conditions here it's also super comfortable for very long periods of time Sarah ran the hold of UTMB in this exact pair of shoes so around about 40 odd hours of continuous running and Hiking through the mountains in the shoe and gave her absolutely no issues whatsoever it's super lightweight and very breathable as well some dislikes the not fantastic for their durability some people have had some upper issues with toes poking out the side and also the regular normal version of the shoe really is definitely on the narrow side so if you have a particularly wide foot definitely check out the wider options here now if I had to choose one shoe to recommend above all of the others as we've chatted here today I think I'd definitely go for the aex Nova blast version 4 or if money's a little bit tighter then definitely look at the Puma they're my two standout shoes for beginner Runners so now you know what shoes to go and buy let us know how you get on with them but you're also going to want some really good beginner running tips well I've got you covered there

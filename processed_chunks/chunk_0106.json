better than last week that's always a bonus oh man how can you can complain about the pain in your legs when you get a look at this view woo so nice seek Beauty keep seeking Beauty test one two three are we back in action in shudio yes we are 23 miles in the books ended up about I think that's 726 uh 727 a mile for the average went out a little quick given the conditions I got to you know I was I carried a a handheld water bottle today but it wasn't enough it I think by the end the temperature was about 65\u00b0 not enough uh so I definitely hit a wall that last 8 Miles so mile 15 to mile 23 that Loop who knows the vert I'm curious who knows the vertical gain for mags above Boulder this this Loop that I do for my house is 2,000 ft of up and down it is it's easily the hardest long run Loop that I do anyway I love it if you want to go see it on straa go check it out it is is just hard it just like is Rel it's just Relentless anyway it feels kind of like Magnolia Road up above Boulder all right so feeling good there's some stats on the screen let's do some unboxing thank you to all the brands I know I'm not really doing running shoe reviews at this point in uh in life and on YouTube but I do appreciate appreciate the brand still sending me gear I will continue to use the gear especially as the summer training ramps up up in the mountains very excited for example I'm looking at a box right here from Smart wool very very cool and actually I posted on Facebook and uh I think it was Twitter just basically what's been your favorite that's question of the day what has been your favorite piece of running gear thus far in 2024 all right so the first three to four months of the year what have you been using wearing testing it could be shoes it could be socks it could be water bottles vests uh uh watches you know Tech all that good stuff so let us know down in the comments all right my worst slowest uh I don't know basically my most challenging Marathon road marathon of my life was definitely at cim but I got to say cim this is pretty cool they sent a postcard I think I don't know yeah this just it's cool it's a basically an invitation to go out to Boston for the Boston Marathon 2025 that's this came in the mail for Mail Time cim to Boston it says so yes that's the plan 2025 Boston finally run Boston so I guess I I guess I qualified with my challenging Marathon out in California but it was good all right here we go David love you David out in New York City David's been a fan uh a friend uh but he's just been like he's just I can't tell you the amount of support

I want to run and train in gear that I'm interested in and I'm not getting any younger right so I got a like I'm really trying to emphasize right now recovery in my training and thus far compress sport has been my favorite uh compression gear that I that I've tested ever so compressed sport I think they're based out of France so anyway so I just needed some new and fresh uh calf sleeves there some special trail running socks for just those hard Mountain running days which are so close and remember um remember last summer I didn't film I took the summer off oh it was nice but but I'm excited to film The Mountain running for all of you this summer so stay tuned for some seek and Beauty up there in the Hills uh let's see and then I also got oh yeah some arm sleeves as well so compress Port absolutely my favorite compression gear there we go I thought that box was lost so I'm glad I I'm glad it actually arrived okay this is from I'm just going to rip it open from Smart wool oh my goodness wow now correct me if I'm wrong everybody did SmartWool start in Steamboat Springs Colorado am I is that am I crazy for I thought I heard back in the day that smart wool started up in Steamboat and then they were eventually purchased uh by a bigger company but I love smart wool I don't always train in wool socks but there are moments where I'm like you know what today is a perfect temperature and conditions on the trails for wool like a smart wool blend basically so these are some socks thank you oh some shorts whoa oh man a see here's the deal I'm I'm a buck 20 on a good day a buck 20 on a good day L ladies are like I need to who should I send these to oh my that's like um that's basically basketball shorts like in the 90s right there uh oh so well I will not be wearing that but thank you smart wolf for that and then a little t-shirt action very good oh a h oh a long sleeve can never have too many long sleeves with a hood tell me that I'm wrong all right here we go

listen Solomon thus far I know Hoka has uh what's the name of that shoe I used to wear it but bottom line the Pulsar has been my go-to for all the Pikes almost all the Pikes Peak races and it's treated me very this is this is my go-to and this looks like the SG version which is the soft ground version I could be wrong on that but anyway thank you Solomon for sending that love that shoe oh my

on the outsole good work there Hoka I love it and it feels it feels pretty ooh that feels pretty nice you know it's just got to be like the um almost like the Fresh Foam more but obviously it has a plate inside very interesting all right so I'll get you get you some initial thoughts over on straa very soon for the Skyward X and last box you know running Warehouse if you if you watch this video

it was good back in the day when I used to publish a lot of shoe reviews but uh priorities change and life changes and it's uh I'll continue to test running shoes for all of you but just know that uh for the brands that do send me gear I'll do my reviews a little more uh simply through photos through straa um and a little bit of video uh shoe reviews as well like this guy you know you you have to really fight for shoes to be sent sent to you and you have to ask and you have to reach out and you have to email and which is great that's fine I don't have the time for it though you know is the bottom line so I am um if they arrive at the house I will put them through the paces for you guys but at the end of the day I'm I'm just here to hopefully give a little love through this camera give a little inspiration and uh keep having fun in this sport of Life all right so U where we go uh 23 miles in the books and I don't even know what I'm racing for right now just so you know like I I have

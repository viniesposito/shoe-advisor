  "text": "hey Tomy from the Run testers in this video we are going to be talking about running shoes coming out in 2025 so we're going to be talking through shoes that we think might be coming out or hope are going to be coming out over the next 12 months and talking about the ones that we're most excited about the shoes that we're talking about in this video we don't really have any insight into the release date of them or if indeed they are going to get released this is purely speculative uh excitement around shoes that we hope will appear over the next 12 months this is also uh the podcast so if you're planning on listening to the podcast then don't watch this video right let's dive in and uh see what we're looking forward to in [Music] 2025 so we're coming to the end of 2024 great year for shoes some fantastic releases and and as keeps telling us um but 2025 is going to be here very soon and there is a lot of shoes that we've heard about possibly getting released a few websites have talked about um release schedules for shoes um and shoes that maybe we don't know about yet but we would probably guess that there would be a new version of them coming out so uh guys what are we excited about in 2025 in the running shoe World um let's let's start off with I'll break this down to categories so that we're not just flow throwing shoes left right and Center let's start with brace shoes uh Nick what race shoes are you excited about in 2025 there a few I think uh I'll probably go with the ones that have been confirmed so I think a lot of shoes get confirmed at the running event in Texas which we've uh We've not been able to go to yet our emails are open for invites for sure but um so a few that I think the one that really stands out to me is I'm super excited about is the uh it's the worst named shoe of all time it's the hoker cell X 2.0 which is you got to ask questions have you about that nav protocol but hocus yellow X1 was one of my favorite shoes of last year I think we all anyone who whove run it have loved it incredibly bouncy really fun a tad heavy and now they've brought the weight right down the second version by all accounts they've changed the cutout to move it to the other side of the shoe to hopefully increase stability I was talking to H about this a little bit as well think they've changed the plate shape a little bit so if it can retain the incredibly F bouncy fun feeling of the first one or making it lighter I think that's going to be a really really Top Choice for Marathon racing in particular but races in general and I think that's definitely the race I'm most excited about um intrigued to see if we get a new vaporfly vaporfly 4 and what exactly they do with it Nike because the three wasn't universally well received you guys didn't like it that much I think um I liked it but the alphafly seems in like before there was lots of lots of different choices I think between people between vly and Ally I think the Ally 3 is pretty much the choice for most of Nike Elites now so inter see if fer fly 4 changes that a bit but I've got a couple of others but I'll let you guys pick them because those are the two that top of my mind then Ken what have you got for rues yeah I mean I guess there's one that we've been waiting for for a while or it feels like it since the first gen came out and it was a bit of a shoe that divided opinion but the so endorphin Elite 2 looks really interesting um not everyone liked it I used it for quite a lot of sort of big races I did the comrades in it I did um a long kind of ultra the tunnel in it but I guess the big news is phone that I first heard about uh a couple days ago which the incred Run phone run which is which is I don't know the name yeah it just sounds like a yeah sounds sort of gimmicky but um apparently incredibly soft and Incredibly bouncy and from what I've seen on the videos the most amazing thing about this is just how far the foam squeezes down if you do that kind of finger squeeze thing that people do with their shoes it kind of goes right down and then returns um it's going to be still got a full length kind of slotted carbon plate um they've now changed one thing which I think did divide opinion which was the uppers were quite fiddly and fussy on the old endorphin um Elites they've made them a little bit more simplified and they've got an integrated tongue now so you're going to get like a guess a bit more of a sort of booty fit which I think should make him feel a bit more comfortable overall but it sounds to me like they're going to be softer and much more bouncy have have you have you seen them in person uh I've just seen them on in videos yeah I've held them I've squished them and they and I mean it's unreal remember when when I remember when I talked about the uh the ballos when we first heard about it and I I got a feeling that it was going to be the perfect shoe for me I've got I think the Endorphin Elite 2 is going to be my my race of choice I I really i' love hate relationship with the Endorphin Elite one I got like a few PBS in that shoe Way Beyond what I expected to get in the races I think it's fast shoe but I don't find it very comfortable I think I think this may be my shoe of the year if it's uh if if it's I think it's might stray too soft like just Jing it looks so soft and I've SE I know some people who have tried an early version they're a little bit scared of it because it's so soft and I guess that makes it a little bit wobbly but if it returns in the right direction then it's going to be a lot of fun I mean Tom's going to lose his mind if it's a soft well I need I need a new soft bouncy Rao why you're not doing marathons anymore mate don't worry about it well I can I can still use it for half marathons if I want you know I'm going to end up signing up to a marathon in August as soon as you feel our soft this shoe you're going to sign up to like an ultra doesn't matter yeah cool well that yeah that is a that is one that um I am very excited to test out for me um one sh that I'm I want say I'm excited about it I I would be if it it comes out like I I wanted to but the sney dorphin pro five um because you know that Pro three is my favorite running shoes of all time didn't really like the four very much so I'm really interest to see what what they do with with the five um and if if they if they you know shift it a little bit more towards what people expected from the earlier version yeah I think the other one we should call out is Brooks finally moving to peber Foams next year with a a peber version of the current shoe um which I think comes out quite early in the year and then they're the all new Hyper Elite 5 will have you know a redesign with so I mean they are I think now the last brand to move across to P Foams races or at least you know an equivalent very soft springy foam so maybe because I think this when is usually F this year every brand pretty much has caught up and is in a similar level now in terms of quality except maybe Under Armour and Brooks so maybe Brooks will be joining the pack uh with a with a redesign [Music] shoe um all right let's have a look at uh trainers and super trainers uh so that's you know sitting under the race the race day shoes what are we excited about so I've I've got one I love the max the Brooks Hyperion Max 2 I found it like a really nice uh sort of versatile shoe to run and again I did a lot of different sort of runs and races in it I'm quite excited to look at the the hyper Max 3 and again you know they've basically added a bit of a bigger stack height it might change I'm a little bit worried because I quite like the fact that it wasn't overkill on the last shoe and you now got DNA gold PE based mol foam as a top layer you're going to have uh DNA flash which is in V2 and the old Sho in the bottom layer um keeping uh Pack's plate but they've kind of changed the geometry as well um and it's mainly they've got a massive you know they've actually added quite a lot of extra stack to it so it may well change that which I'm a little bit worried about but it might make it a bit more of a lively shoe for a daily train and put it into that kind of super super trainer territory where the other one was you know maybe a little bit dull for some people's liking compared to shoes like the super blast or whatever so I think that one could be interesting I think Brooks could have a really interesting year this year yeah definitely yeah Big Year for Brooks cuz they're bringing the DNA tuned foam from the glycerin Max into a few other shoes as well right so be interesting to see new Foams across the board I think I'm very excited about the hok ma X3 which basically looks like the same shoe but with a less fiddly heel design which I think will make it that was my shoe of the Year pretty much this year I didn't mind the heel but you know a slightly more comfy heel for a for what is a training shoe really will be will be great looking forward to that in the super trainer realm for sure anything else well we talking just fast trainers or super is that the plan here or uh I think we lump them together fast trainers super trainers diags are we no no this is a relaxed chat this is a relaxed chat um what's the soin trainer yeah that looks it it's weird that doesn't it because it that looks like a almost a redesign Kara Pro kind of I don't know I don't it feels like a shoe that didn't Ian they already have the Endorphin speed not replace the kvara pro right is it okay I think so there's a Kar Pro too I thought coming out oh too many cavar PR yeah yeah need one but it's got like a half carbon it's got like a a half carbon plate as well I think in the four foot so it's got a slightly different that's what the conar pro did as well wasn't it yeah I don't know where that sort of slots in but hoker redesigned some um made big changes to stuff like the Clifton as well looks like high fairly High drop which would be because hok is basically across the board 5 millimeters more or less except yellow I think but Clifton's going up a little bit and St right yeah more St I think that's good the way because there is a sky flow in the mac and they're a bit more different now I think because the sky flow felt just like a like a better Clifton very similar but with a nicer foam so and the Bondi is getting a super critical foam so it' be interesting to see how that feels because that was not a shoe we were huge fans of in the past well let me throw another one at you Nick the Muno Neo Vista 2 excited about that one I am excited about but they've also released another one that just very recently right that's the race the race shoe no no not the race shoe there's another Neo Vista style shoe that's a little bit less aggressive and it feels like they're now packing that area a bit too tightly with shoes but I mean neov Vista was more or less like a perfect reintroduction of Muno to that area I think so I don't know I I don't know what they'll do with that I mean the new Rue I'm annoyed by a little bit because it's like 60 millimeter stack heite just slightly away from where they measure it and that's that is out of hand isn't it that's one thing when you look across all these shoes and even on from road to Trail as well it does feel like we're now in the world where 40 is small or we're getting it feels like everything's pushing now all the across all of the shoes the stack kits have gone higher and higher eventually the racing the training shoes will be better than the legal Racing shoes and that's and where will we be then um I I don't know I it's a serious point if you even from the test that we've been doing recently where I've gone from like an over blast 5 and back into something like a supernova rise 2 which just got some you just really feel it and I do worry like there's a bit of bit of that where none of those shoes will none of the more traditional shoes might might exist it feels like they're all being kind of even the rise 2 is nearly 40 isn't it yeah yeah but it feels it feels more that now feels more traditional compared to a lot of the others you know or some of them even when they're really big don't feel CR like no me doesn't feel like a 42 millimet Sho it feels quite regularly feels relatively normal compared to some of them but then the Pegasus premium feels so high at 4 you know two more millimeters so it's I I think getting used to being on the higher Stacks as well though now I've noticed like I'm I back in the day that would have been you it would have felt like a big shoe to me when I flick back to something isn't quite does I do notice but all right well let's oh other ones that in this category that might appear you'd assume that there would be another version uh aex Magic speed five well we didn't test the four did we no we get to test I there's been lurky rumors online um you know around around the forums I love a good forum about aex going for a pro Evo style shoe asn't like they as in a very very lightweight mostly focused on Elite style shoe which is a development I am very against and I'll be really unhappy if brand start doing that more often where there's shoes that basically people can't really access um and they're too expensive or they're not really out there so if it's on General sale and it's not a silly price fine you know make a crazy light shoe that doesn't last very long like people don't have to buy that think I wouldn't buy that but you know some people want to but if it's a case of you can't run the shoes the elites run in which probably be pretty much the first time in running history that's been the case that would be that'll be a shame won't it amazing marketing from Adidas though in this in the last few releases of shoes based on the existence of the the pro Evo I get because people people obviously love the [ __ ] [ __ ] pro for and it probably is the more suitable shoot for most people but as a keen amateur I would never go and get that shoe because well that's not their best shoe so I'll go to a brand that is selling their best shoe like the alpha fly or the you know normal speed because I don't want to I don't want to feel second best yeah uh i' got for you Tom got which is one that we haven't actually this another brand that I think is going to be interesting to watch I know Nick you tested some I haven't tested their recent shoes but on got the cloud boom Max yeah that looks fun they're bringing their people phone a bit more stuff right yeah and that's that's but that's an interesting one because it's it's a shoe that's it's not carbon plated it's got they've gone back to having um what do they call it their speedboard they've got a slightly more flexible speedboard but it's going to be a big stack of um p phone and they're basically aiming this at people who run marathons in four five hours but they want they say that it's going to have like a super shoe feel for four the four and five hour marathon runners so that's I never like when people say that that's never come across well when shoes I've tested I yeah I don't need it yeah it's like I think people people run to marathons in most times are using Super Shoes and I think they're doing perfectly fine they're asking for a lot of money for a stub sander shoe sometimes I think it's an interesting one because they sort of say this is going to be like the Super Shoe dream for those people and they've got it from going and watching lots of people run those times at marathons and observe them and see that they're maybe not moving as as well as they might do in a shoe still they still differ massively in how they move right all those people don't have the same running style this exactly what Solomon said with a spectre which was just basically a super trainer with the price of a super shoe and but maybe they'll pull it off I mean I'm really excited about the on cloud boom Zone as well I think that's going to be we haven't tested that yet that's kind of been out but I think that'll be a pretty fun shoe If This Cloud boom Max is the cloud Monster hyper what I wanted from that like a full P kind of Mido that' be great uh all right well now you completely messed up the uh the system then we might as well mention the Haw Rocket 3 if that's if that's going to appear next year this is just a vague like speculation from a website right Tom cuz there's no sign of this year or anything no I mean a lot of these ones we haven't like got confirmation and okay to Cave at that now and at the end of the at the end of the video and the podcast that these are we're not confirming that these are going to be released we're we're talking about rumors some some of them you may have seen some of them like the Texas ring show but yes a lot of these are speculation and uh we're not confirming relase States or anything yeah we we haven't got any Scoops here to give you I'm afraid yeah yeah yeah um so HCK rocket three if that if that does appear I hav I never tested that the two so I'm assuming that's quite an exciting shoe well it wasn't at the Texas show was it and they did have most of the hookah shoes into next year so I guess it maybe maybe won't but and then Adidas Tumi s 11 that might be yeah that would be ad that's often go on a twoyear cycle I mean there should be a new Boston right that would be great yeah yeah um I don't know I don't I haven't seen anything on this what I'd love next year is a real super blast competitor I was just going to say super blast stuff yeah I don't think there'll be a super blast necessarily itself cuz they often I don't know they release it right at the end of the year if they do it don't they T to but lots of brands have come out with mega stack like with great Foams and they've all ended up being more like kind of like the Hocus Skyward X than the super blast you know heavy cruisy big fun you know daily trainers no one see I mean the super blast is lighter than most of the plated super trainers we like test it's it's pretty incredible combo so interest to see if anyone can really have a go at that mhm [Music] all right well let's move on from the faster shoes and let's start talking a bit more about the uh the world of cushion and daily shoes there's one that's probably going to be quite exciting for you that might be appearing next year Nick you guess what that is uh pelocity nitro 4 yeah well I don't know because that was a was that last time they only released that right at the start of this year didn't they the velocity Nitro 3 yeah I mean I mean yeah could we good I'm not sure i' I've not SE anything on it yet so I I don't know I don't know as long as I don't mess with it too much well it's yeah it's been so far it's been a pretty consistent line hasn't it um some changes to to that version is being released but like K said that's still 36 odd millimeters so that will now feel like a low shoe yeah yeah yeah okay any other cush or daily Cushing shoes uh we're excited about to see if they resurrect the Triumph after what we did not enjoy that one this year oh yeah yeah yeah what about I saw I saw something I I don't have any detail to share on it but I know you guys love you like enjoyed the hurricane right yeah yeah yeah yeah that's going to be I think there's an an update for that one coming as well so yeah that's under 40 millimeters and that feels like a massive shoe um yeah that was a really big pleasant surprise this year just a really enjoyable Cruiser probably one of my favorite Cruisers of the whole year Well I say this about the the hurricane I I didn't actually know existed before we tested the the this year's version um so the fact that it's such a long line of shoes is it was really surprising but you assume that from a shoe shoe that's got 26 versions already there will be another version uh this next year yeah it'll be um I think I did see something about this but I can't remember what what changes they make but I guess it was quite a drastic change this year so I don't it'll be assume most yeah they won't change it too much the overlast six will obviously go back to being quite firm so that'll be every year they change that they flip-flop yeah it's funny one the over blast range isn't it it does actually change quite a bit whereas where doesn't have a lot of consistency um good for us because we makes it more fun to review something that's changed a little bit but um yeah anything else in the cushioned world the da Sho World whether I mentioned already the Bondi going to a full super critical foam will be interesting it basically be a Mac stack Sky flow or Mac six so to see how that feels Brooks G 22 i' I've seen yeah that's out isn't it or some of the people have got that people have got that in America that's got the midsole from the glycerin Max okay I slightly lower Stacks that should be quite nice I think I've had a little I've had a little run in that but all right I don't if I'm allowed to say that yeah well I did a little I just like up and down outside in a car park oh little chatter bricks in you yeah yeah and it yeah so it's I guess I'm allowed to say if your car did you I I ran I ran the longest I've ever run in a car par run a 2 minute mile in the shoe but I think I think it will bring if you if the glycerin was a lacked a bit of life this one might come to life a bit more I think okay um no idea if it's getting released but the uh ride 18 if that appears that' be an exciting one for us yeah guess yeah I mean I like the rides but yeah again I'm pretty sure I've seen somebody already put that out there oh really I saw something on the guide for sure so they usually come to don't they um we should probably probably know more about that our job we like the surprise it all appears yeah it's true also we're in the UK we we get stiffed a bit on some shoes occasionally we get stuff ahead of the US which is quite nice but it's very much occasionally yes yeah yeah uh and then there's probably going to be updates to shoes like the Kayano range there's there's always an update to that every year isn't there well we've got the Nimbus in so what have they done to Nimbus slightly higher stack height mostly the same they'll do the same with the car I guess [Music] okay um what shoes am I missing Trail traila yeah let's do Trail Kieran what uh trail shoes what what would you be excited only if you're ready Tom only if you're ready I don't want I just had thought about Trail TR so so I'm I'm shocked I haven't got any I'm not got any prep for it so go for it there's only there's one that I I'm again I've kind of seen it on videos from the running event and that's the um North Face Summit vective Pro three I wish they put more names in the names to make but yeah so you've got uh like a nitrogen infused PE of midsole but there's a dual carbon plate system which is interesting so they've got one carbon plate at the bottom which is supposed to give the kind of the the speed and propulsion and they've got like another sort of cage there's like a drop in insert and then a cage that sits across the top which then is supposed to provide the stability so they're trying to do this kind of jaw system so you can have speed and stability on the TR um it's going be fascinating to see how that how that if that actually works out and because it's a big it's it's it's again it's like another big old sort of Stack shoe for the trail probably along the lines of the meta Fuji and those kind of things where we're getting higher volume but how that runs will be yeah it would be interesting prob think the second version was actually that the wing on the side rubbing the the wing on the carbon play actually rubbed so hopefully that's cuz that I quite enjoyed the ride of it but yeah I mean you don't want that in a shoe you're meant to be running long distance is it and and then there's a ma there's hok of mafti 5 which I've not actually run in the mafti for a long time I don't think but they've done something which they've they're basically going to flip the Foams around so normally you would have the um Firma Foam on the bottom right and the softer foam on the top they're got to flip it the other way so you've got the softer Foams on the bottom and the fermer foam on the top the idea is that this can almost like absorb the trail so it's kind of mold itself or deform as you hit bits of the trail so you don't feel the lumps and bumps that's got high drop as well is it or higher drop than the usual for H yeah I think yeah again they're yeah they're all adding so very interesting given that so much of the industry has spent the last 5 10 years moving towards the shoes that hoker originally brought you know the kind of low Drop Rock could choose and now hoker is moving towards the High Drops that everyone else was doing it's intriguing to see what what happened the the momentum and patterns we see in the running shoe world except Nike with this resolutely 10 millimeter drops with no rockers always the same so I suppose I suppose there might be new versions of the tecton uh out next year that that came out it's around a lot of the trail is released around UTMB don't they now yeah especially the big races yeah so might see a new one of those do do you want to keep the gator on it I didn't mind the gator actually I have to say I I need it because I'm nearly always running in like it's more kind of like grassy and stuff it's not really like rocks and stuff but didn't mind it just looking through possible shoes but I mean there's there's nothing really on the trail side I'm not really that excited about anything maybe another of those what's that one I like the as6 meta Trail Max or whatever it's called gel truko or gel truko that's it yeah getting with the uh I still haven't tried the more Trail need to need to get hold of that um anything else on the trail world that you're excited about Ro Trail world there's only one name in the road Trail world right now and that's the mor flight but I can't imagine a more flight too what would you do with it what would you do with it exactly yeah so different colors just need new colors of it that's true yeah just bring out more colors keep reducing that's already incredibly reasonable price nice all right well I think that probably covers Us with most of the stuff that's coming up that we we hope is coming up or um we've heard rumors about on the on on the internet um so uh yeah we'll hopefully get to test a lot those shoes and um they will appear in 2025 another fun year hopefully big year on the channel lots of fun stuff to come well uh in in advance uh or depends when people listening to this happy New Year oh yeah happy New Year happy New Year catch you later guys catch on the 50 flip on God [Music]",

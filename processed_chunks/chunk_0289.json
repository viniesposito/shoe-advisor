  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers and in this video we've got a first run look at the new Adidas Supernova rise 2 not a huge amount has changed between this shoe in the first generation but I've had them on my feet for a few miles and here are my first impressions of the changes that have happened so let's get into it quick details then the Adidas Supernova rise sticks with the same relatively conservative stack at least by today's standards the stack I comes in at 36 m in the heill 26 and the 4T for a 10 mil drop it weighs in at 9.6 o or 272 g in my men's UK and a half Adidas said it has shaved 4% off the weight versus the first gen but those come in at 9.7 or 275 G in the test shoe so I'm not quite seeing that but coming in under 10 ounces I would say sort of keeps Supernova rise fairly competitive on weight price-wise things stay the same with the Adidas Supernova rise to coming at \u00a3130 or $140 that's now towards the cheaper end of the daily trainer shelves let's give you a quick shoe whip round and Adidas pitches the Supernova as a neutral everyday shoe a starting point daily training that could be good as an option for beginners the updates to the Adidas Supernova rise to are minimal and largely restricted to the uppers where Adidas has tried to boost comfort and save weight that includes new mesh uppers less padding in the hill though that's quite hard to see versus The Originals thinner tongues and some softer eye stays here the midsole unit stays the same it sticks with PE based dream strike plus midsole foam that's made from a small percentage of recycled materials that dream strike plus has some of the bounce of a performance foam but not the full energy of a super foam there's also a highly rocked 4ot and what Adidas calls a support Rod system a set of visible rods that follow the metat tassels and add some stiffness and spring up top the Supernova rise has a new mesh upper that's marginally thinner and a little less structured across the toe box for an upper that's not unlike a nimbus 26 the heel collar are still really well padded particularly at the back they're are quite stiff heel counts to enhance the support and heel hold you've also still got pretty well padded traditional tongues with no gussing if you flip them over there's a generous covering of durable adwar Rubber and overall this is a shoe that screams long mile durability when it came to fit I ran in my regular Adidas running shoe size which is a UK 8 1/2 us 9 and 1 half and I found these fit well true to size they're not the roomiest shoes but they're roomy enough just about enough wiggle room in the toe box was easy to lace them up and get them locked in comfortably midfoot lock down was generally good on that first run the rise held my foot nicely in place plus the big padded heel Coler secured my heel well and in good comfort with no heel slipping So based on that first run I'm going to suggest going true to sizing these so I've just ticked over 4 and 1 half miles my first run in the Adidas Supernova rise to and in those first four miles I think unsurprisingly because the midsole unit is largely the same or in fact identical to the rise one not much has changed here you're getting a very similar ride to the rise one big change Al talks about really have come in the uppers where they've changed a few things to the heel package and the tongues mainly in effort to make the shoe lighter but as you see on the scales it's not a huge amount to choose in terms of the weight and I don't notice anything on the foot to be honest that's not to say these I don't find them a particularly heavy shoe I know some people wanted them to offer the ride they offer but with a lighter package and that's why and it has have made some changes but I'm not noticing substantial here from that point of view so if you already own the rise one I wouldn't say it's worth upgrading to the rise to thinking you're going to get a lighter shoe with the same ride what you are going to get is the same ride and when it comes to that ride this is a shoe that basically packs a more traditional feel underf foot there's not a huge amount of soft cushioning there's just enough sort of softness to take the edge off the road but you will feel quite a lot of ground contact coming up through I still feel like this is a shoe that I'm going to have to break in it's felt a little bit firm to begin with there is a stiffness and I quite like that if you like that sort of more traditional ride you're going to get that with these shoes now having come from the Nova blast 5 and other shoes like the super Blast 2 even the New Balance 1080 v14 shoes like that you know I think one thing you will notice about the Supernova Riders 2o it's the same with the one they feel a little bit more compact it's a little bit less shoe on the foot this a bit of a narrower platform and although they probably feel about the same way they don't feel quite so big overall on the foot but I think for me the most important Sensation that I've got here is kind of an imy that comes from the midsole so this isn't a daily training that's going to come with a big stack of soft bouncy midsole foam what you're getting instead is a phone that compresses a little has quite a firm feeling under foot and then returns back quite quickly it's a more kind of Snappy and responsive ride it's another of the shoes where I think it benefits best from you picking up your feet quick and you're Landing mid to 4 foot rather than further back on your heels and when you're moving at a slightly faster Pace or at least with lighter feet where your turnovers quick so you're not actually putting too much energy down into the ground but you're sort of balancing that that when you're doing that it kind of softens the overall impact and the shoes kind of come to life if you're Landing a bit heavier and you're W to go a bit slow I find maybe there's not going to be as much cushion that some people are really going to want particularly at the easier end I think what's most interesting about that is that I did is kind of peg this is a good shoe for beginner Runners who want kind of like a Workhorse daily trainer that can do a lot of runs and definitely soak up that 80% of your easy runs and I think actually in a world where we've got a lot more kind of softness and cushion from shoes that do that for easier runs I'm not sure that everyone's going to like that there is an upside to that though what you've got here is a much more connected ride and that brings with it a good stability there's a good reliability to the land Landings and the way the the ride feels Under Foot so it's consistent even if it comes up a little bit stiff and a little bit firm which I think for some people particularly if you're looking at running slow and easy I think a lot of people maybe want more cushion if you like a shoe with a little bit less cushion relies a little bit more on Fast foot turnover then I think this could be a good option the Comfort on foot is excellent heels of held well fit is good overall I find the fit really nice and disappearing all of that stuff is a big tick in the box and actually this is the kind of shoe that I don't mind you know I put it in ballpark alongside maybe like a night Peg 41 or even like a Brooks ghost 16 those kind of shoes that if I'm thinking about whether or not it's actually like a Kara if it's got that kind of feel to it maybe not quite a canara not quite as direct there's a little bit more softness and cushion but it's in that kind of ballpark it's moving back to that kind of world so coming up to the 10K mark close to an hour on feet I think the way I describ this best it's like controlled connected cushion you are going to feel some of the ground I think that's probably going to limit how long some people would really want to run in it but if you can get light foot and you start to clip along and cruise it cops quite well but it's going to be for a particular type of running I think you know I think even when you're going slower you're going to want to land in this with lighter feet quicker turnover to really balance out the fact that there's maybe a little bit less cushioning flip side of that it's one of those shoes that I think if you're if you do pick up the pace there is some potential here for it to go a bit faster one of the shoes that it'll deliver the fastest but you're still going to be doing a lot of the work you can't expect the cushioning to be kind of bounding you forward as it might do in some other sort of daily trainers that try to have a range and a bit of Versatility to them so I've just finished 7 miles just over an hour First Impressions in this we'll save a verdict for the full review but first impressions are this is pretty much more of the same as you would have got with the original rise what I find with that is you've got a connected comfortable lightly cushion but not really spongy firmer stiffer ride that relies more on response and fast turnover for that comfort then you'll finding some kind of bigger cushion softer bouncier shoes the energy is going to come from you delivering the the high turnover there's a little bit of spring not a huge amount it is controlled it is stable it's nicely balanced there's a good Comfort on the foot I find the weight okay I think I'm happy kind of clipping along sort of mid Pace in them uh I think if I'm landing too heavy too far back on my heels I feel like there's too much ground coming up potentially if I'm low like slower and heavier basically but there's a reliability to them which I quite like and actually once you kind of just get flowing in them they will turn over quite nicely quite well I feel like with the generations of shoes that we've got coming on now with a lot of people I speak to they like to have a bit more cushion they like to feel a little bit less of the road if that's you and you don't want much of the road coming up through I think the Supernova rise 2 are going to follow the Supernova rise and being a little bit too much kind of ground feel coming through and you might want to go for a softer shoe if you like the sort of slightly more traditional more direct ride underfoot then these are going to deliver that and they it really well actually I don't mind them at all for that I like a shoe which has a little bit more ground feel um you know it's chalk and cheese when you come up to shoes against shoes like the Nova blast 5 which I've tested recently or you're even thinking about something like a new balance 1080 v14 now which comes in much softer and as I said on the run there I put this in the the marker shoes bit more like a ghost or even maybe a glycerin that kind of area and yeah I think you'll just going to like to have a shoe that feels a little bit lower stack feels a little bit more connected like these but we will do more testing obviously put more miles in them and uh we'll bring you the full review once we've done the requisite amount of Miles start to rain here so I'm off back home so there you have it that's been our first run look at the new Adidas Supernova rise 2 certainly tweaks rather than a revolution in the shoe pretty much the same as you're going to get with the rise but I hope you found that interesting if you want to hear about the review our full verdict when we've done the requisite test miles then don't forget to hit subscribe and ring the bell if you like this video hit like if

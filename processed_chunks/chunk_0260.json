  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers now the ax Nova blast is one of those shoes that changes tack each generation it kind of shuffles from being softer and more cushion to stiffer and more responsive the aex Nova blast 4 was firmer and snappier which improved its faster Pace potential over the novablast 3 the latest Incarnation the ax no blast 5 here now goes back to soft with the new midsole foam that's tuned for added bounce the springier flight foam blast Max midsole aims to help the no blast 5 hit that do it daily trainer sweet spot but how does it compare to the overlast 4 has it finally nailed the versatility and is it a better option than the old generation shoe well here's the verdict in our asex no blast 5 versus aex no blast 4 head-to-head review so quick details then stack height and the stack height here stays the same 41 a half Ms in the hill 33 m in the 4T with the same 8 mil drop in both shoes from the four to the five when it comes to weight as managed to shave a little off the A6 no blast 5 in our UK men's 8 and a half test shoe the no blast 5 Now tips a scales of 8.9 o or 251 G compared to 9.4 o or 267 G in an overlast 4 broadly the same weight as the aex super Blast 2 and among the lighter big stack daily trainers the asex no blast 5 price stays the same too \u00a3 135 in the UK $140 in the US sitting firmly in the mid-range bracket for a daily trainer so let's give you a shoe comparison then and at first glance fresh out the box it doesn't look like much has changed between these two shoes design sticks largely to that Nova blast blueprint with this geometric midsole and a Max stack midsole at that with a large rocker plush Cruiser Comfort details up top but there are a few important changes including a new midsole foam with a wider footprint new uppers and an updated outsole pattern as well the ax Nova blast 5 is currently the only shoe in the range that now has a full midsole of flight phone blast Max a phone we first saw in the ax Glide ride Max ASX says this Max stack foam offers around 88.5% More Bounce than you got with the mid the no blast 4 up top you've got the woven upper of the overlast 4 has been replaced by a more premium jackard mesh that takes styling cues from the super Blast 2 the new mesh improves breathability has a degree of natural stretch that holds the foot well without restricting over blast 5's heel collors are slightly more paded the gusted tongues are virtually identical with quite a thin nicely wrapping design though asex has added a tongue pull kind of lace Loop to the top of the tongue here the out soole sticks to a relatively standard covering of aex ahar low rubber aside from a change pattern this is the same across the over blast 4 and the five however you're still not getting that top level grip ah plus that you'll find on the ax super Blast 2 quick word onfit then and the one thing thing that has changed here is the way that these shoes feel particularly across the back of the toes here these uppers there's much more kind of flex there's lots more room the feeling in the toe box is one of kind of more space and if you really wanted that in a long run shoe then you're going to get that in the Nova blast 5 I really quite like that particularly if I was thinking about going for Ultras the extra space in this shoe which does you know some people might think it feels a bit baggy I really like that I like to have a lot of wiggle room you'll notice that when you go back into the Nova blast four bit more structure to the uppers and they just hold a little bit closer across the top of the toes here I found these also very comfortable to be honest and I find them roomy enough but you're going to get more in the no blast 5 than you got here maybe a bit better hold coming back up across the top of the midf foot heel collars and everything else for me holds exactly the same in both shoes I would recommend going true to size when it comes to the fit of the two nov blast shoes I got them both in my normal uk9 which is a us10 with ax I've had a good fit with both no concerns at all they're both fairly voluminous in the forefoot especially the no blast 5 is quite a roomy shoe and I have quite a narrow foot but the length is right and I've not had any problems with lock down or anything like that not noticed a big difference in the uppers I will say and aex has tweaked the one on the new shoe to try and make it more breathable like they always say when they change an upper I've be running in fairly cold conditions I haven't really noticed too much of a difference between them on that front both have a comfortable hold around the heel and midfoot so yeah fits fine for me in my normal size so fit for me has been very good in both of these shoes I would say these are true to size fitting shoes I've got them both in a UK size eight that is my typical running shoe size that's the same shoe size that I've had the previous Nova blast shoes and I you know I think you know things like the kind of rooms in the toe box are very similar you know just enough room not too roomy not too short and making them ideal for longer runs level of padding and the hill colors and the tongues are very good so youve got that good Comfort around your heel and on top of your foot as well getting a good lock down has been generally good as well across the board I think the only real difference for me is just how the two uppers feel with they're slightly different materials or make up of materials I think the no blast 5 one just sits a little bit more snug a little bit more relaxed I think particularly the middle of the shoe and I think with the no blast 4 if you prefer something that sits a little bit closer that middle section of the shoe just wraps a little bit closer then I think you know that's what the no blast 4 will give you but yeah it's it's small things and I think as I said for me going true sizing both of these shoes I think will be fine for most people if you don't really have to play around with sizing on the Nova last series so the fit for me in these two versions of the Nova blast I'm a size eight in the UK these are both size eights very similar fit in both of them I'd probably say that the Nova blast 5 is a feels a little bit more forgiving a little bit wider to me than the Nova blast 4 but there's not a lot in it the length is pretty similar to me and I definitely stay to my size in both of these shoes padding wise there's probably a little bit more um comfort in the padding that you get in the no blast 5 um but very very similar shoes um when it comes to fits so I'll say to my size in both of these shoes in testing I've covered well north of 30 miles in NOA blast 5 and more than 50 miles in the Nova blast 4 I've used them across the same range of paces and terrain as usual I've run everything from slow and easy long runs to faster intervals and progression runs that's on a mix of Road and light off-road River PS the usual stuff that I put the shoes through now I've had a bit of an up and down relationship with the ASX no overa blast over the generations there's no doubting the plush comfort of these shoes but I found the very earliest Generations a bit too soft and mushy slightly uncontrolled at times While others raved about the bouncy energy I found that had to work hard to energize what I thought was quite a sinky midsole that changed with the no blast 4 which brought some welcome firmness a bit of stiffness and snap to the ride there was a little bit of midsole outsole kind of stiffness that added IM medy that made the no blast 4 I thought better for faster runs and boosted the overall versatility with the no blast 5 things have gone bit soft again but it's try to offset that with some extra bounce in the mids salt but I'm kind of back to being a bit torn at times I've Loved this shoe others I've wanted it to give me a bit more when I'm tired now we often talk about how Pace impacts the ride of shoes but for me the ASX no blast 5 performance and my enjoyment of the shoe relies much more on form than on speed I find the no blast 5 got amplifies how you're running on the day regardless of pace so when you're moving heavy legged at time times they can feel sluggish you know if you're struggling there's plenty of cushion and comfort and protection and they're still capable easy mile shoes but you have to work harder however when you're moving light and full of energy probably a bit further up onto the midf foot 4 foot the ax NOA blast 5 I find responds well and gives all of that energy straight back now like the Nova blast 4 I still wouldn't use these shoes I don't think for my allout top Pace runs or they wouldn't be my first choice there are better shoes for that like the speedier super Blast 2 or the more Compact and nimble socking endorphin speed 4 but you can shift up the gears in the Nova blast 5 and they respond well right up to Tempo efforts the overlast 4 also offers that range I think it's just more consistent across the paces even when you're not feeling on top form there's a bit less sync to work your way out of in the transition I find now I like the Nova blast 5 is a bit more of a compact shoe some of the length has been cut by dropping the heel extension Plus I'm always happy to save weight on a shoe particularly on the larger shoes the no blast 5 now runs lighter on the foot than you'd think and feels bit more Nimble by comparison to the Nova blast 4 you're still getting a big stack shoe but you're getting it without the kind of feelings of that kind of extreme heft that you might have got with the four heel Strikers May well notice the reduced heel extension help smooth the ride as well so it comes to the run test the ax no blast 4 was my favorite version of the no blast yet I've never been someone who's been completely in love with the range I found the first one a little bit too wobbly second one a little bit too dull the third one was great out of the box but the foam seemed to lose a lot of its life over time but the no blast 4 I did click with I found it a really good daily trainer with a very smooth and rocked ride that could handle a range of runs but it was just generally best for those easy and comfortable long runs no blast 5 I think is a small Improvement on the shoe I do prefer it a little bit to the no blast 4 but it's not a major jump in any way I would say and overall they are shoes that do the same kind of job which is to be a versatile mid-range daily trainer that will appeal to lots of Runners there's nothing too exceptional about them I'd say in terms of the ride field but they are very solid shoes they do do a good job and I think they're easy ones to recommend to runners in general so it comes to differences between them I'd say the no blast 4 does feel a little bit firmer to me I think the foam has softened a little bit with this new FF blast Max stuff you have in the Nova blast 5 but probably the bigger difference in the ride field that I noticed with when I was running in both shoes at the same time or using them separately was that the redesigned heel bevel on the nol 5 does give it a slightly smoother feel for me as a heel Striker I find that the landing Zone just feels a little bit more natural and the shoe feels a little bit smaller as a result that these are big shoes with lots of foam on the foot they still got you know pretty big rear ends on both of these shoes but I find that I just tick over probably slightly more smoothly in the Nova blast 5 don't think you're getting a lot more life out of the shoe or anything like that in terms of bounce off the for foot or anything like that I think it's a bit softer don't think either shoe really gives you a load of responsiveness but what you do get is a smooth ride from that rocker and that does mean that it's quite easy to pick up the pace in them a little bit I would say especially as they are quite lightweight shoes given the high amount of cushioning here for me both of them would be used as daily Trainers for just relaxed runs easy runs long runs you can do you know some uptempo stuff in them they're just shoes I prefer for that but if you are more of a new Runner or someone who wants a nice cushion daily trainer to do everything in and both of them would fit the bill on that I think you're just getting a slightly softer ride with a no blast 5 and a slightly smoother one because of that redesign heel and then the other thing I noticed when I was running it at the same time is you got a slightly Slappy ride from the no blast 5 and that could be down to the new outso material which is meant to be a little bit softer haven't really noticed a great deal of difference in grip I think both of these shoes have been pretty good for grip on me I know no Blast has been pretty poor on that in the past no Blast 3 was a little bit slippery for me out of the box although it did improve over time on the grip front both of these have been fine for me running on wet Pavements even very slightly icy Pavements around here in the UK so don't think the grip's been a massive difference but I do think it's a less Slappy shoe than new one probably because they've changed their outside material a little bit so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I've done well over 50a in both now and I would say that beyond that kind of headline difference which lies with the midsole Foams there are some differences I think will dictate and influence the kind of experience you're going to get running in these shoes the first one for me is comfort and why don't you know these both these shoes are very comfortable shoes but I do think the over blast 5 is doing a little bit more on or in that department to offer that overall more comfortable feeling that's from the upper midsole and the outsole Departments the upper just feel a little bit more relaxed particularly the midf foot of the um shoe you're getting a midsole foam a midsole makeup that is a softer feeling one compared to the Nova blast 4 and you got an outsole which looks similar to the one on the Nova blast 4 but it definitely kind of contributes to that kind of more comfortable feeling you know that softer mid is spread across what I would say is a slightly larger surface area particularly the for foot of the shoe which again you know it means that Comfort is delivered from all departments and I think that's what I've really seen between the two shoes then you get into that midsole makeup where there are some differences here with the Nova blast 5 got the FF blast Max as I said spread what I think is across a kind of wider base I think what you get is something that you you know sink into a little bit you know compared to the Nova blast 4 it's very protective it feels very forgiving I think you know you roll through very nicely in the shoe just a very you know smooth shoe to run and kind of roll through in I think within Nova blast 4 you got the FF blast Eco plus which is firmer in comparison to the FF blast Max I think when you get that firmer feeling shoe you're getting something that is naturally more stable with that kind of firmer foam whereas I think there's a little bit more going on to deliver that stability on the kind of no blast 5 I think for me that the no blast 4 is geared towards running a little bit more Tempo in it that's kind of what I found I've had my nicer runs in it I think when I've tried to ease off in it and you can run a little bit easier in it I think that's where the geometry and the designs of these shoes come into play I think you've got this kind of chunky heel which works against you know being more comfortable at those easy recovery Paces where that's been lost on the NOA blast five where I think that's made it a nice isoe to just you know cover a lot more time in run it kind of easy to moderate Paces if you want to you know you know pair things back it feels easier and less awkward to do it in that shoe so for me I think they work for similar Paces I do think that when I've tried to run a little bit quicker it's felt nicer to do in the Nova blast or when I tried to ease off it's felt better to do that in the Nova blast 5 I think from an outside point of view you know no blast outside is not being the best you know that you can get on a daily Trainer shoe I think with an NOA blast four and the five I think you're going get something that's going to handle well and drive Pavements and Roads when it gets slightly wetter are they going to give you the best level of traction possibly not but I do think there's a bit more rubber you know here on the Nova blast 5 which I think is going to hold up better from a durability point of view and maybe handle you know longer runs in you know in this shoe compared to this shoe but I think yeah I don't think there's a huge amount in it from an outsole kind of point of view from a grip but I think more so maybe on the durability point of view so I've had a good experience in both of these shoes I would say though for me the Nova blast 4 probably gears or more to that more Up Tempo moderate Pace whereas the Nova Bloss five for me feels more comfortable with easy recovery Paces more kind of easy to moderate Paces I would say as opposed to really slow paces and that's where it felt more at home for me um so yeah two good Nova blast shoes for me very different Nova blast shoes from four to five okay so the Nova blast line is one that has seen a lot of development since it started a few years back and I was a massive fan of the original Nova blast and since then I've had um differing views on uh the shoes as they've been released novablast 4 um I I really like the shoe because um I wasn't a big fan of the no Blast 2 didn't really wasn't wasn't overly impressed by the Nova Blast 3 didn't tend to use it a lot it was fine but I just just better shoes out there for me for that sort of daily trainer all rounder thing um novast 4 actually came in with um the uh FF blast plus midell foam and um it just felt very different than nov Blast 3 it's just bit more responsive a little bit firmer a little bit better for running faster in and all in all a very impressive versatile shoe that really goes up there um again some some great shoes like the Haw ma range things like that um bit more cushion than those shoes but still a similar sort of daily shoe and you could use it for faster sessions you could use it for longer sessions you could use for easy runs um and it was a really good shoe for all of those different things it doesn't excel at easy runs but um it also doesn't excel at faster sessions it just sort of sits in the middle there as a very solid all round shoe that if you wanted one shoe and to do all your training in you could comfortably do it in this shoe um and it would do a really good job um and that's that's the good thing about no blast 4 it's just a great great value shoe that does a lot of different types of runs competently um but all in all if you go on holiday it's a great shoe to take on holiday if you if you're going to have to do some faster efforts and some slower efforts because it ticks off of those boxes and it's not that expensive when you can compare compare it with some of the other shoes out at the moment the Nova blast 5 comes in with this FF blast Max midell foone which is noticeably softer than what's in the Nova blast 4 um I love soft shoes I love cushioning I love bounce um so when I first took this out I really really liked the no blast 5 the first run video I actually said I think it might be the best NOA blast that's been released um since then I've used it for a few more runs I've used it for fire runs now so I'm up to about 55 60k in the shoe um and what I found is that it if you're going out for a nice easy run maybe a comfortable Pace when you're pushing yourself a little bit it feels very comfortable it feels very nice you get a little bit of bounce back from that Mido foam and all in all um I I felt like a shoe that I would prefer to the Nova blast 4 which is a little bit more um a little bit firmer in the mid sole which is not something that I normally go for in a shoe um but what I found out the no blast 5 is that over those runs I had a bit of a mixed experience with it sometimes I go in on a run with it uh and it feel really the ball really nice sometimes quite a when I was picking up the pace in it it felt like that Mido was just a little bit too soft and was a little bit sluggish it felt like I wasn't getting as much energy return back as I wanted to get from something like the level last four which is very good at giving you a nice level of responsiveness and energy return um from that slightly fir Midol um whereas the novast 5 just feels like it it dulls it a bit so sometimes you'll be running on a faster session and it just feels like it's not really helping you it's feeling comfortable um but it's not helping you get any end your return back or any responsiveness um so it's a shoe that really for me uh is much better at those easy runs um and if you're if you want something comfortable and um with plenty of padding in it it's a great shoe for that it just feel very comfortable it just when you're when you're actually want to maintain a good Pace or or pick up the pace for Interval or something it doesn't feel like a shoe that works really well for that that bounce doesn't seem to appear when you're when you're trying to run fast you don't seem to get a lot of that back from it but for easier sessions um it feels absolutely fine um and definitely a shoe that if you wanted a daily shoe and most of your runs were on the easy side or on the comfortable side of running this would be a fine shoe for it if you wanted to pick up the pace of bit then ner blast 4 is probably a better option for that but all in all I think it really comes down to that Mell foam um and the fact that it's just a little bit softer in the no blast 5 and as a result it does change the experience of the run and essentially makes it a different type of shoe uh as as opposed to sort of versatile daily trainer to a more easy run daily trainer which um you're probably not going to do many faster sessions in verdict then and these are both good daily trainings that will largely cover I think similar runs everything from slow and easy up to Tempo runs for sure maybe even some pickups and intervals if you don't mind doing those sort of faster efforts in a larg sh shoe that feels like more on the foot however they deliver that capability I think in a different way and ultimately how they deliver I think dictates which shoe might suit your running best if you like shoes that are softer and bouncier then I think the NOA blast 5 is your best bet if you like a ride that's a bit stiffer and a bit snappier and a bit more responsive a bit more immediate then I think the Nova blast 4 is probably the way to go now same for slow miles if you like your slow miles really soft the no blast 5 softer Edge probably makes it the better cushioned option the no blast 4 is still an impact eating got a cushion shoe in the gamut of all the shoes but there's a bit more firmness that some might not want on those easiest of easy runs or those longer longer slow miles now I think both Generations have Merit I get a similar performance similar runs covered they just deliver it a different way for the way I run and my preference for a Snappy a ferma ride I think the over blast 4 would probably be my first choice however overall you've got two good versatile dailies here that can eat most of your runs that you'd encounter when you're kind of pushing through training for a marathon some Runners might even be able to lace up either of these shoes for a marathon and racing them when you're looking for just reliable Comfort overall and at the price I would say these two shoes actually represent pretty good value too so I don't think you can go wrong with either just choose which ride you like best when it comes to the verdict I do prefer the aex nose blast 5 I think it's my favorite version of the shoe yet but I do think it's a fairly incremental Improvement on the nose blast 4 like I like the fact the rides a little bit smoother I like the little touch of extra softness you get with the shoe which for me hasn't made it mushy at all or anything like that it just gives you a slightly softer feel still the predominant feeling I get with the ride on both shoes is that rocker which is smooth and effective a little bit smoother on the newer shoe and that just means you can tick over quite nicely in it at a range of Paces but for both shoes I'd be sticking mostly to easy Paces so you know all things being equal the price being exactly the same I would probably pick the no blast 5 but given that no blast 4 is the older shoe I think it performs really well still I would probably look for a deal on it ahead and if it was even you know kind of5 10 pound cheaper I'd be happy to go for the no blast 4 over the nose blast 5 because I do think they excel in very similar ways honestly if there was actually just a color of the nose blast 4 that I much prefer to the the no blast 5 I'd get the no blast 4 because I do think it's quite similar in terms of performance and although I do think the no blast 5 is a better shoe I don't think there's that much in it you can use them both as comfortable daily trainers they do a good job and I think they perform at a fairly similar level so yeah no blast will be the one to get on value or even color like I say but no blast 5 is the shoe I prefer I do think it's the best no blast yet but but the improvements we've got here on the no blast 4 aren't enough to really make it a huge leap forward so for me if I had to pick between the Nova blast 4 or the Nova blast 5 I would be going for the Nova blast 4 which I can understand I'm probably in the minority here but what I can see from having running these two shoes now is that you know I like a Del train that has a little bit more of a versatile Edge to it I feel like the Nova blast 4 for me does have that compared to the Nova blast 5 which is a very good Nova blast and you know if you want a Nova blast shoe that's very comfortable and is going to be a good kind of comfortable long run shoe then absolutely does that but I think you know if I wanted something for with a slightly more uptempo Edge I think the no blast for give you that or has definitely given that to me in my time so for me personally I would be going for the Nova blast 4 this is a good Nova blast as well but I think that more versatile feeling I've got from the Nova blast 4 just edges it for me so my verdict on the Nova blast 5 and the Nova blast 4 is that they are quite different shoes now and we've seen this quite a lot with the Nova blast line they tend to make quite a lot of changes to each of the versions of the shoe which does change the experience quite a bit uh and doesn't always happen with shoe line sometimes they they've stick very much to what they they know works but with the nov sign they do tend to experiment a little bit with these shoes um so what I would say is that the major difference is that midell foam and I think it really comes down to the sort of running that you want to do no blast 4 is a very good versatile shoe for the price both these shoes are good shoes for the price um no blast 4 just has a little bit more responsiveness a little bit it's not the firmest midsole but it's definitely furmer than the no blast 5 bit more responsive definitely a shoe that if you're looking for one trainer to do lots of different type of types of running maybe you're training for a half marathon a marathon and you want a shoe to take off all of those sessions apart from maybe race day you could race in it but you probably wouldn't want it you probably W use a ray shoe for that um but it's a good shoe for all of that sort of stuff not the fastest shoe around there there's definitely shoes I would train in if I was going to do intervals over the no blast 4 but I don't mind using the no blast 4 for those same of easy days I wouldn't pick this shoe up for an easy day run because I've got loads of other easy day shoes but I don't mind wearing it for an easy day it's absolutely fine very comfortable plenty of cushioning in it no blast 5 softer not very good for faster sessions more for those easier runs uh where you're looking for for Comfort a bit more um Mido softness um and if it do you do get a bit of end return on the easier runs but on the faster sessions when you maybe hitting it the ground harder you don't really get as much back so I think it really comes down to the sort of shoe you want um because these are quite different shoes now but if I was to pick one of these toso shoes I'd say the no blast 4 is a better shoe just because it's more versatile I I prefer softer shoes but I do like this ride better I just find it to be just more enjoyable to running um especially if you're running at a nice consistent Pace um which for me would be probably 4 minute 50 km um so I definitely say no blast 4 is the superior out of these two shoes but if you really want to get an over blast and you really want a soft shoe that is nice for easy runs you don't care about versatility you might want to go for the overlast 5 just because that's where it sort of sits um but it's less versatile and um probably I probably wouldn't class it as a an all around a daily shoe I'd more class it as an easy day shoe now",

  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so Pegasus premium is an all new shoe for Nike that's going to sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus this is part of Nike's restructuring of its range of shoes into kind of three main silos which is the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers the Vero line which is a more cushioned comfortable shoes it's going to include the next generation of the Invincible and then the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus premium is coming in to sit at the top of the Pegasus line like I say it's coming out at the end of January next year and it's the most expensive shoe in the Pegasus range at \u00a3185 or $210 it's also the highest stack shoe I think I've ever seen from Nike standing 45 mm tall at the hill and 35 at the 4T for a 10 mm drop it's pretty hefty it's 328 G or 11.6 oz in my UK size 9 which is a US size 10 so you've got engineered mesh upper Fair bit of padding around the back of the shoe there and a pretty significant internal heel counter to add some support around there quite a fluffy tongue as well almost like a kind of duvet style material here Nike certainly not made a big effort to reduce weight on the upper it's fair to say then you've got a three layer mid soole which is you know the really interesting part of this shoe you've got top layer that is zoomx foam that's the bouncy peber based foam you see in shoes like the Zoom 6 and the Nike Racing shoes and indeed the Invincible then you have an Air Zoom unit running the length of the shoe now we've seen Air Zoom pods in quite a few Nike shoes like you can see them in the alphafly also been embedded into the midsole of shoes like the Pegasus but never seen a full length unit like this in a running shoe to provide a kind of responsive ride along the length of the shoe and then at the back of the shoe that kind of running to the midfoot you have a bottom layer of react ex foam which is a pretty balanced foam it's fairly durable fairly soft it's nothing special it's not as you know exciting as the foam's above it but is there probably to add a bit more stability and durability to the Pegasus premium then you got a waffle tread outsole which is mostly covered actually is good rubber coverage on the four and heel there you can see the bottom of the Air Zoom pod a little bit of exposed react X foam there but nothing too much and the sho's actually been pretty good for me on grip and durability so [Music] far so it comes to the fit of the Nike Pegasus premium I've got my normal size here which is a uk9 US 10 that's a size I've been using in Nike shoes for many years and all the other Pegasus shoes I've tested and it fits me very well in that size I've got enough room in the toe box good hold around the heel and midfoot it's pretty comfortable shoe with the amount of padding you have at the midfoot and back of the shoe there so yeah no concerns at all about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size and if you've ever used a pegasus shoe I would use that size in the Pegasus [Music] premium onto the run test then and I've run about 50k in the Nike Pegasus premium using it for a mix of daily training mostly pretty relaxed runs fairly long runs and then a easy to steady progression run as well to test it out with some faster Paces it's a pretty interesting shoe it's fair to say like I've tested all of the Pegasus shoes released this year and where the Pegasus plus feels like a pretty natural step up from the standard Pegasus 41 with a pretty similar design all around just with a better foam this feels like something completely different it's very much a shoe that I think is Nike's first attempt to really compete in the max stack daily trainer category you know got things like the Brooks Glycerin Max came out this year the Puma mag Max the hoker skywood X came out I think at the start of this year maybe even the back end of last year these are really big shoes lots of foam underfoot but they're not really designed to be very fast shoes or anything like that they're designed to give you a lot of comfort and a fun bouncy ride for your daily training and the rid is bouncy it's the bouncy as Pegasus I can say that for sure you do get a lot of energy return from the combination of Foams in this midsole I think the Air Zoom unit is the dominant thing that I feel on the run it gives a slightly firmer Edge to it than you get from something just like zoomx foam alone it does give you a lot of response especially under the foref foot that's really notable for me compared to the other Pegasus shoes and I've kind of running them at the same time and that kind of thing you do get a lot more lift and bounce off this forfeit in the Pegasus premium because there is such a high stack there for a Nike shoe you know in general Nike often does these kind 10 mm drop shoes and that means the for foot often sits a bit lower to the ground compared to other brands just because of the way you know a 10 mm drop would work unless you have a very high heel stack which you do have on the Pegasus premium which means you still have a lot of foam under the forefoot of the shoe that does give you a really bouncy feeling you know a very energetic feeling there however all those Foams in the midsole does make this a heavy shoe and you do feel the weight on the run like if you're going to try and run at any kind of speed you're going try and charge up a hill or anything like that it does drag a bit because it is a big shoe and it is a heavy shoe as a result the pxas premium doesn't really feel like a very versatile shoot for me it's one that just makes cruising along at easy Paces you know feel quite fun because it is bouncy and everything like that and you do get an enjoyable ride but it's not one that you then really want to lift the pace in I was doing that easy to steady progression run in today like you can run in it at speed you are getting a lot of bounce back but the tradeoff you know bounce to weight just isn't quite tuned to my preferences anyway like Nike's done this quite a lot in the past actually it often feels to me that they put everything into creating a bounce issue some like the alphafly 2 for example like it was a pretty heavy Super Shoe but put a lot of Bounce in there and the trade-off I think was almost balanced there I think I did enjoy the outfly 2 as a racing shoe but here it just feels like there's a bit too much weight for even all these bouncing materials in the mids cell to make up for so it does work as a cruiser for kind of relaxed daily runs but there's a lot of tech and Foams and stuff going into that to create a shoes through that when there's a lot of those around really and then beyond that I think the bigger problem in the way is probably the instability in the shoe so you've got a really narrow pinch point at the mid foot of the shoe and when you look at these Max stack shoes that are built for daily training things like the Hocus skyex you know the glycerin Max they have really wide bases even something like the super Blast 2 has a much wider base than the Nike Pegasus premium and that's done to create a more stable ride when you've got a really big High stack of foam here so I do feel that this is an unstable shoe you can feel yourself rolling inwards a bit I'm a neutral Runner and you know it's fine for me I didn't have any real problems with it on the run but if you do pronate at all I would be certainly ster clear of this shoe and I was coming back from a twisted ankle during my testing of the shoe and it was one that I just basically didn't want to get back into for a while because lot of cambered Pavements around me like you know lot of broken Pavements and it's the kind of isoe where you can land on the wrong spot and it's going to turn you a bit more than other shoes because it does have that narrow pinch point and it just feels like an odd design choice to me obviously they did did make it a lot wider it would be even heavier and you that's going to be even more of a problem so it's a hard one to do but we got all these Foams in the midsole the weights added up you haven't got that wide base for extra support and even if you are a neutral Runner like if I'm going to go and cruise around in a Max stack shoe for my easy training as a neutral Runner I probably still want the width there the extra base that extra support because you know I don't want to have any kind of instability or twist an ankle or anything like that it just feels like a bit of a worry here especially if you are like me someone who often runs on you just normal Pavements which often aren't pristine and flat you often have to dodge around people and there are like little cers and stuff like that so at the same time I was testing the shoe I was testing the ASX over blast 5 for example which is also a pretty high stack shoe comes in a lot lighter though and it has a wider base and it was a shoe I was able to run in very comfortably as I was coming back from twisted ankle without really worrying about that at all so overall it kind of just ends up falling into a roll I don't quite understand the Pegasus premium it's fair to say like it has got a bouncy ride now at a very simple level it's a pretty fun shoe to run in but then the more you run in it the more kind of these little concerns arise and just means to shoe that I'm not really sure exactly what it would do for me because I don't really want to go and bounce around loads of easy runs in it because it isn't the most stable shoe and it is fairly heavy even for long runs at easy Paces I don't really want to use it for those faster runs because like I said pretty heavy shoe not the most versatile so yeah it was pretty fun to run in but not sure I quite get [Music] it so my verdict on Nike Pegasus premium it's an interesting shoe it was a fun shoe to run in nik's had a lot of fun putting all this Tech into a shoe and it' be interesting to see where this Tech ends up in other shoes in the future but unlike the other two Pegasus shoes in the range which I think are really good Workhorse daily Trainers for those who like traditional ride with that 10 mm drop they do a really good job this feels like a shoe I don't really get like I said in the run test I'm not exactly sure we pick it up like if you have a lot of money you want to buy a pretty interesting shoe a shoe that's quite fun for certain types of runs you can do that job but when you're looking at building an effective running shoe rotation it's not one that I'd really better slip in myself some might find the ride just much more enjoyable me of course like you know it's a fun ride I enjoyed it but some might find it really fun and in which case it's worth spending the money just to have that really energetic feeling under foot and you know bounce through some daily training in a really fun way and you get a pretty cool looking shoe as well this will certainly have some appeal as a crossover shoe bit like the ultra Boost from mes which is shoe you can wear around town enjoy wearing It's a good-looking shoe and then do some running in because you know it is a good running shoe like I enjoyed running in it it's not just one of those shoes it's a lifestyle shoe I we get comments like that all the time but no this is a running shoe and it's a shoe I enjoyed running in but I think it's a shoe that probably needs to add value in some other way to really make it worth picking up and if for you that is you love the look you love using it as a casual shoe as well great you've also got a pretty good running shoe here as well you look at the price of the Pegasus premium though it isn't hard to think of running shoes that I'd recommend getting ahead of it within Nike's range I mean immediately the other two Pegasus shoes like I said I have done some runs wearing the Pegasus premium on one foot and then the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus Plus on the other and they just they feel like you know better running shoes like the Pegasus Plus in particular is lighter got that zumex midso gives you a nice bit of a poppy ride and while those shoes are certainly thinner under the forefoot and feel a bit flat under the forefoot compared to the bounce you get from the Pegasus premium all around they're a bit more enjoyable to run in I think and Pegasus 41 being a good Workhorse Cruiser cushion shoe and the Pegasus plus being you know more versatile shoe all round both a bit more stable as well then Nike also has the zoom fly 6 in its range which is cheaper and one of my favorite shoes of the year you've got a really good combo of materials in there with the zoom X foam there carbon plate in there as well really fun versatile shoe great for Speed workor great for easy runs more stable than the Pegasus premium just a lot more fun to run in and a bit cheaper so that would be a really good alternative if you are looking for you know a proper super trainer and you don't mind training with the plate and then if you are looking around these other Max cushion shoes I think the hoker skyw X and the Brooks Glycerin Max are both kind of better shoes in this category of maxed out shoes with loads of stuff going on in the midell that are just a bit more fun to run in for your daily training like they're both a little bit lighter I think the Hocus SC X is a bit more bouncy bit more fun they're both more stable they both just seem a bit better suited to the type of runs you'd be using them for whereas like I said the Pegasus premium has that instability problem for a shoe with a high stack that like if you're going to have that quite narrow design at the bottom there you want it to be in a shoe that you're going to use for Speed work because you're less concerned about stability I think if you're going going to go and pick up a shoe you're going to use for some fast running and I really wouldn't use the Pegasus premium for that myself just cuz it's weight and overall design doesn't really lend itself to fast running for me some other shoes you can look at as well it's obviously the Astic super Blast 2 which is cheaper than this shoe in the US which is you know wild to me that's a much lighter much more responsive much more versatile shoe all around definitely what I'd pick up ahead of the Pegasus premium as a shoe you'd be using for any kind of run really the Puma mag Max Nitro I'm not a huge fan of myself I didn't really get on with I actually prefer running in the Nike Pegasus premium but you know again that does have a wider design that I think lends itself better to regular training then there's also the Muno NE Vista if you just looking for a really fun and bouncy ride that's got a plate in it it's a lot cheaper though but it's again a lot lighter a lot more fun to run in in general also you know very high stack height similar to the Nike new balance ballos as well now that's a really fun shoe like with a big rocker soft foam loads of Bounce you know it's quite expensive but this is also very expensive and I think that's a more fun shoe to do General daily training runs in as well so I did enjoy some runs in the Pegasus premium I did find it pretty fun and bouncy shoe and a pretty interesting shoe I think there are a few problems here that make it a hard shoe to recommend like I think it is too heavy it's not that versatile and I think that has that narrow pinch point that makes it less well suited for kind of General cruising especially you have any kind of stability concerns I really wouldn't be looking at the shoe but even if don't I'd rather been a shoe with a slightly more stable base myself it's not hard to find those shoes that are also a lot lighter cheaper you know equally energetic and all that kind of things there's just too many good shoes on the market for me to really say this is a standout if you love The look you're going to get a pretty decent running shoe as well if you're going to use it for casual use but overall I'd say the other Pegasus shoes are better buys or indeed the zoomfly 6 though I will be interested to see what happens with all this Tech in the future of Nike [Music] shoes have review of the Nike

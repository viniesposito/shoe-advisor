  "text": "[Music] Nike has just launched the second generation zigama with a few big changes that will hopefully solve the issues that many people face with version one I've just put 100 miles through this pair here to see if Nike have finally solved their outso issues that have played a lot of their recent trail shoes so coming up we've got all my likes my dislikes and there's a few so stay tuned for that and to see if this shoe is going to be going into my rotation and of course like everything on this channel I've bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you my complete complely honest impartial unsponsored thoughts on this shoe to make sure that you get the right shoes on your feet if you're running right let's get stuck into this review and get the zigama 2 done so the big update from version one which is here to version two is this all new Vibram outsole the grip on version one was really truly terrible especially in the wet and the dry it was okay but the wet was just a disaster so now we've got this updated Vibram Mega grip out soole that Nike put in the shoe they' also the upper a little bit and just tided a few little things up made a little bit more aerodynamic and they've got a little bit more of a rocker on the front here as well versus the outgoing model not any big updates up top the big update everyone's talking about is that outso right let's have a chat about all of the facts and figures starting out the purpose of a shoe like the zigama 2 this is very much a longdistance cruisy trail shoe built for Comfort terms of price wise this sent me back \u00a3160 buying this off the sport shoes website site here in the UK it's going to be around about $180 or \u20ac180 stack card at the back Nike is so good they love telling us all these figures well they really don't it's hard to find out but we're thinking around about 36 mil stack at the back and around about a 4 mm drop overall in terms of weight for me this is coming at 389 G in my UK size 12 the outgo model 387 so 2 G basically exactly the same as the outgoing model it's a neutral shoe the upper of the shoe this engineer mesh upper hopefully getting a nice amount of breathability through there we'll come on to that later on in the review the midsole of the shoe we've got Nike's Flag ship zoomx sort of wrapped up in a carrier foam to protect it out of those Trail so super squishy super bouncy very responsive and now zig's finally joined ultrafly Nike sort of Flagship carbon plated Trail shoe to have that Mega grip out soole Unfortunately they haven't put it in the Nike Pegasus Trail 5 which we'll be reviewing soon on the channel but yeah the zigama and the ultra have this fantastic grip on the bottom there are no different widths available terms of colors we've got two at launch here in the UK and five in the US rather bizarrely they're all very light colors so a lot of people like some darker colors when they're running on the trail cuz they get muddy and everything bit odd and finally this was true to size for me in my UK size 12 exactly the same size as I had in the outgoing model quickly guys if you are find this video so please smash that like button share it with a friend and let us know your thoughts down in the comments Below on what you think about Nike cigar you are you interested in it are you going to be giving it a go or could you recommend some other options out there to help out the community and if you got time please check out my website benp parks.com that would be really fantastic where we make the best running hats and Technical gear in the business thanks very much guys right back to the video so starting out with my likes the first one is this outsole that Nike put this vibrant Mega grip the wet grip the dry grip the allaround traction in the shoe is night and day better than the outgoing model on mud rocks wet Dr it all past with flying colors as I said I've done 100 miles in this shoe I've barely slipped at all my second like with the shoe is just the stability and it's just got such a smooth ride through the footstrike I think a lot of that's probably coming from this outsole it just gives a lot more rigidity there's a lot less chance of rolling your ankle just a lot less of this sideways movement you get with a shoe compared to the outgo model which just will move a lot more so in corners and changing direction it really handles it very well love this sort of increase rocker we've got at the front here so when you are running on Tac sort of as a more of a road to Trail shoe you can run in much more of a natural way as well so it really gives you a lot of confidence when you're out there with that grip and that stability as well my third like the reason I really like the originals of gar was it super comfortable that Comfort remains here it is still super comfortable and you've got so much cushioning to protect your feet when you're out on the trail yes it's a high stack shoe it's not going to be for everybody but if you're looking for that super soft super comfortable just running over rocks and everything in your path without really even feeling them or noticing them then you're really going to like running in the shoe and this is what the shoe looks like after 100 miles of running it's really got very little we on there so far so durability with this is really going to be fantastic and I'm expecting to get a lot of miles out of this the ankle Gator at the back for me it's kept all the little rocks out and I personally didn't have any heel slip issues in the shoe at all and we'll touch on that a little bit in the negatives coming up so with that let's get stuck into the negatives the first one being it's still quite a big heavy clunky shoe but at least there hasn't been any weight gain with this one they also do run a little bit hot I've been running in in quite hot conditions it's coming into the summer my feet have been getting a little bit warm in this shoe as I've been running along hasn't caused any issues but if you are in a particularly hot climate you may get some overheating issues in the shoe my second is like is surprisingly a little bit on the narrow side now I did quite a long RAC in the shoe at the weekend the new upper just seems to have a lot less depth to it and when I took my feet out at the end my feet were so scrunched up sorry I haven't got any fidget this my feet look disgusting my feet were so sort of scrunched up and I actually did have a couple of small blisters starting to form just because it felt a little bit on the narrow side they look very similar to the outgo model never had any issues in that it just has a little less material up the front here and the feat just haven't got as much room to spread out and breathe up at the front it's a real shame at the moment there's no wide option with the shoe because that would be a really good one to go for if you have got some wider feet I really think it's it's one to avoid but on my shorter training runs had no issues at all like that it was just when I was going out for a super long time feet were getting a bit swelled up towards the end of a very long day out on the trails and my final dislike is the laces are just bizarrely quite short so if you are someone that has some ankle slip issues it's going to be really quite hard to do that heel lock lacing I did manage to do it as you can see the footage here now and one thing the outgo model had was a half decentish toe bumper at the front so if you stab any rocks or trees you hit that that seems to have disappeared off this one now I did have quite a bad fall in the sure I just hit a tree route as you can see I've got a little bit of damage on my arm here and and on the knee if you can see that but I didn't hurt myself in any way but yeah just the end of my end of my feet were just a little bit sore from that would be nice to have had a proper toe bumper on there for when we are heading out some more technical Trails especially in the mountains when you get a lot more rocks and things so in conclusion let's bring this all together who should be looking for a shoe like this there someone that's looking for that long distance cruisy shoe that screams all day comfort so long as your feet aren't too wide and there now going to have the confidence that it can run in all different weathers and conditions with this fantastic updated outsole if you're looking for a lightweight Nimble shoe then this one really isn't for you if you as I say if you have got a slightly wider foot you are going to struggle with this if you were a big fan of the zigama 1 are you going to like this I think very much yes the updates of the outsole are really really good so will this be going to my rotation W definitely yes I'm going to be enjoy doing a lot more training Mars in this over the summer if I had another race say next week would I be reaching for I don't think I would I think I'd be going back to my version one because it's just got that slightly wider feeling up at the front but I'm going to enjoy putting some more testing miles through this to see if that was a bit of a weird oneoff in that race or whether we have really got that slightly narrower toe box in the shoe as I've experienced if you do go for a pair make sure you test them out really well indoors before heading outside just make sure you're getting a good lock down no sort of heel slip and yeah just see how that front of the shoe feels but overall fantastic update on the bottom next up we're going to be testing Killian all new Tamir version 2 from New Normal some massive vibrant Mega grip lugs on the bottom of that one so going to be really looking forward to testing that one out next up we've got Nike's whole Trail lineup if you want to check out some other Nike Trail shoes then check that video coming up here now that's it guys let me know your thoughts down below keep on working hard keep on get done we'll see you very soon in the next one",

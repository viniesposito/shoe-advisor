out the Thanksgiving it's day one of a detox too much trip toan oh you're oh I see first day at AA huh yeah just kidding sheesh um not by the way if anyone is it their first day in AA you got this yeah what do they people do that what their first first day uh no like this is the time of year where people start making like and like resolutions and I no we still got like a month for that to happen I think you start I think that one year when I stopped drinking for a few months I did it in December and it was hard but I feel like you just got to rip the Band-Aid off just cuz otherwise if you're like I wait until January then all of a sudden January's here and you're like just like yeah or you're just it's too almost too easy to wait till January everyone's doing it you want to get it over with yeah like Robbie and I are both starting something new this week he's starting tonight yeah wait you are you gonna take a before photo oh I I mean I feel like you have to do it just do it you don't have to share it just do I have a pair of tracksmith briefs do I do I purposely slouch and stick my stomach out to make it look as fat no I say try to look as good as possible CU you'll be like I thought I look good okay and then a year from now you'll be like damn okay yeah that's assuming I would do this for a year yeah are you not committing no I am committing in my mind don't you have to like sign up for a year or is it month to month I think it's like obviously there's a discount if you do it for I think six months is probably will probably be the go-to so I'll do six months I'm gonna I'm GNA say a year like I kind of did that push-ups I'm still doing the push-ups yeah but I like I'm going to do a year of 30 push-ups every day okay and again I started that in December or something before yeah the New Year's like once I decide might as well just do it no that's good we're doing a different kind of we'll commit to a year we're oh yeah we're doing uh I guess we talked about a little bit in on past podcast we won't it involves weights yeah and lifting them and not LIF not lifting cans of beer yeah unfortunately I don't even like beer i' I've learned that about myself I'm not a beer guy yeah it does make you feel kind of bloated and stuff and just generally I used to I mean I still feel like I prefer beer though but I guess like we went to Top Golf yeah and I had beers there for for Thanksgiving or the day after the day after Thanksgiving I went with uh my brother-in-law Ryan yeah who plays golf right and you could tell like when we went but you used to play golf a lot dude I suck so bad you don't have the muscle memory uh like it's not like here was the crazy thing so it h not really um or maybe I just rode a bike really crappily before and yes I still did too but uh I have seen you ride a scooter it's often involves you wrecking it yeah um so it what was kind of fun was there's games at Top Golf so we had all these different games yeah and it was myself Rob James who used to be your neighbor uh Ryan Theo and Henry yeah and I was able to come in second place on every challenge that they had but I only came in second place because the other people we're so bad bad okay I mean that's a win but we did we did beat Ryan in one game yeah this is your brother that he's the brother-in-law Megan's brother who who plays golf on the regular yeah that's good to know well I still think we should do a pram with uh like us and people in the running industry that golf we've talked about this with Joe Rubio from running Warehouse because he always golfs with Craig Engles he's a the pro at something or was and then we're amateurs at pretty much everything in life so I feel like we need to make that happen at some point that's pretty much what's happening to me you brought up the amateur thing yeah I'm hitting the stage in my life where I'm like you always thought you'd Master something I've never quite mastered anything I'm like pretty mediocre across the board yeah and I'm like okay this is me yeah well I mean jack of all trades master of none that's always a compliment I think it's not a compliment that doesn't feel like one yeah isn't a jack a good job to have though like being Court Jester I don't know the Jack and the jester are the same thing I knew this was going to happen I thought a Jack and the jester in the cards was I thought no The Joker Is the jester yeah what is a Jack Jack is like the guy who's probably sleeping with the queen but they don't oh he's just a scoundrel yeah I think he's a scoundrel I thought he was like a friend of like he was a also worked in the same Department as the jester but I guess that's not or he could be like the prince maybe oh Jack Queen I don't know okay Megan is getting pushed out of her chair by Ralphie right now I knew this was gonna happen I maybe maybe we should stop bringing rfie in on podcast days it's a little chaotic um so speaking of J speaking of Jax I didn't really have a transition there but I thought I'd did um you're off the translation didn't go to a casino this weekend but we did gamble oh yeah there we go I knew there's some gambling I did this past week so Robbie texts me which he knew he was fishing with dynamite at this point cuz it's over the holidays there's football on the TV he sends me this link to DraftKings to play which I didn't even really know how it worked there I'm pretty sure there are rules that's or an explanation I knew I knew that you were allotted an amount of money and each player was yeah so the idea was that you pick a fantasy team just of the players playing on Thanksgiving Day yeah so there's eight teams playing that day or whatever six teams and you have so much M money to spend on a salary or whatever yeah and then you can use that for the players did you not spend all your money I did oh did you all of it yeah I at least knew that part okay but I just I you know I kind of just picked whoever I felt like and anyway I was almost dead last in the competition and Robbie won of course yeah I mean it was a good day I have to say that so it was a nice nice little come up for 150 bucks on Thanksgiving Day and then fantasy football oh I was projected to win the entire time yeah like even up until like Midway through the Ravens game I was still like 80% chance of winning I was at 1 Point 90% chance of winning I was playing Thomas's team this week just so you know and I don't know what happened but like I went from 99% chance of winning to losing to Robbie yeah sorry my team only scored 85 points it was pretty bad and Robbie's didn't even clear 100 no pretty the ugliest yeah all around bad poor performances on the fantasy front from the newberger SL Murray crowd it's okay we all made the playoffs so we're good yeah did we fantasy yeah yeah yeah I still have a scratch off in my pocket that I bought on Saturday that I haven't even done yet you could be a millionaire I know we were we were heading up to the Penn State game for me and with some friends and you know feeling good dude that looked horrible looked very cold it was it was cold it was like 24 windy yeah no thank you you were out there the whole time oh I went full full winter gear I had three like three layers on plus a winter coaters uh I did but I had those car heart mittens that I like the best yeah double socks these Hoka sleeping bag boots Hoka what I forget what they're called but I think sleeping bag boots yeah I was I was actually feeling pretty nice and those new balance sheet pants remember those pants yeah I saw I saw you I saw your gear the it I'm telling you I went to one of the Ravens games where it was cold like that and the beer you can't even drink like it's not enjoyable like yeah well what we did I mean we kind of togate for a little bit through the pig skin around so that warmed you up and then we uh and then we went into the stadium and we sat down for maybe half of the first quarter and then we were just like let's just walk around so that kept the blood flowing but yeah it was it was pretty cold the most exciting part of the day was we were we were like on the upper deck too so it was crazy up there but the most exciting part was sometimes the napkins will fly away they would they you you would they would go on forever and you could bet on which one went the further this was the most exciting part of the game I mean it was a blowout the the game was a blowout 317 by I got to say if I was at that game I probably would have been all into the napkin Bing you know what I'm talking about if you see napkins flying from the top of the stadium see how far out they travel there's a lot of action to be had I would be into that yeah more so than Penn State sound like a degenerate Gambler I don't even yeah it's anyways so uh that was but before that you did uh didn't you do a turkey oh Turkey Trot yeah how that go did you guys do one no oh we ran we ran yeah okay it was awesome uh for those listening and those who asked Nick bear did not show up I think he's a little intimidated gotta say definitely I mean I've been talking this up for a while and I'm sure somebody floberg relay it to him and he's decided to step down last minute uh either that or it was the uh the rain it was raining rain here too it was really awful so I don't think he wanted to go one more I think he went to go zero um Ralphie you're crazy and uh the um so it ended up was like 40 and rainy there's two waves so I did the 8:00 wave and my family came to do the 9:00 did you do both I did yeah so the first one I went out and honestly it felt pretty good I just didn't like I didn't even look at my watch I was just like I'm just going to go hard keep within range and uh and you wore the adios Pro 4 yeah the adios Pro 4 which turned out to be I love that shoe I mean I did too like I know the toe box we've seen a lot of bloody to bloody toes I think it's just a little shallow and a little short basically yeah so it ended up we we got uh I just felt good and even the last mile was uphill and it was my fastest mile so I did like splits of basically 634 634 4 628 and uh been just strong which I can't believe that's still like a 20 over 20 minute what is it what do you have to run to be sub 20 like 62 or like 6 uh well the course was also like a tenth of a mile long at least and so official time was 2055 so it probably it was on point like everyone had that on their watches like it's 3.2 miles so I mean there's NE it's never well I mean a 5k is usually pretty pretty straight like turkey trots are all over the lot yeah the crazy thing is is that the last part of it is a straightaway so it's like you just need to move the line up a little bit um no it's probably measured correctly I don't know some people have 3.25 but I feel like it could but if you're weaving in between kids and turkeys and yeah turkeys yeah it's a turkey trbe anyways but the um what was I gonna say did you win any awards I wasn't I was third in my I think I was third in my age group so one of the guys I I met someone who like was a believe in the Run fan he watched the YouTube videos and saw us so I was talking to him he beat me by like 30 seconds he was crazy fast and so we ended up talking and then I did a I did a long run the next day and he came out with me and some other people and he was a cool dude and he lost he said he used to weigh like 325 and I think he lost like 100 lb so he's like an obber dude like he he was Trucking he he crushed me and uh anyway so I think that maybe is it possible that if you had all that extra strain on your heart yeah that once you loosen it up you have this really strong pumping mechanism that's what I was we were talking about cuz I was saying how our friend and reviewer John Uber has his heart rate is always so low and he said the same thing he said said his heart rate's always crazy low and his resting heart rate's like 32 or something so maybe we're doing it wrong maybe we should all get super heavy yeah for and then five years yeah and then lose that weight it'd be like elevation training I mean in a way you're not wrong but that doesn't sound I don't know if that's scientific yeah anyways so that was cool and so my brother ran the 9:00 a.m.",

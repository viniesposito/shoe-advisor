  "text": "hi this is Thomas with believeing the run I'm back here with gon who we've spent a lot of time with over the years now this is probably at least our second time doing this at the running event even more even more and today we're talking about the aeroglide 3 and right off the bat you handed it to me and I notice that this foam feels a little bit different feels like a nitrogen infused foam it is a TPU but yeah I mean it's it's a new super foam that we have uh in the in the range uh called energy from Evo so it's going to be a game changer for for for us on the on the full range and yeah like we're about to talk about it is it is it nitrogen infused or is it just regular it is it is the it's another process we have steam water uh and TPU and we reached a super critical State oh so it's similar but just a different technique all right great it feels nice and light all right the upper even looks completely different can you kind of walk me through the shoe definitely so versus the arog 2 we improve pretty much all the different components on this shoes so first and foremost the the form of course we have a better form and more of it so from 37 mm stack height we go up to 40 now drop 8 mm so 40 32 uh and then massive work on all the geometry to make it more enjoyable to run from Easy recovery distance but also to Tempo because I'm going to talk about it this shoe is insane the the concept is called Dynamic comfort so Comfort we have a softer material under your foot and we also take that box thanks to genuine uh upper Construction and you know what like this shoe is the first one featuring a full Inside Out concept so pretty much all the the components that are supposed to be inside or now outside meaning like for example uh the toe the toe box there is no toe box in this one it's this TPU place a piece outside of the shoe that is going to play that role so like overlay of the old days exactly but but the interior is completely seamless okay and this that's Comfort it is Comfort absolutely and inspiration was a Formula 1 glove where all the stitches are placed outside of the shoe so that the interior is completely seamless and comfortable so that the driver can be as one with the steer wheel yeah all right so this shoe like you said was originally built off of the Comfort feeling for daily miles training still maintains it sounds like it's maybe a little faster a little more energetic yeah so this is I I talked a lot about the Comfort part because most people want Comfort I guess but dynamism this is the way how we're going to differentiate and through the weight mainly this shoe is only 245 Gam this is 8.6 o considering the sty heite I think that might be the lightest shoe in this category and this is really something we wanted to reach yet we don't sacrifice an ounce of durability the shoe is extremely durable and what's the price on this so $ 160 $160 I think yeah Val for Price across the board euros and dollars that's nice all right so is this I remember last time we had some complimentary shoes in the trail as well for the AOG Glide I know Taylor is going to cover some of the trail shoes but is this transfer over to the trail side as well it is so the the the technology yes on Pulsar we we're going to have the same form platform but uh most interesting is that we transfer that to gravel a new segment for us you will you will have an AOG grade three gravel coming in March uh sorry in May 25 and when does this one come out so this one will be launched in May 20 uh sorry I can do that again so you going to have the road version launched in March 25 so Arrow 3 and then in may we we will come with very interesting product which is aade 3 gravel using the same super super critical foil and yeah a new experience Offroad as well awesome I noticed that you're doing gravel shoes now what was the demand for that was it like a road to Trail like why are we going into gravel yeah exactly I think gravel we we see many small signals coming from the the cycling industry for example that is I think very ahead and with people that are very picky when it comes to to all the gears and uh a lot of people I mean we are tra company we we are raising and and we we live in the Alps very privileged environment from my point of view but not everyone lives in such environments and you can be looking forward to run on on Offroad uh if you live in Paris in in New York or somewhere else in the world and gravel is very interesting uh answer to those people who want to run afro for many reasons uh and they want the same comfort and the same field and their Road running shoe but just some extended features to tackle this slightly more challenging terrain and this is where we come with gravel uh it's going to we started the story in 24 and then 25 is the moment where we deploy the full range with two new models Arrow GL three gravel and the blaze that is the little sister lowest stack height but still like very full performance package yeah all right awesome thanks so much cool thanks",

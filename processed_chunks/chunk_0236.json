  "text": "hey this is Robbie with believe in run and we are here live from the running event last meeting of the running event we're feeling it the end is INS sight but we saved the best for last we got too athletic I'm here with Russ from toppo athletic Russ good to be back feel like this is a yearly Tradition at this point so yeah it's a nice annual last meeting of the show it feels like a good way to cap off well it's been a really fun couple days in Austin we're both losing our minds we're not sure it's kind of like being inside a casino here yeah there's no clock the wall they pumping oxygen yeah we don't know where we are you can drink at 9:00 a.m. it's like acceptable uhhuh depends what Booth you're at yeah so where's the ashtray at I anyways all right so let's get on to previewing some of the 2025 lineup why don't we kick it off here we got the tole athletic Aura why don't you give me a rundown sure so the aura is a brand new product coming from toppo athletic that's going to be launching in January so just a couple months away this is a product that's going to be our Max cushion uh stability shoe within our line so it'll have the same stack height as at with that 38 to 33 mm midsole platform so tied for the highest within our road line but it's going to feature our unique YF frame posting system which is both on the medial side and the lateral side of the shoe so that's just a firmer bit of foam uh embedded within the rest of the midsole okay this y frame is meant to cradle the foot and especially cradle the heel and just keep you centered right over in the platform nice we think that this is a product that's going to appeal to that customer looking for a Max cushion shoe for their running but also really appeal to the person that's looking for for a great walking shoe and a Comfort shoe option sure for uh spending time on their feet okay nice so combination walking running shoe mhm looks good feels good kind of and I got to say too athletic ERS you always nail it I can tell this is going to be pretty comfortable on the foot so yeah what's um what's the weight on it do you have so in a men's n it's going to come in right around 10.9 o um it'll retail for 165 okay and you said January right January exactly okay cool yeah coming up soon very cool all right so coming right out of the gate with a new model why don't we go next to a not old model but a model that's been around for oh you want to do that one all right oh we're getting into the the exciting stuff all right all right let's buckle up this is uh the so this is the Cyclone Cyclone 3 Cyclone 2 one of uh our favorite shoes of 20123 that was a just lightweight really up Tempo Fast Fun it just felt like a great running shoe sometimes it's hard to find those these days just a simple No Nonsense running shoe you got that paback midsole and the uh and the lightweight air mesh upper and uh I'm walking I'm doing the whole walk through for you and anyways I it doesn't look like a lot has changed ex you tell why don't you tell me what has so like you said the Cyclone 2 was really well received by our customers as well as a lot of reviewers like like yourself I know you really like this shoe so we didn't want to reinvent the wheel with this update so we've kept the same mids outsole platform on the shoe the same 28 to 23 mm platform same pbox formulation all the way through the shoe um what's really changed here is the upper we wanted to just create an upper that would secure the foot that much more over the platform so that when you were kind of cornering quickly in the shoe or you know doing a track workout or something like that that mood foot would be even more secure the 4 foot hasn't really changed it's just that we added a bit more material um to the midfoot of the mesh to deliver that that kind of more locked in fit I got to say the only I feel like the only negative I had about the cycl 2 was what you're talking about is that cornering or you know it could get a little come out over the edge a little bit of uh the upper could move a little bit on that so it's good to see that there's a little bit more more structure to make sure you're locked in over the midsole and it is by the way what's the weight on this again so this is coming right around 6.9 o in a men's 9 or around 5.5 in a women's 7 super light um still retails for 150 and it's going to come out in February all right and so reminder this is uh again one of the I thought one of the most underrated shoes if you're not onto this shoe you need to be onto it you got the paback full paback midsole lightweight package fast and light just a fantastic shoe all around and you got a nice rub brow to too yeah sweet all right let's move on all right we got the uh Phantom 4 here right so this is Phantom is more of your daily trainer kind of reliable shoe so why don't you give me some details on what's changed from the version three yeah so like you said the Phantom 4 I'm sorry Phantom is kind of our uh High cushion neutral daily trainer within our line that Workhorse daily trainer it's actually the most popular shoe in our line for either Road or trail from a sales perspective yeah um this new version is going to feature just a little bit more stock height in the midsole so it's gone up 2 mm to a 35 to 30 mm midsole platform we've also updated the density of the foam or the therometer of the foam so it's a little softer little softer zip foam just a bit more rebound underfoot um a bit more Comfort we've also updated the outsole to kind of segment the Rubber and the heel of the shoe allowing for kind of a softer Landing a little bit more um flexibility within the heel and then have almost full rubber coverage in the forefoot for a more stable toe off yeah um and that that rubber just adds rigidity to really create that Poppy Snappy ride that you're looking for when you're when you're towing off and daily training nice and you're going to get a lot of miles out of the shoe I could feel like just from the Rubber and the mids soole for sure yeah this like like we said it's going to be that daily Trainer shoe um a great option for your long runs recovery days and daily miles this should be that kind of Workhorse go-to shoe within your rotation nice um and what's the price point on this so this is going to be 145 and it's going to be coming out in May in May all right so those are the three Road models I feel like um yeah again some exciting stuff and by the way Cyclone 3 looking great if you haven't been onto the Spectre 2 from 2024 you might want to check that out that's that's like a maxed out Cyclone I would say yeah yeah so while Cyclone's going to be more for that person looking for a more moderate stack heite I like to use that like I said for my track workouts for my shorter Tempo runs things like that Cyclone's going to be that that more High stack version spect I'm sorry yeah spect last last last day uh Spectre is going to be that high stock height option um you get 9 more mm of foam Under Foot compared to Cyclone better for your faster long runs um longer uptempo days but that Sho is still super late super late yeah yeah coming in right around like 8 8.1 o in a men's size 9 so super light I used it to race a marathon oh ni couple months ago so I I love that shoe very cool all right well Russ thanks for walking me through the road shoe we're going to have Taylor come in in just a second and do the trail shoes that's going to be a different video so stick around for that thanks so much",

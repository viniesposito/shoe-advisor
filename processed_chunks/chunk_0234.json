  "text": "all right hi this is Meg with believing the run and today I'm at the A6 booth at the running event with Paul Paul Lang Paul what's your title uh senior Global product manager performance running okay that feels shorter than I think it actually is but uh we are going to chat about the new Nimbus 27 yeah let's do it so first of all what are the updates so this has always been the queen of cushion for us so for this version we're going to give you a little bit more cush but it's deceptive so you still see that FF blast Eco label right there yeah it's not the same foam as it was last time even though it has the same name so it's a new recipe we talked about it on the Pod you know all the Foams are kind of like baking a cookie we rebake this one and so it's the same weight that we were in the previous version but we've got two extra millimet of Stack under the foot so it's a lighter weight formulation we're giving you more cushion at the same weight you know I like more Stacks so that's going to make me happy know to the moon so what is the what's the actual height in the heel here so the rear foot is going to be 43 1/2 and then we're offset at 8 so we go down to 35 1/2 in the 4ot okay so new formulation feel similar what are like the main differences yeah so the goal was we didn't want it to be any heavier but we wanted to see if we give a little bit more cushion so it's going to be soft it's going to be plush um it's going to be a little bit more breathable so if you remember the last couple versions had that knit upper to it so we've gone to this jaquard using monofilament fibers it's a little bit more breathable than what it was but what we kept that people love that knit ribbed collar the knit pull tab the knit tongue so the idea is when you put Nimbus on it kind of envelops the foot you feel that super soft plush cushion and that's before you even take your first step and then with that additional stack that new foam it's just going to feel even softer and more plush so this is your high cushion kind of Premium driver you know if you want to feel fast and bouncy we'll get you an Nova blast if you want something soft and a little bit of a different experience that's what gel Nas 27's about okay so you have a broken down version of the shoe here because it is a gel nimus talk to us about the gel part of it even with this great foam we've still got that gel piece that sits in that rear heel and so the idea is for shock attenuation you know when that foot initially hits the ground takes that shock spreads it out all over the midso so the foam can really absorb it and give you that good cushion that you want so even though it's only this little tiny bit in here it still does all that work yeah so that's the idea rear foot Strikers are going to come in down there and you just kind of see that shock spread out into the shoe this knit tongue is like maybe my favorite feature of this whole shoe although I am excited to try out this new foam formulation um that sounds exciting what is the release date and the price point of this guy the us it's going to come out in January for $165 okay all right thanks com soon you're welcome",

  "text": "hey Tomy from the Run testers and this is my first run review of the Muno wave Rebellion Pro 3 Let's Take a [Music] Look Muno wave Rebellion Pro 3 cost 210 or $250 it weighs 222 G or 7.8 o for men in a size 8 and the drop is 4 MIM the Muno wave Rebellion Pro 3 is a perform shoe designed for runners aiming for faster times over longdistance events the latest version has been modified to be even better for endurance events due to a wider Landing platform and the addition of the brand soft and bouncy nitrogen infused Muno enery XP mid cell phone Muno states that the shoe is aimed at Runners looking for a sub 2.5h hour marathon time thanks to the combination of the new Midol foam along with a smooth speed assist geometry for Optimum gate and efficiency and a carbon infused mauno wave plate to provide a high level of energy return the shoe also features a breathable mesh upper and a G3 outsole designed to be lightweight but provide a good amount of grip on road surfaces although the stack height of the shoe is measured from the heel to the 4 foot there is a much thicker stack of the midell foam in the middle of the [Applause] shoe so the fit for me in the uh waver Bion Pro 3 I'm size eight in the UK this is a race shoe it's performance shoe it's designed for Speed it's designed to be as light as it possibly can and as a result that generally means that you have quite a lean fit on the top that is the case with this shoe it's quite a lean shoe there's not a lot of space for me in my size eight um in the four foot of the shoe um there's Fair bit of space around the toe box no issues there but on the midsection of the shoe um it is quite thin uh for me I didn't have any issues with it I find it very comfortable on that first run but I think if you do have wider feet or um you might be a little bit over um the uh your size for your feet so I'm a size pretty average size eight um shoe If you're sort of going over the size eight a bit you're going to notice that the other thing about this shoe is that it's very much like um a high heel shoe it's it when you're running in it it's pushing you forward a bit and I do find that my foot goes further down the shoe than it would in a lot of other shoes and as a result you probably are getting getting closer to the the toe section at the end of end of the shoe for me I I in that first run I didn't have a problem um but there's not a lot of playroom in there so I might suggest going up half a size in this shoe um just to um just to get a little bit of extra space in there um but I'll find out more during the um during the full review but on that first run it was fine but I think um it may you may did a little bit more space in that for foot of the shoe okay so the first run I did in the shoe was a fart Leck interval session I went out and I did about 11k and I just tried lots of different Paces out for about 1 km and that varied quite a bit between really slow Paces for me which about 530 minute kilm and taking it up to about 4 415 which is about my marathon pace I didn't go any faster than that because it's between Christmas in New Year and I struggled to find the uh motivation to run really fast uh on that first run but um the what I found on that on that run is that this is a really interesting shoe uh it has this new Muno NZ XP midell phone which is bouncier than the previous version of the shoe I was a really big fan of the early version of the shoe the wer Bellion Pro two I thought it was a incredibly fun shoe um but it it wasn't a shoe that I ever picked up I never used it for a marathon because I was a little bit wary of the lack of stability in that shoe and the fact that um it was quite aggressive in how it made you run so when I run a marathon I really want uh a natural feel I like Ury turn like bound so like a nice bit of softness but I want the ride to feel relatively um natural and comfortable because in those later stages in a very aggressive shoe it can be quite hard and in the soc Dophin Elite which is a very aggressive shoe I only went up to half marathon in that shoe and by the end of the half marathon I did find it very very uncomfortable there is no way I could have run a marathon in the socon Endorphin um Elite now the new version of the wave Rebellion Pro the wave reion Pro 3 um it's very similar to the previous version but it does have this new midle foam in it the Muno nerz XP which is a little bit softer a little bit more energy return in it and it feels a little bit denser as well so that's where that energy return is coming from it's really compressing and giving you a lot of the energy back and you really notice that as soon as you step out the front door in the shoe it feels bouncy straight away um what I think one of the things I think that's changed with this shoe is that the well one of the main things that's definitely changed is that it has a much wider bait on it so you'll see that the older version of the shoe is a very different outsole to it you have this big cutout section L across the full length of the waiver belly and pro two you don't have that on the Pro 3 you've just got a section at the back and um the front section of the shoe is also wider so it gives you this wider base to land on um the other thing as well I think is that the this heel section you have this cutout section of the heel um that seems to have moved back a little bit in this shoe so previously when I ran in the version two uh I'm a midfoot striker and I was hitting the this sort of pointy section or the the section where the shoe basically the full of the shoe where you where you land on it you move forward I was hitting it dead on and it was really bouncy but I wasn't really getting loads from it it was a fun shoe to run in um and it was it definitely a shoe that made you run in a certain way um but that shoe unless I was running really fast it wasn't really tipping me forward it was sort of making me bounce if I was running fast I I was tipping over a bit more and and and and it was um working really well for that this shoe is designed more for longer distance Runners apparently uh and I think part of that is to do with the fact that they've moved the this sort of f chrum area further back so as a result when you when you land on it it sort of tips you forward a lot more it's more noticeable in this shoe than it was in the previous version of the shoe so it really is quite aggressive and how it moves you forward um when you're running at slower Pace you get a nice bit of that bounce and it rolls you forward nicely so when running it my marathon pace at about 4:15 I can really feel it tipping me forward it's quite hard to run slowly in this shoe because it's tipping you forward all the time when I started the run I I was left the house and I was just planning on jogging to the place where I normally go and do my interval sessions and um I was strug I I was just getting down to about 4 minute 40 without even trying um and normally I'd probably do it about 5 minute 20 up to where I start doing my inal sessions um and I think that's because of this geometry of the shoe it's really sort of rocks you forward um and land you on that that front section and bounces you forward it really does make a big difference so it's definitely a shoe that gives you a little bit more in that rocker format than the previous version of the shoe did which is welcome change the shoe because the fness of the uh previous version of the shoe didn't work quite well for me when I was running longer distances at PACE whereas I think this shoe that's the focus of it um it is noticeably uh a little bit aggressive so for some people that's probably not going to be uh what you're looking for but if the Mao talk about being a shoe design for people who want sub 2.5h hour marathons so is a shoe design for Elites it's not necessarily a shoe you're going to pick up and go and run a you know 30 minute part running it because it's a it's quite a shoe that's not really designed for that it's very much designed for for for hitting those faster paces and maintaining that pace as you go along but for me at that four 4 minute 15 Mark which is my marathon pace it felt really really good um other thing I say about this shoot as well is the front section of it which is that wider base it is noticeable so when you land on that it does feel a little bit more stable on the front of the shoe um but the back section of the shoe definitely isn't very stable overall the shoe isn't even though they've tried to make it a bit more stable it's not a very stable shoe and it's definitely a shoe that you have to keep an eye on the ground with uh if you're not running on completely flat roads so where I run uh the terrain changes a bit I do a little bit around parks and things like that and I really have to pay attention to it because um even though if you landed on the front section of the shoe you might be all right but not many people do that um and I land sort of on this rear section and it is a bit wobbly it's not it's by no means a a stable shoe at the back so it's definitely a shoe that despite them trying to make it more stable it is not a very stable shoe um but what I would say of that first run uh is that it it's fun it definitely changes the ride from the previous version of the shoe and really pops you forward a lot more than you would expect um and I definitely think it's probably going to be better for longer distance sessions because of that more aggressive um tendency to to pop you forward at those those those Marathon Paces uh and I might even use this for um uh from for Manchester coming up U maybe uh maybe to buy in a couple of weeks but I'm not entirely sure if I'm going to do the Marathon distance at that yet so yeah first run in this very very much enjoyed it I think it's an improvement on the previous version I like some of the changes that have been made in the shoe uh and I definitely think it's more conducive to longer distance training um which is what it's meant to be better at but uh I'll I've still got a lot of testing to do in it and see um if it's a shoe that I would actually pick for Marathon so my early verdict on the Muno wave Rebellion Pro 3 some interesting changes to the shoe I I think it's um it's changed the experience of the shoe I think it's definitely something that um is more conducive to running those longer distances pushing you into a position where you're moving forward at those Paces without really picking up the p and going really fast previously the uh first few versions of the shoe I really liked for 5K 10K um but I wouldn't have used them for a full Marathon just because I didn't get um just didn't get the sort of roll through that I want from it I did use the twos for a half marathon found it very fun but I did find it to be a little bit of an awkward shoe to wear for that longer distance it didn't really help me in the latter stages because I was it was bouncing me but it wasn't really rolling me forward I think this is this shoe is trying to trying to fix that and roll you forward um in in throughout the whole course of a marathon or or half marathon so that um it it it's giving you that optimized um efficiency as you're running but it is quite aggressive so I will do some longer distances in the shoe and see how it feels because I I don't necessarily like an aggressive shoe when I'm running longer distances I like a natural feing shoe but the changes that have been made to the shoe I think are improvements I think that wide base is a good is a smart move um and I also think that the foam is a little bit there's a bit more energy to it as well um but when it comes to stability I still think it's a way off a lot of shoes out there so if you're looking for a stable race shoe you wouldn't get this because it's it's it's a way off being stable at the moment especially if you're Landing in the uh back section of this shoe that's it from me on this first look at the Muno wave bellan Pro 3 thanks a lot for watching don't forget to like subscribe

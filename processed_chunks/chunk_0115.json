  "text": "do you want to run faster without adding more mileage to your training maybe you're prone to injury when you try to increase your mileage or you're juggling a busy shedule and just can't find the time or perhaps you're a bit like me at the moment hitting the limit of what your body's capable of each week so you're looking for some other smarter ways to perform at your best whatever your reason today I'm showing my Ultimate Guide to improving your speed with no extra miles required starting out we're going to have a chat about improving your form efficient running is really like a secret superpower if you can get from point A to point B as efficiently as possible we can get there faster using the same amount of energy let's have a quick chat about some of the basics with good running form firstly let's talk about posture we want to feel like we're nice and Tall shoulders relaxed head up and leaning forward from the ankles and not from the hips giving ourselves a nice forward lean secondly having a chat about the arms your arm should swing naturally beside you you don't want them to be crossing over in front of your body as this means a lot of wasted energy through our body twisting and having to stabilize that thirdly having a quick chat about Cadence and aiming for around about that 170 to 180 steps per minute this is really going to help us reduce that over striding decrease our contact time on the ground but how do we actually put these things into practice I'd really recommend choosing one run a week to really dial down and focus on your running form if it's Cadence you want to improve at the time then I'd recommend getting a metronome app or if you've got a Garmin and I think corus do it you can have a metronome on that device as well and it will beep in time with the Cadence that you're aiming for if you've got a Cadence of around about 160 for example then maybe build that up to 165 for a few weeks and then build it up to that 170 for a few weeks don't jump up too quickly going up about five steps a minute increments at the time let your body adjust it does take a little bit of time another little handy tip here that I really like to implement when I was really trying to work on my Cadence is to work on that arm Drive increase the speed that you're swinging your arms as you run and your feet should naturally FL as well right moving on let's have a chat about giving each run a purpose this is what so many beginner Runners really struggle with more advanced Runners will be mastering this so if you are more of a beginner Runner take note here if you're the type of person that does the vast majority of runs all at the same Pace you saw some good gains when you started running and they're most likely hitting a plateau and you're really struggling to get faster and build more speed there's really a couple of different things that could be going here you may well be running the vast majority of runs too fast really opening yourself up for the potential of getting injured or you could be doing a lot of your runs really too easy and building a good base which is fantastic but you're not adding that speed into your routine so you're not getting faster so it's really important to learn to run at a range of different paces and intensities so I just want to go through a few examples here I've got three different examples three runs a week four runs a week or five runs a week just to demonstrate what I mean by this range of Paces that we want to build in our routine starting out someone running three runs a week the first run of the week most likely to be a interval speed session the alltime classic 6x3 minutes we're going to doing our reps here at that 5K pace so tick that one off nice 5K pace for bu routine the second run of the week most likely to be a shorter but a very much sort of easy run Pace to get our legs nicely recovered at the weekend a longer run again that easy run pace so not a load of different Paces there really for beginner Runners around three times a week we've got easy run pace and that 5K Pace Building that in throughout the week as we progress a little bit up to four runs a week we're now going to be adding in a tempo run into our week as well around about 20 minutes at around about our 10K to half marathon pace that's another Pace we've now built into our week take that one off up to five runs a week now more experienced Runners we're now probably going to add another easy run into our week so another tick there for some more easy pace and then potentially adding some strides at the end of that run around about that sort of 3K pace something like that when you're really sort of opening up the legs building some really good strength and working on our running form so that's another Pace tick add that one in there and then during our long run we might add some marathon pace blocks in there for example so that's a marathon pace tick into the routine as well there if you want some real guidance on your Paces the type of Paces you should be doing a lot of these runs out we've got a completely free pacing chart I'll put it up on the screen now and we'll link to it down below just go to the website hit download it will just appear on your computer absolutely free of course and start building some different Paces into your routine and I'm guarantee you'll see your Fitness really improving both that endurance and that speed as well now maybe you're the type of Runner that doesn't love doing speed sessions maybe you're a bit more of an older Runner favors running on Hills rather than going that all out paac whatever the reason we can also look at doing some Hill reps in there to replace that speed session or you can just get a mix some weeks of speed session some weeks we're doing hill sessions not everyone's got Hills available to them but if you have these are fantastic running up pills really help strengthen our glutes our hamstrings our calves also help building on that running form as well getting that nicely landing on our midfoot which is really a lot easier to do as we're running uphill so what I recommend a very basic guide to my Hill runs here find a hill with a moderate incline don't worry too much finding that perfect Hill something around 4 to 6% is going to be really good for doing hill reps run up the hill of that steady hard effort for around about 30 to 60 seconds somewhere in that range is going to be really good focus on driving those knees up and pumping your arms as I said to really help build that Cadence as well and then jog or walk back down to the start make sure our heart rate is now nicely recovered at the bottom of the rep start with around about four to six reps then work your way up to around about 8 to 10 reps definitely build into routine if you can if you got those heels there this is really going to help get some more value out of your weekly mileage moving on to have a chat all about recovery in order to train hard and Implement these more intense sessions into our week you need to be able to recover a lot better as well make sure you're stretching those major muscle groups after your runs so your hamstrings your carves and your quads as well we've got a full cool down routine that you can follow along to it really just takes a few minutes but it's going to make a big difference when it comes to getting ready for your next run I'd really recommend using a foam roller as well if you can for some more intense self massage sessions potentially in the evening or a massage gun to release any sort of tight spots you've got as well but as always with these things use some follow along guides on YouTube to make sure you're using them in the most efficient way possible doing things also like yoga to improve your mobility and strengthen those stabilizing muscles are really good with running as well again check out someone like Adrienne on YouTube do some of those follow along routines and then finally refuel after your runs with that recovery Shake as long as you're getting around about that 3:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio it just kickstarts that recovery process to help rebuild those muscles and then finally of course getting some really good sleep is going to make that all important difference as that's when our whole body is repairing to come back stronger the next day now you may have heard of the term cross trining getting some alternative different types of cardio there's no doubt about it but running more really is the best way of adding running Fitness but as we said at the start of the video that's not going to be available to everyone we can't just keep running more and more we all have those limits so we can look at other ways of adding that cardio Fitness with things like cycling ellipticals and swimming as well to build that endurance that speed and that V2 Max even more but because the impact of these types of cross train activities is so much less than with running our heart rate zones are also different for these activities as well so to get the same intensity and that effort we need to spend a bit more time doing them than we would if we were running you can't simply replace a 30 minute run with a 30-minute elliptical and expect to get the same sort of effect so for example my sort of Rough Guide with this one that I use in my own training so if I'd like to add an extra 60-minute run into my week this would roughly mean spending around 2 hours on the cross trainer with where my own training is at the moment I've taken out a couple of double run days which I'd usually like to do and I could do them quite well a few years ago so i' have taking out two 30 minute runs throughing the week and replacing them with two 60-minute sessions on the lip it's also possible to add some extra intensity into our week if that's what you want to build in similar to our run sessions we can do these on the cross trainer or the bike as well just by increasing the resistance of the machines so using our earlier example of that 6x3 minute session really quite easy to do this on a cross trainer just increasing the resistance for those 3 minutes and then dial it back down again for the recovery bikes are really good to replicate some of our longer more sustained efforts I find as well so if you're looking to add maybe a 20 minute Tempo into your routine but don't want to do that via running then doing this 20-minute Tempo on the bike is definitely something that is possible if you want to look at a couple of elite athletes and have some deep Dives on some podcasts and some interviews with them Jess Stenson in Australia doing a lot of her cross training on the elliptical or a famous example here in the UK well he actually lives in the Netherlands now Jake Smith does a lot of again cross training on the cross trainer using the assault bike as well and has also done a lot of strength training in the last couple of years as he's been quite an injury-prone athlete recently but it's really starting to pay dividends as he's coming back into some really good form at the moment and then building on that little point there from Jake Smith while this is definitely going improving our cardiovascular system we're not getting that resistance back up from the road that we need so we also need to be doing some strength training as part of our routine to get our legs strong or even stronger so we can cover the ground in a more efficient way as well as we touch on the start so let's have a chat all about strength training so strength training is so relevant at the moment so many of our Elite Runners are building this into routine by building our muscles especially our legs and our core to create more power with each stride again we're just going to get it from point A to point B more efficiently again this becomes even more important as we age so so if you're in that 30 plus 40 plus 50 plus age category for me it's now complete non-negotiable I have to be doing this if I want to keep my running fast and serious and relatively competitive so I'd really recommend focusing on some key exercises the things I'm focusing on at the moment are squats and lunges these are going to Target those glutes those quads hamstrings as well these are the three Powerhouse muscles of running and then also focus on some good core exercises some planks some bridges why it's so important to strengthen that core during the back end of races especially running for sort of suffers they become fatigued as muscles fatigue and our upper body can be moving around all over the place just wasting so much energy here that strong core will keep everything tore and just allow us to move in the most efficient way for as long as possible so again how do I recommend putting this in practice how do I put this into practice putting a short circuit together a lot of these things you can simply do at home doing things just something like 10 squats 10 reverse lunges 10 Bridges and then a 30second plank if you're new to strength training like this do two to three rounds of this and then over time build up to five to six rounds again as you progress add some weights add some kettle bells to these routines so there we have it getting faster isn't all about running but as I said throughout this video running really is the best way we can be doing this but it's not always available to everyone there's lots of other things we can be doing on top of that mileage once we've maxed out that mileage all these other things come into play so we can become a better faster happier stronger Runner overall let me know which tip you're going to be trying first any tips you'd like to share with the running Community down below next up we've got a video all about how to improve your running form so go and check that one out over here that's it guys keep on working hard keep work done I'll see you very soon in the next one",

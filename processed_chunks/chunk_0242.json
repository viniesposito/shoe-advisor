  "text": "hey this is Robbie with leand run and today I'm here with Alex Lynn product manager at ASA we're going to talk about some of the stuff coming in 2025 uh let's dive into it what do you want to start out with absolutely yeah so the first shoe we're most excited about is going to be the experience flow 2 okay uh so this was our first shoe with drop right so back back in October 2023 we we introduced drop to our line for the very first time and just so people don't AR this people who are watching flow is your line that's the introduction to drop yeah experien family traditionally your zero drop shoes so then I'm sorry the experienced family experience and then that so and what is the drop on the experience family at least right now yeah so it's 4 mm drop so so we're at 32 in the heel 28 in the 4ot um and just it's it's a little bit more approachable for those who maybe are a little apprehensive of got going into zero drop um but still still has our signature foot shape fit you know still keeping you relatively low it's still low Drop so not not building it up too much but maybe a little bit more approachable if you're looking to to come into brand sure okay so tell me and what what are people going to get out of this shoe what kind of Runner is looking for this yeah absolutely so uh we really see this as just a really light efficient feel underfoot um one of our big goals with this update was actually to increase the cushioning underfoot as well so it's it's light it's cushioned and it feels a little bit more efficient just with the geometry so not only do we raise the the the uh the drop or add drop to this we're actually able to get a little bit more geometry out of the tool as well okay so there's a little bit of a rolling more kind of keeping you moving through the strides yeah a little bit more rocker shape okay and do you have a weight on this shoe yes this uh the men's size 10 and 1/2 what we sampled in is coming in at 8.2 Oz for a 10 and a half for 10 and half pretty white yeah yeah so we got an all new compound we're actually it's a one of our lowest specific gravities that we've got so very very lightweight um and then we've actually been able to increase the the responsiveness and the cushioning of this okay so a new compound for the midsole and what are you calling that yeah so we're calling it ego P35 okay um and it's really delivering on a really really nice ride you know it was one of those shoes that with our wear testers as they wore them they they were just immediately going to just how great it felt underfoot and how it actually had more light which was awesome and what's the release date and price on this yeah so we're going to release the experience flow too in uh June of 2025 and it's going to retail for $140 okay awesome all right what what you got next yeah uh so another another update for us is going to be the Olympus 275 okay A big one yeah this is super exciting so uh we're calling this the Olympus 275 is kind of homage to the brand and and in our Founders um really they they started tinkering with product in a you know with with a toaster oven is it is it at the temperature 275 temperature yeah so so that's that's our our kind of Nod to to the past there and we actually kind of took the same ethos right and so we wanted to take our our Olympus 6 and really just make it a little bit more technical a little bit more performance oriented so what we've done we we still have the same outsole and midsole but we've actually changed the Strobel and sock liner um to be a little bit lighter weight little bit more responsive feel soot we've just kind of tweaked it slightly um but then really in the upper that's the big story got the Matrix upper on there we got the Matrix upper yeah so very exciting it's it's lighter weight this is actually over an ounce lighter than the inline kind of Olympus 6 that we've got um but super protective super durable consistent fit throughout and then we've also got this kind of sree sleeve in the back here yeah that's nice I like this that's a nice aggressive toe bumper you will not be banging your toes on rocks on that thing not with this one inspiration really is for those that are you know out there for those Ultra marathons and maybe maybe they don't want a carbon plated shoe maybe they they want some a little bit more comfortable for the Long Haul yeah this is going to be a great option force and what's and for those of you who don't know the Matrix upper super premium upper really great durability especially um and then yeah you got this integrated Gator here obviously vrum is always topnotch so and what is the uh what's the stack height on this yeah so the Olympus is uh 275 and the Olympus 6 are both 33 mm stack okay and uh this is part of your zero drop family yeah still maintaining that and then uh oh yeah price and release date yep so this is released in July 2025 and it will retail for $185 okay great all right let's move on all right all right let's see so next up we've got the Lone Peak 9 so obviously kind of the the shoe right when people think of of ultra it's almost always the Lone Peak the classic Trail model for Ultra exactly yeah a second shoe that we've ever come out with first first Trail shoe that we ever came out with and uh you know with with this update really wanted to focus on what what consumers were loving about this so through our focus group some of the the things that we continue to hear Comfort is King right and that's something that they they always relate to us really highlighted by that that original foot shape fit uh and then another thing that that we knew we could improve upon was durability so both whether it was Runners whether it was hikers um people just W it casually they wanted to get even more out of this product and it's it's an aggressive product so we actually have a new formulation of Max trck underfoot um maintains the same great grip and traction more durability so just getting more life out of it right uh same goes for the midsole so it's an updated ego midsole uh again same great responsiveness and cushioning but a little bit more durability all the way through okay and then what we've also done is really focus on the fit through the the quarter here so uh tradition or previously we had more kind of TPU overlays noo TPU we've actually changed it to more of a woven material all right I like that yeah and it just fits quite a bit better especially dynamically a little more flexible yeah yeah a little bit more flexible and then you can also lock it down with these additional eyelets um so if lower volume or you want you know maybe something more technical can really lock it down all the way through but a very exciting update it's it's a big change for the Lone Peak 9 but uh I think it's it's a great one and still maintains the kind of the the sole of what the Lone Peak is and you got what's the sack tile on this yeah so it's 25 mm 25 okay and then uh you got the integrated or the gator attachments back here that's always been part of the shoe I think the Lone Peak 2 was like one of the first trail shoes that I ran in actually oh right on that's my favorite Lone Peak yeah so that was a holds a a nice spot in my heart I say awesome right um and then uh the price and release date for this yep so this is uh it's actually coming out uh in the US here in December so it'll be out very soon retailing for 140 bucks right around the corner okay cool and I'm sure so we'll be rev reviewing this in the near future I'm sure be out in the next couple uh couple weeks a month awesome perfect all right what do we got next in the lineup and next up is going to be the experience wild too okay um so talks about the experience flow right our our kind of first product with with drop um this is actually the first shoe that we've got with drop on the trail side so uh the wild 2 we actually got a really good response with the wild one yeah cuz the first one was is kind of like a road to Trail like do everything shoe it kind of became that yeah which I don't know if that was what you were look for but but I think what happened is it's just super runnable and we've actually found our Elite athletes are actually racing in this oh wow um because they just they just love the feel underfoot it's it's pretty lightweight for a trail shoe but it's still pretty protective exact so yeah with this one we're actually keeping the exact same tooling underfoot got such a good response didn't want to change anything there um and really it's just just through the upper so you can see this kind of asymmetrical design a little bit more protective through the toe there really want to make sure you know if you're kicking a rock you get a little bit of protection all the way through and then highlighting in the heel just just the material brakes there what that does is it it really kind of emphasizes just the comfort that we we want to continue to deliver upon so we have those kind of Achilles pillows really lock you down I noticed that that's kind of a nice touch because a lot of times you know it depending on how stiff the shoe is or whatever you can get some heel lift in it especially on the up hills so nice having those heel pose give a better lock down yeah you kind of sit into it a little bit more that's awesome okay so what's the stack title on this yep so this one is 32 in the heel 28 in the 4 foot and did you have a weight on this one uh this one it's I believe 9.2 Oz for your 10 and a half so again pretty light I can see why your athletes would like this a little more Nimble on the foot especially when you're taking up to the speed and uh price and release date yep so this is releasing may may of 2025 and it's going to for 140 bucks so we're actually dropping the price on this oh W there you go and was last one 150 it was 145 145 okay there you go little shrink flation in in the good way yeah um all right anything else we got going on I think that's what all we've got for yeah perfect for this well D thank you for uh this is our first interview so I'm like still waking up in my mind so I'm glad had a fun Wednesday night even worked at all you know what I actually took it easy last night I I did not I had two drinks done had nice and sleep and uh we're back for day two so awesome yeah all right thanks dude really appreciate it thank you",

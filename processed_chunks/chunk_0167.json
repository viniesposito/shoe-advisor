Megan Murray Megan Murray also married to Thomas newberger I never actually know what your last name is it's like my wife when we got married she like she had two middle names and she dropped one and I never I I don't even know what her name is wait she started out with two middle names yeah oh and then she like dropped one and picked up I don't know she added your name some I had to ask her every time she hat she's going to hate me cheers anyways I I'm making this somehow about myself which I apologize Megan welcome to the show thanks guys thanks for having me I'm excited to hear your life story I feel like I know it's bits and pieces but but not the whole thing so what are we are we starting from the beginning I we started with the beginning with everyone else I think we have to all right so weren't you born in a car uh no wasn't a snowstorm I was born in a snowstorm nice um which I think my parents love that story for whatever reason I love that story I was the second kid so I feel like the first one they were like you know panicked got to get ready for you know the first one to be born and then I kind of was they were like ah she'll be born when she's born and then middle of a snowstorm I decided it was time why did I have the thought that your dad delivered you in the back seat of that car during the snowstorm well so because there was a snowstorm they couldn't get the doctors to the hospital is my understanding so I don't think like the proper people were in the hospital nice so but did your dad I was not born in a car I was born in a hospital but did your dad deliver you or something uh maybe he had something to do with it yeah oh okay so the way here's the how I pictur it the comic book version the car is on the side of the road the hazards are blinking in the snowstorm here Dad has got the back door open he's you know over Robin with her screaming through uh you know know pain and Megan is born I do know it was so sudden that um they didn't have time to give my mom any drugs so I was born like like a little house in the prairie style yeah so I think it's probably pretty memorable so basically the security guard at the hospital and your dad were just delivering you that's amazing yeah yeah so that was the start um where were you born what Annapolis oh really yeah see that never knew that so I was born in Annapolis and we we had a home there and I lived there I want to say until I was like three or four I don't have many memories of the anisis is in Maryland for those of you who don't know yes capital capital capital city um so I lived there when I was very young and then we moved to Phoenix Maryland which is 45 minutes north of Baltimore city where we all are now that's kind of in the middle of nowhere right it is but I lived in a neighborhood where I didn't feel like like some of my friends lived like what I called like cowland like where their home would be on like 15 acres and they would probably call Horseland up there but yeah yeah Horseland cowland whatever you want to call it it beautiful but where I lived I felt like we were slightly closer to civilization okay like I could walk to the Blockbuster on a Friday night oh really do you know where the Four Corners is I I actually don't think I do okay so if you go up to the county it's it's she's basically on the edge of Oblivion so it's like you go up there there's this place called for Corners it's like Jacksonville uh what I like how they just name their cities after not all all other Jacksonville Phoenix yeah um so it's like San Francisco's up there so like if you need to go to the grocery store and stuff yeah I could walk right okay but after that you're like in like rural so all the rural people come to for Corners to do the shopping and okay so I feel like I had the best of both worlds cuz it was like we were kind of out and had some little land like our house was on an acre I think and then but I could walk to all the cool places that I wanted to I mean walking to a blockbuster that's almost a that's a privilege that most people would never get to that was experience like Pinnacle Friday night order Domino's Pizza walk to Blockbuster go get the new release movie if it wasn't there you'd go to the uh checkout and be like did anyone just return one recently nice you smell weird popcorn in there yeah I'm surprised you didn't get a job there so it I think it closed down by the time I was ready to get a job yeah as Blockbuster did man you could talk about that with the record stores is a experience that I mean Blockbuster was kind of a pain in the butt because it was a responsibility you had the tape you had to get it back but going there and picking out the movie that was fun why are we why are we so nostalgic for something that was such a frustrating experience most of the time because when it worked out it was so good yeah it when it it was kind of like now you surf TV to see what's on and you can go through thousand you're like there's nothing you used to go to Blockbuster thousands of movies and you'd be like there's nothing here MH vers the the fact of the matter is though I think what we're nostalgic about is you used to have to be around people it was an experience yeah the smell as soon as you open that door oh yeah it had that like almost like the movie theater carpet popcorn smell the beaded curtain what's going on back there that that thing I also grew up in a house that was like very health conscious I would say and so Friday nights we would get like maybe it was like $5 maybe it was $10 I don't even know we would get a little bit of money we were allowed to go rent a movie and get candy ni so that was like a big to do and have pizza so so you were born I don't even know what year were you you were born oh okay yeah so 88 so you did get the experience you were still in the transition period between 90s were pre- internet and post yeah I feel like I lived like the perfect scenario of when the internet was introduced to my life if it was any earlier I think it would have been catastrophic yeah um but it it came into my life I feel like at a time that was okay because I grew up are you allowed to say tomboy anymore is that a bad word no you can say that okay I don't know anymore but so that's how I was growing up like we spent all of our time outside I was crawling in sewers most of the time there was a pond in our neighborhood where we would go fishing all the time we'd catch salamanders and frogs dude how did I ever know never know this you're closer to my DNA than I ever thought yeah like we used to catch all the tadpoles and then bring them home and then watch them turn into frogs and then like play with them jumping around everywhere like loved that would catch snakes yeah like never never scared of any reptiles loved reptiles really um yeah like very very much not a girly girl did you ever trick uh like scare your parents or anything like that no and also you couldn't scare my father he was ex-military so none of that was happening and no my mom wasn't she wasn't scared of animals either in any way H so yeah it wasn't even a possibility and I grew up with an older brother so you know right right he's what it is and so your parent so your mom is from the United States right is jersey she's from Jersey okay that's in the United States yeah there's a debate whether it should or shouldn't be but the drones are flying over right now yeah yeah those are weird maybe they'll secede and that's everything will be all right no um yeah if the drones if the drones took out the toll roads in New Jersey that would be awesome maybe we could make that happen just the toll boo that's it are is it is that a big concern for you yeah dude if you D have you ever driv to New York the turnpike but you end up paying a mortgage just to get there no you take the train and skip it all yeah but if you drive if you have to drive there don't um and so anyway so you uh so and your dad's from England right yes he grew up outside of London um ended up coming over to the state to my parents you sound like you're from London okay so funny thing about that is obviously my dad had an accent and growing up none of my friends understood what he was saying and I never understood why he his accent was different than I've heard people with British accent also he was he he kind of mumbled and he was like older and so I feel like all my friends were like what is he saying but I I never understood that he had an accent growing up that's like not until later in life where I was like oh yeah he does sound different I guess it makes sense if you grew up there then if you grew up in the house then it's just how it sounds yeah and so I will tell you this uh when I met Ian he was probably 7s 60s 7s late 6070s 70s okay and it took me a while to to understand what he was saying I I would translate for most people I me he he was very good at yelling sometimes and those words you understood quite well yeah you could pick those up pretty quick and he would call me the the p p word all the time yeah if I didn't smoke a cigar with him or drink rotten Scotch I mean Fair really bad Scotch yeah no I don't yeah I would I don't know if I would do that either um yeah so they they met over here obviously they met actually on the west coast and lived there for a while and then ended up over on the east coast for business and I thought that everyone's parents owned businesses together and that's just how life worked like that's you would own a business together and then get married cuz that's how my parents worked so I just assumed that was what everyone did worked out for me um it's pretty funny that that's not at all how normal people function I love your perception of reality yeah that your dad didn't have an ACC people don't have accents just living in my own world and but your dad was also in the Royal Air Force is that what it's called no the s SAS okay um is is that part of the is thatal is that Under the Umbrella of the Air Force or is that you know how like the N seals are under the Navy I don't know anyways but that's like a special like a legit yeah in fact after I wrote my post about how he was part of that so many people reached out that they were like oh my gosh that's like an insane position to be in and live through and like I think he lived more lives than I'll ever know oh for sure but yeah and he would always be the Storyteller anytime we were at a party like people would be up until 3:00 a.m.",

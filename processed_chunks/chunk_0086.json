  "text": "[Music] and we're back from the cir series come on everybody the US Mountain running championships 2024 and that was some footage from the starting area starting line really just a beautiful beautiful setting you can't beat it out there in it just really quite steep mountains and today actually yesterday in case you missed it upper right hand corner we published the full Vlog so it's a long one get your popcorn out and sit down and enjoy that I'll link to it down below in upper right hand corner in case you missed the Vlog yesterday but I did promise that I wanted to break down the race for all of you so that's what we're going to do right here right now but QD uh what is your next race all right what are you what are you shooting for what are you training for I know a lot of it's crazy a lot of people already ramping up for their fall marathons uh building their volume so it's uh it's exciting but what is your next race the distance the surface and um and the location all right I knew in my mind I knew it was going to be a cross country feel but in a mountain setting so fast off the start too fast for me like these guys were moving and I was like you know what I H my legs first of all okay here's the bib number from Leadville all right bib number from Kendall Mountain bib number from Snowbird so three weekends in a row I don't do that but again we're just coming back to this racing thing and it was fun to do three weekends back to back to back I'm not doing I'm not racing this weekend uh but 15 miles 12 mil 8 Miles that's one of the reasons I knew it would be fast out of the start and you actually don't do that and I've talked about this many many times over the last five or six years here on this channel you build your racing distance so you go if you're getting ready for a marathon you do a 10 mile or maybe half marathon tuneup race uh if you're getting ready for a 10K you do 3ks and 5Ks I'm thinking more like track 10K you do 3ks and five even 1500s before kind of building your leg speed getting ready for that test so this was the opposite of what you should do but guess what that's how the cookie crumbled in 2024 for me for Mountain racing so it was a stacked field USA Mountain running championships I knew there was going to be some guys there that were quite a bit younger and yes faster than me especially at that distance but patience all right I I showed it yesterday but again going from I was at about 15th 16th Place at about the half mile Mark and moving your way up oh that's the other thing thing it was toasty all right I'm not a not a big like heat Runner I don't you know here in Colorado our temperatures are pretty pretty tame pretty mild in the summertime even and we don't get any humidity now there was no humidity in Snowbird but it was warm and you felt it out there uh sometimes I go right through the aid stations I did not go through the aid stations especially for an 8 mile race like that's not very far from me and but today or on that on race day I had to stop and get water so thank you to all the volunteers out there at the Circ race uh but I just start picking them off and I knew I would pick off many I didn't know how many uh because I just I just know what altitude does so the race started should have mentioned this at the beginning the race started at 8,000 ft and tops out I think at about 11,200 roughly I I'll try and put it on the screen um so there you go so I Knew by the top there would be a little bit of Carnage especially with the heat so we're passing it's beautiful uh a Circ is a rock formation on a mountain so that's why it's called the cir Series so all of the races in this series which I'd recommend you go check out if you're looking for shorter faster steeper Mountain racing all right that's and so that's what a Circ is c i r q e so we're going we're going Mile Three Mile 4 but by mile about um I was going to say about mile 4 and A2 I'm I don't not exactly in my head where we were on the mountain but I'm move I've moved up to about seventh place and I can see fifth place ahead of me all right so we're topping off and thanks to everybody out all the photographers out there taking great pictures amazing so we top off and You Begin The Descent and it's steep and it's dangerous and a runner did fall this past weekend and it was it was bad uh you just you know I'm 39 and I'm not an expert at downhill running but I do have a decent amount of confidence going fast on technical downhill and especially when my legs are really fresh and so I felt it I was like okay I feel conf even though this is gnarly and you can see it on your screen like it's it's no joking and the biggest thing I'm thinking obviously I want to get home to the family safely but you just like if you do fall out there everyone just please please like your arms they will heal but your head just try to protect your head out there um if you're doing some of these races I'm not joking about that so um by about mile five so three miles to go sure enough I catched uh I caught uh cam Cam's a great Mountain Runner who beat me the week before at Kendall mountains so I managed to catch up to cam and uh and and then you really begin the Steep downhill at some point you we're sent off course uh through this rock Bower Field there's some snow it it's just gnarly it's fun but again you just got to be aware of your surroundings as you're going through these settings uh so you're breathing you're working you're at 11,000 ft and then you end through a tunnel you go through a tunnel and then it's a a Sprint to the finish uh like literally it's 2 miles to go and it it is a combin of service road and Trail uh and sure enough thanks to straa I'm looking at it right now and certain segments on the I pr it's amazing I pr now five years ago I won this race that was the last time I was there and I was in first place by quite a bit so I don't think I was pushing as hard on the downhill and so I actually PR many of the segments on the downhill in Snowbird so that kind of feels good like didn't uh you know didn't get the win so I was in fifth on top and ended up in seventh all right um I would have loved to get you know Podium top three top five is kind of nice seven so two guys fast I mean they did kind of they blew by me I mean they were just fast um I held one of one of them off for about a mile but sure enough he caught me and then another guy caught me with about a mile to you know half mile to a mile to go so ended up in seventh uh but for the third weekend in a row of racing it uh I feel like it was a good effort and now it's like back to training I know I'm not in like my Peak Fitness right now summer is still like it's not early but it's it's you know we're not there yet we haven't been up in the 14ers as much in this in June and July as as you know I might typically have so it's coming it's coming it's going to be another two to three weeks before we're really ready to rock and roll for some races in August Italy Italy italan yeah I'm coming for you more details on that very soon that will probably be my next race is over in Italy late August and then of course Pikes Peak in September so the racing is back it's fun to get some get some bib numbers back on the uh singlet and let it rip that's a brief Rec recap I could go on and on and on no Falls uh I felt strong on the uphill but not like epic again the legs just didn't have the pop you know Mountain Run like when when you have the pop you got the pop and literally like you just kind of prance up the mountain that was not the case like I was kind of digging just to get to the top um and that's okay that's part of racing and part of the whole experience I'm going to stop there thanks for watching Love You all can't wait to read your comments what's your next race and keep buttering that bread I'm actually plotting out more of my uh summer 2024 fkt and racing as we speak it's happening and we do it we're doing it all right keep going everyone we'll of course toss it to the race Vlog from uh this past weekend right there all right see beauty work card and love each other",

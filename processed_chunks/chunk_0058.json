  "text": "[Music] [Music] welcome back to the shed new shudio no no no not the new question of the day I've always wanted to do that roll into the shot all right we're in the shed yep uh doing some organization inside the shudio so obviously question of the day what are you gifting for Christmas 2025 to Runners that you know what are you going to give them all right that's the question of the day so obviously brands are still very interested in sending me running gear thank you by the way uh but I want to clarify obvious like it was a year ago I can't believe it one year ago deor store.com launched and that is consuming all of my time and I wish if it really does it breaks my heart that I cannot be your shoe guy any longer it's the time has passed and maybe I'll pass it on to my sons I don't know running shoe reviews that is it's over like I don't have the time to create high quality I could create bad running shoe reviews but high quality running shoe reviews like I used to do Coes oh my mind and that's okay all right I I've accepted it but I know a lot of you out there have not accepted it and I'm sorry I just I'm one person there's only 24 hours in a day I cannot do the hike and I'm all about high quality on YouTube and so uh but I will say as far as gear and I know there's shoes here there's a lot of I don't know what's all in these boxes we'll open them in a second but as far as gear brands out there companies we've got our own brand all right we've got our own gear we've got our own store and that's again consuming most of my time but if you send me gear I will open it I will use it I a very high likelihood I will use it in videos will I do a full review video I will not I will not again why time that's the only reason all right I just want to be thankful grateful gratitude in the the boxes showing up at my house um but I I cannot give you full review videos because I'm one person all right but send it to me like for example in 2024 probably six different companies for sunglasses have sent me sunglasses I think they know maybe my eye issue that I'm still dealing with they I don't know if they saw that video but I got a lot of sunglasses sent to me this year from Rudy Project Smith Oakley and if you watched all the fkt videos up in the mountains this summer I wore all the sunglasses it was awesome and I appreciated it but so your if you send me gear I will open it I will show the camera and I will use it in videos but I'm not going to do a single video about the gear capiche all right let's open up what is going on here and I have again I just don't know what is in these video in these um I should say in these uh bags and boxes okay o some running gear okay from artil for those alive in the world it looks like a hat it looks like I'm interested in this this looks like a shirt has anybody heard of oo that feels quite nice artil systems ooh that feels very nice very lightweight t-shirt all right and I will do my best scroll down scroll down everybody to the description below to link to all of these companies I'll do my best there's no guarant again I'm not getting paid that's the other thing okay that's the other thing this is free marketing for ECT which I just opened it's free market they're not paying me to do this and so if I remember to link I will but at the end of the day I don't have to link but I will art select uh because I appreciate oh that's nice a nice beanie that's actually really nice I must say this feels like high quality product right here this is more than Marino this is five times faster drying okay oh this is okay artil I don't know you [Music] what did I just say all right pause the video Hold on let me open this three pairs of sunglasses in this box and I'm grateful okay I'm very grateful do I need all these sunglasses no but I'm grateful and I'll show so this is blenders everyone knows blenders at this point Thank You blenders for sending the sunglasses they're looking [Music] schnazzy this is true lightweight long sleeve true spelled t r e w yes feels amazing all right let me hold it up there true all right five times better by [Music] Design this is from Echo I think high five say Hey you love these specs from Adidas sport eyewear Jacob and Team Echo wow oh my goodness oh my goodness it's too much I can't handle it every I cannot handle it it's so much gear one thing that Deora store does not have yet is sunglasses so maybe so maybe uh maybe there this is a sign that we need oh wow interesting I didn't actually I don't know if I've ever seen anybody wear Adidas sunglasses have you these are Adidas nice very nice thank you Adidas I do appreciate wow I like that nose the nose right here that feels very secure we're going to Pivot it's too many boxes we got to move we're going to move over here it was a good run come on you got you got to admit we had a good run and business owners companies Brands thank you five six years really five to six years of not non-stop running gear reviews and not you know don't get me started on running shoe reviews but just like Gear reviews with headlamps running vests half tights t-shirts long sleeves pants socks oh my goodness it's it's amazing so I get it like if you're a business owner out there in the running space specifically I understand what you're going through keep fighting don't give up on your dreams and I'm grateful for you sending me all this gear for the last 5 to 6 years and I just want to I just want to express my thanks for trusting me to but to do the the gear reviews back in the day I'm done all right and I so hopefully you see this video and you realize okay maybe I won't send running gear to Seth in 2025 but if you do keep sending it to me I'll give you a shout out every now and then all right like bare butt wipes in case you you know need to take care of business out in the woods yes indeed or always Hoka sending me gear always appreciate look like there's some loafers here with some epic tread on the bottom all right or go sleeves some recovery sleeves for the calves right there oh it goes on and on and on so keep fighting I'm cheering you on as a a a fellow business owner it's not easy but that's what it takes you got to send the gear out and you got to um you got to just see what the people think okay so I will wear this gear I will use this gear I'm really excited some of this uh t-shirt action and long sleeve action but I'm not going to commit to full reviews for the gear it's just been a good run there's a pun intended there's Seasons to life so many seasons to life and the season of life with respect to so many Gear reviews and that's what I'll toss it to of course right now is like outerwear um outerwear oh my goodness you know what I'll probably do a winter run rning gear I put a lot of work into those winter remember those those Vlogs from a couple years ago winter running gear recommendations like really nailing what you're wearing out there in the freezing freezing temperature so I'll probably toss it to that right here keep fighting enjoy the winter enjoy your Christmas season and hopefully you get some good ideas for Christmas gifts for runners Down Below in the comments all right butter that bread everybody toss it to uh winter running gear right there all right see beauty work hard and love each other",

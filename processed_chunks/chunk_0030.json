  "text": "the World Marathon major season always ends on the first Sunday in November it's the most challenging course of the series but the crowd support is unmatched it's my favorite race for chasing the pros and finding my friends so let's hop on a plane and head east this is a runner's weekend at the New York Marathon [Music] yo what's going on just made it into New York it's going to be a crazy busy weekend here for the marathon already I took care of some first things first business checked in the hotel got myself a slice and now I'm going to head over to Under Armour and make some pasta [Music] when you're thinking about marathons you're thinking about carbs and pasta is definitely one of the runner favorite ways of loading up under armor set this media event at ant Jake a place that is part restaurant and part pasta classroom the ingredients were laid out on Long workbenches along with images of the ingredients of some of under armour's best performance running product the space was cozy welcome and intimate 2022 New York Marathon Champion Sharon Loy was there to talk to us about how she was feeling for the race in Just 2 days and it was fantastic to hear from her

running into the Lost Boys relay race saw a lot of friends down there chatted for a while now we're going to wrap up this run head back to the hotel get change up Qui quick and then head over to the endorphins [Music] party endorphins is a run club that has exploded in popularity with chapters in nine cities and a strong cheer squad Presence at just about every race you've likely seen them somewhere before this year they've set up shop in the Shopify space which is where Bandit had its popup last year and on this evening they were having their New York Marathon weekend kickoff [Music] party from endorphins Drew and I decided to head over to the craft Afterparty there craft was unveiling their latest carbon plated shoe the kite Pro a lot of people there had just raced in the shoe as there had been a take the bridge event earlier that night they had prototypes on display and I was able to get a look at the unique carbon plate there was a food truck outside the spot and so many friends to catch up with [Music] inside and then afterwards Drew and I decided to make one last stop before calling it a night [Music] good morning it is about 8:00 a.m. in the morning on I Saturday here in New York today is a big day let's start it with a ShakeOut with Runa I am walking past the believe in the Run event it's a long line already trying to sneak by undetected I don't know if that'll happen so what's going on guys how are you [Music] hey Runa is a training app and they're pretty big in Europe and the UK but they're now trying to make a big push for the US I'll be using the app to train for the half marathon in Houston and this weekend was the official kickoff of the partnership guys wow we're an official shake out for the marathon 2024 [Music] wo 3 2 1 once we got outside Runa had everyone go through a quick warm-up we got the group photo and then [Music] off a lot of congestion with the end of the dash to the Finish 5K going on on and kind of intersecting with our route here but now that we're in the park spreading out a little bit it's a beautiful morning the r [Music] comfortable the halfway point was at the reservoir and we stopped there to make sure we had everyone we took another group photo and then we headed back to the Run of space [Music] we are back to some of the congestion by the Finish Line almost done almost back are you are you in a red yes oh sorry yeah no no no F there's so much congestion here you know so oh my you can keep going I we're almost done we're just a little bit down [Music] [Music] all right just finished getting some breakfast with Chase and Drew now Drew and I are going to head back further south and go check out the coffee Club podcast is this the way I don't know if this is Del way you have half away Drew did take us the right way and the subway got us to the on popup pretty quick but we still got to the podcast a few minutes late so it was already a packed house when we arrived I've been listening to the coffee Club podcast for a while it was good to be able to see a live taping they had trivia Q&A from the audience and even a little bit of heckling of the OAC rookies it was a fun show all I long to say to you oh downstairs there was a bit of running shoe history from on which is the kind of thing that I always love to nerd out on and then a chance to watch the Shoemaker robot and even try on a demo [Music] pair yeah you make me so nervous yeah say it's true tight and twisted that's what you do my hands sh [Applause] it [Music] CL all right that's it for the on store that was pretty amazing that robot's cool I welcome our robot overlords as long as they make good shoes now we're going to head over to Bandit I think a lot of people forget that Bandit is still a very young apparel brand I have been to every New York Marathon popup they've done and that tradition only goes back to 2022 want to welcome you guys to our uh first popup they've come a long way in that amount of time and this year they're releasing a collab collection with a major running shoe brand and personally I love the R herana theme [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] race day morning started early for me with a

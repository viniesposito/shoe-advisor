  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers and in this video we are putting the aex Nova blast 5 up against the sakon ride 17 to help you decide which shoe might suit your running best we're going to tease out the differences compare the performance and reveal our personal favorites so let's get into it the aex number blast 5 versus S ride 17 head-to-head key details first then the aex NOA blast five stack height has 41 1/2 m in the 4ot 33 1/2 m in the hill for an 8 mil drop the Stony ride 17 comes in at 35 m in the hill 27 m in the four also for an 8 mil drop when it comes to weight aex man to shave a little bit off the overlast five and our UK men's 8 and a half It Now tips the scales a pretty impressive 8.9 o or 251 G the S ride 17 weighs in 10.3 o or 293 G in the same size on price the RP for both shoes is1 135 in the UK and $140 in the US you can find the ride 17 in sales under 100 and under $100 now let's give you a quick shoe comparison starting with the midsoles the Nova blast 5 sticks largely to the novablast blueprint with a Max stacked midsole what you've got now is flight phone blast Max which is tuned bit bounce a bit softi it's got a large rocker the ride 17 has a big but not Max stack with the LI power on plus phone there's also saky speedroll roering going on here as well up top the ride 17 has engineered meshup as medium padded heel collar and a medium padded gusted tongue there's also quite a stiff heel counter here and you've got heel pools to help you get them on the novablast 5 has a more premium jackard mesh up the top that takes styling CES from the super blast the Nova blast 5 heel colors are more padded the gusted tons are thinner though with a nicely wrapping design you've also got heel pools here and you've got a little lace Loop which helps flip them over in the ride 17 has a good covering of outsole rubber for grip and durability in all the right places an over blast five out soole sticks to a relatively standard covering of the aex ah low rubber you're not getting that kind of top level grippiest ah plus that you'll find on the aex super blast too though but you've got pretty good coverings here to protect those midols when it comes to fit I ran in a UK 8 A2 which is my regular shoe size in both of these and the fit on both of them I find is good it goes sort of true to size for me I get good security and hold in all the key areas heel midfoot no slip no complaints no rubbing the NOA blast 5 is considerably roomier in the toe box than the ride 1 but the ride 1 still offers ample wiggle room up there too I like the Airy fit of both shoes now some people have found that the no blast 5 is a bit too spacious but I've got wide feet quite high in steps so they sort of fit nicely for me and I like spacing shoes particularly as I've used these for longer miles so both I would recommend going true to size so the fit for me in these two shoes uh the ride 17 is definitely the a bit more on the uh thinner side when it comes to shoe width it's fine for me I've got fairly average WID feet um but I I think that the ride 17 is probably a little bit more restrictive if you've got wider feet not massively I think it's a fairly averagely width shoe um but if you compare it to the no blast 5 I think this is a little bit more forgiving in the width of the shoe also a little bit longer as well um but definitely if you're if you're if you're veering more towards the wider side of feet then noas 5 has probably got a little bit more give it than uh ride 17 um but I will stick to my size of both of these shoes I'm a size eight in the UK these are both size eight and I found to be very very comfortable didn't have any issues in either of them so I still say to my size um but just take that consideration on the the slightly thinner width of the ride 17 so it comes the fit of the ride 17 and the overlast 5 got my normal size in both shoes which is a uk9 with both of these Brands that's a US 10 and I've had no concerns at all really with the fit I've got enough room in the toe box they no blast in particular is quite a room is shoe around the toes and I've got a narrow foot so I've probably got a bit too much room in terms of the width but it hasn't been a problem in terms of lock down or anything like that good hold around the heel and midfoot and both shoes they are padded and comfortable without irritating my Achilles or anything like that so yeah I'd stick to your normal size with both of these shoes I've had no problems with the fit now in testing I've run loads of miles in the soc ride 17 it's one of my go-to shoes for my casual run so I use it a lot when I'm not testing other shoes and when I'm really just looking for reliable comfort for those easy miles I've covered well north of 50 mil in the no last five including a full 4-Hour solo Marathon test it's video on the channel coming soon I've used both shoes across the same range of paces and terrain covering slow and easy long runs right up to faster intervals and progression runs and as usual I've run mainly on the tarmac on the asphalt on the road but with some light Offroad too to test the stability uh River pars that kind of thing into the park sometimes now quick take on both shoes I love the ride 17 there's excellent disappearing Comfort a really good ride that balances cushioned Landings with a rolling response and a bit of springy energy for me it's one of those shoes that feels natural Straight Out of the Box the moment you put it on it's not a totally effortless shoe but it's very easy for covering long miles just clipping along whether you're moving slow and easy or you're pushing things slightly more Up Tempo it's not super soft it's not super energetic but it's nicely consistent good stability good reliable ride and I think it's pretty good value overall the ASX NOA blast 5 is a very competent daily trainer too but it has some what sort of maybe left me a bit torn it offers a nice smooth ride that responds well on toe off and it feels springy but controlled when you're feeling good running with good form and pushing the pace that's when the over blast five I think feels most energetic when you're feeling like you're energetic but it's also cushioned enough to accommodate the slower Paces as well super comfort for easy casual miles though sometimes on heavier legs I find the it can be a bit sinky and a bit soggy I've had slow runs or at least runs where I felt tired with the softness certainly in a kind of slower Pace form makes it feel like the shoe is working a little bit against me somewhat that was the case during a pretty heavy legged Marathon test that I did but even then it still delivered comfort and protection in a reliable ride that took care of my tired feet and legs deep into that Marathon test and then I've had runs in the nov blast 5 where I'm full of energy running in good form really working off the foref foot with the nov blast 5 I think has felt more energetic and you notice that kind of bounce that comes through in the foam that's the way the foam sort of tuned I've also done a side by side Mile with both of these shoes one on each foot and here is what I found so I've just done a sidebyside mile in the novablast 5 on my left foot I've got the S ride 17 on the right foot I would use these shoes for pretty much the same kinds of run they actually feel very very similar in terms of the softness and the Cushing you're going to get there's more cushioning in the no blast 5 for sure really sinks a bit lower than the ride 17 comes back a bit quicker but they're both going to take the edge off those kind of long easy slow miles you've also got a little bit of a lower stack on the ride 17 so that might be a deciding factor I find it a little bit more stable than nov blast 5 the no blast 5 isn't an unstable shoe for me but the ride 17 is just a bit more of a reliable platform to run off got a big wide 4ot as well yeah I like both of these shoes actually I could do easy easy miles in them I think you could do uptempo in some of them as well so R 17's been out for a while now no blast 5 is a new shoe um R 17 is still a fantastic shoe really really solid daily trainer um almost uh a worthy um successor in some ways to the Triumph 20 and 21 because now the 22 is not not really the same shoe as those the ride 17 is very similar R to what you're expecting from those sort of daily cushion shoes where you want comfort you want cushioning but you also want to do a bit more you want a bit of Versatility uh for a pretty good price as well um big fan of the ride 17 um I think it's a solid all round running shoe feels quite stable um feels very comfortable to wear but also it just feels like it's got a bit more to it a bit of responsiveness to it um and definitely issue that uh I would take with me if I was going away on holiday and I wanted something to do lots of different runs in um also has a great outsole as well um really solid grip on the outsole and quite sturdy as well no signs of wear te on my ride 17 after about 100K running in it over the past year no blast 5 uh is a shoe that if I was comparing the ride 17 to the no blast 4 they're quite similar shoes you get a similar experience i' use them for similar things they've got same sort of level of responsiveness I'd probably say no blast 4 is a little bit little bit more bouncy um than the R 17 but not massively overall they're very comparable shoes those those two and I think they're both very good all around of daily shoes that you can use for a lot of training um the sit at the same sort of price noas F has changed his missile phone to FF blast Max which is softer um which I normally I would really really like um but I think what it's done in the nol 5 is it's taking a little bit of the um responsiveness away with that softness at easy runs it feels very very comfortable absolutely fine no issues at all when you're picking up the pace a bit when you're I've been marathon training for Valencia recently A lot of my runs have been really a consistent pace for an hour an hour and a half uh and when I'm doing those runs and I'm trying to maintain close to my marathon time so uh I'm 4 minute 30 4 minute 40 uh per kilometer what I'm looking for is a shoe that helps me out a bit and gives me a little bit uh nice nice turnover maybe a little bit of bounds a little bit of response enough so I can just maintain that pace for a consist period ride 17 would be fine at that it just really smoothly just you know you can you can move along nicely and it it really helps you it's nice and nice turnover nice bit of responsiveness uh no blast 5 if you're if I'm trying to run for a longer period at a pace that isn't really really comfortable for me which is about 430 I'm I'm pushing myself to do that pace doesn't seem to be helping me the midell phone feels a little bit sluggish um and it doesn't quite give me a lot of energy back when I'm I'm running at that pace easier Paces it's fine I'm not expecting it to do anything particularly amazing at easy Pace you do get a little bit of bounce back from that midell foam um but I think when you're running faster you probably putting a little bit more pressure into that Mido foam um and you're just not getting as much back as I'd normally like from a shoe that I'm doing faster training in so no blast 5 whereas the no blast 4 was a really good allrounder shoe very similar to The Ride 17 I'd say that no blast 5 is now firmly an easy day shoe a comfortable shoe that you take off the miles in but you're not going to go out and run fast efforts in it or use it for inter sessions or anything like that um that's not a bad thing unless you want versatility uh and and a lot of people do want versatility these days that was one of the good things about some of the Nova blast versions is that you could use them as your one shoe that you'd buy and you do lots of different training sessions in I don't think the no blast 5 is going to be able to do that now I think it's just a little bit too easy day orientated and I think that um it will struggle uh it you'll struggle if you get it and you want to do lots of intervals in because it does feel a little bit uh energy sapping to me at certain Paces uh the is absolutely fine on it um it's got good covering it's got this trampoline inspired outsole which I've never quite understood what it means but um absolutely fine no issues at all with this um I haven't really been running much in the wet in it um so I'm not sure how it how it deals with wet ground but for me on most of the surfaces I've run it it's been absolutely fine so the ride 17 and the no blast 5 I think are both very solid daily trainers at a decent price kind of sitting in the middle of their range of shoes for each of their respective Brands I think they have a pretty in offensive ride all round they're reasonably versatile but mostly quite cushioned and protective I think they'll both work for a nice wide range of Runners and I enjoyed running both of them even if neither are very spectacular shoes in any way they're not really the most Lively or exciting shoes out there but they do a really good job and I think both provide pretty good value as well there is a pretty big difference in the ride field between the shoes though and that mostly comes down to the foam in the midsole they've got slightly different geometries as well I think You' got a slightly more smooth Rocket Ride on the ax nose blast 5 but really it's difference in the Foams here um with the rides 17 I think you've got a firmer denser material with this power run plus foam you know it's pretty comfortable but it's not redesigned to be squishy and soft or anything like that it certainly provides enough Comfort but it's got a good level of resiliency so as you roll through you get a little bit of responsiveness off the forefoot and you know it is quite a verstile foam around I think it is just quite dense and heavy though is the way I feel about it so although I like the shoe and I like this foam I think it's just not perfect for me I'm quite a high Cadence Runner I'm not the heaviest runner in the world and I think sometimes I don't really sink it enough into this phone to get a lot of rebound out of it because it is quite dense like I said whereas no blast 5 I found the foam on the new shoe to be really nice like certainly got a softer ride than the ride 17 you're sinking a bit more but I haven't any problems with it feeling mushy or anything like that it's bounced back nicely for me and I have found it quite a nice spritely ride a shoe I've enjoyed using quite a lot I know the other guys have found it not that verstile and a bit too mushy and soft but I think it's got a good level of softness actually it's comfortable at the back there and then I do roll through it quite well and get a bit of spring off the toes again neither of these are the most Lively Foams like I say they're not really super Foams or anything like that they're comfortable not giving a huge amount of punch or anything like that but they do feel good under foot without necessarily being you know amazing as I mentioned I did find the nose blast a bit smoother myself as a heel Striker I find I just move through my foot strike a little bit better and it disappears in the foot a little bit more than the ride 17 for me which has a bit more of a thudding ride to it I think again because of that that slightly denser foam you have there and I do think also the fact that nose blast is a fair bit lighter certainly helps out on that front I find I can just tick through my runs a bit more you know easily in a more relaxed fashion in the no blast 5 and that lightness does mean it's a bit better when it comes to picking up the Pace neither of the shoeses I'd say are incredibly verstile I think they're fine I think it's daily trainers you can do a bit of faster running in them I'd prefer to be in a more speed Focus shoe myself for any kind of workout or races but if you just want to cushion daily trainers to do a bit of everything I think both of these shoes do a decent job I think the Nova blast is a little bit more versatile because is that a little bit lighter and like I say I think the foam isn't too mushy or anything like that they're both pretty stable as well like neither is a stability shoe but I haven't any real concerns of either despite the fact the no blast in particular is a high stack shoe I think it's wide enough and still pretty stable with side Falls of foam there so on neither shoe is explicitly a stability shoe I don't think either shoe has a problem with stability either so yeah all around pretty solid shoes I did do a run wearing both shoes at the same time and it kind of bore out those differences you just got that denser feeling that slightly firmer feeling with the ride 17 for me a slightly softer and spriter ride from the nove blast 5 but I know the other guys disagree a bit on that and find it maybe a bit too soft in which case they might well prefer the more resilient foam in the ride 17 okay my verdict on these two shoes um it's pretty easy one for me uh when I look at Daily shoes in this category I'm looking for a shoe that can do lots of different things um if I'm comparing these two when it comes to being daily allr rounders ride 17 is by far the superior shoe you just get a lot more um of everything really it's a bit more stable it's a a bit more responsive it's got a nicer turnover for me um and it just feels like you can do a lot of different things in it the only thing it doesn't do amazingly well for me is easy runs and the no blast does do that and that is really what the no blast 5 is now it's a it's a comfortable easy day daily training shoe uh which it's competing with um more of those sort of cushion shoes now I think things like the BR B Max the new band more V5 shoes like that where you're just buying a shoe for comfort and and cushioning and you're not really doing a lot of other training in it I think that's what this shoe is now um I don't think it's espcially designed for lots of Versatility that's not a bad thing it's just tricky with AN overb line because they Chang the way that the shoe rides quite a lot so if you're a lot of people will buy running shoes um the same line all the time because they trust that line and they know that it's designed for them but I think with a Nova blast you don't get that every time because you you get slightly different shoe each time and you're never quite sure if the new version is going to be right um but if you're looking at these two shoes and you you want a really good allrounder shoe solid does does everything you want I'd go for the right 17 if you're just looking for comfort in Easy Day sessions I probably still wouldn't get the nebli because I even though it focuses on that easy Day stuff I think there are better Easy Day shoes out there I think if you're looking for Pure Comfort uh and cushioning I'd go for the New Balance Mor V 5 um so like the Brooks Glycerin Max bit more expensive so it's a bit out of the same price league as this but um for me I think there are better Easy Day shoes out there and the magic of the novas line has always been that versatility which I don't think it quite does anymore still think it's a nice shoot to run in I just think it lacks a bit on versatility so I'm going to go for the ride 17 all the way when it comes to daily running shoes it comes to my verdict on these two shoes I think they're both good options I think there's a lot of similarities between them in terms of price performance versatility but I prefer the ride filler than nose blast 5 myself like it's softer without being too soft it's a bit lighter and a bit spriter and livelier on the run and I find I just kind of enjoy running in it a bit more I also think it has a little bit more about it in terms of fast running because it is a lighter shoe and I find I can pick up the pace a bit more smoothly in it than in the ride 17 but there's not a lot to pick between them really on performance it's probably just going to come down to the ride F you prefer that slightly softer ride you have on the nose blast 5 or the more resilient firm ride on the ride 17 so yeah two really solid shoes I'd say despite my preference for the nose blast 5 if I saw the ride 17 the sale for like 450 quid less I'd be very happy to pick that up instead and as it is the older shoe and a very popular line it's certainly the shoe that's likelier to pop up in SES sooner so yeah I would look out for that CU you're probably going to get a good deal on the ride 17 soon verdict then and I think these two shoes cover very similar types of run they're better at the easy end but they're capable up towards marathon pace as well I think they're both very competent daily trainers as well I've enjoyed my runs in both of the shoes and the testing that I've done for me the major difference comes down to the Nova blast 5 having a sof and more cushioned Edge thanks to the slightly bigger stack I think some will prefer that particularly at the easier end of things where you want a bit more cushioning you're also saving a bit of weight on the no blast 5 despite that bigger stack so it's probably a shoe that's maybe a shade more speed friendly however I find the ride 17 more consistent and a bit smoother the lower stat ride suits my style more I get a bit more ease in the transition from the ride 17 rocker so if I was choosing one shoe I think I'd probably choose the ride 17 and not least because you can now pick it up on really good deals it'll do the same job I think as the novablast 5 overall in terms of the runs just a bit cheaper the Nova blast 5 though is still a good shoe so there you have it that's been our head-to-head between the S ride 17 and the aex NOA blast 5 we hope you found it informative and helpful if you liked it enough to want more make sure you hit the Subscribe button ring

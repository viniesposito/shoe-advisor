  "text": "over the past 6 months I've been buying the best rated running products on Amazon to see if they are actually any good I've purchased a real mix of different gadgets clothing nutrition skin care recovery tools and of course 100% with my own money there's absolutely nothing here sponsored I've been testing all of these things out really really vigorously to see if they're going to improve my running or it all be one big disappointment and waste of money right starting out guys I bought a couple of pairs of balaga socks the best rated socks I could find on Amazon they were really comfortable durable still going strong I've done probably a good couple hundred K in these socks and they show absolutely no signs of giving up yet no holes or anything like that in terms of the cons they are a little bit expensive Amazon pricing is always a little bit all over the place different sizes of different prices they are really quite thick as well I think if you do run in a slightly hotter climate you are going to struggle these are not going to be the most breathable socks and in terms of my rating I would give these a 4.8 as well moving on to energy gels to help with those all important long runs and marathon training I bought these CIS isotonic energy drills you get this variety pack in a box loads of different flavors 22 G of carb in sport and vegan as well but I've been using CIS gels for a very long time and what I really really like about them is you don't need any water with these they're really really liquidy and where I've always really like to use these like on the start line of races where you might not have some water around as well really nice flavors so if you're the kind of person that suffers with maybe some like Flavor fatigue you got loads of different options here that you can have on your run and also coming at just about a pound of gel so something like Morton which is sort of a bit of the market leader you only about3 of gel in terms of the negatives of the cyst gels they are a little bit on the large side as well and quite heavy for gels and they can just get a little bit messy they're a little bit hard to open and these pull tabs do sort of come off and then normally they fall on the floor which isn't really great as well but for someone trying GS for the first time I always really recommend to a lot of people start out with something like cyst gels they're really good on the stomach they've never given me any issues for me i' give these four stars personally yeah they're not going to be the best gels out there in the world but for the value you're getting for these they really are fantastic next up on the list is one of the most oddest looking things can you guess what this is yet a lot of you guys recommended this during the winter and I thought I had to get this in now to make it for this video so this is what's called a shoe dryer really good for any homes a bit like ours without any sort of warm rooms so something like this can be really good just to get your shoes dry when you've washed them or you've been out in the pouring wind and rain down with rain Guys these shoes are welling through the drenched so let's get back home and's see how long it takes them to dry and after I came in after this run the shoes took about 40 minutes on here to be completely bone dry there basically like some heating elements in the bottom here and a little fan inside here and then it blows hot air out these things here so you rest your shoes on on there and it just basically just very simply blows hot air out into the shoes to help dry them a little bit like a hair dryer I suppose but nowhere near as hot as a haird dryer and yeah overall it worked really well I was quite surprised I wasn't expecting much in the depths of winter when I'll be using this sort of thing a lot more in terms of the negatives it was surprisingly loud if you live in a small place it might be a little bit annoying so yeah I'd give that four four stars to me now following on from that when I was cleaning my shoes I was using this the boot buddy maybe one of the most famous things to have been on a program called Dragon Den in the UK Americans call this shark tank fill it full of soapy lukewarm water clean your shoes get all that muck off them and then you've also got a scraper here on the back as well just to get any sort of nasty or really dried on bits on there as well in terms of what I really like about it it did the job well it cleaned my shoes it got rid of dried mud or fresh wet stuff as well easy to use super portable if you're going out to the trails you can just take some water with you clean your shoes before you get back in the car in terms of what wasn't very good about it it does run out of water quite quickly a lot of water does come out here so it needs refilling a little bit but one of these will probably did one shoe for me so I need to refill it once to do two shoes if you have got quite small hands it might not be the easiest thing to grip I've got quite big hands so that's what it looks like on there in terms of my rating 4 and a half stars for this only sort of slightly let down because for me I'd like a little bit of a bigger reservoir on it next up I bought some Cal sleeves compression for your calf muscles basically supporting your muscles when you're out there doing activity helping increase blood flow and your recovery ARS as well the thing with compression technology it could will be a little bit up here in the head but I just basically like to put these on when I'm out on the trip Trails it keeps my legs a little bit cleaner stops any sort of brambles and Stingers just nasty things when you get out on the trails it just helps look after my legs a little bit better so in terms of what I liked about these they were just great they were comfortable they were fine the compressed Spore and 2xu like the flagship ones are going to be about 3540 a pairs these are so much cheaper and they did pretty much the same thing I didn't personally notice any difference at all in terms of the what negatives these aren't as nice of materials as those High Flagship ones but essentially they're all doing the same job so yeah four stars for me moving on we have this rather rather Natty invention here bit like a sort of a sports bra really essentially what this is is for carrying around your phone in here in this sort of pouch here you can also put a few little valy boys and your car keys up in here this is an iPhone 14 like the normal size and you can just sort of Chuck that in there along with your house keys or whatever and some other little valuables and then go for a run and it works quite well stops everything bouncing around I do see quite a lot of people running around London in these type of things since I've always been curious to get one in and just see how it feels it's a really good option if you don't know the person that doesn't like an armband or you don't want anything around your waist or you don't want a big sort of pack in terms of what I didn't like about it it's just not my sort of style if I'm being perfectly honest and it just seems like a lot of material and faf just for basically carrying your phone which I really personally rather do in my running belt and that works absolutely fine not really the kind of thing I'm going to ever be using again and keeping in my rotation but yeah not to knock it at all but I would personally give it three stars now longer term viewers of the channel know my favorite way of carrying my phone and my valuables is with something called a naked band and that just goes around your waist and you can really good carry poles you get loads of stuff in there it's fantastic but a kit but they don't sell that on Amazon so I can't be reviewing that here but what they do sell on Amazon is probably the best selling belt in the world which is something called a flip belt very sort of similar style of thing and I've really been enjoying using this one here can stick my phone in the back here again some valuable in there as well my keys on this really handy little clip that keeps them nice safe and secure in terms of what you really like about this thing super comfortable got lots of different colors as well I just went for the plain black easily holds my iPhone 14 in here and I can you can also add some gels in there as well and it doesn't bounce around at all what I don't like about it it would be nice to have a bit of a security pocket here with a zip but I never had any issues with my keys just on there but stuff can potentially fall out I didn't lose anything myself but some of the reviewers did mention that yeah a little bit on the pricey side but really good quality product in here I'd give this 4.3 out of five right moving on to some nutrition products I bought this massive thing of vegan protein powder 20 g of protein I'm actually on my second packet here now you can get it in chocolate or vanilla flavor 100% of vitamin D B12 and B6 as well and you get loads of other quantities of zinc and magnesium and iron fruits and vitamins in there as well as the protein that you need taste okay probably the best tasting vegan protein as a dedicated protein shake that I've been able to ever find Blends okay too it's got no nasty additives in there and it isn't too sweet it isn't sickly sweet and it also doesn't really taste too artificial as we also quite nice packaging quite cool packaging and and you can request it without a scoop because we've all got Scoops in our houses already and they'll also plant a tree for you if you message them after you bought it they will actually plant a tree which is a nice little Eco tip there it does get a little bit thick and gritty it doesn't have many carbs in here so if you're looking for a dedicated recovery Shake there something like cyrio will be better just got a bit more carbs in there so this isn't going to be replacing my cyrio but it's just a nice little extra thing if I feel like I need an extra protein boost during the day so yeah keep this into my rotation as I said I've finished the vanilla one that was great Chuck one enjoying that one as well in terms of my rating we'll give that four and a half Stars right sticking with the nutrition theme is Tailwind you bought a load of these stick packs and I've been using them so much this year to get ready for a big cycle race I did a few months ago so when I've been doing a training on my bike I've been using the tail wind products for that and been feeling really good by using them Tailwind say that this is all you're going to need so you can get all of your sugar salts and minerals you're not going to need to takeing any other types of fuel or carbohydrate I don't really agree with that we'll come on to that in a minute in my own testing of it what I really liked about it very very mild flavor it's not overpowering it's really drinkable even when I was feeling rough at the end of some of my cycles and some of the runs I was doing I could always get this down so that was a really sort of big positive very easy to drink lots of different flavor options you get incaffeinated or non-caffeinated as well and I've really seen a really good Improvement in how long I can last on the bik done plenty of 100 mile rides in the flat here on Swift and 100 mile rides outside as well I've definitely seen a really big Improvement in how long I can go for and just feeling better for a little bit longer during my Cycles as well the stick packs of these are really convenient you can put them in the back and when you are out in the run just having these in your pack is really convenient as well in terms of the negatives of these the packs are really quite to open they are really fiddly and I struggled pretty much every time trying to get into these things I just still felt in during my running part of this I ran a 50 mile race a few weeks ago with these I still need to top up with other things but from a cycling point of view these were absolutely fantastic in terms of my rating I'm going to give it like a five for cycling for me but in terms of running it was about a three next up we've got one of my absolute favorites but as I had to stock up in the last few months on my body Glide I thought why not including this review because I love this stuff it's stops me chafing it's basically this sort of almost like a roll on deodorant type thing you can put it between your legs by your arms anywhere where you're going to have some skin on skin contact to stop that dreaded chafing and potentially ruining your runs I've been using this for absolutely years and it's just an absolute staple in my running routine in terms of what I like it just works if you put this on you're not going to get any chafing and it doesn't really smell of anything at all it's really portable easy application and no mess at all in terms of what I don't like like about it absolutely nothing really I guess they could have some more eco-friendly not plastic packaging but that's about it five stars for me next up guys is my aftershocks headphones now technically I bought these about 3 years ago people always ask me what headphones to use so I thought I'd sneak them in because I bought these on Amazon or bit about 3 years ago these are basically bone conducting headphones you can usually use these in races because you can hear everything that's going around you there's a really good safety aspect to the headphones if you're running around a big city near Cod battery life is really good I'm still getting at least 8 hours out of these headphones really good sound quality so long as you're listening to podcast or audiobook spoken word stuff sounds really good through this and music isn't great you know dedicated proper headphones in your ear will be much better for music and these are an absolute staple in my running routine I basically can't really go for a run without these I absolutely go everywhere with them in ter what I don't like about them you can only really use them for running if you're going to be using these for commuting or any sort of noisy eras you're not going to hear anything that's going on mod and areas you're going to be absolutely fine noisy areas you can't hear anything and the only other negative I can really think of is they have their own dedicated light I think it's called proprietary type cable which if you lose it or you forget it you're not going to be able to charge it I'd really love it if something like this was USBC but it's only a minor sort of setback overall 4.8 I'll give that it's just annoy it annoys me with the stupid charging cable moving on to some more nutrition stuff now people are often asking me if I could recommend any like snacks and things to have on the go and this is about the best sort of thing I can find find naked bars I think they're a British company actually fruit and nut bars basically in the states and you can get them in the UK if you got a whole food and things you get Lara bars well this is probably something about the most equivalent to something like that 100% natural ingredients no added sugar raw cold press available in most big supermarkets they are quite cheap on Amazon and you can buy them in these big boxes I think it's 18 bars in a box my personal favorite was the lemon I just love lemon stuff anyway in terms of what I like about it reasonably cheap I paid \u00a313 a box of 18 bars and you get loads of different flavor options and it's just super convenient when traveling they don't make any mess but in terms of what they look like it's basically just like that and if you bite into it there's nothing that falls down so it's quite good to have in the car if you're going somewhere in terms of the ingredients list all that's got in this one is dates raisin almonds coconut cashews lemon and a h hint of natural flavorings and that's not too bad some not you get some long massive ingredients and they're just a good thing to have in the store cupboard if you ever get a little bit package in terms of the negatives because they're sort of like natural fruit then the sugars are in them a little bit high if you're someone that has some sugar problems then maybe steer a little bit clear of something like this so for me 4 and 1 half Stars they're just a little bit on the small side and I only end up eating two at a time right next up is this thing it is incredibly heavy but basically this is called a slant board and I bought this a while ago to really help with my ankle strength cuz some of you might know I broke my ankle in a skateboarding accident about 4 years ago go now I'm really always working on my ankle dors deflection to really try and improve that range of motion have a bit really big disparity between my good foot and my bad foot and also using it to stretch out my carve stretch out my CES you can adjust it to all sorts of different heights there's loads of slant boards around this is definitely on the premium side of things in terms of build quality but solid metal really good grip you get on here as well it's like sandpaper type thing but it feels really nice just in bare feet as well you can definitely get something a little bit more on the cheaper side and I've seen really good improvements with my ankle range of motion if I just test it out and then go on this for a few minutes and then test it again it really does help improve that in terms of negatives but this one in particular it's very very heavy you're not really going to transport this around too easily so what would I give this definitely five out of five next up is this some sun cream from a company called life jacket as some of you guys know I ran the Boston Marathon this year I can't put any of that footage up on the screen cuz Boston and Marathon will not like that but during the race I got quite badly sunburnt because I was really stupid I'm normally so conscious of looking after my skin but it just didn't feel that hot that day I just forgot about it and got badly some got some heat stroke it's a real issue and after the race I did a lot of research and stumbled across this and I thought this would be really good and I've been putting into my rotation for going out on the hotter days in terms of what I really liked about it it just goes on really well it's not really greasy it doesn't leave any white marks and when you get super sweaty on your long runs and things it doesn't really matter it just all sort of rubs in really quite nicely and really like the company and what they stand for it SED by three guys one of them unfortunately got skin cancer and they started this company so where we're checking out some of these smaller companies selling their products on Amazon so they only make one which is Factor 50 plus it is a little bit expensive but \u00a320 that's going to be a whole year of suncream for me the rating on Amazon gives 4.3 I think it's probably a bit higher than that for me personally so yeah 4.8 for this moving on I bought another foot roller because I lost my beloved roll recovery R3 I went on Amazon searched for foot rollers and this was available on same day delivery which is super convenient one of the perks of living in central London so it's really good for rolling out the underside of your feet keep plant our fasciitis at Bay rolling your feet on these little nodules here it just helps massage that fascia sort of stretch it out a little bit I really like this middle section they have in the middle it sort of raises up in the middle you get some really good angles going on underneath your foot it's super lightweight hardly anything at all so really good for traveling around and the spikes in this one particular one aren't too harsh Sarah has an orange one under her desk but it's really really severe in terms of what I didn't like about it it does just feel very cheaply made it does pick up a little bit of dust and things like that but it got the job done I give that four out of five now if you want to know what the best rated running shoe on Amazon is then that video is coming up so go and check that out so I hope you enjoyed the video guys I've really enjoyed putting this video together testing out these products and bringing that completely impartial honest review as we always do on the channel keep on working hard guys keep done we'll see you very soon in the next one",

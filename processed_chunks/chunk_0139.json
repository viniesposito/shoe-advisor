  "text": "is it possible to run faster with less effort well yes it's something Elite and pro level Runners have mastered and the good news is that you can as well so what's their secret how can we run smoother faster run longer and make our runs just overall feel a lot easier but stick around because we've got all that coming up and by the end of this video you'll know exactly what you should be doing the first thing we can be working on is improving our running form if we can improve our running form and move more efficiently we'll get from point A to point B using a lot less energy more advanced Runners often look so relaxed as if they're just gliding along so how have they worked at achieving this well I've got five ways here that will really help you the first one being is improving our Cadence now running with a higher Cadence will really reduce the amount of force coming up through your legs beginner Runners are usually running around about 150 to 160 and will greatly benefit from inred inreasing their Cadence a little bit more up to the 170s 180s sort of Mark the simplest way of starting out on your Cadence journey is by using a metronome you can then set the Cadence you want and it will Tap Away in the background as you run along and you can time your strides monitor it and then have a look after you're on as well on Garmin or on choros again whichever app you're using and then you can monitor that over time and gradually start to increase it don't go from big chunks just gradually work at increasing it we've got a video all about how how to improve your cence I'll link to that up here and at the end of the video and down below we will also want to be improving our body position and leaning from the ankles a forward lean is how advanced runners use gravity to help propel them forwards the best way you can practice doing this is by stopping your runs and then just leaning into it in my early days of running I used to do this all the time just for the first like 500 me of a run just constantly stopping and starting just leaning forward and starting running like that your body will naturally go into that nice forward lean and then you can just relax stop and do it again and just repeating this all the time will really help you don't to do this on all of your runs but maybe just a couple of your easy runs throughout the week just to practice also we want to really be working on our core muscles doing things like Bridges and planks will help build that strong core that we need to support all of our upper body as it rotates and it keeps our arm strings in check because all of this if you haven't got a strong core all this going on is just wasted energy we also want to make sure our feet are landing nicely underneath our Center of mass the foot strike doesn't matter as much a midfoot strike heel strike 4ft strike is not as important what is important is making sure it lands nicely underneath our Center of mass this will be the best place for our body to efficiently absorb the impact and to maximize that energy return to Spring Forward quite often people will overstride and overreach you're just constantly creating that breaking force every time you run which is just a complete waste of energy you don't be applying the brakes bring that back and we'll be able to move across the ground in a far far more efficient way I've got two other simple things we can doing to improve our form the first one is strides long-term viewers of the channel know I talk about this all the time they're absolutely fantastic quite simply 20 seconds of really fast running 90 to 95% effort here with about a 20 to 30 second very relaxed chilled recovery between each stride I'd really recommend four to six strides put these maybe after one of your easy runs during the week you can even do them during one of your easy runs as well it's very hard to run this fast with bad running forms it really helps train the brain to get ourselves moving in a far more efficient way the final one being Hill reps now hear me out cuz Hill reps are really really good yes of course they're hard work but they really help promote a really good foot placement again nicely under that Center of mass and really helps improve our strength as well they get you really strong and moving in a nice way strength training something I've personally been doing a hell of a lot this year and I'm really starting to see the massive benefits in my own running as well the stronger that our muscles are the more Force we can put through them and therefore run further without tiring out quite as quickly now this doesn't have to mean lifting huge weights it can simply be doing some basic exercises at home without the need for any equipment just things like doing some squat lunges calf raises all really good for that leg strength and then things like planks and bridges as well will really help to improve our core which as we talked about earlier really good for supporting that upper body so I'd recommend picking a few of these different exercises and putting together a little circuit for around about 20 minutes is a really good starting point four exercises 1 minute for each exercise four to five rounds of this with just a minute rest between each round I'd always recommend tagging these onto your easy run days and make sure you keep your rest days as complete rest that's when our body's adapting absorbing everything we're throwing about it so you need to keep your rest days as rest days add the strength work to those easy run days we also do have a strength guide which integrates into all of our training plans which you can see on our website whatever distance you're training for check out benp parks.com and add on that strength training option if you want a complete guide on how to integrate this with your training thirdly is all about improving our running Fitness and this may seem like a really obvious one the fitter we get the faster we'll get running at the same sort of effort level but how do we work at improving our running Fitness well quite simply this is by doing some speed sessions during the week couple of really good ones 4 to 6times 3 minutes at around about our 5K Pace with a 2minute walking recovery 3 to four reps of 5 minutes around about our 10K Pace with a 2-minute walk recovery or perhaps try a pyramid session is 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 these numbers represent minutes of running fast around about our 5 to 10K pace for these with a 90c walking recovery between the Reps now doing sessions like this will really help improve that V2 Max improve our running Fitness overall but it also does add a lot of stress to the body so it's really important for the rest of the week to be doing a lot of our easy miles and at least making sure we're having one maybe two full rest days during the week now warming up before you head out on your run is so important especially as we get a little bit older and another way to definitely make those early stages of that run feel a hell of a lot easier so make sure you're taking that 5 to 10 minutes to warm up properly before you're heading out the door mobilizing our joints with some dynamic stretches we've got a really good follow along video I'll link to that up here and down below as well and then easing into that run really nice and gradually that first couple of Cs should be nice and relax a lot slower than what we want to be doing for our whole run and once you're up to speed you'll feel far more relaxed and using a lot less effort another thing that can make running feel really hard is when you haven't fueled or hydrated properly beforehand now a lot of people when they start out running either eat far too much just before they head out and they're going to feel very sluggish and slow or they don't have enough and then they're going to feel very sort of weak and risk the chance of getting dehydrated so I'd really recommend is having a small snack or something around about 30 minutes to 1 hour before heading out and also avoiding the hottest parts of the day as well you can be running at exactly the the same Pace that you'd used be running at but your body is going to be having to put a lot more effort into keeping you at the pace that you want to be running at so make sure you're heading out in the mornings or in the evenings make sure you're getting nicely hydrated with some good fuel on board before you head out as well and then you'll be using a lot less effort running at the pace you want to be running at now I wasn't sure whether to put this one in the video so let me know your thoughts down below all about Super Shoes these carbon plated Super Shoes that burst on the scene around about sort of 6 seven years ago and now pretty much every Pro so many amateur Runners are going out and spending vast amounts of money on these shoes in the hope that they can be using less energy to run from point A to point B in all these shoes they have these carbon plates that run throughout the whole length of the shoe or some of them they have Nyon plates and these plates help to propel us forward with each stride and then they have this huge chunk of foam in there as well to help protect the legs from that impact so our muscles will be fatiguing a little bit L Nike's famous 4% shoes I had my orange ones I'll put those up on the screen now claim to improve Times by as much as that 4% so for a 4-Hour marathoner they can be looking at a 10minute Improvement going to 3our 50 so why wouldn't you want that free speed will you automatically just run faster by just putting on a pair of these shoes well it all depends in reality a lot of these benefits are far more prominent in Faster runners in a lot of the studies they Define faster Runners by any anyone running 4 hours or less for the marathon but anyone can see these small improvements by wearing a super shoe compared to their regular shoe without a doubt so why wouldn't we go about wearing a super shoe every day well they do have their downsizes they're very very expensive for a start they're uncomfortable they tend to not last very long and they're also not very versatile they really are only good at races and during our speed sessions as well and the body can come a little bit too reliant on technology and we can actually lose strength or not gain as much strength as we could by running in some more regular shoes we'll link to an interesting article down below about why doing all of your runs in Super Shoes really is not the best idea but without a doubt for the vast majority of people doing our races in these new fangled Super Shoes amazing things you've got the cash to do it and you can afford to do it they are going to make a difference to our running time by literally doing as this video says moving from point A to point B using less energy let me know down in the comments have super shoes made a big difference to you I'd love to know but with all of this for me the biggest improvements can be made by correcting our running form which is where I'd personally recommend that you spend a lot of our efforts that is going to give you some really good longterm gains in running hopefully also decrease that chance of picking up injuries as well so let me know how you get on with all of these tips if you've got some other ones let me know down in the comments and help out the running Community got two different videos coming up next one all about improving our Cadence and one all about mental tricks to help you get out there and run a little bit longer as well so check those out keep on working hard guys keep done we'll see you very soon in the next one",

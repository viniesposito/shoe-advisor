much better then so I will start inviting today okay okay but if you want to mention it at school feel free you guys can get out it's it's 7:30 all right love you have a great day at school did you open the back oh yeah oh yeah great job uh with the baseball game okay bye Michael I love you bye SE bye and they're off as are we now I could I could go to a track I could you know we can go do some oval Loops you I don't mind it but it's like track run uphill track Sprint uphill track get out in nature a little more track uh chase down some nice little vertical gain that's what we're up to today today it's I I know we're getting ready for a birthday mile but at the end of the day you know my passion is up in the Hill Country so year I was actually thinking uh a little reflection last night and I was like man how long has it been and I believe it was October which I did not film but October 2023 when the snow hit here in Colorado and I was unable to uh chase down some some goodness up into High Country so why is it so fun to run uphill quickly hastily I don't know you tell me oh man what question of the day what is your favorite form of running favorite niche of running mine is uphill it's so strange but I just love it and uh hold on I just got to get this tag off somehow uh the pulse R3 we're taking out the one and two have been my go-to for the last 2 years uh the the Brooks agile though has my attention I'm excited about this shoe as well probably a little bit longer fkt action proba I'm like like 10 miles plus 12 miles plus this is the shorter shorter shoe for today which uh we're going we are going about 5 miles though to the top here in beautiful Boulder Colorado and it's like light in the Jets man um as far as not necessarily speed this is a rustbuster an out of shape rustbuster today I have not gone fast like this in a long time but you got to start somewhere you remember you're not out of shape you're just early in the process so we are really early in fact we might hit snow on the way up there's no guarantee that it's going to be melted up there from we got snow here in Colorado last weekend so uh we might hit snow but we're early in the process but you got to start somewhere as you're working toward your goals and that is what we're doing today uh just having a little fun up in the uh up in the this isn't even the high country this is the this is the low country uh about 6,000 ft here at the start and I don't even know what we'll I think I'll top out at about 7800 maybe 8,000 not sure it's a little toasty out here little toasty we're going to try the goggles by the way they're dinit Dina fit dinit Dina fit whatever you want to call them d y n a fit so oh some other Runners are reporting in that they have the similar eye issue that I have so we'll see how they perform with respect to uh letting my eyes breathe a little bit right up there all right let's go [Music] [Music] sry buddy [Music] that'll bust some Rust if I might say so myself wo oh my my 6 miles to the top not 5.4 so you know straa we love Strava we all love Strava around here but it's sometimes a little difficult to find the correct segment before you actually do the segment and it's crazy I lived in Boulder for 5 years in college never I never had gone on that trail before because so many trails so little time but now that I've been on the trail now straa recognizes that basically they rerouted this Trail about looks like about two years ago based on the times that I'm seeing here congrats to Ryan David and Brad uh I was it looks like my time will put me in about fourth place for this segment so I was 50 2 minutes to the top it ended up being 2400 vertical feet and uh over 6 mil so about a 7.7% grade and it was a doozy it was fun it was it was hard I was working I felt strong though for the first hard uphill effort in I don't know four or five months I will take it and didn't get the fkt but that's okay again congrats to Ryan he has a 50 minute5 and so I got to drop about 2 minutes for that Ryan is is he is always throwing down like uh I don't know him but um whenever I'm you know scouting other mountains up in the High Country I always see his name so oh man that was good and what else was I going to say oh yeah the downhill I have found that it takes about four to six weeks of downhill running before your quads begin to adapt to that downhill and I just even though I'm doing the 23m long run with the up and down it's just different when you're going down steep mountain and with when you're negotiating the rocks on the way down as well the Pulsar threes epic felt amazing feel a lot like the the you know the two a little better grip I could sense and then uh I don't know they felt really good I can tell I can tell they updated the material a little bit to be a little more Nimble over the top of the foot so good job I'm feeling very good about the Pulsar three I think that's it a good rustbuster didn't get it today but we'll be back next week to uh another week Another Mountain if you know what I mean all right Mountain running season oh I am I amped up this is good uh oh yeah oh yeah I don't know if this camera I haven't used it in probably about a year it's an old camera I don't know if it worked hopefully it did and I got some footage some very uh interesting footage along the way pretty simple with this little insta 360 to go all right I think we'll toss it we'll go we'll put it in the mountain running Mountain running playlist oh we got to if you like Mountain running go watch this all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

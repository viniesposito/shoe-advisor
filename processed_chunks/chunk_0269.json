  "text": "hello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and in this video I'm going to be comparing the Hoka Mac X2 and the Nike zoomfly [Music] 6 so the Mac X2 and zoomfly 6 are both plated training shoes that are designed to be used either in partnership with a carbon plate racing shoe or as racing SLT trining shoes themselves both these models are significant improvements on the previous versions of the shoe in my opinion and both are very much among my favorite shoes of the year but then both in my top five running shoes of 2024 because I've really enjoyed spending a lot of time in both of these shoes but there are certainly differences between them that might make them suitable to different Runners the zoomfly cost \u00a3155 in the UK $17 in the US the Mac X2 is a little bit more expensive it's \u00a3170 in the UK and then $190 in the US Mac X2 is a slightly lighter shoe at 255 G or 9 oz in uk9 whereas a zoom fly is 266 G or 9.",

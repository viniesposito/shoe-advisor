  "text": "after really enjoying the Mac 4 and Mac 5 I've been eagerly anticipating this Mac 6 update when I heard about all the changes I was really worried though but was I right to be concerned well stay tuned as we dive into all that and more with the full review of the Hoka ma version 6 my name is Ben Parks 225 Marathon please excuse this work going on behind me at the moment we're getting set up for the London Marathon Expo we hope to see a lot of you there as we're exhibiting our whole range which you can see on benp parks.com any time but today we're talking all about this new latest and greatest update from hoker going to go through the facts and figures the changes my likes dislikes and is this going into rotation so without further Ado let's get stuck into the facts and figures so the purpose of the hookup Max 6 well this is an everyday non-plated speed shoe perfect for your daily miles and slightly faster runs as well this shoe set me back \u00a3140 I bought the shoe 100% with my own money here off the hoko website in the UK I give that completely honest impartial review it's going to be about \u20ac60 or $140 the stack out of the back 37 mil at the back of the shoe 5 mm drop overall and for me this is coming in around about 276 g a pretty nice lightweight offering here from hoker it's a neutral shoe and it has this lovely engineered mesh upper not the most brutal one I've run in but really not too bad we'll come on to all that a little bit later on in the midsole of the shoe you've got one massive chunk of hokus super critical foam one of the biggest updates here with this shoe there's no carbon plate in the shoe but we've got an all new rubber out soole the first for the Mac here which does give it a little bit of stiffness a little bit of rigidity as we go through the whole foot strike there are two different widths available in the shoe regular and wide which you can spec on the hoker website if you think you have any sort of extra width in your feet definitely go for the wide version there's also four different colors to choose from and this for me in my UK size 12 was true to size right let's get stuck into all of the differences between this and the outgoing version 5 the biggest update with the Mac 6 is this new massive chunk of their super critical EVA foam in the outgo Mac 5 you had a little bit of that and then beneath it a really hardwearing Eva phone now you've just got a big chunk of the most sort of softest squishiest but also pretty responsive super critical foam there's also been a big increase in stack code about 7 to 8 mm extra St kite in the shoe so many manufacturers are doing that these days and you can really feel that difference when you're running in both of these shoes version six now has this rubber outso to the shoe to give that a little bit of extra stability a little bit of extra support in the foam if you didn't have that this foam would wear out very very quickly in the old shoe you didn't have that you just had a layer of the Eva hard wearing foam on the bottom you can't have that in this they've added this extra bit of traction extra bit of rubber outs salt on the bottom of the shoe so you do Lo a little bit of ground feel there as well version 6 also to me does feel a little bit on the narrower side and hus say they've updated the back of the shoe as well it's a very minor tweak right let's go to my likes the first like with the shoe is it was supremely comfortable one of the most important things when looking for a new pair of shoes let us know down in the comments what's your most important thing you want speed Comfort let us know got a really good solid lockdown with this very nice comfortable upper I really like the updated heel color I can't really feel a massive difference but it's still really good no heel slip issues or anything like that when I go out testing these shoes I'm always hyperware Sensations trying to pick up any sort of things of how my feet are feeling I just kind of Switched Off running this one it's really odd and so I had said to Sarah when she was cycling behind me it's just there getting the job done my second like with this shoe is this update this new super critical big chunk of super critical foam it really delivers a fun and also very responsive ride a little bit like the New Balance Rev V4 again with that massive chunk of foam at the bottom of the shoe there it's always pushing you to go a little bit faster and that could be good or it could be bad this is really not a shoe to take out for your recovery runs but it's always egging you on always sort of pushing you to pick up your stride pick up your Cadence and run just that little bit faster for me the shoe really sings that faster end of our easy Pace all the way up to Marathon half marathon 10K all the way up to 5K paast that's where the shoe really delivers and not only through the foam but also because it's super lightweight as well you really just feel you've got running along with absolutely nothing under your feet which is a really impressive job from hoko with what they've done considering that increase in stack height that increase in responsiveness adding the outsole for that extra durability the weight has only gone up a very very small amount different depending on what size you're running in so just a great all around everyday shoe to bring a smile to your face when you're getting your runs done my third like with the shoe is this new outso that they've added for version 6 yes it really helps with durability and grip when I have taken out in some wet weather the out soole has been okay the grip's been okay everything's just a little bit average probably as you'd expect on a shoe like this I have seen a few people complaining about the wet weather grip but in the dry the out soole is delivering some really good grip but it just really helps support that midsole gives it a slightly stiffer feel but also it means you can just cover the ground that much smoother and I really just love how this shoe feels through the whole foot strip with the rocker at the front of the shoe as well just a much better structure with how the shoe is put together right let's get stuck into my dislikes now the first thing to have a chat out here is not really a dislike for me but I really want to bring attention to it it's just this is a very very different shoe from the outgoing version 5 if you're a massive fan of the version 5 you might not necessarily really like version 6 with a massive increase in stack height this shoe gets with that outsole you're losing a lot of that ground contact feel G is that very very lightweight and super responsive ride that the Mac was famous for and now it's just a bit more subdued now some people are really going to like this update but some people are really not going to like it so depends what type of Camp you're in there have been some really big changes with this update for me I personally really like it I like a little bit more stack heite I like what the outso is doing this shoe it's a much better overall General shoe but we're losing some of these Niche products out there and the Mac was a bit of a niche sort of speed workor Fast Very responsive lightweight shoe and that's kind of gone from the hoker range so you may be wanting to stock up on version 5 if you were a fan of that type of shoe and the other things to note in this shoe is very typical of hoker they do like their narrow shoes this is certainly a little bit narrower than the outgoing model so I'd certainly say definitely look at the wide options if you have anything approaching wide feet as well and my final sort of thing to note is it just feels a bit awkward at recovery run Pac it's not a true Do-it all shoe that's still going to be the Clifton but for this type of shoe which really is that higher end of all the way up to 5K it really does deliver very very well so in conclusion who should be looking for a shoe like the Hoka Max 6 or for me someone looking for a non-plated shoe for their faster easy runs their tempos maybe a little of an impromptu sh race maybe a park run something they do their sessions in as well best suited for those definitely quicker Paces am I going to keep this shoe is it going to go in my rotation I'm definitely going to keep it I don't think I'm going to do too much and I got so many shoes to test but I've really enjoyed running in it it has really bought a smart on my face I probably enjoyed the rebel just a little bit more but I had some bad heel issues with that shoe with some blisters nothing with that in this shoe so I definitely recommend checking it out I've really enjoyed running in it I have no problem in recommending it to friends family and most importantly all of you the amazing running Community out there next up we've got the hoker massive comparison video you can watch that over here or just below that you can check out the review of this the New Balance Rebel version 4 keep on working hard keep on getting done guys we'll see you very soon in the next one",

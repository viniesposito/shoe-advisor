  "text": "a lot of people get into running because it's assumed it's a relatively cheap sport compared to others all you really need is a pair of shoes right well like with most Hobbies the more you get into it the more money it seems to drain out of you it's so easy to be influenced into thinking we need the most expensive running shoes the latest tech but most of the time it really isn't necessary running on a budget doesn't mean we have to sacrifice our running experience So today we're going to be exploring loads of affordable options to show that running can be accessible to everyone no matter what your budget is right let's start out chatting about events running events can really cost a fortune I was lucky enough to run New York Marathon last year and it cost me nearly \u00a3400 just for the privilege of being on the start line well thankfully there's a lot of much cheaper options out there starting out with park run which is completely free if you've never done a park run this is simply a 5K run every Saturday morning available at loads of locations all around the world it's got a really fantastic Community Vibe about it and you get a time when you finish as well as a lot of people know park run isn't a race but if you do want to do a race and get an official time we' really recommend getting in touch with your local running clubs in the local area running clubs are very rarely profit driven and they like to put on little local lowkey races and all the ones I've ever done have had a fantastic Vibe about them my own club here in London Serpentine hosts the last Friday of the month 5K and it cost just \u00a36 to enter so what I recommend is just simply Googling your local running club so if you live in Manchester put Manchester running clubs Newcastle Newcastle running clubs see the events they put on look at their event sections and go out and check some of those ones out I guarantee there'll be some really good value for money options Trail Races tend to cost a lot more money to put on so the entry fees are always a little bit higher one way you can get some really good free options out there is by doing some volunteering in those races and quite often the organizers will give you a free place for the following year Centurion down here in the south UK are really good at offering this if you volunteer one of their events you can get a free entry K wrath is another one if you volunteer then they give you a really good discount on next year's entry so maybe get in touch with some of your local Trail organizations and see if you can volunteer and maybe get a discounted or free entry into the race of the year after quite often there's a lot of community and group runs if you did live in some of the biggest cities around the world we got a big one here at the moment from tracksmith put on by our friend of ours called AMR he gets so many people turning up every week for this free community group run they're running at lots of different Paces as well doesn't cost anything we'll link their details Down Below in London but as I said just like before just Google Manchester Newcastle Edinburgh community group runs and hopefully something will come up a lot of run shops will'll put these on as well so maybe get in touch with a local Running Shop and see if they're putting on some group runs and then finally with all of this join your local running club if you can afford it my local running club here \u00a345 for a whole year they also offer discounts if you're unemployed over 65 or a student things like that for just2 a year fantastic Valley lots of free coaching that you get with that as well unlimited group group runs and then finally run through put on a lot of big events all around the UK a lot of races I'm not saying they're great value for money but they're not too bad but they also have What's called the run through Foundation bringing a free Mass big sporting events to lower income areas around the UK right guys moving on to the all important running shoes so cheap doesn't have to mean poor quality and poor performance we've tested many budget running shoes here on the channel over the years and while some were really really bad and disappointing others did perform actually quite well and better than some of the more expensive options out there two of my really big favorites want to check out the Reebok float ride series you talking around about 50 or 60 a pair or the pummer velocity Nitro series as well we're on to Nitro 3 at the moment about 80 or 90 for some pumers there really good to seek out last year's models as well newer shoes don't always mean better like a lot of things in life when the new version comes out the old model will be on discount some really Dependable Classics you can look for over the years things like the aex Nova blast series series the Nike Pegasus series The New Balance 1080 series or something like the hoker Clifton and then finally there's good options out there to buy secondhand shoes now I buy a lot of running shoes every year mainly to review here on the channel and because I buy all of them myself to give you completely impartial 100% honest reviews we sell a lot of those on eBay and vintage as well and these are really good marketplac to have a look you can look at Facebook Marketplace or some of the groups like running gear buy and sell on Facebook that people that will sell pretty much nearly new shoes shoes a lot of running retailers you can't send things back so if people get shoes they don't quite like they're going to be selling them they might have only done a few miles in there just to test them out so you can pick up some really good secondhand Bargains I would say don't try and buy shoes that are more than like one or two years old really because of the foam and the glues just don't tend to last that long but if you are looking for some newer clothes kit and gear some really good brands that offer exceptional value Brands like Ron Hill the legendary Ron Hill one of the best ever British Marathon out there Company still going strong making some really good value products and also Classics like the Catalin Brands like high five you can get some really great deals on high five gels fantastic value and really good product as well it's scored really well when I've been testing out their gels things like goodar for some fantastic sunglasses really good polarized options for not a lot of money and a brand called at Tru which is a new running shoe brand out there we've tested out some of their shoes as well all being really really good options so let me know down in the comments your best running Brands out there that offers some really good value and where You' like to find all of your Bargains and then finally have a look at some Sal section on some website I've got a sale Section on my website and a lucky di section as well where we sometimes sell off some slightly damage or seconds or samples and things like that so we'll link to that section down below as well check out benp parks.com where you can find amazing running hats technical gear and trading plans to help with your running now a lot of people when they get into running they don't invest too much in New Gear a lot of people say go and get a watch now if you can't really afford a watch then I just recommend downloading driver on your phone and it will track your mileage and your distance and your time and get all those really basic things that you need to be tracking during your running but if you did want to get yourself a running watch then have a look at something like the Garmin 55 for around about \u00a3 150 fantastic value it has really all the running data that most people will ever need choros I think got the pace three just over \u00a3200 some of these watches might seem a little bit basic but I see so many people spending so much money on running watches and then use like 5% of the features on them or you can suiz get some older discounted models on websites like C I've always gone into store with CX just to check what it's like but I've bought a few watches in there over the years and they always worked out really well but I always like to just go into the shop first to see what the conditions like see if I got any scratches and things like that you can sell your old watches to them or buy new watches off them well cheap running kit can be great there's also an argument of you get what you pay for spending a little bit more money on your kit can mean it's less likely to break or fall apart it will last a hell of a lot longer for you saving a lot of money in the long term for example I bought four pairs of Saw shorts I've actually got a pair on here this evening about 4 years ago and I wear them pretty much all day every day and they're still going strong I've done thousands of kilometers in them the quality has been absolutely fantastic there some really good brands thing like saw tracksmith Lululemon things like that Mak some really good quality gear now when we race on the trails you tend to need a lot of a quite expensive gear to be able to do there's a lot of mandatory kit and things like that myself and Sarah usually share some some of the items that we have with other Runners around and they share some stuff with us for example we did a race last year where we needed some spikes what are they called Sarah micro micro spikes and we didn't want to go out and spend \u00a3100 on those so we borrowed some off some of our running friends around so ask again in your local community asking your running club maybe on Facebook groups and things like that if you just want to borrow something that's a mandatory kit item for a race if you can't afford to buy a lot of these things there is an organization here in the UK called into Ultra which aims to rake ultra running a little bit more accessible by providing sort of help and discounted options with race entries kit and training as well you can borrow some equipment off them so if that appeals you then again we'll link to their details down below right two more things to go through second from last all about run commuting I used to really like doing this type of thing back in the day and I still run to meetings that I have in London as well turning up a little bit sweaty but I'm getting my run done you'll also save a lot of money on your travel class safe time because you're getting your run done while you would ordinarily be commuting so maybe see if that's an option for you and then finally looking out for some affordable training plans that can help with your running of course we have these on our website all of our beginner plans are completely 100% free no catch at all just go on there and download them we offer a lot of really good value I feel we do offer really good value with all of the training plans we have on the website so if you want to know more all about cheap running shoes and which ones to avoid we bought the very cheapest running shoes from all the biggest brands out there in the world so check that video that's coming up next",

  "text": "hey this is Thomas with beli in the run this is Megan with beli in the run I don't know why I said hey maybe I was trying to get your attention but now that I have it let's get into it me what are we holding today this is very exciting we have the saky Endorphin Elite [Music] 2 what did we think of the elite one it was it was good it was a great shoe um it it didn't feel like it was that premium level above the pro I'll tell you what I didn't like it okay and Robbie had the same opinion of it we felt like it was super firm and I'm wondering did we get like a bad batch like was something wrong with ours cuz everybody else was like oh it's a soft and Squishy shoe what was it the HG foam they had in that they're like oh it's great and I was just like I just don't feel it it felt like clunky it almost felt like a wooden clog going down the street so I was a little bit like man not too excited to get this one until you felt the Mido this when we were at the running event and uh we'll get into what this midsole is but let's just start with the top the fit let's get into it right off the bat you can tell this is a very minimal upper you can actually see through these are they're calling them t or they are tpe Yarns so it's very minimal um you can see your foot through them and then there's this molded 3D heel counter I was expecting it to like I was a little worried about the fit especially when I first put my foot into it it felt a little bit short but once I actually started walking around started running in the shoe the fit was actually really nice I think what it is is this weave actually opens up a little bit and you had the toes spring so when you first put your foot in it did feel a little short with this toes spring and a tighter weave and then as you got into it it stretches out a little bit so it gets the right fit so if you try it on and it feels a little tight in the store or wherever you get it if you ordered it give it a shot before you you know get nervous because it does kind I feel like it opens up a little bit the more I ran in it the looser the upper felt and also this is a race day shoe so it is meant to have a little bit more of that snug fit like hugging the foot versus some of those daily trainers where you have a nice wide forf foot for your toes display this is like really meant to hug your foot so that you can run fast and and quick around turns and everything like that a neat feature it does have here you come up to this knit stretchy tongue which I really like yeah and you can see you can flip up the top here on this tongue and why would you want to do that well you've got got the lace lock here the runnner loop that you could use if you want even more kind of a lock down feel and then you can come across the top of this without having to you know worry about it biting into the top of your ankle but if you're not using it you can just fold this down and have a nice clean tongue so it's not you know going up onto your uh ankle there the only thing I would say that I didn't love about this upper was it does still have a little bit of gaping and and openness to the like collar area it's hard to cut weight and have structure in these areas of the shoe it didn't affect the ride I did feel like I was talking about it loosened up a little bit as I used the shoe more I did start to feel like I needed to kind of cinch down the laces to get the proper fit another thing you do not have a removable insole so that sucker in there um I didn't have the issue like you did with the gaping around the collar here I was worried that there might be some rubbing just because of the way this is structured and molded like this but I had no issues with rubbing got no blisters no hot spots no if I actually really enjoy the upper totally breathy breathy is that a word I don't know it breathes could be breathing it's breathy um it breathes so that's good uh let's move down to the secret sauce yeah so this midsole compound is a brand new foam from saky um it's so squishy what are they calling it incerun yeah the the name of the foam has mixed feelings here the team some of us think it's good some of us think it sounds like kindergarteners got together and made it or you know you think of The Incredibles yeah like oh it's incredibley it's incred run yeah I don't hate the name I really honestly a lot of times I don't give a what they call the phone as long as the phone feels good and this one does yeah so this is this material let's see if I can get this right is a co- polyester elastomer yeah um so the way it was described to us is basically it's a blend of of materials and it's part of the tpe family which is similar to a PE PX but just different yeah it's different we're no chemical scientists here let me just tell you in layman's terms what this foam is it's super bouncy super responsive like this is probably one of my favorite Foams that I've tried ever in a running shoe the closest one that I would say to this if you're like looking at Foams in race day would be the Adidas Pro 4 they really took that and made it kind of soft and and balance it like this but not quite as gooey as this one yeah I can't think of a shoe that feels like this underfoot I was talking to you earlier before we started recording and to me when you're walking around in this shoe and not running fast it feels similar to like a Jello-O consistency like it's it's very soft it feels almost like there's a vibration when you're Landing in this shoe like it's it's unlike any foam that I felt how many jello shots did you do when you were in Charleston none oh yeah that's a lie right there come on we pride ourselves on honesty now when it comes to this shoe I agree with you it has a really spongy feel but I like it the balance on it what I think is the most interesting thing about this foam is when you're running like your easy warm-up Paces so typically when I'm doing a speed workout my coach gives me 2 to three miles warm up and then we get into the paces and a lot of times some of the speed shoes feel a little wonky at those like pedestrian paces and then they come alive when you start running faster this one does something kind of interesting it's really soft and cushiony reminds me of like that clo X1 feel when you're warming up it's just really nice bouncy kind of like little energy in your step and then when you pick up the pace the foam actually firms up and like almost changes Personality yeah I do agree with you there I feel like as soon as I started to pick up the pace in this shoe was when I really started to enjoy it in fact I'm I'm not really training right now but I am doing a few workouts here and there and I took this out for some 4minute hard segments and my Paces felt like I was running a certain pace and when I was looking down my watch it was 20 to 30 seconds faster than I thought I was running so I do feel like there's something to this and it's and it's really comfortable like you were saying it feels very different at slower Paces but it's not a bad feeling not a bad feeling at all as a matter of fact when we were talking to Stony when we were at the running event I was like oh so this is just for your Premier athletes tip of the spear people are going fast and he made a point to be like no this is actually a really great shoe for those people that are also running 330s to four plus Miles because of that soft cushioning yeah and I tend to agree with them I think that you can get away with this shoe for a wide range of uh Paces for the marathon including the super fast people I think you're going to see people running in this shoe that are in the low twos all the way up into the fours and fives and they're all going to have a good experience because of this foam it's kind of crazy now one thing we didn't even talk about was the plate in the shoe okay the plate in the shoe is uh pretty good I like it it's responsive I felt like you can feel it when you're get picking up the pace yeah so it's a f length carbon fiber plate but it's also slotted here and um I think when you do have this very squishy foam it's nice to sort of have that also slotted feel so it's not quite as harsh um you get more of that nice Bounce from the foam and then the last thing that we didn't mention is this I think they call it power track uh yeah the power track rubber which is typically what they put in their trail shoes so it's like very tacky very um grippy but it's just a super thin layer of it so it's not adding much to the weight there it's just giving you a really nice like cushion I mean like um drip grip yeah that's I think that's the word you're looking for um I have to say it is super thin I don't know how durable it's going to be my shoe right here has about 50 to 60 Mi on it I was going through a section that it was kind of crazy that had like a broken water man and so there was water on the street I was like oh this is almost like a water stop where it's like 100 ft of water on the road is dry road then little 100 ft of wet water on the road and then dry road again I was like this will be just like running through a water stop and as I was going through I wanted to see how the rubber felt going through the the wet and and it felt fine it still felt tacky as a matter of fact going through the water and then getting back onto the dry I felt like it like cleaned off the Rubber and I had even more tackiness to it now the other thing we ran through today which no shoe would help was some ice and of course it felt slippery on the ice yeah I don't know that there was a solution for that from any shoe so that is what it is the last thing we want to talk about here is the weight so my women's 7 and 1/2 came in at 6.2 Oz or 175 G which is really nice nice and light my have a size 10/2 us mine came in at 7.75 Oz and I'm going to read it right off the shoe here 220 G I mean that's in the light range for me like anything under eight is really starting to get exciting in the race category especially with this much cushioning M did we say the drop uh no so it's the same as the last iteration of this shoe so as close as they can get to stay within the legal limit so 39 um and a half in the heel 31 and A2 in the 4 foot and then makes it an 8 mm drop does all right and they stick to that speed roll shape that they love over at socony I guess all we have left is to give it our our form fit and function yeah form fit and function all right so form out of five what do you give it five I really enjoyed this you the look the style the fit good yeah I think I'm going to give it a four it's it's a little weird looking to me it looks a little bit short and a little bit stocky um so Aesthetics are a little weird for me but see docking it points for being short short and stocky yeah I know oh that's mean uh so four out of five all right all right and fit fit this is where I'm going to knock it a little bit I'm going to give it a four only because where the collar kind of gets like not very structured it wasn't quite exactly perfect and then I'm going to dock it again for a little bit like it's going to be confusing I think for consumers when they try it on whether it's they're going to feel like it's too short not knowing that the shoe kind of opens up as you're running and kind of spreads out yeah I'm also going to give it a four I do feel like it it especially at stepp in it feels pretty short if you're wearing a thick sock I almost didn't put the shoe on at all because I had a thick sock on so yeah the fit isn't perfect so we'll give it a four function out of five I'm going to give it a five this shoe is doing what it's supposed to do and I think it's actually a tremendous race shoe for just about anybody so the amount of people that are going to be able to run well in this shoe from you know we've Ted talked about other shoes being Democratic in the past where is really like hey if you want a super shoe and you're not going to be running sub three maybe this shoe is good for you it's a little heavier it's got a wider bottom you know what shoe I'm talking about but this shoe I feel like is going to replace the idea of that shoe where I I could recommend this to somebody who's going to be running a 4-Hour Marathon or somebody who's going to be running a 2 and a half I'm going to give it a four and I think I'm knocking it mostly because while I love this midsole feel it's a little unstable so I felt like when I was trying to run fast like this jelly style foam sometimes when you're running around corners it just didn't feel like I could have that confidence around tight turns all right so your total is 14 and mine's going to be 12 and again I I think it's a great shoe I knocked it for a few minor things but overall I'm starting to notice a pad and I think you're a little harder on things than I am okay so this will be out March one for $275 so if you have a spring Marathon you're looking for something I'm going to say I recommend this yeah all right if you haven't yet definitely go like this video subscribe

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run I'm here with ran Smith athlete for lost sportiva also founder of Rocky Mountain Runners also just a great Community member down in Boulder here his name all over the place but we're talking about the prodigio max what can you tell us about the shoe how your experien has been in it maybe a little bit about the product itself yeah yeah I mean I've been using the the prio lineup for quite some time now with the current prio obviously which is out in Market you can buy now um uh the pro that I'm wearing now I've been using kind of for a lot of races this year and finally I've got my hands on the last month or so on the Maxes which I'm pretty excited about I've been using these personally for a lot of kind of training runs a lot of recovery runs the kind of elevated cushioning um you know is just really noticeable I think when I'm kind of you know maybe done a hard workout the day before um I'm also doing a lot of kind of transition stuff so some Trail and then I'm onto road back and forward a lot and this um you know the the the max really kind of performs really well on both those kind of um and it really is Max cushion for the trails like 37 in the heel to 31 in the 4 foot so yeah you're going to feel it and do you do you know much about this midsole can you tell us a little bit more about that yeah I mean it's a it's like a nitrogen infused mold so it's you know similar to the um the rest of the prio lineup really is kind of a performance orientated foam um you're going to feel that obviously just in that kind of comfort factor but as well in the kind of energy return so this would be a great shoe for probably longer runs as well or longer races should I say so I'd definitely be eyeing this up for maybe 100 mile which is kind of my forte um but I'll be using it kind of dayto day as well as kind of a regular shoe awesome yeah we're seeing that Inplay and and this outso is quite versatile it seems have you found that in your yeah I mean I think again with the whole prodigio lineup the outsole I think is a bit of a standout on this kind of line um it's it adds a nice kind of stiffness component to the whole shoe so both on kind of energy return but then just in lateral stability as well it's going to really come into its own um the log pattern is very effective so great on kind of you know wide variety of terrain you know Boulder gets very dry and you know occasionally we get a bit of rain and it's great for that too but um yeah pretty good for kind of the the kind of Colorado West for sure and that's why I'm using it most able to like stack the miles on a decent variety of train um yeah I think the comfort factor is worth talking about as well just in terms of the oper you know this is a really kind of luxurious feel you slip it on there's no kind of like you know burning time required like right from the gun you can go out here and you know hammer out kind of a 10 mile or something no problem at all absolutely and and that's great to hear and you've been with Las portiva for a while now and how does this would you say this separates from what is currently there there or it's passed and how does it stay true to yeah that's a that's a great question I've been running with uh sporta for about 10 years or so so I've kind of gone through the whole gamut of uh shoes and lineup some have come some have gone you know I'm glad that several of them have stuck around for the whole time I've been there things like the Bido the mutants the real Classics I think the podio lineup is definitely um quite Innovative it's I think it still kind of keeps that sportiva ethic right they're like they're really making a shoe for the mountains you know so like with the pro obviously it's a Performance Racing shoe but I think when you see that out soole you slip it on you know that's really going to perform really well not just on kind of flat easy Trails but also pretty technical stuff so I think it's probably going to be a nice entry point for people coming maybe from the road it's going to have that feel to it but I think just kind of elevated obviously with the technical outsole lateral stability is really second to none in my opinion on sportiva products and and Longevity you know this thing's really going to last a long time lot of miles out of this I think in terms of drometer this is a little um slightly more dense than the prodigio pro correct yes but the higher stack gives it a softer feel comparatively absolutely so I mean and you're a long distance 100 mile Master You've Won many you're probably uncomfortable with but you've won many quite prestigious trail races and if you were going to line up yeah I would definitely shift to this kind line up so for me it's going to be probably this shoe or the pro you know one of those I think going forward whereas historically for example I've run a lot of miles in and things like the mutant you know which for me just Comfort durability just that known quantity it kind of works really well wide variety terrains is comfortable for the Long Haul but I think my kind of go-to is Shifting to the prodigio lineup you know as this comes out so me also a game changer and yeah and I mean for trail running specific this gets a little more generous in the foot as you're running compared to other sportiva models so it's going to maintain that from the prio which has been such a great sh this year like award winning and we're just continuing on yeah I think it's going to probably gel with a wider kind of gamut of Runners you know things like the Bido historically it's quite a narrow fit very snug you know that obviously brings stability and performance I think but like the P line lineup is a little um little bit of a wider fit than I think historical kind of sportiva models have been so I think that's going to fit and gel well with you know a wider kind of gamut of people but it works pretty well for me I have a narrow foot you know but the lacing systems are really good I can get a snug fit on it totally yeah cuz I mean Las portiva holds the midfoot holds the heel and now with more generous forf foot that's going to be yeah speaking to the American audience exactly exactly and I think that's going to work on like longer kind of races and things your feet swelling you know I certainly think I could do a whole hundred one pair of these no problem that's awesome that's great to hear okaya PRX thank you Ryan apprciate it yeah cheers thank you",

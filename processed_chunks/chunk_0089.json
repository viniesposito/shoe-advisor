  "text": "I frankly don't have much business racing this weekend I I really don't if you been watching for six seven eight years on this YouTube channel you know that I never race I mean rarely do I go backto back weekends I don't know if I've ever done backto back to back Leadville Silverton Snowbird all right we're going to Utah see you in Utah it's the US Mountain running championships and here's the other business it's 8 miles total that's the total length of this 8. like five I think with about 3800 vertical feet roughly I'll try and get some more information on the screen bottom line we're going up against the Young Guns people that are 10 12 15 I don't think we're quite at 20 years younger than me but at least 10 to 15 years younger but we're going to go mix it up we're going to go have fun as true love said last week to me she said you know what let's just you know it was it was a hard six months earlier in 2024 just go have fun Seth isn't that amazing like your spouse your wife said just like you missed 6 months of racing go have fun go let it rip even if your legs are tired from Silverton and yes they and they're very sore right now as I'm driving back up to the mountains for one more high altitude stint okay one more little scraping of the sky before we go out to Utah I'm not going to go very far today I'm going to try to rest the legs as much as possible bottom line I'll see you in Snowbird come say hello it's going to be I've actually raced I raced a 50k there again four five I'm losing track of time 6 years ago I don't remember it was probably 2019 roughly if I can find some footage I'll put it on the screen so I'm very excited to go back and shout out to the Circ series hosting this event we're going to just do our best have fun in the process and I hope you are you know I'm always saying it but like dig into that if you don't enjoy your racing find a different distance find a different surface find a different location there's so many ways that Runners like for me it sounds like I don't want to say horrible but it doesn't sound fun to race around a track let's say you know five out of seven races a year but some people love the oval that's what they're passionate about is racing around the oval it's just not me anyway I digress um we're going to see what business we can uh we can muster on the the Steep vertical gain of snowbird so oh onward and upward and yes question of the day gear what is what was your most recent running gear purchase that wasn't running shoes all right what was it explain why you you purchased it is it working out for you did you have to send it back and uh so we got we got boxes we're going to open these up right about now it's snowing on top flurries the light snow but I have I think that's the latest I've ever seen snow up on a 14er in the summertime that's that was pretty cool to have snow in July um all right gear companies thank you oh yeah everybody come on now let's pack out our trash from the 14ers uh whoever whoever left that up there I appreciate the elevation uh information but got pack out that trash up on those 14ers all right here we go um as you know as we do R&D research and development for our gear uh my my P my switch that's right the battery died up on the mountain so I I got to finish here in the shudio so as I was saying uh up there sorry about that sometimes these things happen uh R&D as we develop our own gear I've made the distinct and you've seen it here on the YouTube A distinct shift and it's intentional very intentional where I'm not I used to review how many running shoes a week two three three pairs a week now it's maybe two a quarter and that's intentional because of time I just don't have the time to invest in the in the research for as6 New Balance Hoka all everything that goes into a running you know the shots the Drone shots for the running shoe reviews and now I'm actually crazy enough I love running shoes I know many of you love running shoes keep testing keep pursuing it and I'll continue to do running shoes sparingly here on the channel but at the end of the day I'm more excited about uh clothing about outerwear about what we wear as Runners because um that's what I'm doing I'm actually developing our own running gear these are our socks love these socks deor store.com in case you need to pick a pair up I've raced in these socks the last two weekends and I love them um this even this uh long sleeve right here this is all part of the research as I test different materials so up on the mountain today thank you to Nathan to Mont sleep to Solomon to norona uh to R Rie to Adidas for sending this gear to me but I'm not it's not at the top of of my priority list with respect to testing um every shoe Under the Sun or every piece of outerwear under the sun because there's just not enough time as I invest in our own gear right here in the right here in the basement right here in the shudio so that's the that's the update thank you Nathan for the for the gear I'll keep testing it but it's um it's just a it's a shift and it's a good shift and I look forward to reading your comments Down Below in the question from the question of the day with respect to what are you buying what are you purchasing uh why are you purchasing that piece of running gear and it's fun it's fun to to back up from so many shoe reviews so much Gear reviews and it's it's good though like I'll keep testing and Nathan thank you love Nathan on Mont sleep just so everybody knows is a I'm as I've been talking on the channel for years and years about the importance of sleep as Runners and so this is a face mask that helps keep the light out and I've been wearing this for um they've sent me one a year ago and actually over a year ago I because I wore it all last summer every single night and you just put it on and basically it just block O oh my goodness it just H so anyway thank you mon sleep m n ta RI uh or sorry reii is out of Poland a recovery Gear Company this is a jump rope this is a u a stick or a foam roller and then norona is a new company that I've never tested and again this is all part of my research like as I so okay I actually already wore this because I'm recording this the next day this is made in Vietnam but it's based out in Norway so for me in my brain what I'm doing is I'm like huh how are they constructing this this long sleeve out of Viet let me just make sure Vietnam yes made in Vietnam designed and developed in Norway so narona I've never worn their gear before it looks like a viking is their logo very cool and but Solomon on the other hand is a t-shirt this is a t-shirt obviously here um and it's made in uh Tunisia but obviously uh designed Solomon you know in France is where they're based out of so anyway it's just all part of the process as we invest in our gear and so thank you companies I will put all this through the paces and so now I just have more time to put it through the paces and give you my thoughts eventually is the key word here all right I love you onward and upward oh deor store.com we are running a little low on some items but if you do want you know sing like singlets we are pretty low on singlets but hats uh bottles uh socks we got all that so onward and upward we will toss it to um we'll toss it to I don't know some sort of gear review video I don't even know which one but some sort of gear review right there all right see beauty work hard and love each other",

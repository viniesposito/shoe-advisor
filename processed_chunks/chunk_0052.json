  "text": "on shoes have a tendency to start off strong for me but the love affair Fades fast and I just lose interest but after a summer of running did the peba 4f foot and no speedboard of these shoes help Buck this trend let's talk about the on cloud Monster hyper after 100 miles [Music] yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm a non- elite Runner who views running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the on cloud Monster hyper after 100 miles but before I do I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that on sent to me for the purpose of review so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the oncloud Monster hyper after 100 miles and let's start with how I've been using the shoe now I initially thought that I might use this shoe as a daily trainer slash long run shoe something that I could put in a lot of miles and even pick up the pace given that there's that race calor foam in the for foot but that's not how I ended up liking using this shoe instead I ended up using this shoe as pretty much a standard daily trainer for any day where I was just loging easy regular everyday miles or if I wanted to use something for a recovery run and wanted a little hint of stability because I do find the shoe to be relatively stable for a neutral shoe now it was easy for me to reach for the shoe on those recovery days and those regular easy days the shoe was very pleasant and agreeable to run in it just wasn't all that interesting I really felt like I should have been getting more out of a shoe that had so much peba in the forefoot and that was so bold as to remove the speedboard from a shoe model that typically has always had a speedboard I did enjoy my time in the shoe but it was just a bit underwhelming they went through all these changes they increased the price by a whole bunch and I just wasn't feeling any benefit of the cloud Monster hyper over its sibling the regular Cloud monster 2 next let's talk about how the shoes have been holding up physically after 100 miles I feel like the shoes are holding up very well there's very few signs of wear and tear putting my foot into the shoes they feel like pretty much a brand new pair of shoes and Visually everything's holding up really well nothing's wearing down too quickly and everything seems like it's a pretty fresh shoe I did run with these all throughout the summer so they don't smell the freshest but otherwise everything is holding up really nicely looking at the outo there is a little bit of wear that's occurring on some of the higher wear areas of the rubber but nothing that I wouldn't expect for a 100m shoe and one thing that you guys always ask me about when it comes to on shoes is whether or not I'm getting a squeak from the shoe and for the most part I don't get squeak from my on shoes the only time I get them and that's the case for this shoe too is after I've run through a big puddle that's where I will start to hear a squeak because I think the extra moisture that's in the shoe is helping to create some of that squeaking sound I think that it's not an issue for me maybe because of my size I think for my bigger taller friends it might be more of an issue and the one thing that I do want to say that I really didn't like in terms of the construction of the shoe which otherwise is I think is spectacular is that the laces are just terrible they're a little bit on the long side which is kind of nice because most of the shoes that I've come across these days have laces that are way too short the length on these laces is pretty good more than I need but if you're trying to actually do a run or not there's plenty there but the laces get untied all the time now they do have these little grippy bits on the back side of the laces to help kind of prevent them from getting accidentally untied as you run but even that doesn't do very much to keep these shoes from getting untied on their own I typically find myself triple knotting these shoes otherwise I'm going to be stopping somewhere [Music] [Music] mid-run before we wrap up the video let's take a moment to talk about on a little bit more generally at least on running shoes uh and see where the oncloud Monster hyper fits within the broader on running lineup now when it comes to on a lot of people think about the clouds in other words these holes that are in the sides of the shoe as kind of like the defining feature of on-running shoes and while in a large part you're correct you're not wrong for me the defining thing about on shoes is the speedboard there's like a little piece of plastic that's in between the upper and the midsole of the shoe that's intended to serve a little bit of a carbon fiber plate style of function now for a lot of the on shoes the First on shoes that were developed for the first several years of the Brand's existence they all had some level of speedboard and they had a variety of different levels of rigidity to them some were more flexible and more of kind of like a rock plate and others were more rigid and acting more like a carbon fiber plate and so a shoe like the CL Monster version one had a speedboard and regular shaped clouds now on also makes race product and I think what distinguishes their race product from their regular product like this shoe the on cloud boom Echo 3 is that the speed board in these shoes is actually made out of carbon so it's a carbon fiber plate this one you can kind of see in the spaces in between uh the top and lower layers of this midle foam here this one I feel like is more of a 5k 10K racing option and they also have the cloud strike which again has a carbon fiber plate or a carbon speedboard note that this is very different than the cloud strike light spray the Fantastic like 3D printed sprayon shoe that we saw they have the same name uh but this shoe is a little bit different but these are two different Racing shoes it's going to be an either or decision in terms of which shoe to race in now the other kind of shoe that on makes is a shoe with no speedboard at all that's a relatively new development I think last year was the first year they started doing that and that's shoes like this the cloud Surfer which is probably my second favorite on shoe ever made uh this has no speedboard at all and a slightly different shape of cloud I think to kind of compensate for the lack of a speedboard and there's also the cloud Eclipse which is my favorite on shoe that they've ever made it's more of a long run shoe it's something that could soak up a lot of miles and pick up the pace a little bit that's another kind of shoe that exists here now within kind of both of these lines the speedboard and no speedboard there's an entire lineup of shoes that exist with the speed boarded shoes there is a Max cushion shoe like the oncloud monster there's a cloud Stratus and there's other shoes that are fitting the daily trainer and the session shoe category and the type of Runner that those shoes appeal to I believe are those that prefer more of a European style of running shoe and daily trainer something that's a little bit more stable and a little bit more firm not as squishy spongy as we may prefer in North America and so that's kind of how I understand the speed boarded shoes from on and I feel like the modern take on that is the no speed boarded shoes from on which use the cloudtech phase I really prefer these and I feel like these are targeted squarely at the North American Market where we want something that's a little bit spongier for our easy runs like the cloud Surfer or our long runs and Max cushion runs like with the on cloud eclipse and then you have the race product no matter which of these two styles of shoes speedboard or no speedboard you like you're going to be bumping up to the carbon plated product if you want to have an entire lineup with on but these are kind of two parallel verticals well sometimes there might be some crossing over in terms of what people like but for the most part I think these are designed for two different kinds of Runners and now what's unusual is that the cloud Monster hyper kind of fits in the cloud monster 1 and Cloud monster 2 category of the speed boarded shoe but because of the way they introduce the peba foam in this midfoot there actually is no speedboard so it kind of sits in the middle although functionally it still feels very much like a speed boarded shoe so that's where it fits now I know this is a little bit different than the normal kind of like shoe rotation that I might set out for a brand but I thought it might be helpful to kind of like understand on in terms of these three parallel pillars now let's close out the video by going over an updated buying guide now that the shoe's been out for a little while and we'll go over some updated recommendations of other shoes that you might want to also consider the oncloud Monster hyper is what the cloud monster 2 really should have been I don't really understand why there's two different shoes in the lineup this year and while this is a pretty good shoe at $220 this is just way too expensive even for an on shoe if you are absolutely dead set on getting an on cloud monster I'd say go back to version one they look very similar and you can get into that shoe for $170 the difference in performance between those shoes really isn't that different but the thing that I would probably steer you toward more if I could would be the oncloud eclipse at 180 that is my favorite on shoe but let's take a look at some Alternatives the first shoe that I want to take a look at is from Hoka and that is the Skyward X this is another shoe that I think sounded really intriguing but ended up being a little bit underwhelming for me although I know there's a lot of you guys out there that absolutely love this shoe and love what it has to offer and what it has to offer is a pea top layer and some super critical foam it has a kind of a carbon fiber plate in here so on paper it's at least designed to be a big cushion shoe that can pick up the pace which is I kind of think what the oncloud Monster hyper was trying to accomplish and I think both of these shoes do a decent job at that task of being kind of like a Max cushion shoe slash a long run shoe but they just don't really suit my preferences and they don't really work well for me I do think that each of these shoes is going to be something that's going to appeal to some of my bigger taller friends or for some of you that want a little bit more stability in your long run shoes and this shoe actually is priced pretty similarly to the on cloud minder hyper the Hoka Skyward X comes in at $225 which I definitely think that's way too expensive for that shoe but at least we're talking about the same price ranges for each of these two shoes now if you're like me you think both of those shoes are way out of whack when it comes to what they're priced at I got another shoe that I think you should take a look at and that's from saky that's the Triumph 22 again I think that what this shoe is trying to do this year is very similar to what the oncloud Monster hyper is trying to do and I think they're both kind of achieving the same level of success that the Triumph 22 uses an all power power run PB midsole foam this year that means it has a beaded peba midsole foam that is the same type of foam that they use in their race product but it's shaped differently and there isn't a carbon fiber plate to give this more of a daily trainer recovery run kind of feel in effect I find this shoe to be a little bit less interesting than what the paper specs would suggest but it is a very reliable daily training shoe that you can also use for your recovery runs but it's lacking that a little bit of something that I was hoping that I would have just like the oncloud Monster hyper the plus side though for this shoe is that it comes in at a bargain relatively speaking price of $160 the oncloud Monster hyper does look a lot better though so those are my thoughts on the oncloud Monster hyper let me know in the comments if you have any questions about this shoe or any of the shoes that I talked about today or better yet stop by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run clip Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all I have for today everybody thanks so much BR here all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music]",

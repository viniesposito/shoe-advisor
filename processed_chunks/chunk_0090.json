fields around me well there's nothing but the breeze in the greater [Music] no what an epic road trip I'm staring out the windshield right now at Kendall Mountain let's go starting at about 9,000 ft topping out at 13,000 ft but before we dive into the race uh big shout out to well just imagine being a runner a Road Runner a road marathon runner in the' 60s 7s ' 80s you were a little strange let's just call a spade a spade you know you were different if you were a runner back then you uh wore short shorts people stared at you like what is this person doing running for fun well then imagine being a trailer runner in the 60s 7s and 80s so I got to give deference and a shout out to my dad and all the trail Runners of the 60s 7s and 80s for literally blazing the trail for races like this the Kendall Mountain Run all right in Silverton Colorado uh another iconic race in this area is the imagene pass run so we're talking 40 years 50 years of racing up and down this mountain pretty epic I can't wait to see uh see what it's like up there this year and again it's uh 6 mil up 6 mil down the last time I was here was 2020 and so you better believe I'll be throwing it to uh that race Vlog at the end of this video oh my goodness it's just like good to be back in the saddle racing again get even though I raced last weekend so we'll see how the legs uh can deal with the uh the Leadville uh so Leadville is interesting Leadville started at 10,000 and topped out at 13,000 so this one uh this race actually Silverton I'm passing the sign right now is 9,300 uh ft above sea level so it's definitely it's up there but not quite as high as lead Bill Let's Go epicness I'm going to go Cruise the cruise the loop in Silverton and as you can guess Silverton is a uh old silver mining town this is where the uh the old mining used to happen and um man it's just uh it's going to be fun to see everybody all the dgr runners in the southwest corner of Colorado we're back we're racing let's let it rip and I'm going to go pick up the bib number that's always nice to be able to arrive early enough to get the bib number ahead of time so we'll get our bib number eat some angel hair pasta tonight and then uh call it it's an early race start 7:00 so you know no messing around as far as falling asleep and going to bed but okay all right here we go going to move the old truck down to the finish line good always have the Necessities after the race close by if you know what I mean good morning slept like a baby in a little uh little little wman hotel love this this is a great spot in case you ever come down and uh let's rock and roll I talked to the person checking me in yesterday got the bib number it's on that's always good you always want before you leave your hotel tip of the day check for that bib number uh but I asked to how many Runners and because the last time Joseph Barton and I were here was during Co we had to start like we had to start with masks on and stand like 6 to 8 feet apart it was crazy at the start line uh so we're back to normaly and she said 300 I was like wow this is that's a lot I mean I think I think there was I don't know I want to say like 50 Runners last time I was here so we're back let's go get the uh get the warmup on get the racing shoes on and then uh let it rip through the uh the the hills of the San Juans all right these are the San Juan mountains down here in Southwest Colorado they call it the uh they call it the Little Switzerland cuz uh it is it is pretty amazing the uh the hills are just a little steeper a little like right up on top of these towns here these old mining towns all right butter the bread e and let's get a temperature check W yes I like it 38\u00b0 with no sunshine yet all right so that's that's perfect cuz when the Sun hits it'll jump up to 45 pretty quickly so okay finish line finish line here we go 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 [Music] h a [Applause] there on the ridge line well done [Music] [Applause] [Music] good job

look good work that's awesome I love it great job great job finish finish nice work [Music] [Music] [Music] saying goodbye to the High Country seeing maybe see you next year Silverton we shall see epic day amazing day for a lot of different reasons um I did not run as well as maybe I had hoped but guess what uh well first of all no Andes that's right so for those that don't know for if you're new to the channel I get Andes Frozen Custard when I win a race get a PR or get an fkt I bring andies to the house for the whole family to enjoy it's a fun family tradition that we've been doing for probably 5 years now and so when I have to break the news that I got second place and I did not win I did not PR the course today in fact I was about I think 3 or 4 minutes slower than four years ago we'll talk more about that in a second but that's part of the point I want to teach my kids especially the older boys Joseph and Seth they're old enough now to realize like life isn't always going to be a winning proposition there's going to be challenges there's going to be moments where you don't hit your PR where you got to go back to the you know to the training and see what you can do the next time so uh cam who today congrats Cam he's an amazing Runner and Noah in third he's also an amazing Runner and uh so it was fun to mix it up today with some of the really the some of the best Mountain runners in Colorado and so to come in second I feel pretty good about it considering my legs are pretty heavy from the Leadville heavy half marathon you know 7 or eight days ago and so it was it was really good oh yeah that's what I wanted to mention sometimes I am in first place in races or in your situation sometimes you might be on track uh or sorry a little behind track to set a PR on a course that you love you know you run the same race every year and you might be like wait a minute I'm 20 seconds slower than I was a year ago at Mile 2 in a 5k or whatever the case may be well keep fighting because today I was in fourth place for a good chunk of the race probably about 5 miles up and then I caught third place and then eventually second place and that was fun and I did it last year actually at the Pikes Peak Ascent as well where yeah trust me would I prefer to be in first place absolutely but sometimes you got to fight and you're not always going to be in first play you got to fight for every single place and so to move up from fourth place to second place it was just that was that was good and I caught second place on the downhill you guys know me I'm not a fat I'm not a fast fast downhill Runner like it's not it's just not my cup of tea but man I was able to catch second place and that felt good like okay I still got it I can still turn the legs over at 39 These Guys these guys are young pups they're young whipper snappers that I'm racing but I'm trying to hang with them and uh so far so good so anyway that was a that's a little brief recap of the race Kendall Mountain 12 miles uh didn't run as fast as four years ago and the legs just they were a little heavy there were no joke that's why the the Lille heavy half definitely uh stuck around this time so I love you question of the day who raced this past weekend what did you do what was the distance what was the surface tell us your your triumphs but also your challenges okay again again it's not all about just you know nailing it every time you're not going to win every you're not going to win your age group you're not going to PR every race but you keep coming back and you keep coming back that's what it's all about at least in my in my book so onward and upward uh I do have an announcement for yes another race very very soon stay tuned for that uh it's going down in uh I'll just say a state that's neighboring Colorado very very soon all right we'll toss it to the Kendall Mountain race from 4 years ago all right oh man so so good boys we'll get andies again don't you worry seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

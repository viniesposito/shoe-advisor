  "text": "you can't do it I'm not a big fan of scary movies not for me but scary runs all right runs that just make you go this one's going to be a digger we're going to have to dig deep for this so that's today's run the 23m loop from the house uh 2,000 ft of vertical gain it just it's Relentless it just doesn't really stop uh making you focus making you work the entire time and especially with mountain running season uh forthcoming it's not we're not too far off what is it almost we're like 6 weeks away before the snow is melted up there so this that's why I'm doing this 23 milei Loop just getting used to it all right let's rock and roll oh boy a little scary today thank you Jesus for the clouds steady Edy steady Edie just getting it done get in the miles nice steady effort nothing too fast on the downhills nothing too slow on the uphills feeling pretty good preparation for that gym we're at M 17 six miles to go so uh dreaming about some kettle bell action with respect to mobility and core mobility and core mobility and core goals for 2024 nice and easy [Music] [Music] we're back there's the run on your screen got it done with a jog home from the gym all right I a quick trip down memory lane I'm not going to talk about the last eight years of YouTube uh but I do want to talk about the last two years on YouTube and of racing and as I'm like I just been mulling this over and what really spurred on this thought process for me and reflection and it's by the way way too nice to be inside after a long winter and long spring it's like let's get the let's get the vitamin D while we can everybody so um but what spurted on was really the rdam marathon shout out to everybody in the Netherlands we love you thank you for all your support in the Netherlands but all the memories started popping up on Facebook and YouTube Twitter uh from two two years ago feels like that was my road Marathon PR over in rdam feels like yesterday that we were chugging along in uh the streets of Rotterdam so um when I saw that memory pop up I was like man what has been going on the last two years and it's it's just been a lot it's like and it spurred me on to this thought process of the racing and the desire to race um so as I'm thinking and sharing here on YouTube I don't want like yeah yes it's it's my YouTube channel a little bit of my story but really I I just hope it's uh maybe a little Catalyst for you out there like to think back on your last 12 months or last 24 months that's what I've been doing a lot in the last really since I started training again and yes I got a little a little taste of a work a baby uphill workout last week and it just like as Runners like life is like some people like dirt bikes some people like paragliding some people like if you like paragliding let us know in the comments some people like rock climbing I don't know whatever gets your jets going that's that's that's fine with me but for me it's absolutely the training and the racing but I haven't been able to do a ton of racing in the last two years since roterdam since the marathon PR you know we welcome two precious little girls into the world uh the deore deor dearer the family has definitely not gotten smaller in the last two years and so life has just gotten busier there's no other way to say it the big boys are doing you know Sports a lot of baseball this spring and and um so I and oh man the sacrum stress fracture was almost 2 years ago that wiped out an entire summer of potential Racing for me which you know in the summertime is when I do the mountain racing up in the High Country and so as I'm moving forward and oh yeah so for you guys like just hopefully this just a little Catalyst to like okay take a little check where we at everybody and actually question of the day like do you do this have you ever do you do this often where you take a little check a little temperature on your training and your racing and last week's baby uphill workout just got me very excited for potential fast running again in the future and so I guess I you know to answer the question in the title of the Vlog is yes yes yes I will be racing again I don't know when but I will be um all my races have been wiped out in 2024 I was supposed to have done three at this point and the fourth is also going to be wiped out the family we're heading out we're getting out of the country uh hearing about so I'm going to miss the Boulder Boulder 10K unfortunately just uh again life circumstances and so we got to we just got to Pivot and keep moving forward and putting our priorities straight but I am excited to eventually race again and you know I I see the comments and I know I'm I know I'm disappointing many of you with my uh you know my YouTube output and my running output uh even though I'm running 100 miles a week just so everybody knows I am training uh I am getting the work in but I'm just not racing and again it's just like life life is life and you press ahead but Runners we are like oh yeah I I was thinking of this on what was it um you're not you're not out of shape you're just early in the process or you haven't lost your Fitness you're just early in the process of getting your Fitness back meaning um life is is actually kind of long I know sometimes the old saying like you know life is short but like we we have if you stay with it over decades as a runner you're going to have so many opportunities to seize your goals and to chase down your PRS and to go to your bucket list races I know I've got some bucket list races this Summer that I want to do um even though I've missed it for two summers in a row but that's okay you you pick yourself up and you get back on the on the horse and you you try again so that's what we're going to do I have races not going to share them right now I'll make another Vlog very very soon about what I want to be doing for racing in 2024 2023 was the fktsgi I haven't heard from you in 12 months and it's like well I've still been uploading I've still been running almost every day on straa I'm still here we're still alive and that's that that's my little update for all of you yes I will be racing it's been a journey a lot of curveballs but uh that's the beauty of running is that it'll always be there you know the door will always be there for you to turn that door knob the the shoes will always be there to lace them up and go get your volume in so I'm where we go I asked the question today I do believe and um ah man keep it going just keep it going just keep it and life like I I I know you've got a lot of people have grown impatient with me but again I I think in I honestly think in decades I don't think even think in years so it's it's just you just got to keep going when things are hard and it's been very hard the last five to six months for us but we're coming out the other side we're coming so so don't don't stop don't stop all right everybody seek Beauty work hard and love each other",

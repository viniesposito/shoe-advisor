  "text": "at age 45 I've been starting to think that my PR days are behind me but I'm now six weeks into my latest training block getting ready for the half marathon at Houston let's talk about how things are [Music] going yo what's going on kofuzi here coming to you on location from my backyard starting a new series here and I thought we'd do something a little bit different get away from the basement and my two different sets that I have down there so I thought I'd do this outside it is very cold getting colder and it just started snowing so this may be a really bad idea but first things first I think I should clarify that the event that I am training for is at the Houston Marathon in January there's also a half marathon that gets run at the same time so that's the event that I am running and this is an event that I ran before I've actually run both the full and the half ran the full in 2020 and then I ran the half last year for a little bit of a PB 1257 it was a long overdue to update that PB but I was happy to notch that uh but I did it in an annoying time CU it's a 1257 had I run 8 seconds faster I would be A4 guy and that sounds just so much faster than 125 I normally don't get to bothered with what my PBS are and managing little seconds like that but when it's that close it ends up being something that I've been thinking about for the entire year now for that last build I was pretty much self-coached and doing kind of the normal things that I normally do for a marathon uh because I don't really know how to trade myself for a half marathon I did have a Little Help from Sage giving me some pointers on some workouts ahead of that half and that was really helpful but this time I thought I would try using using the Runa app they are the sponsor for this series so let's take a look at what the training has been like so far and let's start with week five Mondays and Wednesdays are usually session days but week five was the week I would be in Austin for the running event so I rearranged my training in the app so that I could have a rest day that coincided with my travel day and then Tuesday was an easy run and I was going to be running with Tommy runs that morning but to hit my mileage goal for the day I needed to tack on a few miles beforehand so I had to get up even earlier and run in the dark but the miles went quickly the sunrise was gorgeous and then I was able to meet up with Tommy now Tommy normally runs his easy runs faster than I do but this was his first run since running the New York Marathon a couple weeks prior so that was a bit of an equalizer and we had a fantastic run that morning [Music] the next day Wednesday was a session day and it was a pretty big one at that 10 * 800 with just 90 seconds of recovery this is basically a yaso 800 a workout that I typically do at the end of a marathon training block when I'm super fit so I was a bit intimidated to find it here in the middle of a half marathon cycle just to up my things and go just to be free just want to Zone just to flow just to hang with the G sometime chill my the good news was that I was able to run in a secret prototype racing shoe from one of the shoe brands I was in town for the running event the bad news is that I can't show it to you or tell you about it but I can say I think that the shoe was really good and I averaged 3 minutes per 800 M repetition which means that the last 5 weeks of ARA has put me in the equivalent of 3-hour marathon Fitness and with how much I been struggling with running and work travel over the last year I really never thought I'd be able to say I was near sub3 Marathon Fitness [Music] again you know when the Thursday was supposed to be an easy 5 1 half miles but at the last minute I was invited to help promote the A6 torches Taco run so I went to that event with Drew whitcom and it was a really good turnout a lot of friends were there but the Run was a bit short in terms of what I needed for the day at about 3 miles so I thought about adding a couple miles to fulfill my quota but the running event is always exhausting so I left good enough alone and then on Friday I was supposed to run an easy 6 but this would end up being the first running session that I skipped with this Runa training block the night before was the running event after party which is typically a very fun but very long night Saturday I was back at home and back at it with an 11 Mile easy run and I feel like I still had no voice after being at TR all week and I felt like I was on the verge of coming down with something but at least my legs felt good and I enjoyed the run and then on Sunday to wind up the week I had my long run workout now this was supposed to be a race simulator based on the paces that Runa thinks that I can race a half marathon at right now and yaso 800s decides Runa thinks that I am in 640 per mile half marathon shape here we go once again one thing to keep in mind is that Runa started over in UK and Europe so I think the training plans are written in kilometers and then converted over to miles so a lot of times warm-ups will be 6 or 1.2 M long or 1 to2 km and today's workout was 3.7 M or 6K at 640 per mile and then 3.1 M or 5K at 640 per mile and then there was an easy 2.5 miles or 4K each for warmup recovery and cool down for total of about 14 Mi I was expecting to struggle and it was certainly hard but I was able to hit the paces for these longer intervals I've been really focusing on keeping my foot on the gas even when I start to feel tired or panicked and I've been trying to remind myself that I can keep holding on to the effort and the pace and just trust that I will still have more left in the tank to finish out the rest of the rep in a way it's been a leap of faith so when I finish this run with the work intervals at faster than G and after the successful yaso 800s earlier in the week I was starting to believe that this run app was actually getting me into a level of really good [Music] Fitness better check [Music] for better Che the next week was the week of Thanksgiving and because of how I rearranged last week I had to do a little bit of of rearranging for this week also I wanted to do a Turkey Trot with my daughter so that had to factor into the rescheduling as well so Monday which is normally a session day was just an easy 7 miles and I can't show you any footage of my shoes on this day either because I am we're testing a different pair of shoes and there's an NDA I don't normally like to running shoes that aren't at least almost nearly production already I'm only one person on this channel and I can only run so many miles in a year so I like to kind of save my miles for shoes that I'm actually going to review so I don't know why I agreed to do this wear [Music] testing Tuesday we were at my in-laws in Iowa for Thanksgiving and the workout was k200 run a kilometer at 610 per mile and then tack on an additional 200 at 530 per mile so basically it was a 1200 met repeats with a fast and then even faster Pace in there the rest was just 90 seconds and then repeat for a total of eight reps this workout was really tough I brought the on cloud broom strike light spray as I enjoy that shoe for very fast work but even those shoes couldn't help me hit these Paces I would consider 610 for mile to be in between 5K and 10K pace for me right now and then having to speed up after a kilometer of that into a 200 M rep at essentially mile race space was so hard and so just when I thought I was getting the hang of the Runa system it felt like the rug was getting pulled out from under me [Music] again now back when I started this runup plan it led me select which race I Was preparing for it asked me what my level of experience was I don't consider myself Elite but it's what I chose based on Rena's definitions and it asked me for a recent race result I just run Berlin Marathon about a month prior it asked me how many days per week I like to run every day please and it asked me what my long runs were like right now and from there it gave me a 13we training plan it was 13 weeks until the half marathon at Houston at the time and from day one the runup workouts have been very tough even the first day of the plan week one day one was humbling it was a long Tempo with paces that didn't seem all that intimidating on paper but I felt like I had to give a race level allout effort on that day and I still didn't hit the paces and it didn't get easier [Music] [Music] So eventually at week four Runa did make an adjustment I Got a notification in the app and after accepting the request for changes it adjusted all my session paces and and once it did that everything was suddenly much more manageable so much so that I thought that maybe the app had overcorrected but that K2 200's workout definitely put me back in my place this run app was not going to cuddle [Music] me Wednesday was an easy run in the more version 5 I had been so looking forward to running in a big mushy maxion shoe after the K2 200s but the more version 5 didn't exactly deliver on what I was hoping for now it was exceptionally cold on that day so I tried to keep that in mind as I was collecting my thoughts on this shoe but this run wasn't as recover full as I was hoping it would have [Music] been now Thursday was supposed to be an interval session but it was also Thanksgiving morning there was a Turkey Trot somewhat nearby that my daughter wanted to try the event is a very hilly 2 and 1/2 Mile Loop and my daughter decided she would race the one laap Loop while I raced the two they gave out turkeys as a prize to the winner of each age group and based on prior year results it looked like my daughter and I each had a very small but nonzero chance of winning the tempts were super cold it was the coldest my daughter has ever run in and we lined up a little bit off the starting line as there were a lot of young fast Runners at this event my goal was to make sure that she got out of the shoot safely before I took off but after about half a mile I could still hear my daughter Breathing heavily behind me at about 610 pace and this was a bit too fast for each of us so I told her to slow down right as we took the first giant downhill now I have really no idea how to Pace a 5m race and I especially don't know how to Pace a 5m race with this kind of elevation change in it but I just went with the flow and it ended up with a 6-minute first mile the Second Mile was all uphill but at least it was gradual and then we hit the really big hill it was over a 100 ft of gain in about a third of a mile and I heavily debated power hiking my arms were numb Frozen and burning at the same time then we finally hit the crest and roll down to the starting line to end lap one and for the second lap I was now able to see who who I was actually racing against there were a couple of guys around me my age and mostly children and I took the big downhill a bit easier this time then on the uphill Second Mile I pushed a bit harder than I did the first time and on the last giant uphill I saw a guy about my age and started to track him down I managed to pass him as we crested the top and yelled at him to come with me to the Finish but he wasn't able to keep up and I crossed the line [Music] instantly I felt like I had paced myself incorrectly because I was tired at the Finish but not race tired does that make sense and then when I found my daughter we looked up the results she had come in third in her age group and I came in second there was another guy a guy I didn't see who finished about 30 seconds ahead of me but even though we didn't win any turkey we had fun some people even recognized me at the event which is not something I typically experience when I go to Iowa but no one asked me if I could run fast in my shoes so that was a bummer Friday my father-in-law needed to bring his truck into Uncle David who is a mechanic a couple Towns over it was super cold so I offered to take the truck in for my father-in-law and I went for a run while I waited for the truck to get serviced it was a nice easy run but it was so cold I've technically run in colder conditions before but I didn't pack clothes for this level of cold it was 16\u00b0 F with a feels likee temp of zero that's about -7\u00b0 C my face froze conditions would not improve much for the following day in fact it was pretty much the same except now it was windy and also I had to do a workout today's long run was 7 1/2 M easy and then 7 1/2 M at 720 Pace my face got so cold running into the headwind that I decided to break up the easy and start the work portion of the long run early into the headwind for a bit before I turned [Music] around this was one of those runs where I worry that my Apple watch is going to die from the cold and it did and I wouldn't have a way to call my wife to come pick me up if I needed to help but fortunately running a couple miles hard into the headwind warmed me up a little and then I was able to turn around and warm up a little bit more the wind wasn't biting at my face anymore and I was able to finish the workout again the paces didn't seem all that intimidating on paper but this workout was hard but at least today I was able to hit the paces the next morning we were back in Illinois and and the tempts weren't much different I had 12 easy miles to run so I headed over to busy Woods each Loop of the park is a bit more than 7 m so I ran about 1 and 1/2 laps busy Woods is typically a very windy place even on days when it's not even windy but luckily today this was one of those rare days when the winds weren't all that bad [Music] so that brings us up to date on the last six weeks with the Runa app I really didn't think that this training plan would be so difficult I don't know why but I just thought that it would be easier yet despite all the challenges that this training plan has thrown my way I've been able to so far stay healthy and I feel like I'm getting really fit hit the Subscribe button so you can get updates for the next installment of this series at after week eight where I'm going to talk about strength training Mobility work and dload weeks and if you want to try runner for yourself you can use the code kofuzi in the app I don't get paid any extra if you do or don't but it's there if you want it [Music]",

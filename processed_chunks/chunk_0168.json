third time I mean we're pavlovian response dogs me and Thomas but she I mean it's the third time so she's had practice Yeah it's true think she knows what's going on we're here with the today's guest Megan Murray Megan Murray also married to Thomas newberger I never actually know what your last name is it's like my wife when we got married she like she had two middle names and she dropped one and I never I I don't even know what her name is wait she started out with two middle names yeah oh and then she like dropped one and picked up I don't know she added your name some I had to ask her every time she hat she's going to hate me cheers anyways I I'm making this somehow about myself which I apologize Megan welcome to the show thanks guys thanks for having me I'm excited to hear your life story I feel like I know it's bits and pieces but but not the whole thing so what are we are we starting from the beginning I we started with the beginning with everyone else I think we have to all right so weren't you born in a car uh no wasn't a snowstorm I was born in a snowstorm nice um which I think my parents love that story for whatever reason I love that story I was the second kid so I feel like the first one they were like you know panicked got to get ready for you know the first one to be born and then I kind of was they were like ah she'll be born when she's born and then middle of a snowstorm I decided it was time why did I have the thought that your dad delivered you in the back seat of that car during the snowstorm well so because there was a snowstorm they couldn't get the doctors to the hospital is my understanding so I don't think like the proper people were in the hospital nice so but did your dad I was not born in a car I was born in a hospital but did your dad deliver you or something uh maybe he had something to do with it yeah oh okay so the way here's the how I pictur it the comic book version the car is on the side of the road the hazards are blinking in the snowstorm here Dad has got the back door open he's you know over Robin with her screaming through uh you know know pain and Megan is born I do know it was so sudden that um they didn't have time to give my mom any drugs so I was born like like a little house in the prairie style yeah so I think it's probably pretty memorable so basically the security guard at the hospital and your dad were just delivering you that's amazing yeah yeah so that was the start um where were you born what Annapolis oh really yeah see that never knew that so I was born in Annapolis and we we had a home there and I lived there I want to say until I was like three or four I don't have many memories of the anisis is in Maryland for those of you who don't know yes capital capital capital city um so I lived there when I was very young and then we moved to Phoenix Maryland which is 45 minutes north of Baltimore city where we all are now that's kind of in the middle of nowhere right it is but I lived in a neighborhood where I didn't feel like like some of my friends lived like what I called like cowland like where their home would be on like 15 acres and they would probably call Horseland up there but yeah yeah Horseland cowland whatever you want to call it it beautiful but where I lived I felt like we were slightly closer to civilization okay like I could walk to the Blockbuster on a Friday night oh really do you know where the Four Corners is I I actually don't think I do okay so if you go up to the county it's it's she's basically on the edge of Oblivion so it's like you go up there there's this place called for Corners it's like Jacksonville uh what I like how they just name their cities after not all all other Jacksonville Phoenix yeah um so it's like San Francisco's up there so like if you need to go to the grocery store and stuff yeah I could walk right okay but after that you're like in like rural so all the rural people come to for Corners to do the shopping and okay so I feel like I had the best of both worlds cuz it was like we were kind of out and had some little land like our house was on an acre I think and then but I could walk to all the cool places that I wanted to I mean walking to a blockbuster that's almost a that's a privilege that most people would never get to that was experience like Pinnacle Friday night order Domino's Pizza walk to Blockbuster go get the new release movie if it wasn't there you'd go to the uh checkout and be like did anyone just return one recently nice you smell weird popcorn in there yeah I'm surprised you didn't get a job there so it I think it closed down by the time I was ready to get a job yeah as Blockbuster did man you could talk about that with the record stores is a experience that I mean Blockbuster was kind of a pain in the butt because it was a responsibility you had the tape you had to get it back but going there and picking out the movie that was fun why are we why are we so nostalgic for something that was such a frustrating experience most of the time because when it worked out it was so good yeah it when it it was kind of like now you surf TV to see what's on and you can go through thousand you're like there's nothing you used to go to Blockbuster thousands of movies and you'd be like there's nothing here MH vers the the fact of the matter is though I think what we're nostalgic about is you used to have to be around people it was an experience yeah the smell as soon as you open that door oh yeah it had that like almost like the movie theater carpet popcorn smell the beaded curtain what's going on back there that that thing I also grew up in a house that was like very health conscious I would say and so Friday nights we would get like maybe it was like $5 maybe it was $10 I don't even know we would get a little bit of money we were allowed to go rent a movie and get candy ni so that was like a big to do and have pizza so so you were born I don't even know what year were you you were born oh okay yeah so 88 so you did get the experience you were still in the transition period between 90s were pre- internet and post yeah I feel like I lived like the perfect scenario of when the internet was introduced to my life if it was any earlier I think it would have been catastrophic yeah um but it it came into my life I feel like at a time that was okay because I grew up are you allowed to say tomboy anymore is that a bad word no you can say that okay I don't know anymore but so that's how I was growing up like we spent all of our time outside I was crawling in sewers most of the time there was a pond in our neighborhood where we would go fishing all the time we'd catch salamanders and frogs dude how did I ever know never know this you're closer to my DNA than I ever thought yeah like we used to catch all the tadpoles and then bring them home and then watch them turn into frogs and then like play with them jumping around everywhere like loved that would catch snakes yeah like never never scared of any reptiles loved reptiles really um yeah like very very much not a girly girl did you ever trick uh like scare your parents or anything like that no and also you couldn't scare my father he was ex-military so none of that was happening and no my mom wasn't she wasn't scared of animals either in any way H so yeah it wasn't even a possibility and I grew up with an older brother so you know right right he's what it is and so your parent so your mom is from the United States right is jersey she's from Jersey okay that's in the United States yeah there's a debate whether it should or shouldn't be but the drones are flying over right now yeah yeah those are weird maybe they'll secede and that's everything will be all right no um yeah if the drones if the drones took out the toll roads in New Jersey that would be awesome maybe we could make that happen just the toll boo that's it are is it is that a big concern for you yeah dude if you D have you ever driv to New York the turnpike but you end up paying a mortgage just to get there no you take the train and skip it all yeah but if you drive if you have to drive there don't um and so anyway so you uh so and your dad's from England right yes he grew up outside of London um ended up coming over to the state to my parents you sound like you're from London okay so funny thing about that is obviously my dad had an accent and growing up none of my friends understood what he was saying and I never understood why he his accent was different than I've heard people with British accent also he was he he kind of mumbled and he was like older and so I feel like all my friends were like what is he saying but I I never understood that he had an accent growing up that's like not until later in life where I was like oh yeah he does sound different I guess it makes sense if you grew up there then if you grew up in the house then it's just how it sounds yeah and so I will tell you this uh when I met Ian he was probably 7s 60s 7s late 6070s 70s okay and it took me a while to to understand what he was saying I I would translate for most people I me he he was very good at yelling sometimes and those words you understood quite well yeah you could pick those up pretty quick and he would call me the the p p word all the time yeah if I didn't smoke a cigar with him or drink rotten Scotch I mean Fair really bad Scotch yeah no I don't yeah I would I don't know if I would do that either um yeah so they they met over here obviously they met actually on the west coast and lived there for a while and then ended up over on the east coast for business and I thought that everyone's parents owned businesses together and that's just how life worked like that's you would own a business together and then get married cuz that's how my parents worked so I just assumed that was what everyone did worked out for me um it's pretty funny that that's not at all how normal people function I love your perception of reality yeah that your dad didn't have an ACC people don't have accents just living in my own world and but your dad was also in the Royal Air Force is that what it's called no the s SAS okay um is is that part of the is thatal is that Under the Umbrella of the Air Force or is that you know how like the N seals are under the Navy I don't know anyways but that's like a special like a legit yeah in fact after I wrote my post about how he was part of that so many people reached out that they were like oh my gosh that's like an insane position to be in and live through and like I think he lived more lives than I'll ever know oh for sure but yeah and he would always be the Storyteller anytime we were at a party like people would be up until 3:00 a.m. just listening to my dad tell insane stories damn I missed out yeah ah um that's because he how long was he in the military for a really well I want to say I don't know 10 15 years would be my guess okay and then and then he left uh or retired I guess from and then okay and then so my parents were in the orthopedic field um my dad actually ended up designing hip and knee Replacements he actually had patents on several different versions of them um it's funny cuz I was telling Thomas we were randomly talking about jobs this morning and when I was in elementary school um like during some of the Summers when my brother and I weren't in camper doing anything we would go to my parents office and they had us work and one of the things we did is they used to make these wax molds of these hip and knee Replacements and the wax would like get outside of the mold and so you'd have to take an X-Acto Knife and like Smooth it all out and so we spent like hours in this Warehouse doing that while we were younger and I remember thinking it was like so like monotonous and boring but we were with these men who were working back in this Factory that were so fun and funny and just wonderful to be around and so like it was just a fun experience that's cool and that was in Maryland yeah they they had a um office building in Hunt Valley whoa so were you basically creating for us like you were you were molding people's knees no so it was a it was like a a mold we were just we were just taking the scrap like the excess wax still that was like going in someone's leg right well so you'd have to put the material in the mold create the oh I feel you okay I got you I got you and also like we would hand it over to someone else who would like also inspect and before it went to another person who so yeah we were not they're like this one has uh someone's initials in the year written in I'm picturing like Tommy Boy when he like tries the the buffer for the filter and it shoots up flies on the window yeah and I'm also thinking like you know how the boys have helped like come and done like some grit packing before they did it like for maybe 10 minutes and they helped out I'm wondering how much actual work like no we would stay for if not a half day like a full day sometimes um that's a good work ethic right there but I remember there was a cafeteria in this office building that that was like the Highlight we were allowed to go get something out of the vending machine at lunchtime so like a candy bar or something and that was like epic what was it about cafeterias when you're a kid like in any workplace it's like a magic if you go to a break room in like the worst break room in any office or you think it's like the coolest place in smells like bad coffee right but that I I remember doing that when I went to visit my mom would go to like a vending machine and the vending machine like being able to pick out anything in a vending machine was like yeah pretty exciting they also so my parents worked a lot and traveled a lot um but so and so every once in a while we'd have to go into their office on a weekend but and so they owned this building and the front half of it was like office building like offices and then the back half was a factory and but it you could obviously get through the whole thing and so they would let us bring our roller blades and there was also a um like a a conferencing system throughout or speaker system yeah and so we were allowed to rollerblade from the front office Parts all the way around to the factory and so my brother and I would like race each other and then we get on the loudspeaker and be like and so like that was super fun yeah in a potentially not fun environment when my parents had to go into an office on a weekend oh that's pretty cool I like that they were all good memories so they have did they work a lot doing that then yeah um yeah my parents worked a lot okay but somehow my mom still managed to like come to all of my sports games and like pick me up from school and yeah I honestly and your school wasn't close by well so um growing up I went to a little private school called St James Academy in monton Maryland okay and so their offices were only 10 minutes from there um so that that drive wasn't bad um when you switched it's when I went to high school that I had quite a trek okay yeah um and then so were your parents well what sports so what sports were you playing when you were younger then um I primarily played soccer so like all year long indoor outdoor um growing up and then when I went to middle school that's when I did lacrosse field hockey and soccer now funny thing is she went to the soccer camp and you got to tell this story um she went to a soccer camp that I ended up sending the boys to okay saying same soccer camp dude's still there really yeah he was probably how old was he when he went there I don't know like he just retired from the Blast Soccer yeah he was a professional who was retired and when my boys went this dude looked like you know is like the [ __ ] keeper no if the [ __ ] keeper had like a giant belly like you know he he he was on a diet of but I remember thinking he was super cool um yeah but tell him about the field trips that you would take um so we would this Camp was you would play soccer all day in these fields but then also like no shade by the way one day a week or maybe half of a day you would go somewhere to like a a lake or a quarry and go swimming or a pool or something like that and I'll never forget this one time he was driving us in like this weird van like this creepy van um and he had like rigged a TV in the center console yeah and was driv Ding and watching this like very violent movie did you say he was also cracked a beer or something he opened something um and I just remember being like what why is he watching TV while we're driving to this place and so D he was ahead of his time yeah and so we go to this this Quarry and we're all like swimming or whatever and we get back in the car and we head back home um where all of our parents are there to pick us up and he realized he left one of the kids at the Quarry and everyone was like freaking out and I was like Mom I don't think this guy's very responsible like and I think I was telling her about the TV and then we never went back oh man and he's so meanwhile I send the kids there so my youngest is is kind of finicky anyway and he there's no shade like they're just in this field in the middle of Maryland summer which you know is like at best 80\u00b0 and 100% humidity yeah and I would get them home and they would just be covered in like dust and dirt and just wet and sweaty uh and he was like I can't go back he's like what I'm like what'd you do today he goes I sat under a tree for like three hours yeah that's I mean yeah that's kind of how it was I guess I mean back then it was like if you didn't get secondhand smokes something they weren't a good coach yeah that was kind of the deal at least in baseball I felt like if if you didn't step in tobacco spit on your way to the Batters box then you were on the wrong you weren't getting coached well I'm like thinking of all my coaches as you're saying that and yeah checks out especially when I was younger I don't feel like there's like athletes back then were really focused on nutrition yeah like being anything outside of playing the sport that was when athletes were just naturally good at stuff like you'd have a dude who was you know 20 like who's a golfer that is is really John yeah John like the John Daly athlete was every athlete like they just played until they got fat and then they stopped playing yeah theying they didn't even have weight rooms in Major League clubhouses till like the late 80s like they didn't work out they just kind of showed up yeah awesome I wish that's how everything was um but yeah anyway so you so that was a kind of your you played soccer a lot yeah and then did you did you do travel soccer or or was it just like indoor like whatever season was did they even have that yeah they had that right they did I don't think I ever joined a travel soccer team I did do some travel across stuff for a little bit um but yeah I think especially having two kids in with like owning a company and yeah having two kids in sports I don't know how we would travel right so then did your parents have to travel for work and stuff yeah okay they traveled quite a bit in fact I had a really good relationship with my grandparents because um that's where we would go and stay like when they would go to Japan or okay wherever um for for a week or so my mom would always try to stay with us so that it was only my dad traveling but there was just several times where they both had to go and so um I was very much a mama's girl growing up so those trips would devastate me um but when you were growing up well I still am so how did you deal with how did you deal with that when that happened uh uh I cry a lot and then my grandmother would tell me not to cry in front of my mom because then my mom would get upset and then she would be upset leaving and it would be a whole thing so I used to try really hard not to cry until she would leave oh man that um yeah I mean eventually I just got used to it and especially as you get older it's like you realize that they're coming back and it's not the end of the world and right it's just hard to imagine that when you're younger and it's the first few trips yeah yeah but also it helped that I had amazing grandparents who were like they they lived in Annapolis and they had a pool in their backyard so it was like a Haven and their basement had a pool table and so so far Robbie whose childhood is the best childhood out of these uh these epod yeah that's awesome I'm I'm really glad I did I I had a really good childhood I feel pretty lucky that's awesome and that it's I mean it's great because your parents you know they they still worked a lot but they were there for you which you I mean that's it's how every kid should have it yeah yeah I mean I think they I mean that's where my work ethic came from for sure was just watching them and it's I had this like Mom who was so loving and then this dad who was like very high expectations and I feel like that combination was yeah pretty good did you ever when your if your when your dad was like that did you ever feel like it was like did you ever hate did you hate it but then later in life you're like I'm glad that happened yeah in the moment I was like you know you don't you never want to be yelled at or you never want to be like I don't know told you can't or can do something or you're not working hard enough or something like that like no one wants to hear that in the moment yeah but I feel like that's you like you need that you need someone that's disciplinary you need someone who's going to challenge you know otherwise you're going to just Coast I feel like that's like 99% of people these days or parents even and myself included in a way you know oh I feel like you want to be you want your kids to be it's like a weird you know I don't know I feel like there's a more of an emphasis now on not do you know what I mean yeah not not push not being too hard in a way 100% is Megan obviously doesn't like yelling yeah uh for you know from childhood and stuff like that but when I am a little bit of a yeller when it comes to the boys yeah and as they grow up I've mellowed but there's still like if if I raise my voice I still see like the Flinch of of [ __ ] yeah and like even when I'm even when I raise my voice you recoil yeah I don't like yelling at all in general I mean I'm I feel you I I there's definitely a balance though like I feel like we've gone too far the other way where it's like everything's okay and everything you can do whatever you want and it's wonderful where like I obviously back in the day when people were like hitting kids and like that's that was not right but there's definitely something in the Middle where like if I see the boys doing something dumb like flat out dumb like trying to get into the toaster with a knife kind of dumb I'm going to yell like my instinct is stop what you're doing and I might throw in an an exploitive yeah and they freeze but that's the whole point I think that when they were growing up if they started riding their bike into the street yeah same thing yeah you yell and they freeze and you get the result you want you they need to remember something like or else you're just going to end up having a kid pancak out in the street sorry that probably too much but yeah um but but for real like I was like you need to know that I this is a serious business but anyways but in the same way also yeah pushing your kids like you don't want to I I feel like it did swing too far where especially in the club soccer travel team this kind of business where parents are like throwing their making their kids try to be professional athletes of the that doesn't help either that's yeah that's a little bit too crazy too and I feel like that's more of like a parent trying to live out some dream that they didn't there were your parents like that with sports uh no although so my dad um coached me for indoor soccer for a few years no one know how to play there everyone's like I don't know what he's saying yeah he made he made him practice with a tennis ball so the way that um they picked they did he did uh the way they picked soccer teams um in indoor is you would go to like these tryy outs and they'd like Mark you as a one two or three like in terms of skills and they try to even it out and how much like it's sounds like a code but if you're a kid in the three Zone like do you you self identify as a three or you like they tell you too like you know they probably don't do that anymore but so they wouldn't let multiple ones be on the same team okay and my friend my best friend of the time um she and I would always be ones and so we got our dads to coach together okay so that we could be on the same team oh it's like The Parent Trap for the coaching trap I like it yeah yeah um it it only worked for one year this was Carrie okay um but anyway I know Carrie was athletic yeah she was very very talented um sorry Carrie for listening she's not she's not um but so my dad coached us this this one year and we ended up with like the most rag tag team in the world like girls who could like this one girl I don't know where she came from she could barely speak English like this one girl was just like had never hadit a soccerball in her life like it was the most insane group of girls you've ever seen in your life and I was like what are we going to do and so my dad was like we're going to start with tennis balls if you can kick a tennis ball you can kick a regular soccer ball you can dodge a wrench I'm telling you he took this team of girls that I was like were there's no chance of anything happening into we like won the tournament that's awesome it was insane but my point of that story was he was very into yelling from the sidelines he got kicked out of multiple games but it wasn't like as the coach you got did the girls who didn't know your dad before they started did did they warm up to him or were they afraid of them uh probably a little bit of both also you have to understand a detail she's leaving out this is becoming the story Ian but his his hands his hands were the biggest hands you've ever seen and I don't mean size lengthwise I mean like each finger yeah I recall I actually do remember this yeah you could put a regular like a 32 in waist belt around his fingers I think I recall shaking his hand and being like I don't want to be on the receiving end of anything military wise I just always picture him grabbing someone's skull and just crushing it yeah oh yeah there's some craniums lying around yeah anyways sorry um I don't know what we talking about indoor soccer he coached it anyway yeah he was but he like he would get very into the games and be like yelling at like a ref not not like us not like and not me like I never felt pressure from either of my parents to like oh you got to practice more you got to do more it was like that all came from within okay okay interesting somewhat like you're running yeah yeah uh but but here's here's how I picture it it Ian went really quickly to Hot Zone and I can imagine a ref not seeing oh yeah something that should have been seen 12-year-old kid reing the game yeah and yeah probably like a 16-year-old and I can't like Ian I like I never his vocabulary for um curse words was extensive and I can't imagine he would be able to hold himself back so I I would love to have some he he he really did a lot but there was a few times where it just went by the wayside that's amazing all right so that's cool so then you in high school you went to I went to Garrison Forest um which I went from a school where I academically I did really well um and I worked hard but it it just wasn't that hard for me to go into a high school that it was very academically challenging and so that was tough for me yeah okay um it was it was definitely an adjustment period and now I was driving 45 minutes to school so I would be leaving the house at 7:00 a.m.",

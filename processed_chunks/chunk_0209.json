  "text": "[Music] all right Robbie we have a special guest this week we're actually going to do a weird thing this month and the guests are going to be people that are part of our family and uh we're pretty excited to announced that Taylor Bodin our lead Trail Reviewer is actually coming on full-time this spring and is going to be a like dedicated to trail running and growing our trail running audience and content side of things Taylor Bodin who I called Taylor Bowden for like a year and a half I mean I don't know welcome Taylor thank you yeah and you're not the only one I my first couple years as a teacher my principal called me Mr Bowden forever and I just kind of quietly told everybody the right way to say it it's French apparently so like a cinjun yeah maybe cjun from Minnesota bod Bodin is I guess you're closer to Canada that would make the French Connection more likely yeah actor there was an actor bod oh yeah get and like uh gold medal snowmobile freestylist oh yeah everybody knows about snow exactly yeah freestyl us motans yeah I I've never like met any other Bodin though so it's fair so Taylor what did you do fulltime now um I am an elementary school teacher teach first grade here in the mountains ofus Park um for a long time that did include coaching too until this year and then it was my uh year of saying no so I'm just teaching just reviewing and uh turns out my year of saying no ended up being a year of saying yes with the believe in the Run family so that's pretty awesome um yeah but yeah that's the gist of it really simple nice yeah so you've been reviewing for us for how long now five years I think five years which is just wild that's gone quick yeah and through that time you've come the trail expert I believe the run and you've run in how many shoes do you think you've run in at this point at trail shoes oh my gosh I don't know well I was just making a list of all the shoes that we reviewed this year for trail and there's like 60 some trail shoes and I I usually get in most of them um right so a lot and then like my first Trail shoe or not even Trail shoe the first shoe I reviewed was this weird mauno which now I know is probably one that nobody else wanted but yeah so I know I know how that is but yeah like a lot of shoes over the years and the trail space has just grown so like there's so many more offerings every single year so I don't even know Robbie a lot I mean one of the things that I was impressed with um besides just the amount of shoes that you've reviewed for us which thank you um is it your Comfort on the trails and your abilities on the trails like I think it's one thing if you can throw down on the road that's like just pure power and muscle and and you know you you got a work ethic or whatever but the trails you kind of need like I don't know uh coordination and power it helps yeah both help for sure um yeah well after I was uh done with college I ran track and cross country through high school and in college colge um and I was pretty much ready to be done with running at least like Road running and stuff and I was thankful that we moved to Estus Park where we're at now and it had a ton of trails and so it really revitalized running for me but I did learn quickly exactly what you're saying of like it requires a few things skill is one of them and it's like over the years you just continue to build some of that comfort and skill but yeah and power power is help helpful too when you're here in the mountains for sure yeah which but you grew up in Minnesota which isn't exactly known for elevation or altitude which is wild because two of the best Ultra Runners of all time Courtney de Walter and Scott jerck are both from Minnesota as well yeah uhhuh yeah I don't know I don't know exactly probably just needing an outlet I was just back in Minnesota for Thanksgiving and even my family which they're fairly active like you can just end up sitting around a lot of the times because it's so dang cold during the winter and so I I have a hunch that many athletes that have come out of Minnesota just like needed something to do and I that's was me too of like I needed to be busy I needed some sort of physical outlet and so I'm glad it ended up being running but some some people ski some people uh you know just go out and shovel snow I don't know Minnesota for athletes ice ice fishing oh man yeah I've had a lot of long days and nights in in the ice castle trying to stay warm and yeah that sounds I've never been ice fishing but I feel like I need to do it at some point in my life I could totally see Robbie sitting freezing his ass off on a lake with like a a thing of beers and a rod in the water sounds pleasant yeah quiet just getting away yeah is and that's what it is I mean that's fishing anyways right but it's a whole new level when you can't move around can't like necessarily get comfortable and that was my childhood experience but nowadays like my grandpa and my uncle the the fish houses they're basically mobile homes you bring out on the ice oh really and they have like bunk beds they have a full kitchen TV and so Wild on yeah I didn't even do that yeah no it's it's a whole new level up there yeah so not to do with snowmobiles and ice fishing I'm going to bring it back to trail running a little bit yeah one of the other things I've noticed about you is that you're you're a super fan of the sport as well like when we were at Western States in Broken Arrow uh this past summer you know all and it's that's the other thing that's weird about tril running because you're all stuck in the village together it's it's not like Road running where yeah Dez is over at this hotel this other athlete's over at that hotel and you kind of see them maybe crossing the street or something like that when we were staying there you see all the athletes in the village or at the coffee shop with them they're very accessible and you seem to know everybody yeah I mean you guys know how it is in the in the running space but especially in like the trail running space uh when it comes down to it uh it's a really fairly small world still even though it feels big to me and like especially now like opportunities are kind of endless in the industry but there's still just like select groups select people it's a bunch of like weirdos who like to be outdoors and and do hard things I guess but there that's not a lot of people in the world so when it comes to events like western states or it was the same at UTMB even even though that was like way next level from Western States even like you end up knowing so many people because it's really not that many people in the world that are doing something like this but it's growing and that's pretty awesome and exciting too do you feel like the way that it's growing is uh well two things do you think it's just the beginning and B do you think it's sustainable because it's trail races are different than road races you can't have 40,000 people on a trail you can have a couple thousand people depending on where it is and which Trails but there's kind of a cap almost totally and especially here in the states it's that way because most of the races are run in National Forest Service which they have a cap depending on where you're at and what particular Forest you're in and so like it is limited in that sense but I I really think it's just the beginning of the the broadening of it like you're probably going to see more races still about the same size for most races that you would see around today but you're just going to see more of them they're going to be more accessible more places uh more companies are creating more opportunities like that and the other part of it is a big part that's growing is like the adventure tourism side of it and so there's a lot of different ways it can grow and it is growing already but it it really seems like it's the beginning because of that but you're right there's only so many people that can effectively be on a trail without just being in a Congo line already um well Scott jerk was talking about like wave Starts Now or or like multiple Day races where there's different you know I guess just plain old waves yeah and you you do see that in like the whole UTMB week is a good one to look at because it's kind of the Pinnacle of our sport it is the Pinnacle of our sport but they have races for 6 days straight and they're starting at different locations but they have a common Finish Line different distances and so some of that's already happening but in terms of like if you know they wanted to raise UTMB to having 10,000 athletes instead of 3,000 athletes yeah they're probably going to have to start in waves like that but also I I feel like that sustainable conversation is a little more the Forefront for trail Runners because we still want it to be an an outdoor experience for the most part want to be like a rock and roll concert yeah exactly and I'm I'm someone who loves competition just as much as anybody else who's really competitive um and I love the sport but yeah there's going to be some challenges with the growth um and there already has been that we I I'm also a race director so we have been trying to manage in that way and like you have to get really creative with how you what you offer how you offer it and but you still want it to be for everybody and yeah that's hard this is that's a good time to shout out your race by the way yeah yeah yeah run wild events in Estus park lots of great races popping up yeah so here I believe in the run it's never a linear line of what we end up doing and and how we end up working on stuff we kind of uh follow opportunities and stuff like that but as coming on as a full-time Trail review what do you think like what are the things that you're hoping that you're going to bring to the table and things that you're hoping that you can grow for the company I feel like this is the interview right here right yeah I know right glad I already agreed to this um and you did too um well I think one thing is like being present at events you were talking about it at the running event of like believe in the Run isn't just doing reviews anymore it's more of a brand so how is our brand going to be able to fit into the outdoor space that's going to be some problem solving and and really from my end I'd love to just follow your guys's creativity on how you've been able to do that so far because there hasn't been we want to do and from my perspective I as a reviewer we want to do this this and this and that how we get to the Pinnacle you're following your creativity and that's part of the reason why I believe in the run is uh viewed as different from the consumer and I mean always having that honesty as part of it so I think figuring out a way that believe in the Run fits into the outdoor space and from my perspective it it's already there that's how it started right mhm yeah yeah I mean I feel like laying that groundwork with the Sho reviews of The Last Five Years the trail shoe reviews and stuff and having you know especially last year doing some stuff out in out in the space has been good um but then having you especially on the West Coast or out in Colorado is great because it's a lot closer in proximity to a lot of the events that are out there I feel like yeah uh which by the way I feel like the East Coast needs to get some some bigger stuff going on I mean there's some good trail races I felt like Vermont had some stuff but not like you're talking about more like Mountain races and stuff like that and I will tellit the the brook and arrow trail series and uh certainly Western States really open our eyes to like like you I looked at you and I was like you feel like a native there you do feel like you belong for us even though I've done Trail Races tons of trail races and uh Ultras and everything like that when I went out there I felt like believe in the run as an entity was uh a guest we weren't embedded what what I'm what I'm hoping you know what I mean yeah sure what I'm like we we watch Dylan Bowman and those guys and they're definitely like that's the that's the crew and and by no means do I feel like we'll be I think if anything we'll be a great partner to free Trail on our Trail side I don't see us as a competitor or uh or even trying to be a competitor with Dylan on that side I think they're doing a phenomenal job and like you coming on is more just broadening uh and making even for the people that are interested in our road reviews more accessible to the trail side of things and you know look most of the people that come to us aren't people that are buying one shoe to do all their running in they want a specific shoe for a specific reason and they want to know okay okay the the trail shoe and I think seeing a legitimate you're a legitimate Mountain Runner you're legitimate racer watching you do the vertical mile was insane uh was that was that just the vertical mile that you did or wait what was vertical kilometer what was the one that you did the first day for broken era where it like it was just like people were they said cough out the blood or spit out the blood it yeah Tim Tolson up there yelling that that was the VK and so going up a kilometer over the shortest distance possible but I think you hit something right on the nose of like we're not trying to be in my mind we wouldn't try to be a competitor and you've done such a great job with believe in the run at this of like not necessarily viewing anybody as competitor but as we all Elevate our own practice it's going to elevate everybody else and that's like just a personal philosophy and something that I teach like try to instill in my athletes of like the idea of competing with each other is GNA bring out the best in everybody and believe in the runs always had the lane of like the gear it's focused on the gear and because of that focus and trust that you've built with a community and I I need to start saying us too because our Trail team has done a lot too as you start building that trust that's what organically um makes these community events so po popular and so desired by so many people because there's a built Trust on the gear level our expertise and it just kind of boils over into the other things so just my view of like this next year is like like let's get into some events Let's Make Believe in the run more well known gain that same trust so that we can do some of the similar things that you guys have been able to achieve on the road side because it's special right like the community that comes from it is really special and well I feel like TR even has I think tra even has more of a community aspect I mean I know there's Road running groups and Crews and everything that's clubs that have become more popular over the last few years but I feel it uh I think trail running in general has a more hit uh history of community or this inside I don't know rag tag Club of people do you think that's partially because when you're out like when you're on the road and something goes wrong you can stop go to 7-Eleven get a car to come pick you up or whatever but when you're on the trails you really are dependent on the other people out there and the a lot of the support comes from like yeah we're in a race and you you're missing a goo and I say hey here you go you need you need some nutrition or something but like when you're out on the trail like it could be a lot more like everything from first aid to well the aid stations you know uh hanging out after the race the fact that you're most people were walking half the time not Taylor though that's what I love about Taylor not Taylor yeah but Robbie and I sometimes having long conversations with people whether they want to or not I have to say I was surprised if both Robbie and Maya's performance at broken trail uh considering that we were City Slickers and not used to altitude I think we we we were respectable on that course I was happy with it oh you totally were yeah and you guys both know you could have done better in that respect but I think trail running yeah when it came down to it like the sports only like as a sport 15 years old and so like it's just starting to get into its Heyday but since it's so new it's been able to maintain some of it its core value of like it all started races literally started of saying hey I think we could do this quicker and start adding people to it start it at a trail head no like all the bells and whistles are kind of taken off and that's the experience people wanted it was never about really anything else and so like I like that that even in these massive Trail Races that piece is still there yeah exactly and so I've always compared it to uh the difference between kind of like music concerts like a fish concert would be more like a trail run versus a Taylor Swift being your you know your uh Marathon major totally yeah it's it's a very Bluegrass Vibe for sure um but yeah it and I think I think with compet the competition side being so relatively new to it there like we're just getting into the days and age where there's getting to be significant money at some races um even some smaller races like some of our races here in SS Park like we offered $ thousand dollars for our backyard uh that we just hosted in the fall like even smaller RAC does that bring does that bring the does that bring the top people well yeah that was the and it did bring more competition like our it was our furthest year yet and so there's but that's only a certain percentage right so that was like 5% of the athletes there were going for that money really whereas the rest of them were still looking for that experience uh on the trail with some people they're they're just there to be on the trail and and so I think I hope that that will just continue as the sport grows for sure I I mean I think there's an appeal to that though like even being at like the broken trail series and seeing these people that are like the top of their their game and just fantastic athletes I mean I think Jim womsley ran the VK challenge with you um yeah you know and then ran the western states but um a week later you know it it's exciting for the average person and I would consider myself an average person to be there knowing that those people are there it's fun to see like the real the real athletes at these at these courses yeah like everybody's just a person there and I know even just Logistics in a major Marathon or something like that like that just wouldn't work out for most athletes that are at the tip of the sphere but it really does work for the trail Community cuz it's all coming down to people just being there wanting a trail experience and even the elite athletes of like they likely got into it because of that too all right let's talk about some personal goals yeah so now that you're opened up and and right now you review shoes and you teach and your your days are pretty structured and the training you don't have as much flexibility for training you're super talented at running trails is there some personal goal that you think that when your schedule's a little more flexible working you know the way that we work that you're going to go after some some big goals I I mean that would be pretty ideal right of like just one just getting into some consistent training where I feel confident that's where I've always struggled as an athlete so like that would be the first and foremost just to feel confident as a runner myself there are some local kts that since I'm in the Boulder area that Solomon pro athletes have taken down that I maybe previously H held I would like to go after that some of that and so like that gets me going like those are the things that motivate me kind of like home course stuff because I love the training I love to Train racing is just kind of it's the celebration um but some other like it would be awesome to do any of the UTMB racing is I still I still love getting into Ultra stuff but the sport has grown so much that we could go to Broken Arrow and I would love to do the premiere event there the 20 was it 23k like some of that but I'd also love to go to Leadville and run the iconic Leadville 100 and do well um Robbie said he would Pace you the whole time yeah yeah I'll Pace you to the start line and then from M from 100K to the end all right so you got make this happen Robbie it's not happening in the time that we've had Trail reviewers we've had a few people picked off the team and ended up being sponsored athletes how many how many athletes have you worked with since you've been at believe in the run that have ended up going pro well what three or four at least Robbie definitely a few I guess determin Pro um yeah but they they've left they had an opportunity with another brand yeah yeah yeah I mean we are women which is awesome yeah exactly exactly well I I think it's also like if you're like we had some women that were quite talented that maybe it's not as easy to find the talent in trail running if you're a a corporation unless you're going to these events so all of a sudden believeing the Run has a reviewer and they start following him and going oh jeez This Woman's pretty rad at trail running yeah checking out their profile yeah and oh you want to come run for normal you want to come run for Hoka we've had Hoka normal um well technically speed land but that was after we he reviewed for us and then had G said da I think we actually set that up I yeah did nevertheless still a sponsored athlete um but yeah and I'm just waiting for someone to send me a contract but haven't seen anything show up you should get the mustache gming contact why isn't it me yeah yeah yeah but I mean I think well just going to say I think that what we're doing is still fairly unique even though like media has blown up even the few years that I've been with believe in the run but yeah having females for one being gear reviewers that's really attractive but also if you're also a very talented athlete you got the you got the pedestal to like kind of display yourself and all you're running from believe in the run the website all you have to do is click on the profile and you can tell some of the Great accomplishments and then you're sponsored the thing that drives me nuts that's actually crazy to me is that we hear companies say or we hear people say oh there's not a lot of female reviewers I'm like there are just whenever we get one get sponsored you take them yeah um and yeah we're always open to Bringing on more Talent if it if it if it fits you just need to know how to take a photo that's photo take a photo and write those are the two requirements absolutely yep and I guess you should run that's a good one yeah you you definitely need to run you should definitely trail run be able to articulate your thoughts about shoes um yeah that's that's also exciting I think that you know we've talked about one of your responsibilities coming on being uh someone that's scouting out you know and not just women but reviewers for uh trail of course you know then Robbie gets to look at him and go yes or no yeah he gets to be the emperor the Gladiator thumbs up or thumbs down he just saw Gladiator a picture taking that is the clutch clutch skill that you need yeah that's a tough one um it's it's it's amazing how many bad photos of shoes you can see and everybody thinks that putting the shoe on a fence post or rock is going to do it we've all we've all been there in the very beginning uh question so since you you actually don't have a lot of time because you are on your lunch break but yep I did want to ask you for people who are looking for shoe recommendations what your favorite trail shoes are right now O Okay well this is kind of hard because some of the trail shoes that we saw at the running event I already have and so like just as a brand the Northface has kind of had my number last year and this year which is crazy they were I know yeah they were trash for a while Megan and I had to do the North Face 50 mile in California with their shoes back in the day Megan still won't run more than a a 50k because of that yeah yeah you can blame that on the North Face but if you get into any of their new stuff like MH got the soft cushion got the responsiveness like I've just been really impressed with them as a brand and that's whenever there's a LW that's kind of what I reach for just because they're fun and feel great and they can approach a lot of different train um we put Brooks catamount three pretty high on the list on our end of year reviews and that's just a great Do-it all shoe it's meant for racing but you can use it for anything it's a Tempo shoe it's based off of the Hyperion line so a lot of it's just fun on the dirt see I'm my favorite Trail shoe this year I I don't know if it even got I haven't seen your Trail picks uh yet but they uh tekon I absolutely loved that the list it was on there and honorable mention it was kind of it was yeah honorable mention number two um I think it works really good for some scenarios you running in the 2.5 2.5 is a better shoe than the three and that's why all the elite athletes are that was my guess I like it's a little more opened up but the problem I think that it has and which I noticed uh when we were out in California 2.5 doesn't have the protection of the foam that the tekon 3 has so I did get some like chunks out on some of the rocky terrain that we did but I I just love that shoe yeah it it's a great shoe for certain terrain and it's one of the like if I could like put that midsole on pretty much any other upper like it's just fun feels good you could go so so far with it without any complications yeah that's great SHO tell me have you run in have you run in the norta 05 yet because we did get it a month ago at or a couple weeks ago at the running event have you run in it yet uh just on our Austin run and spent a couple days on cement floors in it but that one's super impressive how light it is how responsive how good the upper feels like that one's going to be a race day pick for sure we wore it all week and our feet felt fine sorry about that yeah talking over we wore it all week and the feet felt fine so I can't imagine it wouldn't be great on the trails the only thing I guess would be uh my concern or or question more than a concern would be it's got a small lugs on it so it's not going to be great for like really technical train but like the stuff that that we were running on when we were out in uh in Olympic Village or or wherever that was um it seemed like it would be a great shoe for that kind of terrain right yeah but at the same time like I'm not trying to say that I am the elite level reviewer and that everybody should listen to me in this sense but so many people I'm I'm up there I know that um but so many people dog any shoe that has a 4 millimeter or three and a half millimeter lug which in most conditions it's going to do fine on any terrain I normally would prefer it really yeah exactly if and it's more versatile to be able to hit some roads or smoother sections and so if you're picking a shoe based just off the out sole um I would probably refine your practice of doing that because it it do a lot it's not goingon to dig into the mud yeah we should note that Matt sidel uh norda athlete he wore the o05 for JFK 50 mile front to back all 50 miles and that's some crazy terrain on the at and came in third place third place overall yeah without changing yeah I don't know if there's any other top 10 athletes on either side that stayed in one pair of shoes so that's just like impressive on its own and he's he's a good he's a really good athlete as well but like if you can run that race in particular with one pair of shoes where many people are switching into Alpha flies for the the faster section like I heard that was a mistake some people like too harsh for the alpha flies on the um Toth so one guy actually messaged me and said that he wore the clo X X1 because he was like you guys always talk about being a great trainer and he's like it had the cushion had the thing he goes I had a Flawless second half where his brother-in-law wore the alpha flies and got blisters and stuff W I don't know that i' want to be alphafly is great for like Road where you're not going to be shifting around a lot in the shoe I don't know how great it would be on that Toe Path but it's just a uh one person's opinion but no I I wasn't questioning whether or not the lugs would be good I just am curious how it would perform on the trails I prefer a smaller lug just CU I like a smoother feel Under Foot especially if you're going long distance that having that cleat feel I've worn innovates and I've worn like smoother trail shoes innovat or soccer CLE let's I mean it was great the time I warm cuz it was muddy and snow was on the ground so it worked out but it wasn't exactly the most comfortable yeah but it but it can work even if it has shorter lugs that's a thing and do really well like I would think that would be a good shoe for hat because you have those Road sections oh yeah for sure yeah definitely um how much time we got left Taylor time check let's do five minutes yeah minutes did you eat your peut butter and jelly sandwich not yet saving that for later I actually do have another question since you are from Minnesota and you run in the cold a lot and winter is we're just getting into it right here in the Mid-Atlantic where it starts to get real cold what's your favorite cold weather running tips um mittens are magical the just keeping the fingers together it makes all the difference like I wear mittens all the time and we just got in these new arc TS mittens wonderful they're like a gortex basically a gortex liner as a mitten and I can wear that like it was 17 degrees this morning and I only wore that and it's basically a liner and did fine but you can put wait gloves in it when you're say it's like a shell and then you have gloves inside you can do gloves inside but you don't have to like I didn't wait you just wore a shell over your hand and what was the temperature well it has like it doesn't have a micro fleece um I don't know the material that's on the inside there is a an internal liner of some sort but it's yeah it's it's a gortex yeah what was it temp yeah 17 17 17 I'm complaining over here about 29 yeah it's probably probably feel like summer yeah and I live a little higher than uh the town here and so it's it's it's basically like between 10 and 20\u00b0 most of my runs for how how long what part of the year is that 5 months more than that yeah yeah our winter is like six months like Colorado seems so cool when you look at it in the summer or if you're at a ski resort but it sounds horrible to live there Taylor's always trying to get me to he's like dude you got to move to Colorado for The Last 5 Years I'm like I have the app on my the weather app on my phone and I have esta spark just to look at it and when it's September and there's I see a 10\u00b0 morning I'm like absolutely not and by the way Taylor if he moves to uh if if you get him to move to Colorado you're both fired dang it okay there's no way well then don't I need I need now yeah especially when Five Hour Energy what I'd like is a campus there we should have like set up a Colorado campus okay we can travel out there for a week do some trail running with do a a canvas tent out in the field I just remember I always went to Colorado in the winter to go skiing and then I did the trans Rockies run and I will never go back to Colorado except for in the in summer it's beautiful it's it's yeah it is amazing it really is the the Saving Grace especially if you're not a huge skier like I I enjoy skiing but I SK for the uphill action of it if you're a big skier you can play in all all seasons for sure who skis for the uphill action that's insane is that you mean the lift the ski lift yeah nope you vape on the ski lift and drink some beers on the way up drink Fireball yeah okay I have done that but not typically yeah yeah Fireball not dude when I was a kid peppermint stomach bags oh yeah that was the move okay just out of the inside pocket yeah um but for color I'm just going to give it a good wrap I'm looking outside and kids are in T-shirts because it's like 50 degrees right now so it could be 17 in the morning and warm up okay that is true it does it's today it's still 30 degrees here in the after Mill of the afternoon but it's 50 there so it's well being in Minnesota I was reminded I'm never living there again because any sort of in the air just makes it feel so cold yeah yeah so never doing that again all right I love Minnesota but well that's a good way to wrap it up we're back to Minnesota um anything else we forgot to say it all comes back around no um but I I am really excited for what we're kind of stepping into for beli in the run I think the next year is yeah big exposure getting us out there but there's so much there's so much to be had in the sport and the space and with the people um I'm honored and just super excited to really get rolling I'm just it's so much fun to watch the team grow and to have good people on the team and and I think what you'll you've already been with us so you kind of know the culture but once the team is is the the most important part of of this whole whole thing and it makes it all worthwhile is is lifting everybody together it it really does and that's like I've had one offer from a competitor and one offer from like a more local magazine to do stuff for outdoors and but there's nothing quite like beli in their run sense of team and um I just have always loved the vision you have for the people on your team and so I haven't wanted to go anywhere else or try this that's cool who's a competitor cuz have to stomp on the neck yeah feminist and Robby out there with a gun yeah yeah Robbie's First assignment all right well we'll uh we'll talk to you soon have fun the rest of your school day teaching make sure you eat your lunch thank you thank you and just remember if those little guys get on your nerves you only have a little bit longer with them few more hours yeah cool I was thinking no oh just another semester yeah yeah all right man we'll talk to you soon take it ease sounds good thank you guys [Music] [Applause]",

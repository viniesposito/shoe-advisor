  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers with another running shoe review in this video I'm going to be doing my full review of The sakon Exodus Ultra Trail [Music] 3 so Exodus Ultra 3 costs \u00a3150 or $160 it weighs 311 G or 11 oz for men in the size 8 and the drop is 6 [Music] mm socony Exodus Ultra 3 is a trail shoe that's designed for tackling longer sessions in the outdoors it does that by combining cushioning stability and a responsive foam to produce a balanc ride that takes a lot of boxes if you're planning on running for a long time the midsole is a dual layer of the brand speed Focus power on PB foam alongside a more supportive and durable power run frame a wider base and sidewalls add even more stability to the ride on the out soole is s's power track rubber to improve traction and protect the midsole and the upper is made from a closed mesh that aims to be both breathable and [Music] protected Fit For Me In The Exodus Ultra 3 I'm size eight UK this is a size eight found it to be quite a a well width shoe um and there's plenty of space in the forefoot as well for a trail shoe um yeah I definitely found it to be uh very comfortable it's quite a High um toe box as well so plenty of room for your feet to move around tape is a bit at the end um so you know if you're used to using shoes like Ultra or something like that you're probably going to notice that there's a bit of a taper but uh I've got fairly average width feet uh and my feet don't taper massively at the end but I didn't have any problems with it I found it to be very comfortable um even over longer sessions so I definitely say to my size in this shoe there's plenty of padding around it as well very comfortable upper um nice and breathable as well okay so the Exodus uh Ultra 3 um I've done a few runs in this now um uh long run I've raced in it I did 10 Mile racing it over with the Downs uh and I've done a few easy runs in it as well uh and I found it to be a really solid comfortable all round Trail shoe um the fact that it's designed or that talks it's it's in its name it's called an Ultra Shoe and the brand talks about it being a shoe designed for a long distance um I think it's not necessarily you have to buy it if if if that's the sort of shoe you're wanting I think it's actually very accessible Trail shoe for a lot of reasons the reason why uh it's the brand and people talk about it being good good for longer distance is because uh it's very comfortable there's a good balance in this shoe between comfort and the more technical elements that you would want if you're running for a long period of time so it's got this dual midell it's got the power on PB foam in it and it's got power on as well power on PB foam is the sort softer bouncier more race orientated Pham which is designed to give you a bit more energy back um and if you just had that that's can be tricky for a trail shoe because you want stability and that other power on foam adds stability in it as well so over over all it is a very solid stable shoe you do feel a little bit of nice softness from that Midol from that power on PB but it does feel very stable as well which is one of the major reasons why it's good for for longer distance training one of the things about running on the trails if you're um going out for a long time is that when you get tired and you don't have stability in your shoe you're going to notice that because you want stability so you don't trip over um and it does a good job with that so it's that's that's the main reason why I think it's really classed as an Ultra Shoe but those benefits don't necessarily mean that it's just good for Ultras um you can definitely use it for easier runs shorter distance runs I've used it for all sorts of runs and I found it to be a very very comfortable shoe for all of those um what I would say is that I don't necessarily need the level of balance uh and it might be a little bit too firm for me over easier runs over harder harder terrain um but for most people I think it'd be absolutely fine uh and it's very comfortable to run also say about the shoe is that it does feel quite um quite quite poppy on the run it does feel like you can pick up the pace nicely it's not shoe that I would use for um really fast training I don't normally do interval sessions or anything like that I don't tend to race very much when I'm out on the Trails um I much prefer to use the trails as a more comfortable long run um to to um accommodate my uh faster training that I'm doing uh on the road um but it does feel like a pretty pretty good shoe for for running at a consistent Pace quite well when I was running the 10 mile race the leis downlands 10 Mile um it felt like a good shoe for that I wasn't going all out I wasn't r at my race pace foot that I would on road but I was consistently running at a a taxing pace and I felt the shoe did a really good job at it uh just feels quite nice light on the feet and you do get a little bit of nice comfort in there but it's nice and responsive as well because you've got that duwel layer of midell foam in so all in all a very solid uh shoe if you're looking for something a little bit more performance orientated but you still want those elements of comfort in there as well um other things I would say about this shoe uh the out soole isn't great uh it's okay it's got this power track outsole um I've never really been a fan of of of power track on some shoes what it's not as good as things like a vibr outo that you'd get on some of the hoker shoes um it's fine um but what I did notice is it's quite hard um outsole uh and it doesn't doesn't feel very tacky and when I was out running on the downs and I hit some uh wet rocks and things like that I did feel like it just didn't have the the grip and um the ability to sort of hold on to those those rocks nicely so I was really careful when I was out running on the down in the wet in this shoe uh if you're on muddier terrain uh it's okay until you get to a point so if you're running across really wet boggy uh slushy mud those outsole logs aren't massive so it's really not designed for that as well um that might actually be um uh where it's that sort of ultra thing comes in as well so I think for a lot of people uh running those sort of longer distances you're going to be looking at running along uh maybe more comfortable Forest paths public foot paths um and on those sorts of terrain maybe in the warmer months uh where it's not really really water logged I think that's probably the sweet spot for this shoe so you're not going too far away from um that sort of hardened um that sort of hardened ground that you would get on those Trails but definitely I wouldn't use it for really technical terrain on the mountains when it might be wet or slippy I definitely wouldn't use it on wet bogy terrain I wouldn't go up the late districts in this year and start trying to run up the hills because I just don't think the grip would be would be good enough for that uh but other than that I've really enjoyed using the shoe I think it's a solid all round balanc shoe that a lot of PE people could really enjoy you don't have to be an ultra Runner to to to get the benefits out of this shoe um and all in all I very much enjoyed running it I think a lot of people could use this shoe and and and see the benefits of it so my final verdict on the uh s Exodus Ultra 3 I think it's a great all around Trail shoe it's not necessarily a shoe that you need to be an ultra Runner to use um but it definitely has some benefits for people running ultramarathons um if you're just a long-distance Trail Runner and you're really focused on chugging out the miles and you want something that's comfortable stable um and just really does the job on a certain type of terrain I think it's a really really solid shoe um I definitely don't think it's a shoe that has loads of Versatility when it comes to terrain I think it's really designed for those lighter Trails or the trails that um are more what you're going to expect from um uh more the nicer climats uh in maybe the winter or the spring or the Autumn uh you're not going to be wanting to use this in really wet soggy conditions icy uh conditions or um if you're running up in the mountains and the rocks and things like that I don't think it's got the the outso for that um but for more General conditions if you're running for a long time through public foot pass and things like that I think it's a really solid balanced stable shoe and I think a lot of people are going to like it uh other options that you might look at instead of this shoe would be something like the HW tecton range I haven't tried the three um and that's obviously got a plate in it as well so you might not want a plate in it but those shoes for me just have a little bit more to them I like the midsole in those shoes um same as something like the speed goat range I haven't tried the most recent version of the speed goat the speed goat is very similar in a lot of ways of the shoe but I think the out soole and the midsole are just a little bit better than than what you get in the uh Exodus little bit more comfortable for me um and also better grip from from the outso as well so I think there are better options but this is probably the best balanced option if you really want stability as well because I think stability is a big factor in the uh benefits of this shoe that's it from me on this review thanks a lot for watching don't

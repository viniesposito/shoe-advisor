aerobic engine and the aerobic engine is your cardiovascular system that takes time to develop and the more that you run over years and years and years the better it gets so Pap is almost 40 yeah and second place probably was 19 W maybe 18 I he was young wow he was very his parents were there yeah he was very young wow which means his cardiovascular system is still developing okay and uh so he went out with me the first mile mile and a half which is great but eventually my aerobic engine took over because it's been developed for decades now and that's where the perseverance and hard work go hand inand um to develop and then boom you fly the W and you're literally twice as old you're literally twice as old as the second second place wow so yes Michael so like you were like that was

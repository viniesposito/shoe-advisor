  "text": "hey Tommy for the Run testers with another running shoe versus in this video we are going to be looking at the new Balan 10v 14 and the sakon Triumph 22 let's have a look at what we all [Music] thought the New Balance 1080 v14 costs \u00a3160 or $164.99 it weighs \u00a3287 G or 10.1 Oz for men in a size 8 and the drop is 6 mm the so 22 cost \u00a3170 or $160 it weighs 306 G or 10.8 o for men in a size 8 and the drop is 10 [Music] mm the New Balance 1080 v14 is a daily shoe built for comfort and accessibility in the previous version of the shoe New Balance modified the fresh FX midsole to be noticeably softer but with that came a dip in the stability and the versatility of the shoe the Tennesse v14 addresses that with a slightly f version of the foam and the overall Mido geometry in addition there's an updated engineered mesh upper to improve the fit and provide better breathability that also includes a good level of padding as well as a soft gusseted tongue on the outsole is a modest layer of rubber across the key areas of the shoe although this doesn't cover the full length of the midell foam the sagon trium 22 sees some major updates to the line the biggest of those is a new poweron PB foam midsole a peber based material replacing the poweron plus found in the Triumph 20 1 that aims to improve cushioning energy return and responsiveness the same phone is used in the sakon Endorphin Pro 4 and speed 4 there's also an updated upper that's designed to be even plusher and more comfortable than its predecessor and a noticeably wider base across the full length of the shoe to improve stability on the out soole there's a generous layer of rubber to provide grip and protect the midsole phone I ran in my regular UK running size which is 8 and 1 half that is a nine in New Balance in the us first thing I when I first put them on is they do feel quite snug this is a close fitting shoe I find all New Balance shoes nowadays can be a little bit problematic on sizing I have to work quite hard to make sure I get the right size but having run these in overall I think there's just about enough room there's a decent sort of bit of room at the end of the toe box there's a nice kind of amount of wiggle room across the top here and the flexible up has really helped out the only point I really find they do hold snug into the kind of tone up and across the top of this midfoot partly because of this big padded tongue that really sort of holds there back into the hill collar everything is super padded super plush I get good heel hold good stability back there flipping over to the sakon Triumph 22 it's not a dissimilar story to be honest there's a bit more room up the end of the toes you can see so there's you know this is basically the same uk8 and a half but a USA 9 and a half so slightly different if you're buying in the US but overall nice Airy fit across the toes uh again the flexible uppers is a bit more structure to them so there's not quite as much kind of knitted wiggle room that you get here but there is still plenty of wiggle room plenty Airy there with the space around the toes when you come back into the toe Knuckles this is where there's just a bit more give and a bit more room compared to the New Balance 108 v14 in my kind of true to size the back of the shoe is very similar to the New Balance padded tongue that just takes the lace pinch off covers all the way down under the laces you've got these big big padded heel collars they're probably marginally more padded than the New Balance 1018 they still hold really nicely keep everything locked in place I'd recommend going true to size in the sakon Triumph 22 I think with the new Balan 1080 v14 if you like it really roomy you might want to consider looking at the wide fit in that shoe but I think I can get away with going true to size just with a slightly more snug fit when it comes to the fit of the two shoes I've got my normal UK size in both which is a uk9 with sakon that's a us10 with New Balance it's a US 9.5 both of them fit me really well in that size the normal size have for both of these Brands I think obviously the new balance is maybe a little bit more dialed in because it is a smaller shoe in the US but I actually had enough room in both shoes but not too much room good hold around the heand midfoot so I would say stick to your normal running shoe size for both of these Brands s is generally very consistent across its range is fair to say New Balance can be a bit more up and down with it sizing but the 1080 fit me really well and it's the same size I've used across all previous models of the shoe as well so ter of fit has been very good for me overall in both of these shoes no major issues to report I would say these are true size fishing shoes have had them both in a UK size8 and that's been absolutely fine for me uh what I would say is obviously these are kind of very well kind of padded shoes I think with the tri 22 is a little bit more liberal with that padding throughout the shoe i' would say the tri 22 has a little bit more volume as well overall there's a bit more room in that kind of toe box as well uh so if that's something that you want then I think the tri 22 is going to get you that now that's not to say that the 1080 v14 is snug by any uh stretch of the imagination it's good good room there in that toe box as well too the midfoot holds are very similar the kind of lacing and tongue combos are very similar as well a lot of padding in that tongue it's the same story for the hill colors so for me I think if you want the kind of slightly roomier more spacious uh kind of cushion shoe then it would be the trip 22 to go for But ultimately going through to size you shouldn't have any problem on either of these shoes okay so I have a size eight in both of these shoes uh I found them to be very comfortable shoes to wear um I there's plenty of space in the for foot of these shoes they're both shoes designed for comfort really um there's there's plenty of space for my big toe and around the front side of uh the trium 22 same goes for the 1080 v14 uh there's plenty of padding there's more padding in the trium 22 in fact it feels like a very plush shoe to wear um but there's still plenty in the 1080 v14 uh overall I would definitely say stay to your size in both of these shoes I've had no issues at all in these fan to be um very comfortable and well fitted uh with nice comfortable uppers as well so the New Balance 1080 and S Triumph are both very long running and popular cushion daily trainer lines they've both undergone I think a pretty big change this year I would say and if you were asking me about these two shoes last year I'd have picked the Triumph 21 over the 1080 v13 myself but I think the updates made this year have definitely skewed me in favor of the 1080 v14 which is one of my favorite cushion shoes all around this year whereas the Triumph 22 is one that haven't got on with all that well so with the Triumph 22 sakon obviously completely revamp this Mido putting in power run PB a very exciting change on paper bringing that PEB based foam to this cushion shoe a big slab of it big wide base to make sure it's still stable sidewalls of foam and all that and you thought you should have a nice Lively but stable and cushioned ride but while it is protective and cushioned for sure it's actually not a very Lively shoe at all you get a little bit of a roll through from The Rocker but I found it just quite a bit dull and lifeless running at easy paces and I found it way too heavy and big to pick up the pacing as well so I don't think it scores that highly on either versatility or the fun of the ride with this I mean it still is certainly a comfortable protective shoe and that's his primary job is to Hoover up a lot of miles and protect the legs but it doesn't do it in a very engaging or fun way and although it is protective I don't think it's especially soft like it is quite soft at the heel for sure but I don't think it's as soft as the new Balan 1080 v14 the previous model of the shoe the 1080 v13 was really soft it was too soft for me it was very squishy I found that I was almost wading through the foam and it kind of sapped the energy out of me even at easy Paces on long runs like for short easy runs it was okay it was really soft and fun but I it was a shoe that I didn't really get into sink with and enjoy ticking over long miles in it was just a bit too present on my foot I think New Balance just basically made the foam a little bit more resilient with the 1080 v14 and that's make a huge difference for me in terms of my enjoyment of the shoe on the run it's still certainly a very soft shoe and softer than the Triumph in my opinion but I think now I get a much more natural transition from Heel To Toe I get a little bit more ping off that foam in the for foot and the shoe just feels a bit more lively and fun while still having that really soft and protective element to it as well I wouldn't say the 1080 is a particularly far shoe but I think it is a more vertile shoe than the Triumph 22 if you are looking for one of these to use as a daily trainer to cover a lot of different runs which is helped by the fact it's a bit lighter and just feels a fair bit nimbler on the foot because it has got a much smaller design that isn't quite so wide and maybe the Triumph is a bit more stable as a result of that but I didn't have any stability problems myself with the 1080 v14 even with a fairly soft foam underfoot did a short run in both uses at the same time and yeah the difference is really quite Stark on the run for me like the 1080 really feels a lot more Nimble soft fun like just turns over a bit more easily whereas the Triumph just feels like a really big shoe to me a heavy shoe and you know it has that rocker it works okay but just don't get a lot from the fo you don't get a really nice soft feel like I said it's definitely a protective shoe it's going to do the job and like protecting the legs on easy miles and it is cushion but it doesn't feel very soft and it doesn't feel you know like a very fun shoe to pull on it feels a lot denser underfoot than the 1080 which just feels a bit more lively and fun while still being nice and soft and disappears on the foot a bit more like I'm going out for an easy ride I just feel like I can tick over in the tenat and not really think about it too much whereas the Triumph it's a little bit intrusive in how large it is so turns my running time in these two shoes I would say first and foremost these aren't necessarily my favorite versions of these respective lines I think they have been changes here from the previous versions of these shoes I think have these changes necess made them better shoes I'm not necessarily convinced but I think in terms of taking those key boxes of Max cushion shoes it really prioritize comfort and protection they do that uh very well these are going to be shoes that you use for easy runs recovery runs longer runs where you are not running your hardest or fastest and you just want something to tick that mileage off and you just want those kind of training modes in the bank these are going to be shoes that are going to do that they definitely do it in slightly different ways I think the first way I would say or thing that's kind of really stood out for me has been the weight of these shoes now obviously these are Max cushion shoes they're not going to be super light shoes but I would say the tri 22 has felt like the bigger shoe to me I talked about the level of padding more notable padding in the shoe and it just feels like a lot more shoe when I've been running in the tri 22 compared to the 10814 well I think the the distribution of the weight feels a lot more balanced in this shoe ultimately and I think that really has a big um say in the experience of running these shoes the other aspect here obviously is the midsole and it's not just about the midell sensation what it feels like it's you know the formation of it you know what's surrounding it to kind of deliver that kind of ride as well too the tri 22 getting power R PB a big stack of it obviously we loved it in the Endorphin line you know it's a big stack at the hill and then you get down and kind of Narrows obviously in the forfeit which kind of generally that's what we expect to see you're getting a similar stack of this kind of fresh foam X foam in the 1080 v14 what I would say is that it doesn't narrow as much and I think it's a bit more consistent in terms of that spread of that foam now I think what that does ultimately it creates something that is you using that phone to create a quite stable feel you know this is a very stable shoe as well too and I think the outsole contributes to that but ultimately that's I think what that foam kind of does in one aspect I think the try turn into the power on PB while you know we've loved it in the power um kind of endorphin line I think you know for me it doesn't feel as you know bouncy as I would expect it to be I didn't find it as plush either kind of Falls in between something of that and I think ultimately just feels a bit laborous to run in the shoe e kind of easy and Recovery Paces I just felt like a bit of an effort to roll in the shoe I didn't feel like it was Mak or helping me in any way to really get through that time where maybe I didn't want to be out running I think for me the 1080 v14 you know I really like the 1080 v13 this mid so is not as soft and plush but it still has a plusher element to it and a little bit more resilient I would say and I think what that does is it makes it more comfortable I think and more protective over longer distances I do still think that it's a easy run um shoe or recovery run shoe I think it can handle moderate Paces as well uh particularly compared to the Triumph 22 and I think the key thing for me is not just the midsole it's also The Rocker The Rocker is just a bit more prominent uh it's not overly aggressive but it's enough to kind of roll you through from Hill to toone just kind of really get you through those kind of um those running miles particular those longer ones as well was I feel like that kind of lacked or was lacking for me in the trium 22 I think from an outside point of view not a huge amount in it I think there's a bit more rubber and coverage on the tri 2 2 outs soole compared to the 108 v14 these are going to be shoes ultimately going to spend a lot of time in I think from a traction and grip point of view Pavements and Roads absolutely fine I think kind of lighter trails are absolutely going to be fine there as well too um I just think maybe you're getting a little bit more rubber um on the TR to but it's not a huge amount here so ultimately these are Max cushion shoes I think as I said tick those key boxes in terms of the one that I would go for I'll get into that next okay so two shoes that are designed for simar purpose they're both daily shoes that Veer more towards that cushioned comfortable side of running um they are shoes that have had uh a few developments from the pr the previous versions of both of these shoes some not necessarily welcome ones uh let's start with the 108 v14 so uh 10 v14 big fan of this shoe um the 108 v13 uh I was a really I was really keen on that shoe um because 1080 V12 v11 was wasn't really keen on those found them to be a very boring design of shoe uh the Mido just didn't really do a lot for me it just felt a little bit dead um it was quite well balanced so you it was quite accessible for a lot of people because it wasn't too soft um and also relatively stable uh for for for those sorts of shoes uh and then the ten v13 came along and the new MID is really really soft so it suddenly uh polarized the audience quite a bit because some people didn't really want it to go that soft and if you're a really heavy Runner or you don't really like running in soft shoes ten v13 was a little bit of a Marite shoe um for me I really like soft shoes so I very much enjoyed it but um it had limitations in that shoe you couldn't really run a long distance in it because it sap a lot of your energy because it was really soft it's great for Recovery runs and easy runs just cuz it dead in the impact just felt very soft nestled your feet into the ground um but a lot of people didn't didn't like that shoe because of that um the 10 v14 has rectified that a bit um one of the other problems with the 10 v13 is because of that softer midsole it lacked a little bit of stability which the previous versions had 10 v14 fixes that by making it bit more stable through the design of the midsole and the midle uh itself uh the foam in there um and as a result it is a nice balance between the V12 and the v13 it's not as soft as the v13 but it's definitely softer than the V12 uh and as a result um it's a great daily shoe it's really solid um you for easy runs recover runs great for longer distance efforts anything like that where you're running at a nice comfortable Pace very very good and it's probably a bit it's definitely a bit more versal than versatile than T v13 um just because it's got a bit more of a responsive midsole in it all in all really solid daily shoe no problems at all with this I've I've been using this for about 70k so far I've been doing a lot of marathon training sessions in it the sort of one um 1 hour run my um comfortable pace which should be like 5 minute kilm great tick in the Box really enjoyed it nothing amazing about it it's not like I finish a run in the shoe and think that was a phenomenal uh experience nice and bouncy it's not like the Mizuno Neo Vista or something good solid shoe and definitely a very accessible shoe because you're getting a nice balance midso now the S trium 22 um the S trium 21 and the 20 I was a massive fan of both those shoes they were like my perfect running shoe they were uh quite soft a little bit of energy returning them very enjoyable to running very comfortable uh but also you could pick up the pace nicely in them as well they were like the perfect holiday shoe that you could take away with you because you could just do loads of easy ones in it but if you really wanted to go and do intervals or something you could do a bit of them in that shoe so it was a great daily shoe that really ticked a lot of boxes uh and um yeah it was a big fan of the 21 22 um there's a few changes to this shoe which I really just don't get along with the Midol foam it just feels um a lot thicker to me and a lot denser and I don't get a lot a lot of cushioning out of it I'm 69 kg so I'm not getting the best out of this midell phone probably I think if you're heavier you're probably going to get a little bit more compression out of this um but the way the shoe is designed um I I'm a mid foot Striker and I hit the shoe right in the middle and um it I just don't get anything out of it it's like I hit the ground and just stops and then I lift my foot up and go again and I don't really get any rolling action from it I don't really get any um com cushioning from it I it doesn't sort of compress when I'm running in it it just feels very clunky to me as a shoe and I uh I used this shoe actually um because I ran Boston Marathon and London Marathon six days after I ran Boston in alphafly 3es um but because I was doing London as a sort of comfortable run at my easy run Pace I decided to use the try 22 because I was such a big fan of 21 I thought I'll give it a go and it would see how it was over the marathon didn't enjoy running London marathon in the shoe just F felt like a lot of hard work for me I didn't feel feel like it was comfortable didn't feel like was rolling me forward at all it just felt like a bit of a slug it would have felt like a slug anyway cuz i' just done a marathon the week before but it it just didn't seem to help me at all this year as in said I've done a lot of other runs in it and it just doesn't work for me this year it just feels like it's lost the magic that I got from the the previous uh Triumph 21 um for easy runs for Recovery runs I think it's fine but even for those I want a bit more softness in it and I know some people will say there's a lot of softness I think Nick notices it a bit more softness in that that heel of the shoe um because he's a heel Striker I don't hit it on the heel I hit it in that mid mid midsection and I'm getting nothing um so yeah not not really warm to this shoe at all uh I'm very rarely pick it up for any any sorts of runs unless I'm testing it for for some reason uh the other thing i' would say about these two shoes is the outsole is very very good on the trium 22 really solid rubber outsole great level of grip in it very similar to something like pag grip uh so that's a really good plus point for the trium 22 uh I'd also say it's a very stable shoe as well um should have mentioned that earlier when I was not talking about grip the outso on the 1080 v14 absolutely fine what you'd expect from the 1080 range um it does have some exposed sections but I have not seen any wear or tear on any of this at at the bottom uh but I would say the grip is much better on the tri 22 just the way it's designed and the coverage that you get on that shoe now I've probably run slightly less miles in both of these shoes than the other testers they came in a bit later for me but I've managed to rack up around 40 km in both and I've put them through a good range of paces though in most cases I've ended up dropping back to a very easy Pace because that's really I think where these shoes run best for me there's an upper Pace limit on both essentially what you've got are two soft cushioned pretty pillowy shoes that work best for the easiest miles they're best at that end of running Paces now I like the previous generations of both shoes for what they offered the 1080 v13 was a good highly cushioned slow recovery run shoe with a soft rried but not much by way of Versatility for me and the 1080 v14 offers more of the same though it's to having a slightly stiffer more immediate feel Under Foot it's still highly cushioned but I would say it's not quite as soft that brings a bit more immediacy to the ride which I'm a big fan of now when it comes to the Triumph 22 there's much more marked difference I think between this and the old generation and I don't think sakon has improved things it now feels much softer to me more squidgy a bit more labored it's a bit heavier on the foot so some of the sprightliness I think that gave the tri 21 a bit more versatility and range well that's kind of gone to me it now feels much more like an easy run shoe only the Triumph 21 had a bit more about it than the 1080 v13 but now the Triumph 22 goes much more directly head-to-head I think with the 1080 v14 I'm not in love with the 22 there's sort of too much work to get through the touchdown to toe off I much prefer the ride 17 from sock and even for my easier runs but both shoes offer good stability both shoes look like they'll enjoy well and last long miles I've also did a sidebyside mile in these two shoes to really tease out those finer detailed differences so I've just done my side by side M I've got the so Triant for 22 on the left foot I've got the New Balance 1080 v14 on the right foot from doing go side by side like that in my head from the run that I've just done these shoes are very very very very very very similar they are almost the same shoe in many many respects you've got the kind of same plush padded heel collars kind of thick padded tongues got the same kind of uppers they're quite thick boring on the probably too hot if you go into kind of summer months but there's nice and flexible lots of room in the toe box there lots of wiggle room they feel soft they feel kind of roomy nice and snug nice and comfortable all of that kind of plush comfort that you want from an easy day shoe is here in both of these shoes from the fit and the uppers so when it comes to the ride I think the nuances here essentially boil down to the fact the New Balance 1080 v14 come in slightly stiffer slightly they're not firmer but it's a stiffness to that kind of midsole and it creates a little bit of a smoother transition than I get from the Triumph 22 which it's just a bit softer I think it's a little bit squishier I don't quite get quite as much kind of consistent roll through or consistent move on sort through that transition there's a slight disconnect that I feel there a little bit of sinking in the middle a bit more than you'll get with a new balance 1080 v13 that said I'm really splitting hairs here and I would happily run in either of these two shoes for the same kinds of runs and that is essentially your easy recovery steady they are both the same weight in terms of the way they feel on the foot I think they both offer pretty much the same when it comes to that cushioning and Road protection well if anything maybe the New Balance 1080 v14 feel a bit more immor whereas the socy Triumph for 22 feel just mildly more bouncy if you want to call it I don't find them particularly bouncy I don't really get as much energy as I would like even though they've got that same foam that you'll find in the speed for I don't find that much energy in them I find them a little bit soggy and a bit sinky overall yeah so having done the side by side really the upshot of it is I didn't really learn very much from it because they do to me on the foot feel like they run very very similar if that's the thing I think you could choose between these two shoes you wouldn't be disappointed with either of them for going on kind of easy sort of very easy runs the only downside I think is that the Triumph 22 has lost a bit of Versatility over what it had from the Triumph 21 so my take with you should go for the S Tri 22 or the new B 108 v14 now as I said these aren't my favorite versions of this shoe but I think if I had to pick one I'd be going for the New Balance shoe I think ultimately my time in this shoe has just been a lot more memorable than my time in the Triumph 22 which I think is just slightly Mis Mark for me this year you know especially when I've kind of really liked the previous Triumph shoes I think if you are looking for the shoe that you know ultimately is very comfortable um you know offers a very kind of stable kind of smooth kind of gently rocked ride that's going to really kind of nudge you forward um and you know really help you tick those running miles off then I think you know the new B shoe does it in a lot more effective way and it's a slightly more versatile shoe as well too it's a little bit cheaper than the Triumph 22 it's about10 difference in the UK so I think for me from a kind of price point of view and in terms of performance I'd be going for the 1080 v14 I think for me the Triumph 22 is just not being the Triumph that I've wanted it to be even with that power on PB in there so yeah for me it's a no-brainer go for the New Balance shoe which just feels a lot more balanced in terms of a Max cushion shoe and how it delivers that okay so my ver on these two shoes pretty easy I mean I'm not a massive fan of either of these shoes I like the 1080 v14 I think it's a solid shoe it's definitely not one of the shoes that I'm picking up very often for a lot of my training sessions or anything like that um but in testing this shoe absolutely fine absolutely enjoyed it because I like softness I like a bit of Bounce I'm going more more likely to pick up things like the Muno Neo Vista uh the New Balance BOS stuff like that for a lot of the training that I'm doing whereas this just doesn't it's doesn't do things like those shoes does it's not giving you bounce ory return or anything like that it's just a solid shoe and I think uh that's what a lot of people need uh it's accessible it's stable uh it's comfortable it's got a balanced midsole it probably works for lots of different weights of people things like that great shoe um definitely the sort of shoe that a brand needs because you know when people come in especially when new Runners and stuff it's a very reliable option for people to buy uh tr22 equally it's quite a solid shoe for that level of Runner um but I do think the Midol is just not quite right in this shoe uh it doesn't really feel as comfortable as the T v14 it might just be largely my style of running because I'm a midfoot runner but a lot of people are midfoot Runners so they're probably going to have a similar issue with it um so it it just doesn't do a lot for me and even on easy runs or recovery runs I'm not enjoying it um so there's no run that I really find this shoe works really well for and I think it's just the geometry of the shoe um which which doesn't work for me so very easy decision for me at these two shoes I'm going to go for the 108 v14 uh just cuz it's a great all round shoe and you can't really go wrong with it verdict then and if you're looking for pillowy soft guaranteed cushion comfort for easy miles both of these shoes definitely offer that and I honestly think that you could choose either and get roughly the same experience for me these two will cover the same kind of runs neither shoe really gets out of second gear for me they perform well in first or second gear though but I find that limits their versatility and I'm kind of split on which one I like the most I prefer the fit of the S Triumph 22 I marginally prefer the slightly stiffer ride of the New Balance 1080 v14 it's just a shade smoother in the transition for me but because I find the rid so similar I think if I had to choose one it' probably come down to price and the New Balance 1080 v14 probably just about edges it though I honestly think that you could take either of these shoes and get largely the same experience from it so Verdi is a very easy one for me these are both cushion shoes that you're going to use for daily runs easy runs I just think the 1080 v14 is a lot more enjoyable for any of those kind of runs I think it feels a little bit softer to me which is nice when you are on tied legs but it has got a nice level of resiliency so you can kind of roll through nicely and get a bit of pop off the forefoot and it's also just lighter nimbler just feels better on the foot to me than the Triumph 22 because like I said just kind of forget about it when it's there it doesn't feel like a very intrusive shoe whereas the Triumph is this big block at the end of your foot and you know it's doing the job there it's got dense foam it's going to last forever it's going to protect the legs but it doesn't really bring a lot of life to the Run whereas the 1080 is quite a fun shoe to run in I'd think maybe if you're a heavier Runner than me the Triumph 22 might just have a little bit more to it you might get a bit more bounce back from the phone cuz you're putting a bit more Force into it or something like that but all around I would certainly recommend the 1080 over the Triumph myself just a shoe I've enjoyed more for really any kind of run that's it from us on this versus thanks a lot for watching don't forget to like subscribe

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Anton kitka legendary Ultra Trail Runner here in the us and we're going to talk about one of the new shoes from L fortiva the Lo fortiv Los fortiva prodigio Pro you've you've done quite a bit of running in it and um it's based off of the Lo Los fortiva prodigio model which just came out this last year great all-around shoe what's what would you use this for what do you love about it just tell me about it in your experience yeah I mean for me this is the like the high level ultra distance performance shoe um hence the pro Appalachian I guess uh it's actually kind of a completely different shoe than the prio itself uh super critical foam uh with a kind of a softer foam in the middle and then there's no Strobel last so your your foot feels that softness right away yeah and uh the thing that I like the most about it is is probably the most reactive shoe I've ever worn like I don't know I haven't worn the other Super Shoes on the market but this shoe feels like cheating like it's just like you're bouncing along totally but then also the outsole instead of having the lower lugs that the regular prio has it has a little deeper lug and a little more rubber yep so it grips really well uh on dirt snow and that's going to be a 4 mm lug this is a four M lug yep yeah and they friction white that white yeah so Ultra sticky I've scrambled the first flat iron and Boulder in this shoe yeah multiple times it's not the most ideal for that because of the uh the squishier foam totally but it is totally capable in that regard but for when you decide to put this on like what are you targeting with this shoe on usually a long run for me uh like this fall I did like a 35 mile and a 40 mile in this shoe both high in the Alpine and the mountains um and I chose it because I was going to be for 6 or S hours and at the same time like I ran this C Series event and Ryan Smith over there was crushing me in this shoe I was going up as he was coming down in this shoe and it seems like it can handle a decent amount of train for sure like well a couple of things with that I think like this wider platform in the forefoot it gives you a lot of stability like when going fast downhill on technical trails and then again these lugs uh it's on something like that where you're a little more off Trail a little steeper you're still going to have really good traction okay um and it's I don't know it's light too it's it's it's super light uh and especially compared to some of the other uh brands that are coming out with a shoe similar to this this is light it has that security this brand new woven tpe string like upper Y is awesome um now this might be foreshadowing a little bit if you were to run Leadville is this your shoe for you personally I would it's funny I would have to decide between between this and the regular Pia probably and you're more known to be a little more minimal this does have a more maximal like look to it for sure but I wouldn't say it runs that way it's it feels like a very fast light shoe which is great to hear because many of the shoes in this category on the market you could run a light Trail maybe into the moderate sense but this one you'll be able to take further into the mountains than probably most I would say the only my only obervation about running this aad bille is like the asphalt Miles because it has that quite sticky out soole and like the deeper lugs yep like the regular pesia might be a little it just doesn't it feels really good on asphalt for me awesome but uh yeah either either one is going to work well I mean for LA sportiva from the many years of being a very Mountain Centric brand like this feels new it feels Innovative but also stays true to their boots for sure 100% it's a mix of kind of like that little softer shoe with the rocker makes it very runnable but you still have the aggressive outsole you have this Gator to keep you know dirt stones out of your out of your shoe it's yeah yeah and let's be honest like I'm not getting any younger and the older I get I do appreciate more of that sensation of you do have the cushion but also you have the stability that goes along with having a solid Trail Sho 100% awesome okay well thank you so much I appreciate it cool",

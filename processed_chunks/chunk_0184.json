  "text": "what's going on everyone this is Chad with believe in the run the end of the year is upon us so that being said I am here in Baltimore at the newly renovated headquarters to bring you what I believe are the best shoes for bigger runners in [Music] 2024 now my assignment was to come up with the top five list of the shoes that I ran in in 2024 when I started to whittle down down uh the shoes that I had tested for believe in the run and shoes that I had actually acquired on my own I got to a certain point where I was coming up with my list and and the first few were fairly easy but then I got to the back end of my list and I had two shoes that I just could not decide between so I actually have the top six shoes with a tie for fifth cuz it's my list and I get to make the rules let's get into the list number five in a tie is the Hoka Skyward X and the Brooks Glycerin Max now one of the reasons I had such a hard time deciding between these two shoes is they are very very similar they both have that super high stack a very high quality premium foam and they both have a very similar ride to me both in terms of geometry um as you can see they both have pretty significant tow Springs and at the same time I mean overall I feel like they had the same use case that long run Cruiser that's going to be able to take you long distances I tended to lean a little bit more towards the glycerin Max simply because it was such a great surprise coming out of the Brooks company that we've kind of knocked them on Innovation for a long time this DNA tuned foam that has different densities in the same block uh of foam from the heel to the forefoot something that I can actually feel the softer heel and the slightly firmer more resilient and responsive forefoot Hoka has uh the plate in it so it provides a little bit more uh rigidity but at the same time provides a nice comfortable ride I mean if you're someone who likes ground field don't even bother trying these shoes on cuz they're not going to be for you that said I could not decide between these two shoes for my number five so they are tied number five best shoe of 2024 hokus Skyward X and Brooks Glycerin Max now moving on to number four number four actually uh is a daily trainer for me uh the number four is the New Balance 1080 v14 um if you follow me if you followed my reviews for the past few years you know I actually was able to test the 1080 v13 as well and it was one of the few shoes that I've run in that really just didn't work for me I overall liked the feel of the shoe but the fresh Fox was just a little too soft a little too squishy um when I ran I got a lot of roll into my medial side um of my right foot it really kind of had my post TI tendon acting up the 1080 v14 changed the game for me when it comes to New Balance and uh their daily trainers this is a real premium daily trainer they firmed up the Fresh Foam x a little bit it still has great pop to it it is a little firmer they also change the geometry of the shoe um widening the base a little bit um and and the heel it is a far more stable shoe it has great outsole coverage rubber you're going to be able to get a lot of miles in these it's just a real premium daily trainer one of my favorite daily trainers I think for all of 2024 um and overall I think it's just a great shoe I think they really improved from the v13 and I think it's uh one that's going to be a great uh part of my rotation moving on to my third shoe I really don't know what category to put this shoe in uh and that is the Puma deviate Nitro 3 if you read my dedicated column on the website you would see that the two was one of my favorite Tempo in speedwork shoes um I feel like the Nitro 3 takes a little bit of a step back in terms of the tempo and speedwork you could absolutely use it for that it is light it does have some of their more Elite great foam uh and it also does have their power plate but to me it just has more of a feel of a real premium daily trainer something that you could do for a lot of different um types of runs you could take it out on a on a daily run where you're going to maybe do some strides you're going to have some farli or other workout uh aspects in your run um overall uh this shoe is great Puma grip cannot be beat um the outso traction on this is phenomenal um overall I feel like the DV8 Nitro 3 is just a great allaround shoe um it's really going to handle anything you can kind of throw at it um if you're looking for something that you can maybe even use as a budget racer with the fact that it comes in around $160 you really can't beat that [Music] value now my second shoe shouldn't be much of a surprise cuz I did highlight this earlier in my video before where I talked about the best shoes of 2020 4 thus far and I have not been shy in singing the Praises of the sakon Endorphin speed 4 this shoe to me epitomizes what it means to be of a doit all shoe it is light it is Snappy the foam is very very responsive the power run PB is slightly firmer than what we've seen in Prior models like the version 2 um but it has more stability which is what we saw in version three version 4 is really the perfect marriage between the the speed two and the speed three um overall this shoe can do everything you can take it out for daily miles you can take it out on your Tempo speedworks you could race in the shoe um I think to be honest this would be a really great shoe to race um reasonable distances I do really think this could um be a great once again budget racing shoe I'm going to put that in quotes cuz it comes in at the I believe 170 Mark at at the end of the day this shoe is great I do think saky also improved the compound that they use for the rubber outso in the shoe one of the big things about the prior models is they didn't necessarily have the greatest traction I think that was improved in the V4 this shoe not only looks good runs good and uh you can't beat that now we have come to number one on my list and once again for people who follow me follow all my content uh this should not be a surprise and that is the as6 super Blast 2 if it ain't broke don't fix it and that is a motto that as6 stood by when creating the uh super Blast 2 the super blast one was my favorite shoe of all time but that was until I was able to lace up the super Blast 2 which has now taken its place I ran my Marathon earlier this year in the version one and had a great time my legs felt great afterwards I've put a good chunk of miles in the V2 um as I've been training since I got it I actually think they improved the upper it feels just a little bit more put together and a little bit more um cohesive with the overall shoe it does run a little bit shorter everyone always said the super blast V1 ran a little long I wore an 11 and A2 in the super blast one I normally wear um 12 in uh as6 um I got this in 11 and a half and my toes are a little bit crammed in here uh on the run so a 12 probably would have been fine they did kind of shrink it back down but overall this shoe just is everything I would want in a shoe it is lightweight it is sturdy it is stable ground feel on it you can't really feel the ground but it doesn't feel mushy or or to the point where you feel like you have to work extra the shoe gives you back everything you need yes it's $200 but it's a shoe that you could basically buy this pair and run all your miles in it you could race in it which I actually probably will do uh next year when I run the Chicago marathon um I'll probably run in this or potentially a newer pair cuz I might run through this one by then that said this shoe is great this shoe can do anything you need and more and so that's why the super Blast 2 is my number number one shoe for bigger runners in 2024 what's coming up in 2025 the crew went out to tr and shot tons and tons of content on shoes that are going to be coming out in 2025 now I've watched a lot of that coverage it's all great you should watch it too um but I'm going to give you highlights of a couple things that I'm looking forward to most in 2025 number one um surprisingly Sketchers the sketch lineup I think they call it their Arrow lineup um a e r o um there's three shoes in that line that all looked like they're going to be actually really good training and potentially race day shoes for Sketchers um I was able to run recently in the gun Razer 5 and I was a real big fan of that it reminded me of the Hoka MOX 6 overall I think Sketchers is really turning a corner um I know Robbie uh would disagree about the turning a corner because I know Max road is one of his favorites uh ever um but overall I think Sketchers is really starting to put together some real quality shoes uh and I'm excited to see potentially what those are like obviously considering I just raved about the sock in the Endorphin speed 4 um I'm somewhat excited to see about what they do uh with the V5 can they build on the success of the V4 continue it along in that path of being somewhat of a great doit all shoe whether it be for Tempo racing or or even daily miles I think the thing I am excited about most HST was the on cloud boom Max which on is touting as a marathon racer designed with the uh runner who's going to spend four plus hours on the road out there um it's designed with us in mind um I'm really excited to give that a try um if I do um it just looks like something that's really going to be accommodating it's going to take into account the extra time that we're going to spend on our feet uh and everything about about how we run um and overall I think um it's just going to be very interesting to see what that's like if you like this video I would ask you to hit the Subscribe button hit the like button on this video uh follow believe in the run on all the socials Instagram Tik Tok Facebook you name it they got it uh follow me on Instagram at the Cale Runner you can also find me on threads um uh and at this point we're done with 2024 excited to come back in 2025 and bring you more bigger Runner content uh it's December now January's coming up I hope you all get out uh get registered for grit and uh can log some great grit miles hopefully in some of these shoes that I've highlighted is the best ones for 2024 [Music]",

  "text": "hey this is Robbie with believe in the run and today we are here with Sketchers performance and Ben Stewart Ben what's your official title senior director of technical performance one of those long ones that's how you know it's good D all right so I'm excited to talk about the 2025 lineup for Sketchers which I got to be honest we haven't se last year was uh kind of a drought I would say maybe you wouldn't say that but it looks like you more than made up for it coming into 2025 because I'm seeing some stuff that looks pretty awesome so let's tell walk me through this this uh three new models that are coming out um yeah where do you want to start yeah you got it let's uh let's start uh let's start at the top here so for 2025 we're going to introduce the all new AOS series um so really taking uh inspiration from uh aerodynamic shapes in different Industries whether it's car or flight what have you um but that's really going to set the tone for the design de that Sketchers is going to move forward with that you're going to see throughout the product here so aot Tempo here this is a versatile fast sto so um we've got 38 mm of stack in the heel we got 34 in the 4ot okay it is our single density super critical hyperburst midsole right on and we are still leveraging our proprietary Goodyear rubber on the bottom I like how you stick to your you stick to Good Year you're like you follow them follow them than to battle him back uh that's good stuff and but you know what I got to give you credit I always got to give Sketchers credit for being the first to do super critical midols so you're the OG's in that game you've did it before anyone else is doing it so it's nice to see is this a new version of hyperverse that's coming out in this in the in the Arrow series this is a new let's call it a new blend of hyper it's going to come out here yeah so we've been tinkering with that and perfecting it and subtly different across the different uh models that we'll we'll talk through today Co um but yeah all right and what was the weight on this one again about eight and a half on the men's side about seven on the women's side okay and this I got to tell you this upper feels pretty fantastic light incredibly breathable it's a TPU woven upper exactly right it is light it is breathable and secures the foot nicely all right and what's the price point in release State on this $160 160 okay at a uh 5 oneish April time frame okay and again this is going to be more of your uptempo shoe things like that it is awesome all right let's move on to the next one this is going to be our Max stack Arrow burst so this is for those long slow miles but also for an everyday trainer where you want your uh you want your legs to feel great the day after your roll yeah right who who doesn't want that right exactly so we're rocking a 42 mm stack in the heel and 36 in the 4T for that 6 mm drop nice we are still leveraging that uh Goodyear rubber on the bottom I you know what I like that you have a more you you we had that pod period or whatever that was going on look like Pac-Man grid underneath there but now we're back to more like just strategically placed rubber that good year I like it exactly and we put some horizontal Flex screws throughout the shoe as well to make sure that it is a nice smooth transition nice and so I have this uh kind of breakaway parts right here so walk me through what's ins inside this midsole awesome so internally you are going to see a carbon infused H plate here so that's really to shore up the shoe here um nice little torsional rigidity and nice little pop at toe off and we've seen the H plate in some of the past models shoes before so that's kind of you're kind of seeing that just in a different version exactly and uh and then we have and uh price point on this price point is $140 oh okay yes and I do want to call out oh yeah my bad I didn't mean to neglect the insole it is an old new um Arch bit so we know that that has been a staple in the past um but we wanted to make it a touch more democratic than we have okay good that was kind of an issue in the past yeah all right so we've kept some nice geometry on the top side but we've really sculpted out the bottom here a bit um zonally engineering um that uh that foam um so you're going to get that nice contouring but it's going to be a little bit more natural for more Runners nice cuz yeah it's just dependent on who was running in a shoe but sometimes that Arch could get a little bit aggressive and really dig in there on the longer run so that's really cool to see this is pretty and what was the weight on this shoe by the way the weight's right at uh 11 oz on the m so 11 oz a little little on the heavier side but again this is going to be more that kind of Max cushion like recovery type easy day eat up miles exactly all right so we got one more one more to look at so lastly is the arrow spark so this is going to be your more traditionally stacked shoe here we have 36 in the heel 30 in the 4ot all right also a um super critical hyper burst ice um midle okay subtly different in the uh in the compound internally just leveraging Eva um in this where the burst is a combo Eva TP right okay we're also going to have the um H plate in the 4 foot of the spark um Li more breathable engineered upper um and nice uh medial gusset to keep that tongue in place nice and so what was the weight on this again did you say the weight I didn't it's right around uh 9.7 o on the on the M okay so pretty normal daily trainer type situation um okay and this is the arrow spark question has the G run been done away with we are focusing on the Arrow uh Series going forward is the go run still technically part of the name uh we'll have to see when Lun comes out uh you have my vote to throw it out um anyways that's just a personal opinion uh nothing against the shoes but when writing whenever I have to do like edit the reviews I'm always or writing the reviews on website I'm always like go run how do I spell this how do I make it work anyways just a personal editor's preference moving on uh I'm excited this is cool because you know we we we've loved Sketchers in the past especially like the razor line we had the I mean personally the ride 11 was I feel still one of the best shoes of 2023 uh even probably a great shoe now the max Road huge fan of that um so let me ask you is this going to replace the max Road and shoes like that like are the past models that we seen the ride the max road we we have the Razer 5 that's out but are those other models they're they're gone they're gone okay we're focusing here the arrow is the is the name of the game exactly all right mhm I don't know if I I guess time will tell I guess we will see after running in it because I got to say like the the maxroad um one of my favorite shoes of all time I think Max Road 6 and maxroad 5 um so I feel like sketch has always done a great job I'm going to have faith I have faith I haven't even tried the shoes yet but I have faith that you guys are going to pull it off and it's exciting cuz you know we were we weren't sure but it's cool to see this um see these new ones is out on the table and hopefully on our feet in a couple months you got it yeah super exciting awesome is there anything else I forgot to cover are we good we're good all right thank you a pleasure all right",

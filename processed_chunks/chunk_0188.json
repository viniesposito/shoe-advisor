know what I love this time of year everybody's posting their top you know their list of their podcast Spotify and stuff and uh I don't think anybody listens to this show apparently there's numbers that Megan crunches that say people do um and but seeing it for me is visual so seeing all these people coming up in our stories and stuff saying that they listen to the podcast that's exciting I know I saw that this morning and it was like it was the drop fuel for the soul Aly on the run cidus and desen Cara was like almost everybody's like in some order and I was like this we're in good company that's why I've been commenting what I love is the people that listen to all the podcast it's like oh the drop and the feel for this you're like hardcore you're you're in the biggest NDS think I've seen anybody that didn't anybody who tagged f for the soul also had the job is it yeah yeah yeah so yes in case you are unaware you are listening to fuel for the soul the podcast where we chat all things hydration and nutrition and how it affects performance and today we're going to answer a bunch of fun listener questions but first uh so Runway is sponsoring this episode they have lovely collagen and protein products which Megan you can speak to all of the goodness of they do they do they are really trying to wrap around everything that we need from a supplement standpoint to be a healthy run runner healthy Runner and continue to be healthy so collagen helps with our joints and soft tissues to keep us healthy protein for recovery and creatine is added to their protein to also help us with strength muscle mass and Recovery I've been using the protein and creatine thing a lot yeah my brother was in town for Thanksgiving and I like he better not see that or he's going to take all of it yeah I put out I put we had some lesser Brands around the house that we spotlighted you know we put it in front of the other stuff so that he wouldn't grab it Runway was in the back over Thanksgiving yeah sorry Runway we're not ready to give up our supply yet he can go ahead and buy it with there's a discount right yeah yeah a glowing recommendation right there that you didn't want to share it so yeah so yes if you guys want to try some and you haven't yet go to Runway . life so that's R nw. lifee and use the code feathers 15 for 15% off your purchase um one thing I want to talk about was before we got started uh the difference between someone like you who is uh educated and reads research and actually bases your advice on science and experience and we don't take on a sponsor that we don't believe in or we try a product and don't believe in there was recently this study that showed like influencers recommending stuff and how they determine whether or not they'll recommend something and also how other people take in that knowledge whether or not they vet it or look for scientific fact or anything like that I know that I'm always reaching out to you and being like hey feathers is this miracle uh pill that they say will reverse aging does it work and you're like no you know that that kind of stuff but it's interesting to me do you feel like that we Fallen because we are in the media and because that we do podcasts or events or whatever it is do we fall into the influencer realm I mean I I I think we probably do that's what my TR badge said but I I makes me cringe a little bit because I'm like I don't like that's I didn't start doing what I do to be an influencer you know I think we are influencing people's purchases um but I don't I don't love that term at all can there be a difference between I cuz I feel like an influencer now some people are proud of being influencers I it's not something I've ever wanted to be no I wanted to give people good information to which they could make their own decisions yeah we've done that with personality and tried to do it with humor and with quality content and that kind of stuff but I've always avoided kind of think of as influencers and I don't really see you as an influencer it's not like you're showing me your run and then being like and then I took a ketone and amped it up for the last three months well I also think when you think of influencer you think of almost like a sales person because it always feels like they're trying to make you use a product or do something and so like Megan's literally sharing information and educating Runners to help them make better choices of what products they want to use versus being like here use take these ketones that may or may not do anything we do talk about like for we do have sponsors so Runway was just one yeah but like for example when we when we decided to take runway on as a client for advertising on the show MH they sent product we tested the product we tried the product ourselves we made sure that it was something that we could recommend to someone so in a way that is a sales sure uh pitch but what we're trying to do I think the difference where we're going is I find that an influencer if a brand is willing to go to them and throw cash at them typically they're not turning it down they'll say yes yeah yeah well and I mean I think we're very particular about who we take money from and the reason we do have some sponsors which I think people have mixed feelings about that is because so we can continue to put out free high quality content for people like we we need to make a living at some point right so like anytime I have a sponsor that's why because I want to be able to offer more free things to our audience so bringing on that sponsor allows you know us not to have to charge someone for something that we're providing you know so it just kind of it's like a win-win and then too what's interesting is like our sponsors who have been on this podcast like Runway or cherry Bundy um they say our codes are used constantly you know more than a lot of their other codes because we are particular about who we recommend and I think you know in my eyes I want to bring on people to sponsor that fill a void or a need and runway's first product was collagen and collagen is so clunky for a lot of people to take if they don't like it in their coffee or they don't want to put it in a hot liquid before a run and they had a product that was like an electrolyte drink so you know when a company comes out it can fill a void of something that we need as Runners then and it's quality and it's tested and we like the people behind the product um you know it's kind of a no-brainer to me to bring people like that on you made a good point and I and i' i' I've said this before to people who have either you know come at me and in a in a way all the things that we do that provide um financial compensation for what we do MH I'm always trying to give like when we have parties or if we're doing events I'm always trying to make sure there something in it for the people that come whether it's Swag whether it's you know whatever it is they're getting something out of we do the car boxes we we are always constantly trying to provide for our audience and we doing it at usually zero or very very low cost for example like grit that we just did that's a the entry fee is less than if you tried to buy the Garment you know uh just for yourself so you're getting a whole community and that stuff involved without without that and we have the website now you're even contributing to the believe in the Run website with nutrition advice so you have a website that's already a phenomenal resource for people at zero cost they can go there find out do the calorie calculator do the carb calculator do all the things that they would need to do on their own you provide that at no cost I I I see the difference that's where I kind of see a a big difference between we're not just taking money to to do ads or to do uh pieces we're trying to actually bolster up we actually have employees we have you know people that are helping us put the content out and that that does cost there's a cost involved right but the end goal for us is to to give good quality enjoyable entertainment to our audience yeah yeah it it's funny say that because I just launched the group nutrition classes for the spring so the for any any race it'll start the first week of January and then we'll have a group specific to Boston um and it's they're filling up pretty quickly we still have a few spots left probably when this airs there will be too um and you know people are like we I learned so much in that class which is the goal right to get people together really educate people talk about the right topics for where we are in our training to really help figure out how to scale nutrition performance nutrition daily nutrition All That Jazz but then I had somebody reach out when I was promoting it yesterday and they were like I just need to let you know I only used your free resources on your website and I had a 20-minute Marathon PR and I was like that is so cool like I love that I can give people excessive attention and a ton of Education if they have the finances for it and they want to be a part of something like that but then I also love that if someone doesn't have the time or the resources to be able to join a group like that that they can still get what they need so um it was it was cool to to hear that yesterday the other thing that's NE about your groups though that I've noticed because I had to go to one of your Boston group meetups had to I had to well look it's it's a busy weekend and we were there for I forget why we were stopping by our hotel we were dropping something or I was going I just want I just want to hang out with M um and uh I I noticed right away that there's a bond between the people that are in the group so they're all like for the example the Boston group they're all running Boston they're talking they're getting hyped they're motivating each other and it is fun if especially if you're maybe you don't live in a city where you can do group runs or whatever you're part of a group leading up to Boston you get to Boston you get to meet them you get to hang out with your hero Megan featherston and AKA feathers I still chat with several of the girls from the initial group back in what was that 203 2021 was the first year I know I was looking back at that so this will be the fourth year I've had a grp straight out of crazy right it was I know I love and that you can see little friendships form like there was the two girls at the Chicago ShakeOut that were in the group um and they became like best friends and it was like I was like this is wonderful and I think it's important to know too like I have people that are trying to break three hours in that group and I have people who run a six and a half hour marathon in that group so it's like a super diverse group abilities ages experience so it's just fun to kind of see all those all those types of Runners get together and learn together yeah I mean to get back to my initial question I don't I don't I don't see us as influencers I don't think that we are marketing for the sake of marketing or that um I think that we have a mission and and a and a reason behind the passion that we have for the space that we're in um you happen to be in love with helping people reach their goal through uh dialing in their nutrition we happen to be on the other side where we're like hey your gear and how you feel about running is is tied together so you know I think that it's we're we're in the service industry more than the influencer industry that's a good way to put it I agree I hope that's how we're viewed at least yeah that's the goal well I'm telling people now so if you're listening that's the way to look at us I think people get that I think people are soing up what we're still in here right like I think that's why we have such a great we'll just end this one now peas and carrots wait what about Emily Jess and how question we got to do this stuff all right let's roll right into these questions now that we've chatted about nonsense for several minutes our first question is from Emily she said I know everybody is different and there is no one amount for everyone but I'm mainly wondering if there is an equation or a calculator of some kind to find a general idea of the nutrition ballpark you should be in I understand that seeing a professional to make it more individualized is preferred but I don't have access to a dietician at the moment and the weight list for a dietician in healthcare is currently two years I am a healthy individual and I eat when I'm hungry but sometimes I worry that I may not be eating enough It's Tricky right I mean I think a lot of people have this same question so you're absolutely not alone Emily a lot of people don't understand how to scale nutrition for running and a lot of times our appetite alone isn't enough to guide us most people don't notice a huge huge change in their appetite or hunger um when they're changing things so I mean looking at it from my perspective we want to like find an equation that tells us how much nutrition we need on a daily basis which there are some calculators out there but then where it becomes nuanced is like okay that's how much nutrition I need if I'm laying in bed all day that's an easy equation for most of us but then we need to look at how much are we running how much are we cross trining and how busy is our day-to-day life like I sit on my butt in my day-to-day life so like I don't expend a whole lot of energy but um my kids were asking me yesterday why the mail man walks through our yards and I'm like because he walks house to house and it cuts you know his his travel time a little bit so somebody like that is burning a ton of energy through their their job so you know kind of to answer Emily's question we need to figure out like how much energy does my body need to just stay alive and then add on to that any type of planned exercise but then also any movement that it just comes from our daily life uh whether it's work or child care or you know whatever that looks like um so it can be kind of tricky to figure that out so this time last year we put together the program called fueled that has those calculators available to people they can plug and chug what their daily nutrition needs are uh carb needs fat needs protein needs fluid needs um all that kind of stuff and then the cool thing about that is you can change it depending on your mileage so you can learn how to kind of scale your nutrition so is available if Emily or someone out there wants those calculators to play with themselves um I significantly cheaper than you know working oneon-one with the dietician you think like you could even type this question into like almost like a chat GPT where you would be like hey I run an average of this many miles a week I am sitting at my desk this many hours a week and I weigh this much and like can you give me the optimal amount of calories or whatever I would I would bet you that you could do that I'm going test it mate's going to test it are you guys surprised I've never played on chat GPT never I I don't know because scares me I think there's both sides to it I do think it has some decent information but you are going to get sort of like crowdsourced information like I did a thing where I was like okay I need two workouts a week with weight training for a runner to uh benefit you know the an endurance athlete and I don't want them to be longer than you know 40 minutes and it'll come back to you with a plan and the plan looks very similar to other online things that I've seen so it's like they kind of pull all the same information but then again you're like okay well that is what I guess works yeah so it's like it's you know I don't know I I'm not 100% trusting it just yet yeah yeah it's kind of scary yeah because like especially if you ask it like some things that they could screw up right what if it tells somebody like a wh low ball energy need and then they're undering you know that makes me nervous a little bit there's a lot of equations that come into or pieces and parts that go into how much nutrition does our body need and it is so individualized even calculators alone sometimes aren't enough right but um I'm one of those people like his handheld like I'd rather learn from you and then try it on my own like the best everybody learns different made can read it and then absorb the information and be fine with that some people can watch videos and be fine with that and I can do tutorials on videos for like stuff that I'm doing like in the creative world but when it comes to like actually like even like with a camera or something like that I got to play with the buttons and do the you know the adjust it and kind of like aperture is like abstract until I actually use it mhm so and I think like human interaction is so important for us to make Behavior changes too you know so having that like support along the way and personalization and feeling like something is tailored to you is very important for a lot of people I I would agree yeah um Megan I'm gonna send you this because it's honestly very fascinating you could probably have it write a a uh calculator for your website because it can do all the coding but I just I wrote into it that I'm 30b female that runss 50 miles a week and has a sedentary job it's not me say female how did you gain all that and um and it came back with an insane answer that I'm sending to Megan and she could tell us whether or not it's can you read the answer no it's like paragraphs and calculations and okay wild we can move on and you can look at it and then we can cheat we'll come back to it at the end yeah all right um so did we did you wow that was a good hook to get people to listen to the end did you did you do we think we answered Emily's question though generally speaking Yeah I think that you did I mean if you want to synopsize what you said maybe we could do that since we kind of went off in different direction yeah so I mean you can find calculators online to help figure out those Baseline energy needs but then you know what I would want Emily to make sure she's doing is to take into account any additional energy expenditure through planned activity and then through just your daily lifestyle would be important and if you really want something more the fueled program is available to purchase and it's like an on demand thing that you can just kind of guide yourself through that has some videos and calculators and all that kind of stuff cool all right our next question is from Jess she said I went from seeing how far I could get with no food training for Ultras to now I see how much food I can fit into my training runs so thank you I'm a caffeine lover I try to be a good grownup and stick to the recommended 400 milligrams a day but my question is how is caffeine intake Ed by a runner's weight and activity levels I have heard you say caffeine before evening runs may not ruin your sleep because it's metabolized quicker when running does that mean we could actually take in more than 400 milligrams if we are running it off or a bigger Runner or my way off base I'd love any insights or thoughts from y'all for info I'm 59 160 lbs and run about 50 Trail miles a week and lift heavy four times a week I usually have around 200 milligrams at 6 a.m. and 200 milligrams at 10: a.m.",

  "text": "York we can York out us another year another Peak here we go everybody I can't believe it's time again I just cannot believe it's time oh my my all right let's open this box question of the day who's racing all right let us know in the comments the ascent or the marathon is it your first time up the peak all right basically 8,000 vertical feet starting in Mana 2 Springs we got our gels all right for the race fresh gels and fresh kicks you better believe it come on now oh yeah I actually I it's great you got if you've oh man what a summer so I got a lot to break down here take a there they are there's the Freshies all right so nice uh I did go a half size down you know how I like a snug fit for racing and I got my gear here that I've been prepping all week gathering in one spot actually the camera is sitting right on top of the gear that is get going to end up on top of the mountain so let's actually dive into that right now it's going to be chilly like last year it might snow I don't think it's going to snow Saturday or Friday night but it sounds like maybe for the marathon who knows it's it's kind of up in the air right now but at the very least it's going to be quite chilly so all my basically winter parka gear is sitting right below the camera I'll show you that on the screen right now as I so that bag will end up on the top of the mountain and let's see got all my dgr gear race gear ready uh it's just been an epic summer a big summer a lot of vertical gain but connecting to the title of the Vlog I've never done this before Oh I actually wanted to show you this too so last here we go glad I remembered or saw this so this is I think this is last year it might be two years ago so I think this is my fifth or sixth I don't I'm losing track uh Pikes Peak race so this is last year's race shirt very cool probably says it somewhere on here I think this is last year's and bottom line last year I was a little tired for the Pikes Peak ascent and remember last year I doubled so this year just the ascent on Saturday three weeks before last year's race I took a little little rad road trip to mavista Colorado and I did three fktsgi hope it finish higher than that at least top three but it just showed me um like what I'm getting at for you and your racing you're going to learn you're going to learn you're going to learn every year every training block you're going to learn new things and as you age you're going to learn how your body is reacting to the training so I think I was a little tired on the starting line uh last year but this year we shall see we don't know yet that's why we tow the line that's why we lace him up that's why we go have fun in Mana 2 Springs Colorado but this year so I this is it I took I've never done this before ever ever I took two days off I took I didn't I did not run I didn't run I never do that ladies and gentlemen if you've been watching for years and years you know even before a peak race but so I I foam rolled I did a little walking on the treadmill I went to the gym to hop in the hot tub I just tried to make the legs as happy as possible so that was Tuesday and Wednesday today's Thursday Friday racing Saturday so I I jog two miles today tomorrow I'll do like a mile crazy again adaptation learning the process of racing as you get a little older almost a masters but I just wanted to communicate with you like don't be afraid to change things up and we shall see we don't know we don't know that's why you got to tune in I I think there's going to be a live stream and uh a live stream and what else um I don't think I don't know if there's live tracking for I think there's a little bit of live tracking on the website but bottom line I'm excited I'm excited for the packing enjoying the whole process and I just close with this is that I love racing but I tell you what tapering is kind of a sad moment because you can't run a lot and I I just like to run that's all I like to run a lot but you have to pull back and you got to taper and you got to let those legs get happy but I'm excited to get past the race and I'm excited for race day you know why cuz I'm sharing it with the family and I'm going to share it with you if you're there and again question of the day are you racing are you going to be there oh if you have any video clips from the starting line the Finish Line uh up on the mountain if you're up there somewhere feel free to email them to me info at demor Global running.com and I'll try and get them into the Vlogs the Vlogs that happen after this video so uh but it's like at the end of the day yes winning the Pikes Peak Marathon I think the first one was 2020 exciting unexpected got it done but like if I'm not sharing it with the family what's I don't want to say what's the point but it's almost like what's the point for me personally so the family will be there it's just going to be a good old time it going to be a good old time everybody so have fun out there enjoy the process of packing of getting your bib number putting it on eating some pasta whatever you do to get ready for your Peak races and um yeah you can have

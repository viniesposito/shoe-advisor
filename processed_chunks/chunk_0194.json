  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Robbie with believe in the r i don't think you're supposed to introduce yourself for this oh really we I like this is perfect this is exactly on par go ahead who are you uh Megan with believe in the run and this is a special episode a Monday episode the origin story episodes of Robbie Robert what's your middle name Lee and no it's not that's right it's not after the Confederacy yeah Robert Lee readinger Robert Lee readinger they have statues of his uh Uncle all over West Virginia my grandpa's first name was Lee my dad's first name was Robert a lot of creativity went into that and no Force why he put is that why you put an e at the end of your name so it's robbery yeah E le yeah it's just to throw people off Roberty Lee oh man hopefully it's just people from Australia listening to this they have no idea what we're talking about oh I think it's made it that far oh you think so do you know any Australian history though that's a good first question for you like I couldn't name a single politician in the history of Australians can you name a city yes Melbourne or is that how they s say it Melbourne do you know Clive didy do syy what Clive digy do is that a real person yeah no it's not did he is that where's it from name one person who had a crocodile farm down there besides crocodile dundy I was going to say easy no Steve Berwin oh yeah but I don't do he have a farm or was he just he has like a zo Sanctuary okay yeah well his son's doing stuff now too yeah I saw that yeah recently anyway this is supposed to be about you I mean all that is about me in a way Australia um okay let's so let's go to the way back do we start from the beginning beginning where did Robbie grow up and what was childhood like wow really going deep um let's see I was born in Lebon Pennsylvania which is small town near kind of outside Hershey I guess if it was South Central PA is it Lebanon or leanon they say Lebanon Lebanon Lebanon or Le they honestly just take out the a too it's like the easiest thing ever Le Lebon yeah um there's a lot of stuff like that that doesn't make sense Lancaster instead of Lancaster that no sense it's oh I've been pronouncing it the other way yeah they just they just people make stuff up anyways so I was born there uh lived in pomara Pennsylvania which we talked about cuz that's where Nick bear is from till I was five and then I moved like how do you not know him that's like it's not like it's huge like you had to have Shar he's he's younger than me he's like eight years younger than me oh I thought maybe you'd have to be sharing some DNA living in that small town yeah it's pretty small so and then we moved uh near out more towards the mountains near Hershey and that's where I lived pretty much all my life before bouncing around places um as an adult but so I grew up there and let's see do you want like the for real like the whole history yeah all right might as well people I have three brothers I have brother I'm the oldest of four siblings uh my youngest brother's my brother is 10 years younger than me and that's like the age range that's big yeah um four is a lot 10 yeah what four and we lived in this years four kids it was crazy claustrophobic we lived in this tiny brick ranch house and there's just one floor until I was 15 or 16 and I got they we readed the basement did you share a bedroom yeah with my brother um who was 10 years younger than you yeah so when I was like 12 or 133 until yeah so like 11 until I was 15 or something like that that's crazy yeah that's you were basically raising an infant I guess I don't crazy I don't remember much of it like in that way no baby waking you up in the middle of the night but I I guess I don't really remember that it probably happened but and then my sister Mrs her [ __ ] room but it was like real tight real small but we grew up in the country so lots of fields and like riding my bike to my friend's house my only friend who lived a mile away um and then swimming in cricks yeah kind of just fishing bare feet all summer starting fires you know stuff like that like was an exciting trip to you like going to like one of the like gas station stores kind of yeah so we we were I grew up I don't know poor but my dad worked for Hershey Chocolate Factory so he worked there for 40 years and so he he had a it was a pretty stable job like it was a union job and see as soon as you say that I think of wily Wonka like your dad has a purple crushed velvet suit that he wore to work did you guys get to go to Hershey yeah sometimes but not not too much in the factory like there's like one day of year where you could go inside the actual fact okay Thomas asked me this earlier today he said do you think if you worked at Starbucks you wouldd start to hate coffee so question yeah did your dad hate chocolate Andor the rest of your family pretty much no one in my family ate chocolate that worked at Hershey yeah wow so because of exactly because of that reason it's weird people who work in Gold minees still like gold yeah I mean as a kid I loved it so we weren't I don't know I feel like Health was weird back then like we did eat stuff from so my family uh my grandma grandpa and uncles they still had a farm a mile away from our house which is where my parents live now and so they still raised cattle and pigs and chickens and whatnot and so we still got a lot of our food from there and corn and so in that way that was healthy but we also had like our pantry with all the sugary cereals all tasty cakes kind no no that's still Robbie today like I'll see Robbie and you'll talk to him and it'll be like just getting back from Chick-fil-A yeah and but I know that for the most part you guys are healthy like I say even your kids will eat like they're not too picky right I'd say it's balanced out like I don't I definitely will eat terribly from time to time SL half the week um like did you like pork rinds growing up no but my family they made scrapple which I never really liked I still don't even like a lot of people don't know what scrapple is if you're not from the delm Marva area I don't think it's that big like I grew up in California and I only learned about it when I moved here I think it's mostly like New Jersey PA what is it it's basically after you butcher a pig which I've that was had to do sometimes with my family which is a crazy experience when you're 8 years old and you're you butchered it well helped clean it yeah like my uncle like they would he would kill it and then you like strip the you know cut it like oh jeez so this is my Orin story yours but I'm going to throw in here our school bus literally like one time we we saw saw a cow get slaughtered oh like a Napoleon Dynamite Happ it was very similar that like I was when I saw that I was like oh my God yeah they they hang him upside down it's like yeah and all the things where they're like oh chicken with a Teta cut offs bleeds like a stuck pig there's a reason those things are actual euphemisms cuz they're all true life yeah like as a kid so it's very I'm like Dwight tro but like a more normal version without as much anger yeah yeah they same anger there sometimes yeah yeah for sure um there's some vindictiveness but he um sorry so they I I kind of grew up that way so we ate like somewhat healthy but I was pretty active like I was um sorry somewhat healthy in some ways terribly in other ways um but I was really active as a kid like loved to play baseball that was my favorite sport for sure played soccer um kind of like rode my like I said rode my bike did a lot of stuff like that and then and but we we grew up kind of the middle of nowhere so I didn't have too many friends and I grew up kind of it was kind of weird situation where my parents were super conservative Christians so it was like there was a lot especially being the oldest there was like a lot of rules and a lot of can't do things so are they still uh conservative yeah but like not as I would say like in some ways but generally not as much like for sure by the time my brother came along was like much different but I wasn't allowed to watch a lot of movies or music listen to music or things that were like like it's CRA honestly it's actually crazy if you think about what's weird is we have this in common for a little while stepmom that we weren't allowed to watch TV or anything both of us have discussed it might be where our our hunger for pop culture oh 100% yeah so like when you were growing up would kids be talking about movies and stuff and you just couldn't even relate I feel viscerally like even talking about it because you would they talk about Nickelodeon or Ninja Turtles and Power R you know whatever and you don't you like kind of pretend like you know what's going on is it like in that scene from 40-year-old version where he's like yeah it's like a bag of sand yeah pretty much yeah um and that was so that was definitely tough um but for sure that's where my love of every like because once I got older it was music movies uh like anything pop culture isn't it funny that's exactly what your parents wanted to keep you from yeah and it drove you to it yeah isn't that how it always works pretty much yeah so and like there was no drinking uh young parents inake nothing like that like was very like very strict and conservative and this is the 80s cuz I do you remember the ' 8S like there's the weird the conservative right was like satanic panic and all this other stuff so it was people were spinning records backwards yeah it was a wild time and so that like even then we watch these movies there's these movies that existed you can still find them on YouTube that are basically the dangers of rock and roll and it's like and watching those I'm like this is like this looks awesome yeah you kind of like there's that a good advertisement for rock and roll yeah and um so I grew up like that and um didn't have too manys friends and didn't know too many people growing up so be before we leave the satanic Rock and Roll Part cuz I remember that time period that you're talking about yeah and when you heard music almost some of that music was a little bit scary like CU you knew that it was like quote unquote evil music like Black Sabbath and you know you heard he bit heads off of you know bats at thing and Guns and Roses ACDC well yeah that's even later but the were you when you listen to that music did it seem scary or did it seem like dangerous yeah in a way well I didn't really listen to it when I was a kid because I had no way of getting a hold of it you know uh I didn't really have friends who like I said I didn't have too many friends so I knew of it and things but I wasn't really able to get my hands on it I always felt bad there's this one kid that would would come of my house to play baseball sometimes he lived down the road and he like for some reason he only had bant t-shirts he didn't have any other clothing and would you make him put it inside out yeah my my dad make him turn inside out cuz it was the Guns and Roses album covers with like skeletons and yeah and chicks on them and stuff like so he wasn't allowed to wear him to my house which H maybe a little bit I get but yeah I always in hindsight I'm like man I always feel bathroom but um yeah and then so that was so this is all through high school well that was pretty much Elementary School and Middle School in middle school I started um me and my friends got really into skateboarding that was kind of there's like this kid that just we saw with a skateboard and we asked them about it and then for some reason we all got into it the little circle of friends that I did have and that your mom and dad were fine with that yeah yeah they were pretty much fine with that cuz it was just skateboarding it was like a sport and in Middle School like we like they weren't bad yet like my friend weren't that bad yet there's still we were still kind of kids it was 12 13 and then so we skated a lot my mom would just card us around to skate parks or just whatever we just be we just find a parking lot it was awesome we just we lived in the middle of nowhere so we just find a old railroad tie wax it up and just put in the middle of a parking lot you could spend four hours there doing that in 90\u00b0 heat and um so that's what I did most Summers in middle school and stuff and that's honestly I think skateboarding helped a lot with probably we talked about this any on the podcast before I think I've never had really injuries as far as bone stuff or anything like that I think it really helped strengthen that from all the repeated you know tricks and stuff on skateboards that's funny cuz I basically hadn't had no nobody in my family really broke any bones M and like skating you take some hard slams I always joke about it now like if I did like just a small fall I would be right yeah yeah there's surprisingly I've never broken a bone that's kind of shocking um yeah and so I did that for a while in middle school and that was fun but those friends then high school was weird because those friends started to like go off and kind of get into some a lot of partying and drugs and stuff and I was still like a good Christian kid or whatever so I didn't really do too much of that um oh and I also forgot to mention yeah like I grew up camping a lot too going outdoors and my family went like we didn't go on vacations we just went uh we had a pop-up camper but we would just go to like a state park or whatever so I never I didn't fly till I was like a senior in high school or something or junior in high school and then so we never and we didn't like go out to eat or anything like that so it was a very weird that's it what do your parents think like now with your job now you fly all over the world yeah do they what's our take on it I mean they think it's cool for sure um but it is weird because a lot of my family hasn't really been outside of pa pa yeah I mean I think they've been a couple other places but nothing like they never been to Europe or California or anything like that or Texas mostly just some place the East Coast um do you think well we'll get into your band stuff later but yeah oh yeah so then I so then and then High School I um I still play baseball but most of the other and I still skateboard it but a lot of my friends were like I said they were going the other direction and honestly like it's kind of sad cuz at least two of them two of my best friends they've died of heroin overdoses um since then and and like it's like you just see like that whatever started in high school at that time just kept going like never stopped and then we so when then when I was in high school I started going to this youth group um that was actually pretty awesome like I just I didn't have that many friends I didn't know too many people I was like pretty like I was friends with everyone at school but I never had any friends friends and then that when I started going there I met like there's people who are literally my best friends still today who I still met there in e or 10th grade or whatever nth or 10th grade and so so like I just met some really cool people who made me gain a lot of confidence and it's really weird I I always think about this with my kids or even your kids like when you think when you talk about Theo I think about this like you're just like where did that come from and I think about myself where when I was younger I had no confidence didn't know anyone like whatever and then I just met these people who were just like cool or I thought they were cool and then I was like oh I guess I'm cool and then I just embraced that and kind of just became myself and then became friends with like a ton of people and then I love meeting people and then like so before this would you say you were a shy kid oh yeah for sure like absolutely and and then I just liked meeting people and meeting new friends and stuff and have in high school and into college and that was an awesome time for sure like that changed my life pretty much my senior year of high school I guess or Junior to senior year of high school um and then yeah so I went to college after that in uh oh and I played tennis my senior year high school so that was like another thing I just tried new things was just like I should just try out for the tennis team and I was actually really good and I wish I would have done that earlier because I was actually one of my it's probably one of my favorite sports um and then we got to college so I went to a college called Geneva College Geneva College it's out near like Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and um it's like a liberal art school but I really liked it it's small school actually I didn't I was like okay with it at the time freshman year kind of was rough and I almost transferred to Penn State um but I just decided last second not to and then I yeah and I met some really good friends there and I thought I had a pretty good education I went for English education which was I was planning on being an English teacher probably because I watched Dead Poet Society way too many times um because I loved writing and reading when I was a kid oh that was the other thing I was like obsessed with reading as a kid I read like an insane amount of books um all the time and I love reading newspaper like I would read the newspaper with my morning bowl of cereal and as a kid yeah like you're like in Middle School and High School were you wearing a tie no I just like read that like I loved reading everything pretty much um well because you that was probably like your outlet you didn't have access to movies and yeah pretty much yeah that is true and so like in when I was in high school some friends like some of my new friends I met introduced me some cool writers too like on the road by Jack kowak that was like a book that changed my life um like I I love CER in the Ry I loved um Kurt Von give books and stuff like that so I just kind of got into all this reading and writing and then went to college for English um and it was a good it was a great education in hindsight I didn't think it was at the time you're like a sucks I go to school it's like 2,000 people um how big were your classes I mean lectures there were some lectures that were like you know 100 kids or something 150 kids but but like my individual classes were like 20 kids so they're like maybe even less than that some like 10 so pretty small classes yeah so that was nice CU you could really get like just dropped in their professor's offices at any time and and being a liberal art a liberal art school I felt like it gave me a really good education just like to think about things in a different way and you know you got to take art classes and all kinds of other stuff so that was cool um but then when once I graduated from there I um like I I did my student teaching my last semester of school and it was at a poor steel industry Town um like the whole steel industry left Wester PA so all those towns out there were just like ghost towns and to some extent still are but I student taught there and it was like no AP classes no college prep classes it was just like everyone's in the same class so it was for student teaching it was pretty rough cuz you had to deal with like so many behavioral problems and just I don't know I just didn't like it and I just it's crazy because I went to school to be an English teacher and I did my student teaching and I was like dude I don't know this is what I want to do and it's funny because I remember the there's like this class I had in my senior year of college where the professor asked us if it was like the three if you could have three dream jobs or something like what would they be I think I said I think the number one was journalist for Rolling Stone or something and then two was a a rock star or being a rock band and three was um be a teacher so my third one was teacher did that didn't like it so then after I graduated college I worked for a Small Town Newspaper close to home in humblest Pennsylvania and so that was just like a weekly newspaper where I would write news story local news story Sports whatever and a friend of mine this was a full-time job yeah it was a full-time job but it paid like $10 an hour or something was terrible and I did that for six months or so and then a through a friend of a friend someone said oh my my friend is looking for a bass player cuz they have this band and they want to go on tour I was like dude I'm 22 I I've always wanted to do that I'm like yeah I'm just GNA I'm just going to do it did you know how to play yeah I play oh oh yeah so I played B since I started mention I started playing bass guitar when I was 15 or 16 you play in the church right yeah so there friends that I met at youth group they bought me a bass guitar for my birthday uh the one year I think when I turned 16 or maybe 15 so I learned it and yeah played for church why bass guitar over regular guitar um I I had a regular guitar but I think it was one of those I don't know it was just one of those things that seemed interesting maybe I there was a time where I felt like the base was like especially with flea from Hot Chili Peppers yeah he kind of made it cool and then there's other bands that like were bass driven and you're like it's also easier to learn like sure it's only one note at a time boom yeah one finger one nose still got to have to have rhythm yeah which I'm struggling with at the gym yeah yeah um and so yeah I did play start playing in high school and play throughout college and then I was like yeah let's do let's join a band tour because why not and so I remember there was a it was crazy too cuz I had this fork in the road where there was a newspaper that asked called me to they went to hire me to be a daily sports writer which I probably would have is another path that I wouldn't have mind taking cuz I love sports um I could have really done well in that I liked lot of the Sports Illustrated writers like Rick Riley um he would always have the last page in Sports Illustrated he's kind of he was always one of my favorite writers and honestly who I kind of uh formulate the drop email that's kind of the basis of that his writing and Mitch album and other people like that were awesome Sports Raiders and so I so I had that job offer or was joined a band and I was like I'm I'm just going to do the band thing which is crazy were you nervous at all about that decision I don't think so I think I am a risk taker in that way where if it just feels right I just do it so for better for worse and I don't know my parents probably thought it was insane but they they I was still living at home at the time cuz I just graduated college and so they were like go get out go on the road yeah I guess but they let me stay so when I came home from the road they would I'd still stay at home home and just work whatever job I could get so for the for drop listeners if you ever hear me talk about some job I had in the past it's usually in the band days because we were super broke like so basically what we did was we just had a 15 passenger van and a trailer and okay wait back up for a second okay I'm sorry they someone says you we want we need a bass player and you're like oh cool that's me I'll do it do you know anyone in this band uh I did I did vaguely know let's see H I kind of knew one of the guys and then but I wasn't friends with him did you have to like play for them and they're like oh yeah you're good enough or yeah I think I just played and then drank some beers we also have to throw out the name of the band yeah so it was called farewell flight we weren't that big if you look at it's still on Spotify though um but we and was based out of Harrisburg PA and we were all DIY so this is a weird time for bands because it was 2005 six and it was right after um like CDs were dying off but the internet was still kind of lagging lime wire napck so yeah what we were doing I mean there was did you have sharing Services Myspace page yeah so was like height of Myspace all right but the problem is that Myspace didn't didn't have great promotional tools it wasn't like today where everything's integrated and Instagram and Facebook and whatever um so it was in it was so difficult to find I mean I would literally just do zip code searches and like spam people to come out to shows like it was crazy it was like DIY to the extreme and uh or if we were trying to find bands to play with in other towns we just Hammer different places on MySpace because there's really no other way to find venues bands anything and so our drummer booked all the tours and we would do three weeks usually three weeks on the road 3 weeks home or 3 weeks on the road four weeks home just for years and so mostly this half the us and we did one six week tour that was like the whole way out to California up to Seattle and back um but I mean we played 750 shows in span of six years so I mean 25 130 shows a year at least okay how does a band member get paid so yeah they don't um so when we were first starting it was so we were so broke that everything we made just went back in the van so was like into the band so it was Van repairs merch buying merch um just general expenses and stuff like that because you only make you know on a good show you might make a hundred bucks for the whole group yeah so like not a good show but just a normal show okay that and sometimes if you get really lucky if you have a HomeTown show you might make 500 or something like that so you were just using that money to survive and travel yeah so it's like when we came home I was dude I remember coming home from tour R end me my change J just put gas in my car to get to work like I'm not kidding you I had no money and we were like hungry a lot because we only our first priority was cigarettes and beer and then food so in that order and didn't you have a a hack at Wendy's or some place with a receipt that you could get oh we had a ton of hacks I could go on for another hour about all the food hacks cuz there is uh some of the back the receipts would have oh if you fill out the survey you get a free whopper or with a purchase of a fries but they didn't say you couldn't buy value fries which are only a dollar and then you buy you know it was like a drink in a but if you buy the value on it was two bucks and basically you get a whole meal so that was like a hack then Arby's had this weird promo was back when they were doing like texting stuff where they're like oh text this text this number and you'll get a code well they didn't limit how many codes you could get so we would just uh be texting us Su they had this promo going on for like two months where we just hammered these new Arby sandwiches that they had coming out it was insane and then another time talk Taco Bell had this competition for bands on the road and we got $500 in Taco Bell bucks which were $5 checks and they were actually like checks legal tender so if you brought them about a 49 cent Taco yeah buy 49 cent Taco they have to give you $4.50 back in cash which we then just SP spend on beer and all it all worked together like that so it was like trying to find out crazy hacks to just survive basically of course we're just drinking Keystone Light the whole time there's no like no other options the fact that you're still alive is impressive it actually no it's actually incredible I mean sometimes I'm like did I burn the candle too much at that end and it's all going to come crashing down in like two years which it may but the and then we had a van that ran on vegetable oil that was the craziest thing cuz it ran on because we were trying to save money so we got this whole system installed where this huge tank of vegetable oil sat in the back of the van like 120 gallon tank this this real yeah I know somebody else who did this and it the car smells weird yeah you just like we would go so what the idea is you have this tank in the back has two two split with two different sides and two different filters and it has a hose so you have to go to restaurant dumpsters and pump the grease out of the dumpster into your van but the problem is it can't just be you can't just roll up to McDonald's and just pump it out because their grease is so bad because they just fry things endlessly and so you actually have to find decent quality grease so like Taco Bell actually has very good grease uh Chick-fil-A actually has great grease cuz they change it regularly but then any other fast food restaurant was horrible so we just had like we had a whole book with like the best restaurants in like the East Coast with like the best grease and we' have to do rounds every three days like we'd split up into two teams of two and find like find the grease or whatever but the pro problem with these vehicles they also run really dirty like it's hard to keep those how many of you are there and how many are you sleeping in this van four four of us but we'd always have a friend or two who would just jump on we had this one friend who is he's now a doctor making like half million doll a year a cancer doctor but he had he was in med school at the time and or prior to med school and so whenever he had a break he would just like fly out and meet us or jump in a bus and meet us on tour and just tour with us for the next two weeks and he would he would rack up these crazy bar tabs CU he just put it on his med student loans which was awesome and and we had other friends who would just jump in the van for a week and just hang out and then go back to where they were whatever so it was kind of a rolling circus and uh but it was awesome it was it was the best definitely the few first few years were the best times just I mean it and and honestly it taught at the time I was especially as it went on I was think it started to feel more like failure than success because we were we did have some interest in labels in the beginning and we had played with some cool bands and met a lot of cool friends and recorded a couple albums in Nashville with some good producers and stuff like that and um and now it's but then it started to die off and this is like year two three um three or four okay and then by that time the grind of touring and playing to 10 people at a show like some dive bar and what I always thought is like you're playing the same songs over and over and over again doesn't that start to yeah that's why band that's why radio Hood doesn't play Creep you know stuff like that it's like fans love that but I get I understand now why bands don't play certain songs or even go back to certain albums so yeah that got old but just the lifestyle it started to get more depressing where we were just drinking not to have fun but just to drink just to stay level just to sandwich yeah just to stay warm in the van like when you're in an ice storm in Iowa and you're 28 or you know 27 years old and all your friends have now are starting families or doing have real jobs with 401ks and you're drinking Evan Williams whiskey like and sleeping in a van with three dudes when it's 30 degrees out kind of it's like a little depressing and then you had to go home and wait tables at the holiday in and like hey Robbie how's it going yeah that's what you were doing yeah so when I mostly my job was waiting tables at a restaurant at the Holiday near where I lived and then but I also like I said I just pick up crazy random jobs if I ever needed extra money and you're still living at home at this point I lived at home I think until I was 25 like the first couple years and then I moved out um and lived with a a friend who just gave me super cheap rent like 150 bucks a month for a room um and so that was in Harrisburg so then yeah that was a kind of a grind and then towards the end it got like I said it got pretty depressing but yeah when I came home from tour and people ask you that was the worst because in the beginning you're like oh yeah we went we played went the whole way down to you know Tallahassee over to Austin up through Kansas City to Michigan and played like you know it was a lot of fun it's like a good time and people thought it was cool and then once you're doing that for so long it's like damn like I don't know it's just I didn't want to talk about it and then so I finally uh I Recon so my wife now we had dated my senior year of college and we dated for a year and then broke up for four years and so we kind of reconnected when I was 28 or something 27 and then I was like okay I need to move on need to go do something I don't know just need to move on and I moved to Baltimore dude and it was just like on a whim not cuz of Kimmy kind of but her so her brother had a boat cleaning business and I had just gotten off tour and they the I was this is so sounds so insane so I I was working for a I was working for a water meter company installing water meters throughout like they were upgrading all the water meters this requires no skills I learned them on the Fly okay Robie you haven't heard these stories it sounded like torture you'd be out in the freezing weather trying to like use tools dude that that job was it was so hard but it really taught me a lot uh about independence and kind of because you'd be out in the field and things would go wrong and you couldn't call anyone cuz when I was younger I used to I wasn't very independent my mom did do a lot of stuff for me and for us kids you know she's just trying to help us but I never was taught resilience or anything like that and so then that job honestly that was another thing that changed my life was being stuck in the middle of nowhere if the water meter breaks or something and you just got to figure it out and it's like at the time the job sucked I thought it was such a shitty job but you don't realize like some things just are good in in the long run or in hindsight and that was a super like it was hard it was manual labor in a way or just being out in really bad conditions and that a winter in Pennsylvania and uh but that that really helped a lot so anyways I came I came home from that from a tour and they were like yeah we don't have any more work for you like all the our contracts are dried up so I didn't have like any money to my name and I needed a job and my so Kimmy who I was dating she lived in Annapolis and I knew her brother had this boat cleaning business I was like can I just work for you for summer and I like like I'll figure the rest out I just need as long as I have a job will figure it out and so I found a place on Craigslist within a couple days and thank God it was in Canton cuz I had no idea like where anything was in Baltimore oh W I was just lucky it's like a block from my kids school and he had a room that didn't even have a full wall it was like it was like you know the middle rooms and row homes the tiny little ones it was one of those where just basically the bed fit in and the wall didn't even go the whole way up to the ceiling it was like it was crazy but he only charged me like 400 bucks a month or 450 for everything which in Canon is insane yeah and so so lucky luckily I moved there work did the boat detailing stuff for a year uh then I did it myself like I ran the business for Year and that was the hardest job I ever had like no question about it it was like it was so hard cuz you imagine just a 50ft yacht and you have to wax the whole thing just imagine the whole thing like yourself yeah you had no one else like I had it my friend my one friend uh from home actually like that he came down and did it with me but you have like a power tools like a power buffer and you're waxing the whole thing like underneath my dad used to do that I would do like one section for four minutes and be done yeah it's like dude it sucks thanks for the help and is in July your heat is like radiating off the boat trying not to get sweat on it CU then messes everything up it's like I mean I was in good shape but that was brutal and that's another job where I'm like dude I hope it doesn't come back on me because there's a lot of chemicals and stuff like yeah I don't even know we hardly ever wore masks you were outside and don't forget did medical testing too oh [ __ ] I didn't I didn't talk about the medical testing I did oh yeah so the whole time we were in the band real brief we like me and the other guys in the band we were all broke so there's the Hershey Medical Center would do these medical tests of all kinds of crazy stuff and I mean I did drug testing in college that was a whole another thing that was that was crazy super crazy but cuz that was clinical drug trials that you would have to stay at the place for a whole weekend and then but I I did these at the Hershey Medical Center they did these all kinds of tests where they would they would inject your arm with vitamin C which makes it feel like it's breaking somehow I don't even know how it would hurt so bad and then they would measure the nerve activity in your leg which I still feel like I can feel how many times I got stuck with that and uh the one time they put these like thin like acupuncture needles the whole way straight through your like four of them like one end of the other are you sure you weren't in the movie Saw I don't know it was a crazy time but and then then you get like 50 bucks in a lunch voucher and you and everyone in the band would do these yeah like we were their main clients we get the first people to call they just where they be like hey farewell flight is here yeah honestly they would we they'd be like yeah we just saw Timmy he's got his crackers and lunch vouchers did I meet Timmy you might have met it once who's the one who has the Keen Ted too that's Mark Mark okay yeah you I think you might you might have met him he does live he actually lives in Baltimore now but yeah I thought it was weird that I was I used to listen to the song on Spotify that was one of your bandmates songs I still think it's a great song oh yeah that's right I forget the name of the song though um I'm trying to remember which one you listen to It's one wor like pretend that you just pretend that you love me yeah um um what's the name of it though anyways his name's luer r l l u KR check out his music it's great yeah I his voice is really good yeah no and I I was listening to him and Robbie goes what are you listening to yeah and I said that he go I used to be in a band with that guy I like that was my lead singer um yeah and then so boats was last so did the boats yeah so the uh the other kids or sorry the other guys in my band so they when I left the band they moved to Nashville and you left you broke up the band uh a drummer once I announced my departure our drummer was also Mark was like the I think it was the writing was on the wall I don't think it's that crazy then the other guys moved to Nashville and they they wrote songs with a lot of other people and played country with country music artists like I would think that such a hard road unless you have that success yeah and even if you have the success then you got to try to repeat it but it's just everybody wants it everybody is trying to do it and if you're out there in a van and you're freezing in the middle of Kentucky or wherever you were yeah eating you know AR sandwiches because that's what you can get yeah the will to continue going on and to continue pushing in that direction has to hit a limit at some point yeah yeah no exactly which it did I mean yeah it's it's hard it was hard and so I think I was definitely it it was a weird leaving that was tough and then moving to Baltimore because I didn't know anyone in Baltimore besides my wife and then but she didn't she lived in Annapolis at the time and time she wasn't your wife right and so and so I didn't really have any friends and it's a huge you don't understand how much of it how much of a lifestyle change that is because when I was in the band if you think about 3 weeks I've never been as close to people anyone in my whole life most people aren't we would be with each other literally 24 hours a day where you're playing together drinking together sharing the van traveling together sleeping on the same floors next to each other it's I I it it's almost like being in war not in that way but I understand I never understood why people want to go back to war mean like camaraderie yeah and I never understood why why would you want to go back to war you're at home why would you sign up again but I totally get it because that's it feels like a whole piece of VI is missing when you have that it's not the war aspect it's not the danger it's not the depression it's like that part of being close to people like that and then having being completely out of that it's like really hard to deal with so that was actually pretty difficult for me at the time um because we just stay up till 4:00 a.m. talking and drinking and hanging out like was it this is before I mean I think phones were like iPhones had just come out but it wasn't like it is now like we you wouldn't be scrolling Instagram at night right so was like we all just hung out all the time and talked and honestly that's where it's weird cuz I think some people do like this podcast because we have a good sense of humor and I don't know I feel like I'm pretty good sometimes with thinking of things on the fly but all my like anything all my humor or I don't know responses and things like that all came from them or and practicing that for years on end cuz we'd all just riff off each other and I'm not saying like I'm a professional comedian but I'm saying like I like it's easy it's easy to just like flow in conversation and let things like and think of things in the fly because we would always just be hanging out and talking and RI riffing off each other and all my friends are 10 times funnier than me like I'm not even close to being the like it's like it's pretty yeah anyways and so we so that was hard getting out of that and then I had to transition to living in Baltimore and like when I wasn't when Boats were done for the season I I Barb backed at salanta Irish Pub down at Fel Point still there yeah and that was that job was actually pretty rough too because I don't that that one dealing with what you had to deal there yeah I remember when Brandon came on board and he was still part timing oh right at rip tie at rip tie and I was like what' you do this he's like I clean vomit off the toilet and had to mop out diarrhea all over the floor and I'm like dude how much do you need how how much do we need to pay you to so you don't have to go back there yeah yeah no that kind of stuff and um and that was wild because I worked in kitchens my whole life and there was always unsavory characters but coming to Baltimore like the first cook I met had murdered someone and was out like and and just got out a couple years ago or whatever and he was actually cool like we all hung out together and but he was in the black gorilla family which is one of the most notorious gangs in Baltimore and it was just a weird crazy mix of people like being in a kitchen in Baltimore and but that feels like a similar lifestyle to the band life where like you're up all night well that's why I kind of liked I had no problems living working in a restaurant because I a I had done it my whole life anyways and B it's like I kind of of like the pirate ship mentality of it in a way and so that was uh I did I did that in the offseason and stuff and just tried to save up a lot of money that way and and then I ended up the boat detailing thing was like so hard and brutal and wasn't working out too well and a friend told me he worked for a military contractor for the Department of Defense and was like hey we have some openings and like the technical writer position or something and so I I just wanted like a normal job honestly for the first time in 12 or my whole life and that was so I took that and what year was that that was like when I was 30 so I was right when I got married yeah 30 okay and so that was 12 years ago and um and that was the other thing when I left the band 2o I [Music] thought that whole time I I was like oh I in my life I thought I was so old like I really did I thought I was like oh I'm done I can't even I'm just going to I'm I'm bound to isn't it weird when you're 26 you think that your life is it's over insane and I thought I was bound to just do manual labor garbage jobs my whole life because I had a pretty low self worth at the time I was like there's no I don't even know what to do I don't even know what my skills are I literally had no no idea I was just like I don't have I haven't done anything since College as far as academically or in the real Workforce what's my resume I lived out of a van for five years and weit at tables like I don't even know where to start and so I honestly didn't even know I was like I'm never going to be able to make money like I have a real job and so then and Kimmy was like yes I do yeah yeah and then Kimmy had she had a real job so I was like let me get on that you got Healthcare yeah um and yeah I mean it was crazy her that I don't know I think your parents were a little what are you doing yeah like and that was part of why I wanted a normal job honestly just to be proved to them that had it somewhat together I've I've always postulated that men and evolution of what we do in this world would have never happened if we were content just not having a spouse or having a partner because I think that most most of what we do is to I mean think about it if if you weren't trying to impress a woman you would never comb your hair or dress or anything like that we'd all be still in the caves we'd all be hanging out and I think that the motivation is okay I gotta do this I got to show that I can provide for a family I got to show that I can do this it it makes people motivates people to oh yeah before so before kimy and I got back together my plan was actually me and one of my best friends we were just going to buy a boat and just live on it and just kind of bum around like that we were actually going to do that and because I I didn't know what else to do I was like might as well just kind of check out the world and bounce around like and then and then obviously yeah when I met her I was like okay I should probably get things together or when we got back together and so yeah so then I did that job for a while and then like uh uh that contract ended in six months it was like the shortest contract ever it got cut almost right after I started and so then I had to find another job and I was on unemployment and I was like dude I hate I hated unemployment that was probably one of the worst times too I hate not working and so that was like not that long it was only like six months but got an offer from the Coast Guard uh to work in there technical information Branch as a contractor so I took that and then so then while I was at the Coast Guard this is before I had kids I um I started going back to school cuz my wife worked at a community college so I was like I got free classes so I figured might as well pick up another either degree or just learn more and again I went to basically make money to show her parents that wasn't a dead beat and so I started getting into cyber security or computer networking I took like a bunch of semesters of computer networking and I did really well but I hated it it was just so mind numbingly boring and then I switched to um web development so I was learning that for a couple more semesters and learn like JavaScript and a bunch of stuff like that so kind of got way into web development and then which is crazy because that was I I had a job offer from another place but then it was kind of like the same time as believe in the Run uh it was right after I started believe in the run and that was like some agency that's in the cden yard's Warehouse I forget what it is um but so that was like another path I was going down but then running came into my life during the time so then when I was at the Coast Guard this is 20 about N9 or 10 years ago um so and I think I have told this story before on other a reference to but I like the whole reason I started running was because I had that I had uh oh so my friends that that guy the medical doctor who would come on tour with us whenever and just party with us he had friends uh he lived in Brooklyn and so when we were off tour or going through New York City we just go up to Brooklyn and hang out there and party like everywhere and we were basically doing a crawl through Manhattan at on a Friday night or something and and we went past this place where they were doing uh what do you call it bone uh bone marrow donor like matching stuff and he was like we're doing this like everyone get in line you're gonna see if you can be a bone marrow donor like because we're all hammered and he's a doctor and we're like whatever give me the last thing I'm doing like if someone give me give me the lollipop see yeah see you guys someplace else so we all got swabbed for it and then this is probably 2009 and then 4 years later or something they I got an email from this company company that said you've been matched to be a bone marrow donor like you match with someone I was like what the heck like what is this and it like I had to think back like it said the location of where it was where I gave the donation and it kind of came back to me and I was like holy that's crazy so so I like looked into it and it seemed uh you know I don't know I guess you save someone's life and doesn't seem like a huge risk it's not like giving your kidney or whatever yeah and I was like whatever yeah I'll do it and so they have to give you a huge physical because you know so you go they they flew people in from around the country to George Georgetown medical center Center or whatever and I mean I just drove down but kind of pointless and so they give you like a full scan MRI x-rays like everything and so the scan came back and they said you have your the lymph nodes in your chest are enlarged and they look they look abnormal so you need to see um a cancer specialist so they recommended me to the University of Maryland Cancer Center or whatever and obviously I'm like kind of freaking out cuz I'm like that seems weird and they so I went there and obviously I couldn't do the bone marrow thing so that was pointless and then I went to the medical center and they did a they looked at the scans and the chest uh like thoracic surgeon or whatever was like oh you have yeah your lymph nodes are enlarged but you also have a mass on your pancreas and I was like uh Google Mass on pancreas oh I'm going to die six months was that that was that the like U Patrick suy Yeah thing yeah well whenever you hear pancreatic cancer that's like you assume it's over yeah or even if even if you don't from what I recall even if it's not even if it's benign or something you it's it means it sooner or later like it's like doesn't in because they can't really remove sure it's very hard to remove them so without messing things up and so I don't think that's the case anymore it might not be I don't know yeah but I recall at the time it did not seem great so then they start doing more tests on me and running me through stuff and it's taken a couple months so I'm just having I'm like in this limbo spot in life where I'm trying to figure things out and so this is an fall of 20 I think it was 10 years ago 2014 and they at the time I Still Smoked and I was like I'm I'm just done like I have to quit smoking cuz my wife had wanted me to quit forever and I've been trying quote unquote trying uh off and on and I was like all right I just got to do it so Halloween night actually in Fell's point was the last time well until I had a cigarette after the brillian marathon but um but that was the last time I smoked for real and yeah we just partied hung out F point and then that was yeah so November 1st 2014 just quit and uh after that I okay so then the scans and everything this took like six months and they went through they did a endoscopic ultrasound where they knock you out and then go down put a camera stuff down your throat look around or whatever I think that's what they did is that what they did sounds great and they they were like oh you don't have anything wrong I was like see that's cool Megan made me go to the doctor a while back and I go and he says it looks like there's something wrong on your neck he's like you know it could be a cancer pup or something yeah so I freak out for like a week because you have to get the scan you got to go get the results for two weeks I'm sitting there basically Sweating Bullets so I know how you feel but your sounds even worse yeah six months in pancreatic cancer sounds a lot worse but I I went and they're like now you're fine and I'm like what this is why I don't go to the doctor I mean yeah I mean so the it's still honestly it still angers me a because my medical bills are $20,000 but because my wife had great Insurance she worked for the State uh it was pretty much nothing right wow so but imagine if I didn't have medical insurance or anything like that all because you decided drunkenly to get SW for marrow to help someone moral the story don't help anyone no bone marrow and so keep that bone marrow to yourself but it really did give me a lot of distrust in not I'm not saying that they weren't well intention whatever but I'm like that's a big deal like that's a life-changing deal in so many ways to people yeah you could have sold your house yeah like in so many ways and he was just like oh yeah I guess we read the scan wrong or something like he literally put his hands on my stomach and was like yeah I feel it right there like he told me that to my face now do you always feel that spot and like is there something there well that's funny cuz when I was doing that I was like oh I feel too but it was probably just I don't know a rib one time one time I was at the doctor it was a MC rib that I just ate and he's like oh you got to be careful you might have a hernia tear at some point now I always feel that area like is it is it is is it happening is it happening yeah and um I don't know it's just always it still makes me mad at this day and and I mean I just look at at the silver line was that I quit cigarettes and started being more active so I started I was going to say so this is your story into running is all from stemmed from this yeah because then I started just finding other things to do well if you think about that even though if you'd had to pay that 20 grand it would have been an investment it was almost like college tuition into getting into running this job yeah that's true and so I started riding the bike I still have I the single speed I just started riding that around doing like all over the city and wherever so that started to get me a little bit more fit and then a couple years later I don't know it was I was just looking for a new challenge because I had done a lot of bike packing stuff and things like that but for some reason I just I always like kind of hate it Runners and I was nerds every yeah they're all wearing these short shorts they talk about marathons oh I ran a marathon blah blah blah there was a different there was a group that was a little different in Baltimore yeah yeah and uh and so at the time I was I I I I told myself I was going to run a marathon I was like I'm just going to do it to do it just to check it off say I ran a marathon be like that's not a big deal whatever and a friend of mine who did run she was like I think you should probably do a half marathon first which was very good advice that was the opposite advice I got yeah really and so I did uh did a half marathon first and I I started I ran with Charm City run to start out for because they did they have training groups and so I trained for the rovus beach half marathon so that was my first one um um and I finished in just over two hours 2011 I think but it felt amazing I was like this is crazy and when I first started running it was like awful it was so bad I couldn't run a half a mile at all I remember just running down to the Waterfront and then coming back and Counting Cars to like mentally get to the next one you know what I mean yeah or just were you getting cramps or what was going on just I couldn't it just sucked like you know and you're starting from zero yeah so that's basically from your house that's about a mile yeah and it was you know what pace not I mean I actually probably was running fine I was probably running harder than I should have been um but it's probably like yeah probably 10minute Pace honestly probably 9:30 or 10 and yeah I was it was so awful but then I just kept sticking to it and obviously by halfway into the half marathon training I was like all right like actually starting to like this and then yeah first half marathon felt awesome finished pretty strong and then kind of went from there but then so I was looking for other running groups because the Charm City run group was cool to start out as far as I had no idea what to do with running or anything uh I still forget my was my first Nike shoe my first running shoe is the Nike I remember about the arrival but that was is it was a Nike it was a gray with the like gray and yellow yellow highlighter accents with it wasn't the structure it was uh no I know what you're talking about it was a react not it was pre- react or it's the one I Ran New York in I think um yeah yeah I think you told me it was a stability shoe though it was yeah um it was a cool looking shoe yeah but I remember yeah it's going to drive me nuts it had fly Wire yeah yeah I I know exactly what picture of the shoe but I can't remember so that was my first shoe and I think my second was the Pegasus 33 or 32 I had both of those at the same time and uh and then my first marathon was the Houston Marathon 2015 2016 2016 I think and so I but yeah so then I was looking for a different running group because no offense the Charm City run but the vibe was it just like wasn't my people it's fine like but I I wanted someone where it felt like I was in a band again because that's the kind of people I hung out with it was like people who may or may not smoke or drink or like it's just RIS take you know different they look different than normal Runners well to get neon and we were wear we had tattoos we enjoyed partying as much as running yeah so and so found faster basts on Instagram which is crazy because a there weren't really that many run Crews back then and not really many on Instagram and I didn't know that I just thought I was just looking on Instagram found it and I thought oh this is just normal and at the time it was wasn't that many people in the faster bastards probably there was two cycles to faster bastards so that in the time when we came down and were running in Baltimore where you would have joined yeah it was a steady crew of Megan Gavin probably five to 10 people Steve lewit yeah uh uh cats yeah Steve and Adam and that was pretty much the weekly crew and and then it was kind of funny because Eric Schulman started coming out but it was it was a group of about i' say 10 people that were hardcore there every week and other people started looping in but everybody that came out at that time except for Megan and Gavin doesn't have any tattoos but everybody else was pretty much tatted up and wearing all black yeah like yeah and I thought that was cool and so I dm' faster faster account and asked about runs and didn't hear back from anyone for like three two months so that person would be Thomas yeah I doubt it was three months I I no it was it was probably just like three weeks or two or three weeks but yeah um I think I had started I think I I think I figured out like how to get how to get there anyways so um it was in the bio weekly run class yeah I think I were you pre Wednesdays or were like with Wednesday is already a thing when you came on no I think I was pre okay because it it started off as like a weekly 10 mile run on Saturdays it was just that yeah yeah and so that was in yeah I was probably like 2016 or something like that and so started running with the faster basts and obviously I got into really got into running that was like most Runners know when you get really into when you first start running there's that first learning curve and then once you're in it then it's oh I want to do every race I want to do this I want to do this so that was pretty exciting and at the time I only had one kid so I still had there's some flexibility Freedom when I first start I didn't I think my wife was pregnant yeah she so my first marathon he my kid was 8 months old my first marathon yeah yeah cuz I remember I'd known you'd come out to like one or two runs at the time and there was a first Thursday concert and it was after we made the one hat and I like looked over and I saw the black one yes I saw you at the at the first Thursday concert wearing the hat and I didn't know you well enough at that time to like even though we probably run together I didn't I didn't go up and be like hey what's up oh yeah or anything like that like I just you went you used to go to first Thursday concerts look at you yeah you used to leave the house that's crazy um and I think you had a like a baby with you yeah it's probably why I didn't say hello I'm like I'm not getting no yeah he would have been he would have been like one at the time or something maybe less than that but anyways it was uh that's when I really started getting into running and then when I was doing stuff with the faster basts I would do we I don't I think I don't know how it came about but I would do these runs called Redline runs I know how it came up was it just no he it was very specific okay so you came up to me one time and you're like I'm tired of doing the same run every week you could we do a different run and I was like yeah absolutely if you want to organize it we'll put it in the email yeah and do it and I at the time was like oh his name is readinger let's do a red Line run yeah and there was a two different things going on there's a red line which was going to be a extension of the light rail MH east to west in Baltimore yeah which people were like all pissed off about which is coming back oh it is coming back okay so people were all mad about that and then I didn't know the political yeah I didn't either term for red line so we put out we're doing this Red Line run where a bunch of dudes with tattoos and everything like that well and redlining like to the Limit yeah that's what we were thinking matter of fact would I think it was more Redline like that is what I was thinking yeah um so you put it together uh I believe the first one the f I remember the first one the first one was crazy it start basically started by my house and then we went up to basically Herring Run Park but we had this wild route that I was like let's just do something real weird I think people were freaked out cu you had to go through like uh I remember field or something yeah I was like over railroad tracks over these guard rails threw a hole in the fence uh I remember somebody complaining they're like dude we're walking in like it Dave Bush I remember it was it he's like it was it was like thigh high Thorn bushes they weren't happy that was the easy part um and there was a bunch of crazy stuff but I was like yeah welcome to my world this is what happens and so and I ended at the Venice Tavern which is great good Afterparty so then I started doing those every month or two and that was a lot of fun we had some good runs in that I wish I need to bring one of those back maybe sometime I remember a horrible one we did that went on that Park I is that pig town over there yeah oh when it was raining yeah and it was like hot rain though it was like steamy yeah and it was a lot of hills and I'm just like H but the the bar hang out was cool though the bar was cool but it was air conditioned so we came in from being like hot and sweat I brought a jack I think I came prepared I think I brought a change of clothes with me yeah I I ended up scootering to the start of that one so I I wrote a scooter to that one I remember that's when first scooters first came out yeah I was like yeah so then I basically got uh we were running with the faster pass but I was still working at the coast guard and doing that full time I was just hat like I was reaching the end of my rope there because I was in a I was in one of those jobs that Elon Musk is gonna cut on day [Music] one um but no actually it's not going to get cut because it's part of the homeland security and they have their budgets tied up but it was frustrating because I worked in I worked in government this is like classic bureaucratic government so I'm in government work in a cubicle probably had to do four hours of work a week and that wasn't everyone there but just the position that I was in and there was nobody cared and nobody was pulling the same on the team so I was just like well who cares and so that was sucking my soul dry and I just had to get out of cubicle world or especially government and I just remember this one time a friend who at work who's was great guy but he's just a straight government lifer and he had this spreadsheet like an Excel spreadsheet of every one of his GS steps and his promotional rates and how that would look like when he turned 62 or whatever or 65 jeez and it was laid out each year exactly looks like Severance yeah and I that was the moment where I was like I got to get out I can't I can't do this and and it was crazy be and so and what happened so I had been thinking about this for a while and then you and me and Ryan d one time were hanging out at a bar watching a Browns game watching Browns Steelers game I think might have been yeah at uh at a bar in Canton and we got to talk in and I had been writing for believe in the Run yeah you my favorite was uh we got an Epson watch that looked like a looked like a home printer and it was like big and bulky and they're like do you want to review this I'm like I don't but Robie you do technical writing he's like yeah I'm like you want to review this he's like yeah I'll review it dude I think I wrote 3,000 words on Epson GPS watch was insane which was also a piece of yeah it was a horrible watch GPS watch like Epson who makes the printers like why are you making this um and and I would I also started shuffling um like any shoe I didn't want to review yeah like hey Robbie thanks well hey that we do it to you it's actually I when you especially when you first start reviewing everyone you want any shoe you can get so I don't I got you but it also I think honestly we still do that with our reviewers they're not going to get the like when they like to go back to your pig rendering days they're not going to get the good pieces they're going to get the leftovers until they kind of prove themselves and move up or oh I never even said what scrapple was so oh yeah scrapple is when you after you butcher the pig and have like all the normal cuts off yeah you put everything into and they make the sausage and everything you put the rest of the pieces into and just dry them up meat like anything ears okay so it's just the pieces you don't use and then they put cornmeal to bind it let's move on past that one yeah so that's not that's not like you don't go where I grew up in California yeah not once did I ever see scrapple on the menu yeah right I don't think it's a West at all but out here people love it there's a whole festival for it on the we just gave a bunch to my brother-in-law yesterday or Sunday yeah um but anyway so that was scrapple but then you're at the bar talk we're hanging out talking and I think it came up well like basically I went to leave the job or like find a way to work for believe in the run or big run media and yeah you were like I think you just flat out ass you say hey I want to work there and I was like dude I wish you had said this a week ago we hired this dude oh that's right and he was horrible yeah uh the guy still he stole money from us yeah and I was like his wife was an employment attorney so he probably knew like uh cuz what had happened was we had to let him go and then a check went through afterwards like it was on auto autopay or something like that like hey bud you know that that's not for you could you yeah send it back and at that time Big R media was just starting out pretty much so the amount of money that that was was not insignificant to us right and so you would say hey and I was like dang so I went I'm like B we got to fire this other guy I said I don't know I said maybe to you I said let me talk to me or something yeah I think that is what he said and I and I I talked to me and I was like look he he''s been writing for us I think it would be good you know he can help out with big run media and him and I can work on some believe in the Run stuff on the side yeah because believe in the run at this point that started in 2009 this is probably how long have you been with us now six years yeah so 6 years ago 2019 and believe in the run at that time was still like not a h it was more than a hobby but it wasn't a business right and so you came on and make said it's fine as long as we focus on Big Run media right right yeah and by the way side and so I was once I got the green light I I told the Coast Guard or my contractor at the Coast Guard I was gonna I was gonna quit which was they had just switched contractors like my contractor lost the bid and got passed off to another one which is pretty normal and that contractor the head of the branch at the coast guard the government guy he really loved me and he was like you have to keep them and so they were they were basically willing to offer me whatever I wanted to stay there and I turned it down cuz I just like I don't like it was pretty decent pay uh uh and like it was definitely a pay and I'm not saying like to say it was P like I know what you only had so much money I understand that no let's let's we'll be real here when we hired you we didn't have any money to pay you so when we when we um we gave you like I think we talked about a a salary at the time yeah and so we're like okay Megan we'll we'll just give it a shot if it doesn't work out well you told me you I think you told me like look we don't have any money I was like well this is I understand and this is like what I can do yeah which is I think what you said so we were cool with it and then we I go back to me I go H I don't know how we're going to pay for this guy but I think we'll be able to figure it out and me me and I were pretty optimistic at the time we were able to pick up clients and stuff like that so we're like we'll we'll we'll make sure it happens and it wasn't I would say just so it doesn't sound like I was asking for a ton of money I think it was it was normal money but but but for a small business starting it's a the business was myself Megan and one other employee Rachel at the time so any money more than that more than zero but here's the thing so we were yeah more than zero if if you had said $10 a week we'd been like I don't know where we're got um the but we were at that time kind of like subletting for my brother his office right and so we weren't paying rent either right we were doing work for him to kind of cover that cost so you came on that week my brother and I had a disagreement or misunderstanding of some sort and now we no longer had the office well not only that we lost our biggest contract that we had the same week yeah from a from actually it's a government contract technically the Navy oh right the Army Navy uh 10mile right um that we were working on so we lost that which we just had a a meeting like two weeks before that they're like we're going to build this up we're going to do it you guys did a great job we love how it went last time how can we spend more money with you and then I then the um their I guess their budget board or whatever was like we're not going to do a 10 mile anymore or half marathon and and so they just wiped it out and they're like sorry we don't have a half we're not and I'm like you guys just got rid of the race they're like yeah they will NE they will not be that race anymore wow which is kind of odd but that sounds like a government thing like oh we'll cut that oh yeah um so we were like okay we just lost our office we lost our biggest client and we just took somebody on a salary so you don't know behind the scenes Megan and I are kind of sweating it out yeah and we're like we'll figure it out there's lots of nights where we would go to bed and right before bed I'm like we're gonna be okay right's like yeah we'll be all right meanwhile she's probably flipping over going we're going down but um and so you came on and uh I just remember it was like I was torn because I I wanted Megan to get the help she need on big run me but I also you know I I love right the believe in the Run side and you were gravitating towards so poor Megan's over here going what are you guys doing I mean yeah I mean I saw like huge potential for it and I was like I feel like if I can I worked a lot and I feel like in the evenings too and I was like if I can justify this making money then I can work I mean the whole goal is like work and running you know like do what like you love and I was like but I felt like I understood like like the like not it wasn't at the time a fruitful Endeavor I remember you and I going on but I also understood if I could just prove that it'll make money yeah but you and I went on meetings with like people who were like Hey how do we make this viable remember that yeah and uh I I remember going through and the guy's like H maybe I should do more on YouTube like yeah and we're like thanks that's helpful yeah um but yeah I don't know it's it's weird but I mean and it was like the groundwork was already there of course cuz you had been doing it and it was and I like I was just like if we can all do this like just figure this out yeah I think this is a thing the best thing that happened to us was the pandemic to the business yeah I mean it forced us to do exactly what you wanted to do the whole time which and it worked out that it was probably good I was like focusing on that like no it definit like the fact that when we were doing stuff like you and I were working on uh believe in the Run yeah I know it wasn't always making you happy B but like I was like oh I've got someone to work on believe in the wrong way yeah yeah but it did like it all worked out it is weird how well and this is what I was talking about even when I had that shitty job and I'm like what's the point of this like it's sometime it is weird how that works where sometimes you don't understand how it can like the Pand like in some ways it's I guess well you really because it's believe in the Run basically saved the pan I mean the pandemic saved it without believe in the run I feel like media because big run media is all the clients dropped off right yeah yeah no they the uh the first grit pretty much saved yeah like the gr that right there was sa believe the run and then yeah I I think there was a few things that fell into place that were the huge I honestly starting to do some of the the work that we did with some of the brands and the stuff because they didn't know what to do during pandemic right so we started doing some of those Instagram live things which really uh we started we started the podcast and even the website where more people started running so then traffic and then somehow we figured out the ad Marketplace for that which helped well the website is certainly like I I am so proud of this work that you've done on the website like the thanks the website and I know that even internally like sometimes we'll have like um adjust a position of how we want to approach something and I think that the more that I've kind of like backed off and let you kind of like figure out some of the stuff without interjecting as much has been beneficial like I think that your the stuff that you've done to uh really take it from being sort of like a hobbyist website to now being like a media website yeah and the work um so just behind the scenes for people listening some of the stuff that that Robbie's done uh for us is like we knew that we need to update the website Robbie had a friend that you were connected with through I think it was through the kids or something uh oh yeah like it was one of Kimmy's best friends yeah yeah so we worked with um work with them to redo the website well was like Kim a friend of Kim's friend sorry but anyways yeah I knew them tangentially and they were Runner which actually I don't even know if I knew they ran at the time but fantastically talented yeah um uh Drexler DX Drexler um in they're based out in Baltimore fantastically talented on the website side but like I think the structure and the like everybody has different strengths in our on our team and I think that your ability to kind of like structure things and look at things from a like skeleton almost like okay here's what we need and why it makes sense on the website especially um you really nailed and worked with the Drexler team and I found myself you know I'm more concerned like I'm a visual person and so always forever I prided ourselves on believeing the r i felt was more was more was better looking than anything else out there mhm but maybe functionally wasn't always right and then you brought that in and kind of like really turned it into what is to something it is interesting because this is it is funny how like I think about this goes for anyone who feels like they're lost in Life or feel like whatever path of taking isn't right because I do think there are people a lot of people more people than like to admit that are um what do you call it like there's a term for but they basically just not job collectors but their path is very indirect so I think a lot of people feel a pressure when they get out of college to be like ah I got to find my purpose and job or even by especially by the time at 30 like this is everything that I felt but then it just takes some people just takes a different route like it was very Jagged route yeah in a way but it's not but it's not even it's everything like the DIY punk band ethic of that grinding it out doing shitty stuff trying to scrape together business or fans that was like I didn't realize how much value that provide it then you just like I said certain jobs dude dealing with waiting table for 10 years I don't give a [ __ ] about YouTube comments like you can any YouTube every once in a while you I mean every once in a while like I'm sure you some but I let it just maybe in the moment but it never sits with me like I just there's you can't if you have someone in your face in person deriding you for not getting their food to them two seconds late or putting uh cold piece of broccoli in your hand and saying like this [ __ ] sucks like dude nothing you can't beat that like no YouTube comments going to and so like that prepares you for stuff like that for the social media side or just people criticisms you just let it roll over because it doesn't matter and then stuff like the like even boat detailing stuff that was kind of like business-minded um well it's just like work ethic too and like like all of those jobs like you said like they're not none of them like was the perfect trajectory to come here but a little pie of all of them is like gives you all the skills but even the web development stuff that was I know how to talk to all the web developers and see like what we need how it looks on mobile how it you know different aspects of that work and so it's just weird how it all comes together um and actually real quick I I just thought of this I didn't want to mention it because I do think this is like an super integral part that I don't talk about too much but I think is was really important and everything was that when I got out of when I got out of the band and I started trying to get a real job and stuff I didn't have any money to my name like for real zero and my wife had some um a little bit of money saved up but we didn't we were renting we didn't make a ton of money and but I had $35,000 in student loan debt which isn't a ton but but you know at the time still a lot like I deferred my payments forever or whatever or made minimum payments and so I was uh financially I decided to we decided to get completely out of debt like just have nothing and so for a couple years straight we just hammered that down till we had no debt and so it just made that like a core aspect of our finan lives so we didn't we've and I understand how you can leverage debt in certain situations whatever whatever and like technically uh you know it's better to put a car loan like if it's you get a 2.7% interest rate whatever but it's just I don't like have any of that hanging over heads besides our mortgage now and so this is that has been such a huge thing for me because not having a $400 a month car payment and I'm not judging anyone who us but just this is my like how it worked for me for Freedom so not yeah so I've always had that like freedom to take risks so if I had so say we were living and our house mortgage is a very low percentage of our overall income so I felt like like being setting myself up setting ourselves up for that where we didn't have that hard like any bills you know and we we were able to save up money so that gives you like a landing pad to take that risk I feel like that was a huge part of it because if I had if we had a ton of debt and a huge mortgage payment and car loans there's no way I would have been able to leave the Coast Guard like because it's not like no I I hear that all the time from people who like there's tons of people who would love to take the risk or jump and do something and they just can't yeah because they boxed themselves in a corner whether it's because they needed to have a car or wanted to have and and it doesn't always have to be like a vanity thing like you know they spend too much on their credit card for clothing it's sometimes it's just it's just life like yeah I I know right now if there's a certain wide foot reviewer that if you probably didn't have student loans would want to be want to be a believe in the run all the time yeah and I and I understand and honestly and sometimes it's just life and it is what it is but I we we worked really really hard and when we first got married at focusing on that and sacrificing a lot I mean like we live pretty minimally and have used cars I mean you guys are you have one car that's like whatever and and I try to I don't I feel like you like I don't buy anything really like we'll go out to eat sometimes but obviously it's nice we get our shoes and running clothes and everything my biggest expenses are maintenance for this place right yeah and and that kind of thing but I felt like that I feel like I always want to say that and mention that because it see it's it's not like I just fell into something like I definitely like set myself up to to try and be able to do things that I love to do or take risks because that's why I was able to go from the Coast Guard which did pay like a a pretty high salary for a government contractor anyways and then be able to say oh okayy look I'm going to jump over here and then do my best to work my way up you know to build that so I can justify having you know bring myself back to where I was which worked out and but I think that's a big deal to know that it's not like I'm just drifting around me like oh like let me just quit my job and just start over here I'm like I set this is like a 10year setup you know like so okay so it's kind of it's it's yeah so to to wrap this up yeah the let's get into uh did you ever think in any job because you I think that your core is that you're a writer that you enjoy yeah writing and did you ever think you'd be able to get a job where you would get paid to go around the world and travel the way that you do yeah I thought when I was in a band which that's it's funny because it's pretty much the same thing that when I was in a band that's what I want to do the only downside is that now I have kids in a family so like I always think if I was single in my 20s this would be the per like like that I say that's the drawback of having a family and then having this in my 40s I'm like why why not in my 20s I would go on every lit like literally every single trip well I think why you K didn't get it in your 20s is we like I feel I almost feel like we you know we've had people here that have been younger M that maybe thought this was normal coming out of school and that's true too yeah and I don't think people understand that like at that young age like really like what what we able to do here the fact that I I I can take an hour and a half out of my day or an hour out of my day we can sit here and talk on microphone about our our path and stuff like that and just have a conversation that normally you would have to reserve for a weekend meet up with friends or or a bar thing that this is part of like what we do yeah like how are you going to appreciate that right and no and that's why coming from where I came from it's like yeah I I mean I know like I actually know what it was like to be broke and poor and even from growing up and like my whole life I mean just growing up and not having we didn't have a lot of stuff growing up we never our cars are always breaking down like it was yeah it was it was tough and then um and then coming to and then the whole time to to the band and then just yeah it's it's been a lot but it's nice to somehow even with believe in the run it was like it almost especially with a band that was so hard and worked so hard and got nothing out of it as far as success from a out perspective I mean I was super valuable and I loved it and I would never take any of it back but the but it almost seems too easy not easy but I'm just glad it it's it's nice that it worked out as opposed to I feel like you have Survivor syndrome yeah I mean like why do I get this now no that's true I do yeah like uh or impostor syndrome or whatever kind of similar um and yeah it's it's definit I anytime that I I know this job can get stressful and I know that we have our days where you know it's not all sunshine and and whatever yeah I just I just try I think back to being stuck at a desk or being in a cubicle or in some of the other jobs I've had and how I felt like I was doing nothing with my life and I had to wake up the next day and do it all over again yeah that's the thing it's like I was talking to uh friend of mine who does retirement planning this morning and cuz I I just wanted him to look over stuff and he they're talking about oh what about when you reach this age you can retire you can quit I'm like dude I'm not going to retire like that's like it's a weird thing to me because I'm just not I never feel like I have to go to work and I'm never GNA even if even if I was in a job I would just I'm always going to find a way to make I like doing stuff do you know what I mean me and I don't think I'm ever well here's the thing I think that most people when they think of retirement they think of that's when I can do the things that I want to do right I think the difference is you are now living in life where you're doing the things you want to do yeah I guess that's true and I feel very lucky about that because I get it I I remember and I remember what it was like dreading Mondays and dude the Sunday for Fridays when it used to Sunday night and it started rolling down you knew you start thinking about your what you had to get down on the work and stuff now it's like I'm like oh jeez I got to write up that that review for this year yeah like oh this is awesome yeah it's crazy and I got to say for anyone else listening so aside from the setting it up financially the other thing was I I feel personally if how I set myself up for this too and not that it was technically intentional but just it's a byproduct is meeting people you have to meet so many people if you really want to set yourself up for Success you have to just meet everyone because everything I mentioned in the last hour whatever we've been doing this all those things were someone remember I knew someone who knew someone in the band who were like oh you want a Bas player I found the water meter job was my friend who worked for me the the boat cleaning was my brother the faster bastards was you the believe in the Rong was you the Coast Guard but do all those jobs everything was I knew somebody who knew somebody but I will tell you like I also think to to say what you're uh to add on to what you're saying people send us emails all the time and if you have no connection to us I don't have a face we don't have any emotional connection to you we don't have any responsibility to your mom your friend or anybody to be kind and and actually see what you're sending you kind of have to find a different hustle angle and I have to say the other day I was getting a FedEx package delivered and the guy was like Hey I see you're a media company can I get a job I was like what do you do and he sent me his stuff and followed up and I'm like ah this is hustle and it is to your point he he's out there meeting people he happens to be doing from a FedEx truck yeah but he had the nuts to be like hey yeah I see that you're doing this are you looking for anybody yeah and I've done that stuff like a lot in life where you just you got to yeah you got to make yourself memorable and and what do you say to someone that's shy and doesn't feel confident going out there and doing that I don't know you just have to do it's just like one of those things and I used to be shy I used to be non-confrontational I used to hate all of that stuff I get it but you don't have to talk to everybody but you should be talking to people in the areas like yeah I mean I don't know you have to go to the extent that I go which is literally everybody making friends on the airplane yeah we're on the airplane and I'm just trying to put on my noise cancelling headphones so I don't have to talk to anybody and Robert is getting a life Story the lady next yeah to him um but that also opens more doors depends what you're looking for but there's I guess I'm not opening doors at this point yeah um I'm closing doors I've met people in all kinds of ways that have led to other things just yeah that have worked out so it's I think that's a huge thing in building connections it's just if you have a bigger Network you have so many more options and not saying and I and I hate networking things like if you go to a networking thing because everyone there is just out to get something I don't mean that that was when I talk about jobs I hated I had a job where they like made you go to network yeah there's nothing worse than a networking event right cuz everyone you're just everyone it's like being in DC everyone there is just to like want it leg up on the next thing yeah and it's I've run into a couple of those in the running industry lately really those dudes that are like uh hey let me get you know they want to exchange car just be cool just like just just be cool just hang out like there's so many ways to do that um and just be I guess just be real but I'd say those are like the most looking back it's like that's definitely the most successful setting yourself up financially as best you can uh I would say living below your means especially because like if you that's the other thing it's like I know no matter what happens I can get a job like because if I if I don't need a lot of stuff if I don't like keep my material cost slow and I can just get a job anywhere and as long as I can cover my rent and stuff like that I I feel like I can make it you know and I understand it's not the especially as you grow up and you have kids you have stuff like this like there are for sure bills and responsibility it might not be the same as when you're 21 but I definitely feel like if you can just do those things set yourself up financially meet people like kind of go out of your way to do that and and then um and just look for ways like the I know that's a stupid thing like the law of attraction or whatever the what's that book the secret secret secret but it is true like I have noticed that and I've never read the book or bought in but if you were essentially focused on a goal or something I don't know how it works I don't know how it happens but the world does come around to make it happen but you have to be all in on it um so believe in the Run yeah what's been your favorite like memory or thing that you've done what's the thing that you're proudest of or just something that like when you think of it you're like this was all worth it [Music] uh that last little tidbit really got him yeah this is all worth it yeah um maybe don't go that far just maybe a highlight from believe in the run a highlight um I mean going to the Olympics was insane yeah that's like just I mean because I remember watching the Olympics when I first started I believe in the no when I first started running I remember watching in Rio I remember watching the Rio Olympics and thinking like how would I ever be at the Olympics you know I think that was was Kip chogi uh kipi was there I think that was also thean that's when gayen Ru got third yeah and Dez did kogi win didn't he win in Rio yeah and so I remember watching that and being and I didn't even know who a lot of them were at the time and and thinking like that was so I mean I remember what was it I remember there was times in the be very beginning when there was other reviewers who would get invited to things like I think there's an A6 event out in the desert or something oh you're talking about that I remember this yeah it was the um Glide ride and it was a red Glide ride they went out to the Salt Flats and they just said hey just start running yeah and like and even just like these little things where I was like like that H like I want that to happen I have no idea how to make that happen but just like going in that direction um this is what I mean like the law of attraction I feel like it's kind of like I always think about Indiana Jones in the Last Crusade when he like there's the bridge he has to step across to get to the Holy Grail room or whatever and it's kind like a leap of faith really but he just walks and thinks like I just got to like go in that direction and when my foot hits it'll land on something and that's how I felt it's always been for a while like in the beginning and then eventually you just like you keep making more steps and then it keeps like the path lays out in front of you in a way and I CU remember I I remember like we were trying to like get deals with like sock Brands and stuff and koros was the first company that ever paid for anything like first brand company they paid for like a Instagram at like post or something it's like a th000 bucks and and anyways I just felt like I know it's not company you're thinking of yeah but I just imagine like there I didn't couldn't imagine how we would ever run Tokyo Marathon or um or even Boston or New York City any of those things or go get in even just talk to someone at TR that's the thing that I think was for me is the having access to the people that are actually working on the shoes yeah that was that that felt like something special to me that I I was able to like find out what they're thinking give them my opinion and have them be interested in in hearing our opinion like that that that was as like big as the travel to me here's the no this is the craziest thing the craziest thing to me is that you can like you can walk around probably now and look at people's shoes that they're wearing and be like something I wrote or talked about when in I know for a fact that things that we said change the way that that shoe is like like there's certain changes to shoes that I know happen because of reviews we've written and that's insane because that's hundreds of thousands of pairs in the world or whatever Millions we're part of the industry in a yeah and that's a pretty I mean that's I just feel like that's that's crazy honestly you should not be taking our advice yeah I also love it when we hear from uh like running retail people who work in the industry and they're like yeah I I look at you guys reviews so that I can like talk intelligently about the shoes that are coming in because they don't get a chance to try all the shoes so they'll pull up our reviews and and and read which blows my mind but they'll come up and tell us that and the other thing I love hearing is that people walk into the store with their phone in their hand with one of our reviews up and be like yeah can I see this shoe and this shoe I'd say and i' I would say the two other the two other favorite things were Chicago was awesome that was super cool Chicago shoe gazers that was really cool and I think the um I this I don't know if this like it was just like the coolest thing was that underground race I did in Venice yeah which I wish you would have done but it was like the coolest thing I've ever done like I think that was cooler than any of the races in a way but I also I mean just in a different way it was amazing just to be in the on the other side of world there's two two ones that you did that I thought think that maybe I should have done but I didn't want to get up that early for that that one that was ridiculous and the other one I didn't want to get up early for which is funny cuz I'm normally way up before you are and I'm a morning Runner but you did the um steps in oh the incline the yeah with Taylor uh in Colorado and I was like yeah maybe I should have done that it would have been cool but you should just do a different time because it was super foggy that day so you couldn't even see anything yeah so and you'll probably go back there it wasn't that but like when I did the escarpment with Taylor and Carl yeah it was it was horrible like the experience was horrible we got up to the top and just knowing that I went through it with Taylor and Carl yeah there was a special feeling like there was a bonding like Carl was so sour but it I felt like it was kind of like a bonding moment because you did you Stripped Away all the like is this real or not like I got everybody was 100% that day yeah that's pretty cool but yeah so I I do get that but uh yeah Carl ran with you in the Venice race that was the what do they call those what's the name of those races um I mean they call it I thought it was like a version of taking the bridge M the Gap M the Gap that's it yeah taking the I get taking the bridge and mind the gap confused makes sense yeah um yeah and that was so much fun and so cool and he basically ran like it was a satisfy ad yeah I mean every it was there all from Milan just decked and dripped out and satisfy and it was deodor kind of loosely with Theodora which was was super cool of them and just the like running in Venice when it's completely empty like a ghost town was just wild which also weird because we were there later in the day and it's packed like shoulder to shoulder almost and then you're there when it's literally you saw maybe 10 to 15 people there the whole course of the race and uh and such a historic place you know like it's just an amazing James Bond Town yeah uh anyway that was awesome and then yeah basically I don't know just like everything it's there's a ton like it's pretty much every runner's dream I mean everything I know we're going can I give a final yeah what are you looking forward to like in 2025 just it with believe in the Run what what what are you looking forward to next I mean I am excited about the dirt the trail Division I think that's super cool and Taylor leading that and I think we might be going back to Tokyo so that's pretty cool I think Tokyo is the coolest place in the world that I've been anyways um yeah just generally like moving forward getting swole oh yeah getting swole for 2025 getting jacked all right my dream is to get stopped by that body by Mark guy you know him on Instagram oh yeah I do he's like he stops you and ask you how you look the way you do you seen it before oh I've only seen one there's like a 50-year-old woman yeah and he's like what do you eat what do you do to she's like I cut out all sugar and alcohol I was like next dude all those people on there that I was talking about this in the gym to the trainer he was like yeah they're all full [ __ ] uh cuz all the people in those videos they're like yeah I eat six raw eggs for breakfast and then uh celery and no carbs and yeah just chicken breast and then sweet potato and some more chicken for dinner like dude that sounds horrible sounds like you're living in The Matrix my trainer is uh one

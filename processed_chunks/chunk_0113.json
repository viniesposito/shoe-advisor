  "text": "over the last few years the aex nov last has really established itself as one of the best daily trainers on the market so much so that this is now one of the most highly anticipated launches of the year last year I found myself recommending the version 4 time and time again for it simple no fuss Approach at a really good price point as well so will aex continue this winning streak with this version 5 or will version 4 be the best one to stick with I managed to buy this very pair at the Valencia Marathon Expo a few days before the official launch event so some good time to put this through its paces and see what it's like and of course I bought this 100% with my own money as we do here with all the shoe reviews on the channel to give you that completely honest unbiased unsponsored review thank you so much to everyone who likes comments and subscribes to the channel and checks out my website benp parks.com you can find awesome running gear running hats and those five star rated training plans right let's get stuck in the review of the aex overl version starting out with all of the differences between this and the outgoing model so with version 5 we now have a new midsole foam this is asx's FF blast Max version 4 was the FF blast plus Eco it's now a little bit softer than the outgoing model and also a little bit of a lighter foam as well aex have also updated the upper to the shoe with this new engineered jackard mesh upper pretty breathable we'll come on to those points later on and also on the bottom of the shoe we've got the same out so material as the outgoing version just an updated pattern an updated placement of those rubber pads on the bottom of the shoe Weight Wise with the shoe pretty much the same as the outgo model some people have got a pair slightly lighter some people slightly heavier when I weighed it it was 2 G heavier but basically exactly the same the stack and the drop again identical and the price they've kept that a really good price point here from aex at 135 so let's move on to all of the facts and figures so the purpose of the novablast version 5 this is your premium daily trainer a shoe that can do all different types of runs at a kind of that 7 to 8 out of 10 not perfect at any but you just go out there with a nice one shoe rotation it will do them all pretty well it's certainly possible to use this for some longer runs as well price-wise this shoe sent me back \u20ac150 because I ought it in Spain but in the UK it's \u00a3135 $140 $240 Australian dollars Canadian dollars is not out in Canada at the time of filming stack code at the back of the SHO 41.5 mm with an 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise as I said pretty much identical 302 G for me in my UK size 11 1/2 on this particular shoe really quite nice and light there in terms of that neutral stability this is a neutral shoe the upper we've got this technical jackard mesh upper midsole the FF blast Max there's no plate in this shoe but it's reasonably stiff and on the outside of the shoe we've got asx's aha low density rubber here which is not great we'll come on to that in the dislikes later on there are no different widths available there are different men's and women's version as well with lots of different colorways we'll put them up on the screen now I can't even remember how many they are but there's quite a lot at official launch let me know what your favorite one is down in the comments and this wasn't true to size for me I did go half a size down the same size I get in the super blast the same size I got in version four of the shoe right let's have a chat about all of them likes and there's quite a few my first like with the shoe is super stable smooth ride it's bouncy and it's cushioned as well it just looks after your legs really well on those long runs a really true versatile do it all daily trainer I really like the rocker at the front of the shoe it just is so smooth through that foot strike it wants you to pick up the pace a little bit but this is happy just cruising along that easy Pace eating up those mares yes the foam is a little bit softer we'll come on to that but it's responsive enough if you want to pick up the pace you are going to be able to my second like the sheer value that this shoe is offering in my opinion this is the best shoe in this price segment \u00a31 135 is really good aset could have definitely put that up by5 or10 and I think people would have still bought it so kudos to them for keeping version 5 at that price point just really well put together shoe really good build quality and yes \u00a325 cheaper than sort of Nike equivalent shoe with the p plus so exceptional value at this price point third like with the shoe Comfort the fit and the lock down is very similar to version four we've got a new lacing system two different types of lacing up the front here we've got a partially gusseted tongue as well that stays in place really nicely that's not moving around at all it certainly feels a little bit wider than the outgoing well it is a little bit wider than the outgoing model but I've had no issues with any heel slipping any hot spots any blisters or anything like that there's really no need to use the lock down lacing but if you want to these laces are more than long enough to do that there's a good amount of breathability in the new upper as well got a good air flow through here as I'm testing this this is the middle of the winter in the UK we're not worried about overheating but if you are in a warmer climate I think you're going to get some good air flow through in this upper and at the back of the shoe the heel just the right amount of softness the right amount of padding that you're going to want in a daily shoe my fourth like with this shoe is the amount of cushion you're getting versus the weight now one of the big popular shoes of the year the super blast people can't believe how light it is for the amount of Stack height the amount of cushioning you're getting in that shoe this is very very similar this is a lot softer than the super blast definitely not a competitor or a placement for the super blast or anything like that but just the amount of cushioning you're getting with a shoe for the weight of the shoe as well is really quite fantastic it is lightweight it also feels lightweight for me a shoe around that 300 grams is what I really like to look for the super blast does that fantastically well this is just a little bit heavier than that but still really nice and light and my fifth like with the shoe it's just the versatility that it offers it's very easy to run in just no fuss at all give me absolutely no issues it just gets on and does the job no matter what's on the plan or what distance you need to go out and do you happily take this from anywhere from a 2 or 3K jog all the way up to 30 40K long run this is going to lock after your legs really well you can use it for some speed sessions some threshold sessions some Park runs of course there's better options out there but if you rock up to the sessions you got this on your feet it's not a bad thing and you just get your run down absolutely fine but as always here on the channel we will talk about those dislikes with the shoe so let's come on to those now the first dislike with the shoe and it really unfortunately carries on I actually think it's a little bit worse even than the version 4 model is the wet weather grip with aex I don't know what's going on with the shoe it's something that everybody knows about surely they know about they've kept the same rubber it's a slightly different pattern on the bottom of the shoe but this is really quite slippy I've taken it out a few times in the evenings around which it's a bit wet a bit of moisture on the floor about 8 9:00 at night and you're just sliding around all over the place I'm not going to be running in this shoe in the wet weather this for me is going to be something I'm only going to use in a nice dry environment hopefully the TR version which is their trail version of the shoe which is normally a really good winter running option will be along soon there's no talk about that at the moment everything's identical the upper the mid sole it's just a different bottom of the shoe and it's a really good winter running option but for me this the grip is just surprisingly bad for how good the rest of the shoe is just another couple of things to have a chat about they're just observations there might be likes they might be disliked I'm not sure which Camp they fit into you let me know how they affect you but the first thing to have a chat about is the foam this is certainly a lot softer than the outgoing model but it's got a good amount of response and a good amount of Bounce in here as well you do get used to it quite quickly so if you enjoyed the slightly firmer ride of version 4 then that's probably going to be one to stick with if you are looking for a little bit more of a softer ride that's going to absorb the impact a little bit better but still give you that responsiveness and that Poppin that bounciness then this is going to be a really welcome upgrade for you my other little observation here is the width with the shoe the fit is going to be a lot better for wider footed Runners it's definitely on the wide side now they're not releasing this as far wear in a wide option but if you have a particularly narrow foot this might be too wide for you and it might be one to avoid so let's move on to my conclusions and final thoughts do I recommend this shoe I really do I've enjoyed putting some early Mars in this shoe yes I probably like the slightly firmer ride of version 4 and I would say if you really like that then go and buy another version 4 but more than happy with the slightly softer ride that this one's giving is it worth the upgrade well probably personally no because I like that's like that slightly fair right but I would still recommend it for the vast majority of people so who should buy the Nova blast version 5 someone looking for a great onoe option this is why this shoe absolutely sings someone doesn't want to spend hundreds of pounds buying a big shoe rotation that's what one shoe without breaking the bank to do it all really well and that's why I've always find myself recommending the Nova blast cuz it just ticks that box so well for me it's the best shoe on the market currently offering that so will I be keeping this shoe well I think 100% yes I don't always want to put the mileage on my super brass 2 and this shoe is just perfect for those shorter those medium type runs it's got enough pop in it for suddenly fanasy picking up the pace doing a bit more of a fart Leck run when I'm out there doing some faster surges this has got me covered so let me know your thoughts on the ASX no last version 5 down in the comments what do you think about it are you getting it are you interested in it have you tried it help out the community and let every know your thoughts we have got the Adidas Evo SL coming in very soon we have some comparison videos with that

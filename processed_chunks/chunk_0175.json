  "text": "[Music] all right hi this is Thomas believe in the run this Robby with believe in the run and this is Megan with believe in the run and I don't know why I'm yelling but that was quite aggressive yells at Clouds this is the last podcast of 2024 really limping into the end here yeah I feel like wheels are coming off everyone's sick everyone's sick I think you know this is like I was been looking forward to this time because we traveled a lot we did a lot of things I was just like we'll get to the holidays we can kind of relax and I think my body is gone and said okay yeah let's get sick let's everything's broken yeah yeah I mean everyone's getting sick around these parts I think it's inevitable when it the weather gets cold I mean actually I think you two got it at the gym I that's why my theory I was going to go with that as well I don't know everyone's that or maybe I don't know my kids also get sick so maybe Robbie brought it in yeah Robbie's the real problem yeah I'm the small poox blanket of Believe In The Run hey Robie before we get started you got a package from tracksmith why don't you rip it open and let's see what's in it oh we're already starting Christmas presents I think I know what's in it I hope I know what's in it it's going to be so good tracksmith came out with this new piece of apparel it's what it is oh yeah it is actually that man yes they're running bibs what size are those dude that does look big looks big no it's a small look I mean they come up to your armpits and you got pockets in the back like a it's like a reverse is it like a reverse that actually is kind of cool basically like the same thing you'd wear if you went skiing or cycling yeah except for no no uh shammy yeah I don't know the pocket I think would be cooler front like a sweatshirt like on the bottom that's what I was trying to figure out do you wear what do you mean on the bottom like your do you wear underwear when with your no I think it's just normal tights like you don't wear anything underneath I don't wear any do you no man okay are you a never nude um but they what's a never nude it's from Arrested Development Tobias fun uh there's dozens of them but so you're going to wear a t-shirt under or a long sleeve or whatever shirt under that and that's it yeah I think I guess so that's kind of weird dude I dare you to run around with not a jacket over the top of that just a long sleeve shirt that's how they model itas I'll do it on Christmas yeah how else you going to model it like you can't show it with a jacket over cuz then you can't see it and if you wore a top over it would just look like normal running tights right so you got to wear underneath Farmer John I I will say I don't know I don't understand the utility of these versus a normal pair of running tights it keeps you warmer allegedly allegedly I mean so does a thicker like or a light jacket yeah but this makes it real challenging if you ever have to go to the bathroom the bathroom putting them on oh dude I wish it had a flap in the back like old uh cartoons where they had the just good the ouse and pull that flap down yeah this is I love tracksmith but this is an unnecessary I don't know what's waiting see what Robbie says maybe it's the new favorite thing yeah we got to test it out dude you should run with no shirt on underneath it's just the bib it's illegal in some countries it look like look like Bor B ass Carl's and Carl now has switched sides he's into it yeah he's going to cut the legs off it'll just be a banana hammock with the straps yeah I like it all right well I'll try it out I did actually run in the Fels turtleneck this past yesterday actually when it was very like 15 degrees and uh it was like I thought it was 20 was it it was in Pennsylvania you were that was a mistake there was actually I just wore that with a light Marino layer over top of that it was it was perfect my question though is like you ran in that mauno shoe that we all like which on my ratings on the you know I'm trying to get more accurate with the rating system for the videos yeah and I felt like I put it almost close to like yellow and I think it's a really good shoe but because of the way that we rate things now um it'll it'll be interesting because everybody likes it you like it me likes it I like it but I was thinking you were in colder temps did it affect the um I didn't I feel like it's such a soft foam that I don't feel like it really did I was a little nervous because the first there was a couple inches of snow on the ground so the first couple miles of it's like a you know where we went running yeah I recognized your Strava map I was like oh that's where we went yeah for Robbie's bachelor party that's not a bachelor party yeah midlife grais bachelor party didn't it feel like a bachelor party Carl it kind of was in a way uh we had like yeah we had Robbie's mom and uh Justine arsing yeah that was it yeah my mom wasn't hanging out the whole time she's she helped with the food but anyways just a little dancing left she still got it she still got it the and my uncle brought his stripper raccoons with it was good yeah the tassels were amazing yeah how do you train a raccoon to do that I don't know you can trust me um but they yeah so there's snow on the ground I was running at first in straight snow I was like this is a horrible idea um and then you got to the gay snow yeah yeah and it was super colorful and all all was good no it was then the crush gravel was showed up and it was fine uh but yeah it was I was wearing those tracksmith ndo tights which are like those without the suspenders yeah pretty much well they're you know how they're almost like a wet suit yeah I get the worst uh chaing grundle CH from those and I just take a whole handful of snow and shove it down with tights no that would make it worse yeah that's not the answer believe it or not it actually helped what all right yeah I don't understand that somebody who's a scientists in our audience maybe can help with this I can wear like the short tights yeah pretty much guaranteed to get grundle chafe uhhuh but I can wear regular tights and pretty much be fine oh weird maybe it's just a certain cut any short typ or is it because the weather that maybe I'm sweating a little more when you're wearing the shorts I don't know that's probably what it is but I there's nothing rubbing there I don't understand what's causing the friction I don't know some sort of yeah maybe there's it's antimatter or something dark matter yeah uh but I I do like it when it's super cold out like today this morning that was too cold for me she just as long as after you get past that first mile me didn't she came back in her skin was red I don't I don't think I was wearing warm enough stuff actually I that's probably why my upper body was fine I was wearing the new rabbit jacket they just sent called warm up and go I think that's what it's called yep sorry rabbit and that sounds about right and it was good so my like upper body was fine but yeah my legs felt like I Les I have to say the rabbit tights I think Traxx makes a great tight but the rabbit pocket tight oh is also one of my favorites for the winter that's actually probably my second favorite especially when it's getting cold yeah is it thicker it's thicker yeah which is funny because they're from California yeah but that is one thing they do really well is it the trail tights I think I I I think they mine are just the pocket tights yeah I don't know I don't know they are though I wear those all the time and trying to think what else was it is sometimes it's hard to dial in those temperatures but when you do is it's it's great I don't know but I nice I will tell you this we've been recommending those car hard gloves yeah and I wore those the other day when it was 20\u00b0 cuz I'm like 20\u00b0 too warm one yeah and when I I stopped to change my music cuz I had like this this new punk rock playlist and I was like not vibing on it so I stopped to change the music had to take the gloves off trying to get them back my hands back in cuz my hands were a little bit like not even that sweaty but just a little bit trying to get them back in yeah was nearly impossible I felt like it was like two things of rubber trying to go past each other it's like I know what you're talking about actually but yeah those are for running yeah it's almost has to be below 10\u00b0 today would have been a good day for it I think yeah I had mittens on and I was still cold well the good news is I think you got a pair now for Christmas okay Thomas can't really good with the with the surprises really can't resist surprise oh man we should have just brought them in for the show this at that point I think they're probably from M's mom um just open Amazon package even better um yeah but otherwise what else has been going on well I wanted to since this is our last show of the Year recap the Year talk about some fun stats hey before we get into that can we talk about a show that we watched uh well we watched another Christmas movie but besides that we watch what Christmas movie red one red one yeah what is red one the one with the rock last night B oh yeah it was I thought it was about a Santa Claus it red one oh it really red one is Santa Claus okay so by the way it also sounds like a Russian spy movie the dude who does those State Farm commercials is like Santa Claus in this okay you looked up his name JK something yeah uh I forgot oh yeah from dude the drumming movie dude is strapped yeah oh really ripped and apparently he started working out when he was like 61 for a movie or something he's he had he like remember he had to like lose a bunch of weight for this role and then he wanted to gain it back so he started this like strength routine oh and he got jacked what was the what was the drumming movie Whiplash yeah and I don't know if I is that good yeah he's like intimidating in that movie okay so it's a great movie he gets jacked and he's playing side by side with the rock so you know look like you got any muscles at all next to the rock is impressive yeah dude's 69 wow man we looked up everything that's cool we know his background the movie on the other hand that was ter it had a lot of Rotten Tomatoes 30% Rotten Tomatoes it earned him yeah I mean hot Froot hot Frosty's been the Talk of the Town is it did you watch it I haven't yet but I heard I heard people talk about it at parties all kinds of stuff oh yeah I think it's so no we haven't out there that it's it's almost so bad it's good yeah kind of thing but yeah I think it helps that that guy is also jacked in the movie yeah so man Jack he's shredded yeah shredded he's shredded jul Julian salad um soy boys are out jacked and shredded is in that is true we also May so I started I go on Prime TV to watch the Beast show oh yeah and that's what I wanted to talk about and uh I I start watching I'm like I actually think me would like this uhhuh so I me was about to go out on a run I was like hey come here check this out cuz I won't watch ion I won't watch this if you like it uhuh I'll wait till we can watch it together Meg was glued to her seat and so we were like all right good I hate how much I I couldn't stop watching it I was like this is so dumb and I was like but I can't stop watching it no it's amazing the psychological game he comes up with is so messed up I was telling Thomas I was like does he have a degree in Psychology like where does this come from I'm sure he has Consultants that are like this is what will happen if you do this because that they so when I I'm Psychology major and throughout College they like they did all these tests after World War II to find out why the German public would go along with like extermination of the Jews and they did all these tests of like obeying authority figures and doing what you're told and we are kind of messed up yeah people yeah but like the the fact that there was such high emotion so early on was crazy well I think when people have that idea that just that seed is planet that you could have $5 million yeah I guess we should tell people who don't know what we're talking about what the premise of the show is so Mr well first of all who's Mr Beast I mean if you don't know who Mr Beast is you probably shouldn't be listening to this yeah but no he's the most he's the biggest YouTuber of all time he has like 300 million subscribers just ridiculous but I don't know I would say probably more kids watch it but teens but at this point I feel like most people know I think I don't know well maybe especially after this show which yeah yeah just started what is it even called Beast games Beast games so he's doing the largest game show in history which has a $5 million grand prize and giving away tons of more money like Millions every day and there's a thousand contestants it starts out with a thousand but it goes down pretty fast yeah so you start weeding out uh the contestants pretty quickly but the games and everything they're ridiculous the the people who like self-identified to drop out that that part was the craziest part for me I think like I yeah that wasn't so interesting to me and I was we were waiting for like the people that sacrific themselves for this whole other team to win like I was expecting Mr Beast to be like yeah here's a or here's a prize and it was just like bye I wonder if they come back later in the show but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't yeah I've only watched the first episode they had to eliminate a thousand I mean it's it starts with a thousand people I doubt those people are coming back the other thing that I thought was crazy is the people that informatically were like I won't take the deal I won't take the deal I won't take the deal and then they take the deal like and you're like you just screwed everybody everyone on your team yeah I mean like people are inherently selfish and terrible people I feel like like that guys falls apart quickly like you said with the whole self survival is there's two parts to it though you feel like when you start cracking you're like if I'm cracking then someone else is going to there somebody else will crack and this is my opportunity CU like right now they ended on the second episode with like a cliffhanger I haven't seen a second one yet I'm waiting to watch with my kids I won't tell you what happens but it's a cliffhanger and it's getting to a point where you know someone's going to fold and it's going to eliminate an entire team of people I mean the worst one for me was was and we can move on after there is a Mr be cuz he he does all these kinds of games on his show at other points but he had two people living together for I think several months and they were in the same room I remember you telling us about this yeah and then at the very end he gave him the chance to steal the other person's money like right when they were leaving the room like they were each going to get $500,000 or something and he was like you have 30 seconds to steal the other person's money I was like dude that's messed up did of them take it they didn't like but you know they would never see each other again they could it's pretty yeah but you got to live with that for the rest of your life I know but and the $500,000 I mean your taxes T be taking with taxes but anyway so it that that is entertaining that was I was looking forward to watching that the thing is that his premises are so simple mhm that you're like why isn't anybody done this but it's the resources he has yeah he built a city well what I love about him is that the whole rock and too he's been H he's just having fun and so he's like if he makes money he puts it back into having more fun that's what I love about him so much is that he he doesn't because he's definitely had a buyout offers from you know networks or companies but he literally just loves what he does and he doesn't do it for the money at all like he just pours everything right back into it which is why it's so successful and he's partly autistic stick I'm pretty sure like I think he's even said that they did they did have problems like my son was telling me that um one of the guys was got in trouble for messaging little boys oh yeah oh yeah I remember that he's not he's no longer on the show that makes sense um I mean but at this point Mr be has got to be worth a ton he's got chocolate brand well just his brand value the day he's got restaurant stuff have you ever looked it up yeah I did I did when we were watching and I forget what it said what I thought with genius is what he did during um Co where he 500 million put his Burgers into other people's oh yeah restaurants yeah no he's he's smarter whoever his team is but anyways uh so yeah that that's been cool and yeah what did I I had too much caffeine yesterday and sometimes I'll wake up that's do you know when you you wake up the middle of night and you can't go back to sleep why did you have so much caffeine I don't know I was just drinking stuff with caffeine in it like all day and night Monster Energy I had a couple these of coffee and then I had some Diet Dr Pepper in the afternoon and that usually in conjunction I don't do well with caffeine Dr Pepper has his caffeine mhm yeah and then so I woke up in the middle of night and I was thinking about you know all this stuff probably that we're doing now and you just start thinking about everything in life yeah that's the ones where I wake up and Mak like why did you get up and I'm like cuz I just knew I was up like yeah there's a certain level of alertness I almost I almost was there and then I was managed to fall back asleep but I I for some reason I think I had this dream about a cat like a kitten type cat kitty cat yeah and and I had this idea in my head that I couldn't let go of which was if if you found the two biggest house cats in the world okay and started what what size are what would you consider the biggest house cat like a large Tom cat like um like this big right or those cats that you like that are like I one of those that look like leopards yeah no these are just I'm talking like they are domesticated type cat talking a big big fat cat like Garfield yeah yeah and you started and you bred them could you eventually well if they're two Tom Cats you can't or what's the Tam cat what's the opposite of a tom cat I think just a female cat a mom cat so if you take those and you would breed them to create bigger Cats Could you ever reach the size of a tiger no over time I mean you could probably get a giant cat yeah like you could manipulate into larger and larger cats but it would probably like have like health issues you know how humans over time have gotten taller yeah so I'm talking about if you did this over centuries could you take a normal house centuries they reproduce a lot faster than us and if you we ours is naturally through selection happen we could artificially select for them and so so it could happen yeah I think you could that's they do that like that's have you heard I just want to see if you could have a house cat that was as big as a tiger they mix uh Buffalo with Buffalo with regular like bows and and steer oh and they got that what is it called like the like a liger it's kind of like that it's a it's a very hearty like big bowl thing bread with bread for skills and Magic yeah okay well anyway sorry that was ridiculous but I I was legitimately thinking about that 4:00 a.m.",

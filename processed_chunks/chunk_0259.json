  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex super Blast [Music] 2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are not necessarily directly comparable shoes because the zoomfly has a plate in the midsole whereas the super blast doesn't but they are both super trainers that are designed to do a wide range of runs they're both very popular shoes and people are quite Keen to see this comparison so so here it is the zoom fly is the cheapest shoe it cost \u00a3155 or $170 the super Blast 2 is \u00a3200 or $200 the zoomfly is a little bit heavier is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super blast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size they both have an 8 mm drop and the stack height on the superlast is a little bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel 37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly is 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the 4ot comes to the design with the Nike you got two layer woven mesh upper with a fair amount of padding around the heel significant internal heel counter as well to add some structure at the back of the shoe you got a duel density midsole the top layer is made from Nike zoomx foam there's a carbon plate running the full length of the shoe in between that it's a fairly flexible plate a little bit more so than on their Racing shoes but still a stiffening agent to add to the midside to add a bit more propulsion and then you have Nike's sr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the shoe there which is little bit less lively than the zoomx foam above it but adds a bit more kind of durability and stability to the shoe got a waffle full out sole coverage at the forefoot and heel big cutout in the middle that shows off the carbon plate in the mids soole and then with the super blast you also have a dual density mids soole but most of it is made from asx's FF turbo plus foam their best foam the bounciest foam the most responsive foam used in shoes like the metas speed Paris racing shoe series and then you have some FF blast Plus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe there as well got a pretty simple engineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of padding at the back bit of structure at the back you nothing too much going on with the upper there and then you've got reasonable outsole coverage there on the bottom you these patches of the ahar plus rubber which is pretty good in terms of grip lots of exposed phone but you know the key areas are covered there not any problems with grip with either [Music] shoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 for both of these Brands that's the size I use across the Nike and aex range and I've had no problems with the fit of either both have enough room around the toes good hold around the heer mid foot they're both pretty comfortable uppers all around I would say know four super trainers that can do very fast running as well as easy running they do have very accommodating uppers that make them comfortable to pull on every single day Nikes are probably a little bit more dialed in around the toes you know it's a slightly more cramped fit I'd say than a super blast but not in a way that was unpleasant at all it just gives it maybe a slightly racier feel at times but overall I was very happy with the fit of both shoes yeah great uppers good comfort and I would stick to your normal running shoe [Music] size onto the run test then and I think these are two excellent shoes two of the shoes I've really enjoyed running in this year the superl 2 more or less just picked up where the super blast one left off in being pretty much the standard Setter for plate free super trainers like it's a pretty unique shoe and one that I don't think any other brands really been able to emulate in terms of that very versatile plate free design whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big upgrade on previous models of the shoe which were heavy clunky not that good and the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's a plated super trainer that can match up to the best in that category including shoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or the H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good competitor for someone like a super blast as well if you don't mind training with the plate so super Blast 2 we had in for testing first did a lot of running when we initially had it in and I actually took it away last week for a trip and just used it for everything you know just walking around all my runs one of those trips where you only have a very small bag on a budget Airline so you have one pair of shoes for everything and it's perfect for that because it is such a versatile shoe it is comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it you know does everything really well it's also quite a nice looking shoe I think in this colorway although some will disagree it's also just amazingly light for its size which really helps you pick up the pace in it so I did like kind of a progression running the shoe while I was away I've done some full sessions in the shoe as well and while it is quite a big shoe something I always noticed because of the way I am quite a high Cadence Runner quite a shuffly runner and a big kind of boatlike design like this sometimes feels a bit big on my foot but if I kind of get over that I can run fast in the shoe without any problems got a lot of response from the foam and you know it does feel good for those fast Paces but really excels I think for kind of cruising around daily runs like progression runs you're moving to kind of steady Paces kind of quick but not fast I guess how I describe those kind of runs where you are moving with a bit of effort but you're not really going for it and long runs in particular just really good shoe for eating up a lot of mileage and just amazingly light for its size like all these super trainers that come out with plates designed very explicitly for fast running things like the Nike and other shoes like that are all heavier than the super loss despite the fact has a higher stack just because that foam is so light and that does really help it be a more versatile shoe the Nike is also a very versatile shoe though and that certainly wasn't the case with previous models of The Zo flight like this is now isue you can go and do fast runs in I've done a couple of hard sessions in it I've gone down the track and done a 10 times one mile session a nasty progression run on the road done a pretty decent steady run again quick but not fast over about 90 minutes where I was running pretty well and you know at the back end of marathon training this was a shoe that I really enjoyed using for all the runs I was doing around that time so pretty good workouts lots of long runs of progression runs and it just felt really good for them like it's an exceptionally comfortable shoe given the speed you have here I would say it starts with the upper which is really nice to slip on and then the underfoot feel is really quite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that you can run very fast in and that's a bit similar to the super blast but I think you have a slightly smaller and more Nimble design with the Nike and although it's know heavier does feel a bit more kind of fast and direct than the super blast because it has a I think a slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker like kind of you know you get pushed off the toes a bit more on the Nike I would say and it just has a slightly smaller design around the heel which has a heel Striker with a high Cadence I do notice if I'm trying to run fast so I tell you like when it comes to you know really allout sessions or trying to hold a fast pace for a long time if you're looking for a stand in racing shoe I think that's where the Nike excels a little bit more than the super blast just because it does have a bit more of a racy feel a faster feel I find it easier to sustain Paces in the Nike than the super blast super blast really for me fits more in the daily trainer mold where you know can do everything and it can go fast but I think it excels more at kind of slightly more relaxed places than the Nike both I would also say are surprisingly stable for such big shoes like they both got pretty wide bases both got designs that you know are not necessarily going to be inherently stable with those big stacks of foam on there but they're welld designed I had no concerns about running in them kind of on any terrain uh and certainly no concerns in terms of pronation or anything like that so I did do a short run wearing both shoes at the same time you actually have a softer feel with the Nike I think it almost feels a little bit more flexible like the superlast is quite renowned for being quite a stiff shoe despite the fact it doesn't have a plate which does help it run fast but I know not everyone loves that for kind of more relaxed Paces like I quite like it for those relaxed Paces that stiffness kind of pushes you through and rolls you on it's not uncomfortable at all but it's surprising actually that even though the Nike has a plate it didn't really feel that much different in terms of stiffness when you comparing these two shoes directly on the run and you get I think a little bit more pop and lift off the toes with the Nike with that plate in there and the way the rocket I think just works a bit better for me rolling me through my foot strike where youve got the quite sharp tapered rocker on the super blast I think that helps a lot in terms of like a big amount of Bounce and if you're a bit more of a loping runner I think you'll probably engage that and enjoy that a bit more than I do but I do think just get yeah a bit more punch off the Nike superlast feels a bit more relaxed it's kind of a strange to both of these shoes actually I would say feel quite similar at a range of Paces like there are some shoes where you really feel that they're a bit more direct and firm and aggressive when you start running quick in them but both of these feel like oh you can run in these at very relax Paces Run them at fast Paces they still feel quite similar which is nice like it's great for a training Sho to be able to do lots of different runs in like that and they always feel quite comfortable and have stability but you can run nice and quick in them as [Music] well so verdict this is a really tough choice I think these are both excellent shoes that do a range of jobs really well they're really versatile shoes they're comfortable I like wearing them both for easy runs and then they do both have Pace you can go and do fast sessions in them and you can even use both as standing Racing shoes especially for longer distances because there is a lot of pace there as well as protection and comfort with all the foam you have Under Foot so when it comes to picking between the two shoes there a few things you could look at to help you on that front I mean one is just simply the price the Nike is cheaper so that's an easy objective win for the Nike and given that both these shoes are quite similar in performance that is quite a big deal you know you could certainly pick up the Nike make a saving and have a really good shoe then the ride field I think you've got a slightly more cruisy feel with the super blast it's a bit better for kind of loping through those easy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a bit more comfortable pulling on for every single day because it doesn't have a plate in there it's got a nice relaxed upper it feels really good at easy paces and you can step up the pace when you want to and the Nike is a bit nimbler bit more punch from the plate if you are looking for more of an explicit fast trainer to add to your rotation I think it does the job a little bit better but it is also very versatile for sure got choice about whether to plate or not to plate like not sure it makes a huge difference in this case myself like certainly there's a nice feeling in running a shoe without a plate and running fast and all that but superlast has got a big old super foam in there it's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a similar way in many ways as having the plate that said I do think it's a bit easier to maintain you know fast Paces over long distances in the Nike so maybe that's a mental thing or maybe that actually is the plate coming into play so if you don't want to use a plate to shoot obviously a super Blaster is an easy winner there so that is something that you know some people want to consider so obviously if you're looking for one shoe to do it all I'd probably get the Nike myself if you're quite keen on racing because I think it's a slightly better racing shoe and it does those easy runs well if you're looking for a shoe to add to rotation just to have with like a carbon plate racing shoe to do to do those really fast workouts in I think the super blast works really well I think that's the Fantastic that's probably the best two shoe rotation out there I think at the moment is to get the super blast for pretty much all your training and then a carbon plate racing shoe for races and the odd really hard session super blast just does that role so well and if you're looking for like a fast trainer to slip in the middle of a rot I think both work pretty much equally well so it's more whether you want the kind of lighter but bigger design of the super blast the slightly punchier kind of plated Nimble design of the zoom fly like again it's really close here so I think I'd really struggle to pick between them I think I'd probably just lean towards the Nike myself I just suits my running style a little bit better just because I have a high Cadence I said I really enjoyed just having the super blast as my only shoe away on a trip it was really nice to put it on every day it's a shoe you can really fall in love with by using over and over again so yeah very hard to call probably the Nike just as it for me especially as it's a little bit cheaper but certainly very case for either shoe both very much stand out of [Music] 2024 that's our comparison of the zoom fly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know what you think in the comments below please like And

  "text": "[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Robbie with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and you're back for a funfilled packed podcast holiday Christmas Hanukkah why is there a c in front of Hanukkah you can spell it two ways why I don't I that to me is they don't do they don't do good branding some people say Hanukkah some people say chanuka they still say Hanukkah but there's a silent sea I I well no like cha chica wait there's oh I just I assumed it was a silent sea Hanah it's probably something like that but that they really they got bad branding which is strange because typically yeah you know yeah we need w foot Jarrett to come on the show and give his Jarrett wife B and give his uh full indepth history it'll take eight days though yeah oh if you're out there getting ready to celebrate Hanukkah you know congrats yeah when does it's probably starting one of these days no I Googled it um it starts on Christmas oh is that like Passover you never know when it starts exactly it's on a different calendar right sorry for being so ignorant about this stuff but you know how it is yeah we we never claim ourselves to be the most educated bunch in the world no but you know that Google released this chip that says that there is actually a Multiverse Oh I thought that you going to say there's a Hanukkah two things a different day two things that blew my mind well multiverses Christmas and anuka that's two different true verses and they have different calendar so I going they should call they should make a holiday called chronica that's probably exists in certain circles I would believe Snoop Dog celebrates Chron Dr Dre and Snoop dogs um yeah but with the multi verse that one blew my mind with this new chip that Google has okay so what do you I don't understand you got to explain a little bit more the chip is existence in itself points at having a Multiverse because the only chip that would do the same work right now that we have would take a trillion years to do it oh I have heard about this so that this chip is actually they're saying has to be accessing multiverses to oh because computational power it almost like breaks the laws of physics or whatever exactly and the other one that blew my mind was this guy was talking about space travel and speed of light and we could get to it would take about I I think he said like it was like some ridiculous short period of time to get to the next closest galaxy uhhuh he said and to get back if you could travel at near the speed of light uhhuh he goes the only problem is you wouldn't be able to tell anybody about because by the time you got back it'd be four million years later on Earth man hold on I'm breaking my head I know I was just thinking about chips the only kind of chips that probably I was thinking more Kettle Kettle Coke or something that's some Kettle Coke chips feel like I'm in a Multiverse depending on the flavor yeah I also think that Megan time travels cuz when she runs a marathon it's about an hour faster than us and by the time we're done that's actually she's already had cocktails yeah there's definitely some time travel going on there yeah Thomas also everything he sees on Instagram now I mean there's no reason not to what what have I been wrong about so this week he sent me a real and it said it was Deep Creek Maryland uhhuh and it was Lake Co no I haven't been to Deep Creek in a while maybe it looks like Lake l in Italy it wasn't you you can't prove where it was no it was 100% from Italy and he sends it to me as if like cuz he's always looking like real estate like places where we could get like a cool like Lake Shore home or some place where we could go to to vacay and so I think the intent was to be like look how great Deep Creek is and I was like possibly it took me 15 seconds to realize that was in fact not Deep Creek oh wow and he was like yeah look at how great this could be look I also spend I don't do like in depth when I'm going through Instagram I scrolling I see something a that's cool send that yeah it's not like I go let me read the entire thing and see the fine print and maybe Lake like Deep Creek is the Lake Como no the person who posted it was trying to make everyone believe that that was deep like I don't know what people are doing on Instagram just posting I've seen these um I've seen these before I don't know if in Instagram by the way Deep Creek is man-made lake in Western Marland okay fun fact there's no natural lakes in Maryland at all yeah there's just reservoirs and I don't know Army projects but the I've seen this though people will post there's a lot of AI Genera stuff and it's like the Grand Canyon of uh Pennsylvania not like not even what it looks like there is this quote unquote Grand Canyon Pennsylvania that's a real thing but is it Grand actually it actually is pretty grand for p by Pennsylvania standards but uh but I'm like what what's the point of this I don't even understand the engagement part of it why do you need why you like what is like what brand deals are they getting from that wait I think that you guys like why do you immediately go to Brand deals well what are what are you doing I think there's all kinds of reasons for these bots on Instagram they build up a giant following then they sell the account to someone you think that's what's going on I think that's one of them I know that they do what they do is they'll try to build up a huge audience quickly yeah and they use all the little techniques and then they go to a business and you can change the name so then you buy it and you look like you have you know 50 to 200,000 followers and you're like boom I was talk did we talk about this on another episode about how I think we did but how if a real goes viral now yeah we talked about that it doesn't get any you said it doesn't necessarily do anything for the account yeah and on that but remember when it actually did like you would if someone had a viral post or real they would end up getting like 50,000 followers from it that I mean I look at like the hakua phen phenomenon yeah that happened this past summer yeah that Arc used to be like you had like six months right of it being funny and let's t-shirts and yeah all sorts of stuff now I really feel like you have like three to four weeks and it's gone yeah and then yeah but she got like a podcast stuff yeah that it was horrible of course I don't already done I think so and then she did a meme coin that she might go to jail for at this point okay do you think that she actually knew what she was doing like do or do you think someone said hey let's do a Bitcoin and probably not or a blockchain coin and I don't think but I don't know if that absolves you from the potential uh whatever violation SEC violations from yeah cashing out on it immediately after it spikes yeah I don't know um it I think I don't know how hard that stuff is to prove I will tell you that Bitcoin man it hit another high it did it yeah I haven't really been paying attention a bit you don't want to if you're not in it you get mad was it 110 like I think it hit like2 or something or that's all right yeah but whatever anyways um yeah for those of you not in the super power computational chips what do you call Quantum Computing yeah Instagram reels and crypto yeah imagine imagine jumping into this running podcast and you're just like what is happening anyone listening to this knows there's minimal running content these days I don't know if anyone there's tons of running content there's definitely has to be a number of people each week who come into this new new yeah thinking it's a running podcast which it is we'll get into that in two hours from now it's it's a like what can we relate it to that something that's like like this um like our universe is running but we're also going to talk about about the other stuff in the universe yeah I don't know like a some sort of barnab and Bailey freak Show it's still a circus they have tigers and lions but then off to the side it would be more like that if Megan had your mustache yeah you should try you should get one I don't think that's how it works I mean I don't I I've been I've known Megan for several years now I think over we're well over 10 years now and uh I've never seen her with a mustache well she digs into Carl's T stash uh creepy Carl creepy Carl oh guys don't make it stick creepy creepy Carl's not creepy he said he was he's a little creepy do you watch his stories um I love his stories yeah like I feel like I'm getting a look like it's like a little window opens up in car Carl's head and you get to see what's going on in there it's all through the lens of a binocular yeah binoculars from if there was apartment word for emo that started with K I would be calling him Kemo Cho I don't think you want to call him that that's not going to work no we need we need a word for emo off The Rocker Carl's been running though yeah I know I heard I heard there's been sighting Sasquatch sightings of Carl out there the grer films yeah yeah so was the Bruder the one who filmed from the null no the guy was on the null the grassy null the grassy null is where they think shots were fired from but the the camera was the one that captured like the Kennedy getting shot right that's the film yeah did you um speaking of which I was watching a thing when Trump was getting assassinate and I don't know if this one's a fake and me says I believe everything on Instagram you just said when Trump was assassinated so I'm thinking that's fake no attempted ass there's a woman sitting right behind him oh gosh who doesn't she doesn't Flinch she doesn't move she like holds up a sign then puts it down and nods and then the fire goes off and she doesn't move and then she just kind of smirks when everything that's going on and it's in the video and I'm like dude yeah I just I just think people react to things differently well yeah I don't know that one I'm starting to think I mean I don't know that the whole thing's insane so I don't I mean yeah I don't trust anything from anyone anyways and talk about surreal they showed a box at like the Army Navy and it was Trump Elon Musk uh like several other guys and you're just like looking in that box you're like there the weirdest group of people it's a weird time yeah I mean if there's any Multiverse we're living we're living in one of them the chip is proving it yeah um before we get off the subject of Christmas and holidays do you have some updates on new movies that we have watched oh okay if you want to hear about them I would like to hear about them you were there uhhuh well kind of um okay Operation Christmas drop oh yeah I've heard of this one before four out of 10 Stars really bad yeah not good not good it was really bad I couldn't tell you any of the actors in it um it was about I don't even really understand the plot and I watch the plot was that they're have to close down the military is making cuts and they want to close down a base and this one base went viral for dropping Christmas presents to um to like Islands out in the Pacific and they where they at bombs this guy this guy is wasting Resources by doing Christmas present drops on these islands and so they send out a rep an attractive rep uhhuh from the mil from the government okay one of the congresswoman's Reps and she goes out there and you make this sound better than it is she meets the guy and he's like debonaire and you know like no he looks like a Kendall like little cocky and so you think oh he's just a a-hole and then no you find out he's got a heart of gold oh okay and that what he's doing is he's helping people and he's doing it all through donations and stuff so it's not wasting the military uh money this sounds like a propaganda film but okay she falls in love with him the congresswoman comes out to spoil Christmas and be like you're close down oh and she gets a Christmas spirit as well and everything is great so it's kind of like uh what accent just happened I think that's my Christmas it's kind of like SpongeBob but instead of Bikini Bottom it's like the bikini at to they're like on top they're on land so Squidward is the uh is the one who wants to ruin Christmas SpongeBob no crusty Krabs wants to cut prices ah okay or expenses they're using too much fresh crab in the Krabby Patty okay this makes more sense now thank you for that's quid where it's like oh go check it out I think that's the accident you were going for yeah whe unintentionally SpongeBob okay that's not bad actually don't do anymore just stop that was perfect I I think the key to doing accents is doing one word and then no one can tell that was I had a friend who did James Bond she could do Bolt the door before you leave or something that might be too long yeah yeah too many words okay two other movies a sudden case of Christmas it had Danny deito in it didn't even finish it it was very boring not sure what happened like he got Co but it was Christmas Co no the parents were getting divorced and they were going to tell her in Italy is in it will will will yeah hold on the parents are getting divorced and then what they went to Italy where her dad lives to tell the daughter that they were getting separated and then she decided she wanted to have one last Christmas together but it was August so they decided to have Christmas in August okay first off the girl likes Greta thornberg so the little child is a big Greta thornberg fan oh like the the climate person yes oh okay sorry that's part of the plot that's she mentioned her in the movie Weir um and then from then on I just was like oh you little brat and she's she's uh she she's going she's going to visit her throwing pain on all the on the paintings the mum basically yeah she's you know that she's decided that she's going to have Christmas CU her parents are splitting up and it's summertime but who cares yeah that's entitlement if I heard it it's like you said the whole whole time I'm like this little brat um and then you can't have Christmas in August you maybe can do it in July because that's like a funny haha thing but August there's no way yeah no and her summer boyfriend that she visits when I hate this no he had a summer girlfriend she winter yeah was a whole thing she was like that was a thing and was like reverse cuffing yeah is that the deal yeah and is that Carl do you know that's true okay cuffing Carl oh he likes that actually that could be a band name that's like um yeah speaking of Christmas trees he just lit up yeah um um anyway yeah that one Danny deito couldn't save it which crazy but Vilma wi dama Wilmer vama that's it he's in it he's the dad added nothing okay yeah he hasn't done he must have just been there for the paycheck or something he was just like okay and then the final the final movie I'm guessing the parents got back together if we had watched it to the end yeah 100% it's a Christmas movie um the final one we saw was called nut crackers and it's a Ben Stiller and it is not at all what I was expecting it's about um four orphaned boys their parents are killed in a car crash and Ben Stiller is the brother of the mom who had the four boys and he's like this businessman that lives in Chicago and they were like in the suburbs of nowhere land no they weren't in the sub they're in the country in the country they're basically feral children so the parents were educating the kids at home their homeschooling these kids they're like homee all the boys have long hair like they all look like Bad News Bears like he shows up to the house and they're like on the roof and like ones in a costume like kind of creepy there's pigs in the house oh yeah oh it actually did sound like your podcast earlier this week I was like I was like that actually sounds pretty cool Min is the trash yeah uh it was it was it was pretty dark humor um it was a nice message at the end but yeah I don't know I didn't get to the end I don't think of that one either okay you fell asleep I don't know did I I think so oh jeez all right so that was Nutcracker nutcrackers yeah oh okay yeah we did watch Home Alone though yeah classic yeah I mean it's I def we watched that last week I think it's the best it's my favorite Christmas movie even the second one isn't a bad sequel like it's it's pretty pretty solid sequel It's the third one that was really bad yeah yeah but we um we finished I pretty much finished the uh Home Alone Lego set oh you did yeah finished it does it do stuff like does it have like little it's honestly incredible traps and stuff like that yeah it's incredible okay like the detail is you should do a little unreal you should do a little real I thought about it it's like going to take me too long but they so they have the the traps that they have are the paint can swinging down the steps I like that they have the they have a little thing that pushes a sled him riding the sled down the steps out the door they have the iron they have uh two levels where you drop the iron down the laundry shoot like that um the does marf get can you spin his head around has a red yeah can yep and uh and then he has in the basement they have that like stove or whatever the wood stove that if lift it up it has a light up brick that glows nice then the they have a Michael Jordan and a like record player that if you turn on a thing it spins both of them is it actually Michael Jordan yeah it's a they don't it doesn't say Bulls it says like bricks but it has 23 yeah and then um they have the treehouse with the zipline very good and did this make you wish you could shrink down to Lego size and play around yeah it's a it's oh and then they have uh inzz room they have shelves that collapse ni if you pull lever it it does it has the spider for that goes on Marv and the like it has a oh sorry yeah but it's not in the aquarium so it has a tarantula um but it's like on the wall near the staircase going up to the attic it's pretty awes like it's the detail is incredible um so I was pretty pleased with that and then you can get like a light up you can get lights for it and it it's not through Lego but third party makes a whole lighting system that you can intricately put into like every room and stuff so I haven't done that yet but I did get it I will say I've never been disappointed with a Lego Product yeah they they know what they're doing it's a good it's good stuff uh speaking of Nutcrackers though I and uh I feel like they've been jawser sizing pretty much since the beginning of time nutcrackers know what's up so are you a a I went to check in on the Jaws are sizing are you still I've been a little laxed lately uh but I keep thinking I got to do it did you listen to that to the episode of search engine that had the talked about the jaw maxing stuff yeah I never knew that that was like a thing in the that people did in uh like other not subreddits or something like I didn't know it was like a trend I didn't know it was J it's crazy but I did it was funny because I was talking to someone who was I talking to he was he he had oh was it was somebody messaged me through Instagram and he was having work done at his house uhuh and the guy that was doing the work was like hey have you ever heard of jazer size and he's like yeah he goes That's my son his son no way the creator of jaer side so he told him about the podcast oh wow that's wild so yeah all right first checkin it's the holiday season so shouldn't we be grateful for something like I don't know what you're grateful for I don't even know I guess I'll just do a random pick for myself that I'm grateful for so in this check-in I'm goingon to say I'm just grateful to be out there running sometimes so like breathing in the air feeling the wind in my hair that's pretty cool all right guys element is still a sponsor of this podcast but for a limited time they're offering their chocolate medley ooh that sounds pretty delicious you

Robbie at the gym two times and our gym is not like and not exercising like demons and stuff like well maybe like spin head spinning around puking actually sometimes I feel like that but it's not like it's not like when I think of a gym normally I think of like a merit or like that one where it's like social and people are walking around talking to each other and this is not that kind of this is more like what I would imagine like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 70s yeah like it's just iron and bars and like racks and stuff like that yeah there's no it's not pretty at all yeah I love it cuz I was thinking about this I like the the setting of a gym that's just kind of bones and work and not I was like if I had this equipment at home I would never do anything but I feel like when you're in a space that lends to that do you think it feels it kind of feels like a car garage like a uh like you would go there to get your car fixed yeah it's yeah it's an old Warehouse kind of space that has if you've ever been to any of our grit parties we've gone or grit parties what else do we do at Mobtown and just party parties Mobtown Mobtown Brewing it's a same building basically just further down and uh so like how many people are in the gym when you're in there uh like four that's it cuz we go a little bit earlier I think later if you're there at 6:00 p.m. or something there's more but yeah it's pretty much just us yeah cu the other people are staff that are usually there so there's maybe four to five people in the gym but Robbie and I were the only two working out thanks yeah maybe one or one other person but then it's nice because they're you can you can just ask them if you have any questions the the owner and the coaches or whatever they're super helpful not just ask them like she was all up on my stuff making sure that I was doing stuff which I was a little nervous because I stopped you had four sessions where you work with like a trainer to make sure you're getting your form right and kind of understanding how the Reps and the stuff work because it's kind of like a philosophy of this three three times five so you're doing at your max weight five reps three times yeah so uh I finished up with my like kind of like Mentor coach MH and then Robbie was still on your last one last night right I was a little nervous like when I okay so I'm going to go back in Monday oh I was taking notes in the notebook to make sure I'm not doing messing anything up because I don't I don't remember anything you know you're doing better like I just was like I don't remember anything and and I went in and it was fine I'm like so what do I do like she's like let me see your notes from last time and I had just like the Reps and the weight mhm and she's like okay here's what you're doing today yeah I was like you were benching like 500 lb and stuff I I didn't bench yesterday okay yeah yesterday was deadlifts we don't need to discuss the weights actual weights on the bars yeah start maybe in a year yeah yeah the uh you go up five basically increments of 5 lbs every time that you're there I do feel like it's only been two weeks or whatever I feel like you can even already notice somewhat of a difference well it's interesting cuz I did you know the squats last night you know and then I was like I had hill repeats this morning I was a little nervous how my legs were going to feel MH I felt great like I I did well when you say you can notice a difference do you mean like in your appearance or in how you feel just how you feel okay that's trust me yeah well right now Robbie's feeling muscles he's never felt before yeah although is nice I'm not really sore like I was that first time but yeah it's it's been pretty cool and they were actually on uh NPR last week on all things considered yeah they did like a 9 Minute segment on them what were they saying um about how they work with older athletes there's like an 86y old woman there who's seems like they interviewed her she's more coherent than I am you have to send me a link to this it's really cuz they kind of fell into Niche where they were working like a couple older athletes started just wanting to not even athletes they just want to build muscle cuz they're losing it you know they're in their 50s or 60s or older and then it just word spread that they're a gym that will help older people stay strong and now it's like the place to go it's like it's like cocoon in the neighborhood yeah yeah so it's going to an old person gym as well it's great I love love it it's like my people yeah well what I did noce I told Megan earlier I said Robbie really does talk to people I go when I was doing my sessions like I lifted the weight I did what the guy told me to do I focused on my form Robbie like I swear the whole time I just he and I was like Wow Robbie's talking to him the whole time yeah telling him stories I didn't know what was going on it's true yeah you got a friends now a lot of good feedback on your podcast I think people really enjoyed your yeah I think so life I was talking to Upper void this morning you know James that we met and he's like I listened to the entire two hours of Robbie's he goes now I know him very well for better for worse yeah it's funny too cuz I was thinking I mean I was just kind of riffing and I forgot that I never even talked about how I got into TR like looking for trash and stuff or any of that I know that seems to be kind of a key part of my life mine's coming up on Monday and I was like I didn't we didn't cover half the stuff that I normally would talk about when it comes to running or or why and all that stuff like or even I didn't get to talk about fireworks that much which I think which was a regret we can have you back on I can put in a good word could be like the the the stuff that didn't make the two hours the 5 Hour sides yeah um when are we recording yours today or tomorrow uh Thursday Thursday okay we have a busy week somehow I'm going to come up with something good oh this should be fun like I'm Cur I'm curious cuz I don't I think I know everything yeah I don't yeah um so I'm interested but the of our childhoods I think Megan has the cleanest I don't know I bet we if we dig in we can find something yeah her dad did yell a lot I mean yeah yeah I mean I feel like you have some interesting stuff for sure but the um I was going to say we should tell people that we're not doing this podcast for the last week of the year which I think would be the new year right the third of January you will not have an episode from us so you'll have one so we are doing one we're just skipping one yeah basically after the New Year the 3rd of January you will not get your normal Friday podcast but you'll have all the Monday podcasts and we'll continue right back on on the 10th of we're doing one next week though like the week of Christmas okay yeah um and then me was like do we wear the sweaters that one or this one I was like you can't you got to Before Christmas after Christmas is like well technically you're recording Before Christmas it doesn't matter you got when the people see you they don't put like the Christmas specials are probably done in the summer but they put them out in Christmas mhm got I think that works I think that analogy works but the like they wouldn't draw Peanuts Christmas the day of Christmas it works me that always scares me when you don't you you did a good job the hard tea on that one but every if I said it people would be like that's a different that's a different uh show yeah you started out with drawing and then yeah I didn't know where you were going with that but no you got it right wait what did you say drawing the peanuts peanuts Christmas special yeah Peanuts Christmas I got you they created it by the way one of our underappreciated musicians of all times is the guy that does the um a soundtrack for that oh um Vince gatei yeah his stuff is gold really is I was we watched so we watched that this week Charlie Brown Charlie Brown's Christmas and I was like yeah this is nice if you can't get emotionally moved when they [Music] go yeah it's like sad but uplifting it well what it is like it makes you appreciate what you have that little crappy tree and Linus on that piano and a robot teacher talking to down to them yeah actually think she talks in that in the Christmas special yeah yeah she probably don't come I do appreciate how they don't let adults talk in any of those things in The Muppets or in it's just all kids that's cool well no The Muppets had adults I thought they also but didn't they talk the same way yeah yeah that's what I mean I like how they they no The Muppets didn't do ww that's what he just asked no The Nanny The Nanny did in uh well in Muppet Babies I think yeah Muppet Babies is that's a little bit different I don't even know what Muppet Babies is that's like being a fan of DuckTales yeah the same similar same time frame it was a short live little bit before Rugrats whatever happened to those duck hunter dudes oh the the Duck Dynasty yeah remember they were real big oh I they might have just I think they got in trouble for being racist feel like there was a canc I don't think it was I don't think it was reac's I think there was a cancel thing though they weren't involved with that whole butter thing that lady that used all the butter in her cooking oh Pauline yeah dude Pauline got in trouble dude if you want to get the Pauline uh corn Castro recipe is real good yeah you need to check that out noted I don't like are you do you cook stuff for Christmas like are you the chef not really sometimes but I was thinking of doing a baked ham for this year we just figured out what part of the pig the ham is because I had to Google it I knew what it was she didn't believe me I didn't I don't I just I don't know I guess I didn't think about it I didn't want to think about it it's like the I should know this from do you know where do you know where the Boston butt is but I was thinking it's the hind quarters it is yeah do you know where the Boston butt is um I mean somewhere in Massachusetts I guess m it's found a pig the Boston I didn't know it called the Boston butt yeah it's probably not where you expect wait so tell me not the butt it's the shoulder oh interesting yeah I don't know why I Googled that and then we looked at a whole pig and now I'm just I like after all those cuts are off that's when they make those grapple so if you yeah so if you went up to someone said I like your Boston butt you be like shoulders talking about your shoulders yeah you'd be like I've been deadlifting I've been uh uh pressing all right I'm going overhead press I don't think you should do that I'm going to start complimenting people that way we should do a t-shirt for Boston next year that's like nice Boston butt yeah okay those will do well so when if you're running Boston you just say to people as you're passing them you're like no your shoulders look good yeah would you like to lick my Boston butt and we could have a little thing of ham there didn't need to go that far well it wouldn't be him cuz ham is put it on a big old lollipop stick and run around with it finest Boston butt yeah all right gy up you don't think we should pitch at the New Balance no I'm Adidas or whoever you pitch it you tell me how it goes maybe the ham Farm reserve of America I feel like people need to yeah expand their minds a little bit to Encompass more more philosophies of thought here I I'm the marketing departments need to really think outside the butt did you want to talk about these spices while we're talking about food oh yeah I mean someone someone that was a good Segway mate that was really nice I just need to get off of that so someone was I think we talked about get off the butt yeah speaking a buto this guy who uh he was at TR they had a stand in the food court oh okay like and he was he had wanted us to does he realize that that one bottle is not going to work um what do you mean one like that I think there's another one actually oh there is yeah is there one for for the other household yeah Oh you mean you can't share anything I cannot actually I actually already opened that I'm sorry I was craving some barbecue sauce did you so there is another bottle I thought I had it but maybe I left it at home what is this even called so it's called slab barbecue it's from Austin and I think it's a decent he sent us some shirts too um slow low and banging since 2006 I like that I like slow low and banging backyard red sauce pour one out yeah and it have a rub and stuff anyways I thought i' give him a shout out cuz he sent us some stuff for Christmas or whatever oh his website is dope bbq.com I like it it's pretty good wow his F he just got like three hits yeah there you go but he's a runner so he he follows our stuff like that's cuz he came up to us in TI when he saw me in the food court meaningless speed hanging out in the food court yeah I was SC scavening the the tables for any leftover treats um and then yeah he he said he was a huge fan of ours so I thought yeah that's excellent I like his marketing we should do we should do a I wish I did have a smoker I don't have a smoker anything I'll tell you what if he'd be willing to come to Baltimore it could be our summer grit that'd be cool our summer grit party food that'd be awesome well I told him um I was like dude you need to partner with Solomon cuz it's slab barbecue I was like you next time with Tes in Austin you definitely need to partner and do a an event like slab slap yeah dud I would love to throw a Solomon s lab maybe if we go back out to Broken uh Arrow this summer yeah we could uh have a uh a barbecue with Solomon and slab right there in the village be perfect yeah a slab slab yeah I like it anyways um that was what was that what were we talking about the butts again probably be done with that part trying to get off it you were talking about how you make you might make ham for Christmas oh right oh you know we'll have I we'll have our our steak and Cake yep we talked about it oh yeah right great that sounds good I we are making we're having some people over this weekend and we're making a oh that's weird yeah she didn't get the it's just people in our uh in our neighborhood you don't live there Carl and I is Carl going no it's like we're doing our Christmas party and then oh it's whatever no Carl didn't get invited I don't need creepy Carl in the in the house Robbie did you did you beat Thomas and playoffs and fantasy did I okay okay I didn't check I'm I'm not trying to be Megs all happy cuz actually I beat Chad big guy Chad lost oh I love D pretty hard to me 147 to 124 I was projected to lose the whole week Meg coming in strong yeah that's pretty cool that's fun for me why is I don't know is it that's not me is that you or is that me is that someone maybe it's my phone coming it's probably your phone or it could be the polyester sweater we're wearing be throwing off some um I didn't realize yours was like three-dimensional I got the most boring one oh I didn't realize mine was either until you just said it yeah mine has like pom poms and stuff hanging off now how is that guy he's become Christmas and he was from one of those claymation Rudolph for those listening we're wearing Christmas sweaters I have Bumble from the original Rudolph like is that just open he's no licensing for him no they have license it's sh it said on their website they had license for this okay yeah I'm getting a Spam risk um dude I'm um I was going to make a Spam joke but then I decided against it the I did beat you by 20 I'm sorry okay how much did you beat me by let's talk about this in the Fantasy Football 20 point 21 points uhuh uh so I had a player that I had Megan help me I didn't I didn't play baitman it had 23 points 23 points and that's why you don't let guest coaches come in and yeah you can do your own lineup next time T it's fine by me I don't care whatever even if you would have swapped him out for another player I still would have won but yeah but it but it's a two- we thing so the points I still don't understand that we have the dumbest P off situation why didn't we just stick with the original one I don't know who made this sry Lindsay did it and I felt like Lindsay wasn't that active she's she's one the more active was she active yeah okay but I don't know I think it was cuz when we were doing Fantasy last year was like so crazy it was the it was towards the time we were doing the Olympics and everything else and it was just I was like I can't be managing this she took it over but maybe next year I'll come back as kamish or just I think we should maybe you you work with her okay and we get back on the Yahoo one cuz the ESPN one I don't think is as good the SPN interface is terrible uh anyways but we'll see see what shakes out so it speaking of Christmas since it is Christmas most people are looking for Christmas gifts for runners yeah what would you what would be your top recommended thing probably should have done this a couple weeks ago but that's all right get it yeah but so what you have you get gift cards yeah okay if you were wishing for something this Christmas that had something to do for running what would it be that I presuming we don't I don't don't have any of this mhm like what's cuz okay here's the other thing people get stuff and they're like crap I didn't get anything I really wanted so now they have maybe a gift card or something and they're like I'll redeem this or I used to like if I didn't get what I wanted for Christmas I I just buy it for myself I know I almost buy everything for myself anyways cuz I I know when the sales are going to be and I know how to say like where to find it and I'm just like I'll just can I just get this also like you don't even think about as an adult now it's like if you need something you just kind of get it yeah like it's rare I actually was able to get Megan two things one of them she probably would have gotten for herself if I just waited long enough mm and the other thing though you know whatever okay but like so what so exciting I you can't give it away though right yeah that's why I can't supposed to be a surprise say anything yeah um okay do you with I'm sure you do cuz your kids are okay you want to answer the question yeah let's answer the question if you were going to get if you're going to recommend one this what you were going to say so hold on that but the one thing for for R running related yeah running related well I'm working on this article I'm almost done hopefully I can get out this week so every really want to I'm I'm working on like why every Runner should just be wearing Marino wool at least in the winter time so anything bass layer type is yeah either the new uh not new either the tracksmith Brighton Bas layer or there's several other brands that be highlighting um I love my sore one sore makes a nice one I wear that this week and I was like that's a really good one but even uh face guy has them obviously smart wool um things like that I think it's the most useful piece of apparel that you can buy and it's a little bit pricier because it's you know made from Marina wool but so if it's a present treat someone treat yourself it's totally worth it though for the value that it gives you that's what iend mine's pretty similar like the bright and base layer like any of those pieces that I use like all winter long oh see I or even like a nice pair of gloves that's where I was going go I I love a a good pair of gloves or mittens is priceless through the winter months all right second check in sticking with that holiday gratefulness I guess the next thing that I'd be grateful for is surrounding myself with a team of people that I love achieving goals with and uh it really makes it great when maybe I don't have the best running performance at a race or something like that but I get to cheer on the people around me and they're having a good day or whatever it is or when I do have a good day I get to share it with a group of people that I really enjoy being around all right guys let's talk about our sponsor Lagoon pillows all right let's do it we've been using them for years now still my favorite pillow ever and now's a great time to gift a pillow do you ever remember sleep without a lagoon pillow under your head I mean when we travel and it's not great yeah I I felt like the last hotel we were at it was almost like someone rolled up some socks and put it in the pillow to give it the stuffing socks and rocks yeah yeah well if you want a really great pillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com slel there is a quiz is right on that page just hit the button fill out your information say what you like what you don't like and it'll populate the perfect pillow for you and if you use the code believe at checkout you can also save and the other thing is I think works all year round is headphones yeah oh I mean if if you don't have a good pair That's essential yeah I think that was the other thing the bo they're price ear but there's the Bose open ears I like the Bose open ears but when I was a at the airport and my earphones died so I went to the like kiosk or whatever and I bought a pair of Bose sport those have been fantastic I mean they're not the open ear one you can hear what's going on around you so I think if you live in the city and stuff they're definitely an advantage to to that but and I also love the open ear ones like if you like music and like when we're running with a group in like the Saturday runs with faster bastards yeah sometimes I find myself with people talking and sometimes I'll find myself in a no man's land where I'm by myself yeah a half a mile into the Run personally yeah the open year ones were great for that because you could hear people and talk to people yeah and then if you wanted to like when you get by yourself you still have music and they actually have good sound unlike the shocks headphones that sounds like you're listening to Tin Can telephone I'm not 100% sure but I think shocks may even come out with one that's like the Bose where it's like the speaker in the year instead of they should instead of that I'm not 100% sure on that but I thought I saw something like that um I would say also yeah the gloves for sure I have what's crazy is my favorite pair of gloves is a SmartWool convertible Mitten but they don't make it anymore which is really strange because it's such a good you can usually find I find a product like that there's a parallel product from somebody else yeah a lot of people do this convertible Mitten which say sky has one that's really good L lemon makes good one too do they yeah I think that's my favorite glove because if you need to keep your do the Mitten part you can do that or you can I'm explaining how convertible Mitten works it's still never as warm as a mitten though like your fingers need to be touching yeah but it's I find it very rare that you need an actual Mitten here's the weird thing though tracksmith has a really nice I didn't like it at first cuz I didn't think is warm enough MH cuz air gets through it but it's a mitten and what I found that because air gets through it it still works like a mitten but it's so breathable that you heat up it's not the um and at first I was like this doesn't work I can feel the wind coming through and my hands are still cold but as you start running right it you get all the benefits of a mitten but it still lets heat out okay interesting so you don't like feel like and I know we recommended before but that the car heart winter Mitten I bought that one cuz the $29 that thing is insane it's unbelievable that that is I reserve that one for like it's got to be super cold 10\u00b0 cold yeah that's the that's the 20 below yeah when it's 20 and Below I'll throw that guy on but the price the value to price is it's I think it's waterproof too and windproof that's a I still I'm always shocked at how cheap that glove is because this equivalent if you bought an arteric glove or something like that you're talking $120 for basically the same thing so my son who's just getting into running he needed now he's got workouts cuz he's you know mandatory workouts so he's like freezing his fingers off cuz he didn't realize that hey you need gloves so he asked me for gloves I gave him an old pair of sakon convertible ones and he's probably not listened to the podcast so I could say when I added into his Christmas presents I just went on Amazon and they had like um I think adidas gloves that were convertible for not that expensive like I'm saying say like under $20 okay yeah um yeah you can definitely find some some deals out there but that's uh the cart heart one's a good one I'm trying to think if there's any others but wait speaking of Adidas you finally got a pair of the evos have you run in them yet I oh what I was going to say I'll put the I'll put shop links in the description for the stuff we're talking about but the Evo SL I haven't run it yet just got it yesterday so I was going to run tonight I think with some of the faster bastards that do work out Tuesday nights so I'm not sure if I'm where do they work out they do at the annex oh really yeah okay so I might do that tonight but I'm not sure if I'm going to wear it I guess I could what for a workout yeah it's fine it's light enough that you'll feel a turnover um it's not it wouldn't be the ideal like if you really wanted to Boogie yeah but it's it's light enough and the foam's good enough that you can do like uptempo stuff if not I'll wear it tomorrow or Thursday for sure I'm excited to see what you think since the rest of us are all like yeah apparently every and not just you guys if feel like I've seen everyone who's bought it pretty much loves it um what are we going to ask that a couple minutes ago um like I feel like I'm super old school and that I like to surprise people or especially like kids or or family or whatever with gifts like that are wrapped and they don't know what they are and I feel like you Thomas like do like that's irrelevant like he'll ask the boys what they want for their birthday and it's not even like a wait he'll like order it in front of them on Amazon oh yeah and like they're fine with it and he's fine with it but I'm like I feel like that's not how it's supposed to be no I have to do that I'm with you okay yeah I mean it maybe for my wife it's a little bit different because I'm just going to be like what exact she's like I want a raincoat or whatever yeah and you're like which one what color do you want which one do you want I'm not sending stuff back just look at CU I was trying to ask her and she's like let me just look like yeah just tell me and I'm going to order it yes and I guess so my look it it it goes back there I didn't really have birthday parties I didn't we didn't have like holidays and stuff like that so like just getting something was exciting was that's it mhm and I'd rather just what do you want I mean know it's it's partially irrational CU like they know like the boys know what's in the things that I'm rapping but I'm still wrapping them there's like no point but I actually I wanted for the for myself I'll give my wife a list of 10 or 10 things and pick something yeah and I try to forget what I even ask for so I'll do like a month in in advance and then and then I'm a little bit surprised I like being surprised a little bit I can't think of anything though that I want like when if Megan was like what do you want the only things I want are ridiculously expensive like a Rolex watch yeah I'm like you could get me an Omega watch or a Rox he sent me a link to a watch it was like $27,000 I was like what am I going to do with this if something happens maybe you come into some money or something yeah that's the first thing I'm sure that's the first priority of business yeah also now like I was talking to somebody at that party and he sent me a link to that camera that was talking about oh gosh now I want that camera Carl you need to you need to make it it's the Leica q34 that's this is not how he described it to me he was like we could really do a lot more if we had this C like he was convincing we're going to have a camera museum by the by 2026 and believe it or the lens on it is supposed to be the most accurate to like what your eye sees and the amount of megapixels and all that stuff makes it so that when you take a photo if you needed to take it from way and you blew it up it's still in good quality it sounds nice yeah and it looks insane it's like a beautiful piece of equipment all right and maybe then uh I can send Taylor out the uh a73 shoot shoes can't we just get a sponsorship with one the camera brand seriously I mean I'd love it if Sony was just like we need Sony DJI and Al Leica those three companies I'll work on it yeah I was uh looking through I don't know you know this cord cases and stuff and I found my go GoPro that I've been missing for like a year I was I was pretty excited about that I don't know why I don't ever use it but I had taken it to Colorado last year and I I just assume I lost it in Colorado I was like oh sweet I found okay here's the problem you know that new charger for the the cororo pace Pro yeah I think I already lost man lost my little n wow I that aming keychain thing yeah and I went to go find it the other day and it wasn't in the keychain thing yeah so the new coros Pace Pro GPS watch it has a colored screen a full AMOLED display and everything else which is nice but it has a new charger another one we always need more Chargers and it's like a little portable piece that plugs into a USBC lightning connector but it has a keychain glove type situation so con case with it and I put that in my backpack and attach the keychain to like my backpack has like a keychain string interesting and I went to grab it the other day and he said creepy Carl got his fingers in there CRA crafty Carl yeah his long fingers just stretched across of Carl yeah I just I'm sorry dude this is the last episode car klepto Carl yes oh chronic Carl klepto Carl just other we're just coming up with more and more so have you have you quit running yet or are you still running with your work with your weightlifting I quit running you said last time you're like H kind of not running CU I'm weightlifting I will admit I didn't do a long run last weekend but I know I I I actually woke up early yesterday morning I ran uh have you signed up for the 50k I saw him out one day he was I didn't see him but Thomas ran right past me today this morning as I was coming around a corner and I yelled at him did you really this morning yeah didn't hear him you didn't see him H wow yeah he was like going straight and I was coming around the corner how was my form yeah looked pretty good all it was a great morning for running today it was oh 50 in the 50s I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt I know I saw you m the coast t-shirt yeah I love that t-shirt they did a nice job with that one yeah I'm actually I was talking to uh upper void this morning cuz they're in China so I had to get up early and get on a call with them and I'm thinking that maybe I'm going to talk to mount Coast but I think that we should do a trail run with faster basts and believe run Club you know how we sometimes do that trail run all together M get a food truck little party in the parking lot and uh try out the new Mount Co shoe and uh for Recovery everybody would try the upper void uh little recovery shoe they got that sounds pretty cool I know and then we could do garments cuz upper void has some really cool clothes they're going to send us some by the way all right I'll talk to you about that later but I really like the style there that sounds like a good idea yeah a little bit of business talk for y'all business um it's party business so you didn't sign up for the 50k hat 50k I did not okay that's definitely on the fence dude you should do it I think you just sign up and then you signed up and you can also it's one of the races that you can get a full refund if you don't do it okay is it and they also have good swag they actually do they're one of the few races the blankets the blanket or the that's oh hat just has hat doesn't do a blanket they'll do like a they have done a blanket they'll do like a Patagonia I think the reason the NCR does the blanket is cuz originally hat did I feel like I have a hat blanket you do it's it's insane that they almost don't sponsor us because I feel like we've probably mentioned them more times than anything else on the podcast yeah I don't think I don't think they're flush with cash they are but I'm just saying they're getting probably the most free promo of any race ever I love I what I've always loved about that race is that it really is just a community race like they just put it together there's there's not like a a bunch of fanfare you come in you grab your number put your stuff at the drop they always have excellent uh food drops like the aid stations are insane yeah uh just like well-manned well stocked the pris the pis the potatoes and the salt the uh there's like licorice bowls out there's e licorice chips there's flat soda sodas of every kind yeah it's really great and if you run in Baltimore you're going to see everybody you know like is either volunteering or running it if you catch a good day where it warms up later chilling on the hillside watching the finishers drinking a beer it's like the best it's like the kickoff the spring you you guys are making me want to run it you know what it's like you can't you it's bad timing for you this year maybe next year it's the weekend after LA Marathon it's a month before London wait so M do you have goals with a Z coming in 2025 do you have mad goals assuming I get my London bib yeah yes assuming you and if you don't you just are giving up on your goals yeah then I'm out then then I'll run have 50k are you running the LA Marathon Marathon no um we're doing a project out there so I'll just be out there okay dude I should run hat then yeah Gear Up for your uh Carl should run it with me as a precursor to your OC yeah which definitely looks like it's happening Carl maybe you should watch some some of the OC just to get even prepared well the OC the show okay yeah yeah just wondering how that was get through that I can get through anything close enough to the name of the race that I feel like yeah OC oh dude the first couple seasons of OC were amazing yeah I watch that whole thing yeah that's good stuff better than Christmas movies one of the best soundtracks to a TV show too remember remember they used to do actual CDs for the show like every season they'd have a fullon CD sound yeah so when you ran hat last time and I came out I don't know if that's the last time you ran it but I don't think you were there when the last time how many times did you run it three okay I think it was your second time yeah yeah that's when you came out with jar came out and I I just remember it was a crappy day it was cold it was windy MH and I was just like I'm so glad I'm not running today yeah that was uh is that the C I don't know yeah it was yeah yeah and I was just like I mean if I run it two more times I'll have 10 hats which might be interesting yeah at that point you might as well open a haberdashery the one thing I will say that I do not like and I think that they should fix is the race used to be shorter than 50k and they use like when they list out the times and like time all time fastest yeah it they have the oh you're right yeah when signever part part of the problem with that is it's the original people who started the race who have those fastest yeah times like it's called a hat because the hinty Anderson Trail race right and it's like all their it's like okay well done yeah it' be like if we started a 5K and then made it a 10K and was like oh yeah you guys will never get close to my and then we just invited ourselves for the first year and then Chang the distance yeah we should do that make our make ourselves legendary that would be great um yeah yeah I oh we will do one episode more before grit starts I mean if it's a month out before London that's possible that's what I mean that's what I did last year and it was I think two weeks before no it was three weeks before Boston last year I did hat and then I did Boston it's not like and it's not like a rate it's it's such a different like you're using such different muscles I feel like it's not yeah but I've always felt like like when I've come off of hat I've always felt stronger in the next run yeah can you imagine if I did a yeah that would be I don't know I'm I'm I'm interested now yeah be good I'm gonna have to reach out to caster and be like what do you think and then Robbie we're gonna have to go run Hills we didn't even talk about the we did a well we didn't do a Beer Mile this past weekend but we spectated Beer Mile for the faster bastards I I would say I hosted somewhat yeah but we didn't run it no yeah I'm I I don't like beer miles to beon watching it is hard enough like everyone's so uncomfortable and we also it was cold it was cold it was very cold I was the bike lead yeah you did a great job trying to clear the path for the and you were you were like moving like they were running fast yeah I think he I think it was uh what was the winning time do you know seven something like there's been there's been faster but I don't know on that it wasn't an official track it was more than a mile too that was the thing it's probably 1.2 miles yeah but also you're like chugging a beer so that's like a 5 minute mile yeah well depending how fast you could CH he was couple guys in the lead were doing it pretty fast yeah well I think we allowed the shotgunning too which I know is frowned upon but there we had one well no only one guy shotgun it yeah and I told him he couldn't do it after the second one Robbie laying down the law but uh I got he's like can I can I shotgun I was like yeah whatever no you can't uh well someone else said it to him the guy who was in second was like dude you can't shotgun I was like he's actually right you're not allowed to yeah I don't know I always forget their name because I don't I'm not that familiar with a lot of the new people the thing is though that for me it's like we're not an official group that wasn't an official track if you want a shotgun any way that you can get that beard that's a good point I'm like like it's faster bastards it's not I should have allowed it all rule breaking is yeah it's like dude like if you ran in actual jeans I would love it yeah are you supposed to running jeans for the Beer Mile no that's a jean mile blue jean M but if you combine the two okay imagine that yeah that'd be a good one we did do the gene mile a few years ago MH all right I'm going to tell you this this morning I went out for my run and I think this should be a challenge I got off the phone and I needed to get the run in before we got I had to go check out the Press by the way went and looked at the and picked out the thread for the sweatshirts to see the test print for the winter gr win grit sweatshirts yeah they're going to look nice um so I had to do that all before coming in here so when I got off the call I like try to be as quick as possible to get out the door to get my run in and I had hill repeats uhhuh but I forgot to go to the bathroom before I left the house which one number one or number two oh snap yeah dude so I was carrying that with me the entire Hill repeat session and you know I'm trying to Boogie and my hill repeats I have to say I was pretty proud they were like 520 519 530 you know like in so I was I was moving as fast as I pretty much can okay and then immediately like did my cool down two miles and got into that house as fast as possible yeah dude that you should that should there should be a great adjusted pace for having Dro a deuce on Strava should be like what they should have that as an option like just click a checkbox during your activity did I have did I not go to the bathroom before yes okay that could 10 seconds perile good but it's also I think as a challenge it is challenging that's the worst it's just a bad idea like think of the consequences yeah no I don't want to yeah I don't know how yeah usually my body for some reason just what shoe did you do your Hill I use oh you know what I went back to an old familiar friend I did the SE Elite V4 why did you choose that I like that pretty blue color I know it's really pretty like a teal color I was like looking at my rack today and I was like I want something that has a little pep to it and I was like uh and I saw that teal blue and white and I was like oh that looks pretty so I just grabbed that nice that's a good yeah it's a good color we and you know what's weird that felt really soft to me but now compared to the saky um endorphin endorphin Elite yeah that thing is I think the reason I didn't love the SC like I really do like the SE Elite for a lot like I loved wearing it in New York but I feel like it just doesn't feel like that light race day vibe no the platform's wide yeah it's a little bit on the heavier side I think it's great if for that like if I was going to say I was going to go out for a marathon at 100% effort it's not the one that I would probably pick but if I'm going for anything below 100% 80% yeah then solid it's such a great shoe because it's so comfy all right final checkin something to be grateful for obviously it's you uh we're so grateful that you tune in and listen to this podcast we really appreciate it so many the things that we do we want to bring that you along on the experience and hopefully see you at some of these things so the fact that you're tuning in and listening and you know playing with us while we give you this nonsense we really appreciate it and a big heartfelt thank you from everybody here at the believe in run team but uh yeah the the idea of like and and then you know every time I wear it now though I think a Chris Chavez going his first sub three in it oh so like for some people it will work I mean the shoe's not going to make your race it's just what you're comfortable and confident yeah but that was his first sub three like he threw down in Houston which he's coming up on his year anniversary wow when do you think okay so like when you claim PRS MH I I kind of think I have an alltime PR and then I have a relatively close PR uhhuh what do you think the time frame for like like when does your PR expire or just like yeah like you're kind of like I because I feel like you certainly deserve your alltime PR yeah but there's also like in the last five or six marathons where's where are you yeah it should be you're saying like age adjusted almost but see here's the weird thing is I even think so one of my fastest marathons in recent times was the 325 I ran at NCR uhhuh and that to me feels like yesterday and I just realized that that's three is it is it I think it's four or five yeah I think it was 2017 wasn't it hold on wait really no was it pre-co or postco it was preco so it had to be 2019 then I think it's 2019 well it's at the end of the year yeah so I think it might have been December 2017 no cuz I remember that and I don't even think I really cared about you it 2021 oh it was 2021 yeah well that's recent enough I'll take that damn dude I'll take that sense of time I lost you might be time traveling right now as we speak dude that loss of time for Co has really thrown me off 2021 so that's three years three years I'll take that I thought it was only three years ago that feels like 10 years ago all right yeah it does feel like a long time ago so I'll take I I'll take 325 that counts close enough for close enough yeah but I do I'm worried now like I'm like I don't know if I have that in me anymore like I I am that's why you're going to the gym and building muscles you might get it back maybe um but like this weekend C Caster was like Hey Run for the 10 miles that you're going to do and like 8 to 7:30 pace and I'm like can I like are you sure about that yeah you sure about that uh speaking of the weight lifting and or I don't know what you're speaking of but did you see that Nick bear got hit by a car in this past week was he able to stop the car and lift it over his head close what what happened he cuz he did record a video saying how he got hit by a car he was running by his house and I guess he has this stretch where of a mile road where he has to get to the dirt roads where nobody is on but it's like a 55 mph Road I think it has a shoulder but it's still yeah and it was dark and he said he has he had a Garmin that has a flashlight on it but I don't think he wore any headlamps or lights or anything and he there's this one part where you have to cross over and get and he crossed over and there was a right turn lane and a normal drive lane and I guess a car came up on him in the right turn lane and an SUV and go going pretty fast and clipped him and next thing you knew he was in the left lane somehow like on the ground somehow it's cuz it got hit by a car no but he was on the right lane the right side of the car clipped him I think or maybe that's crazy and maybe it wasn't the right side but yeah it was he said it was a passenger side of the car so that clipped him and he handed up in the other lane broke the like broke the mirror off dent in the door he had tire rubber in his leg like destroyed his elbow and arms like was all busted up I mean he's lucky he's alive nothing broken I don't know I didn't uh I didn't know if he said it was broken or not but I mean dude you get hit by an SUV at any speed you're lucky to be alive so this weekend I had to do uh my run out in the county mhm uh Theo had practice so I'm running basically backwards on the Charles Street 12 course so like running back towards kennworth yeah and this cars are flying yeah down that hill and stuff as I'm going up the hill I'm like and they cut in like cuz it's kind of like Cur curvy they'll cut in and there was a couple times where I was like if one of these cars hits me I'm like splattered like there's nothing going to be left for sure and there was like this one truck it was looking the other direction like to emerge into the other lane oh yeah and he swerved into like the shoulder where I'm running right and I was just like and he was going probably 50 m hour and I'm just it's like all right this is getting a little freaky yeah I mean honestly I feel like that's why it's just safer to run in the city as much as there's I think so still crazy drivers intersections you have much better chance of surviving a 20 m per hour but I also think that people in the city are looking for people I think when you're out in the county they're not expecting people to be although I know you bust my nuts for wearing a headlamp when it's dark out but I don't I a I'm trying to not to roll my ankle but B it's like I have noticed many times where cars like stop cuz they actually like what the hell like they see me which I mean there's plenty of places in where it's dark enough at inter you know how we just got a headlamp yeah do I need to plug that in or something I think does it have a battery or does it have like a charge it does have a battery uh I haven't looked at the charging I guessing it's a USBC or a cuz it didn't come with like a cord or anything it just came in like a I feel like things don't come with cords anymore I well probably if it's all USBC you don't need an extra one but so we got we opened up and we I'll put together a re for it soon of a unboxing of a Nike cortex Pegasus and in that package from them one there's Lube or something but I didn't I didn't use that I just left that for Carl yeah we we put it in his box yeah that he keeps by his desk yeah crafting Carl the um and then there was a headlamp yoink and took that but it was just loose in the bag yeah it's a black diamond I think it's Astro which might be new headlamp cuz the Black Diamond Sprint is probably my favorite head lamp of all time cuz it's just a nice little portable doesn't not intrusive are we Bing you m no sorry put in your pocket she's definitely bored um are you loves headlamps you know what that's actually I do love headlamps it's like one of my weird interests but the I was that was another that's another good Christmas gift cuz it's like 25 bucks or something the Black Diamond Sprint it's such a great headlamp um and they sent essentially a version of that but yeah I think you have to charge it either with the USBC or micro USB okay so it's not a removable battery no that's definitely rechargeable I love it when the brands send like a little extra yeah it's nice to get a little little something and the metal case it came in Carl's going to use for uh keeping that the shoes came in yeah the brands do love sending uh shoes that are locked up with a code weird boxes it's an interesting uh I they need to do something like like put it behind the Constitution make us do a little Nicholas Cage action I like that yeah like it's actually someone broke into the yawning now yeah it's contagious when you do that yeah do you think we should talk about wait wait let's let's talk about both Robbie brought in his endorphin uh trainer trainer which I have to say well I'll let you go first Robbie talk about it uh yeah so I mean this is basically the replacement for the kvar pro endorphin shift I think it covers both the bases yeah uh which if you didn't read our review I thought the kar Pro was not a great idea yeah I think the kar Pro I rolled my ankle severely in the first 100 feet of it out the door um and I did I think I wore it a couple other times but felt it was a little dense right in the midsole yeah I didn't see a point to it and I hate to tell you but so the newest version has it's actually very similar but it just has a top layer of incred run foam that stuff squishy super squishy yeah yeah it's in can I pet yourg it's in the uh it's in the new endorphin series basically Elite is it in the speed no Elite has power run HG does he no we have in cred run it's in crun it's all in cred run that's why it's so squishy and guess what it is incredible yeah so this has that foam which is I'm just going to mention it's the worst name for a foam every time I mention it uh then what's on the bottom it sounds like a Sketcher name but then the the bottom is just a normal Power run foam oh which is a rubberized Eva yeah so you don't necessarily need I mean rubber on the outside if there's any contrast night and day contrast I mean squish the two see this is I the sometimes this works but I feel like rarely it works where you have this nice layer of race day foam under the foot and then you ruin it when you put a giant slab of there's there's two shoes that I would disagree with you on that M I'm going to say the Nike as zoomfly 6 did a really nice job of combining but I think that's the the amount and I'm also going to throw the vomo in there the Vero but also that's I feel like react is a little bit softer yeah way softer well would don't you say also the Hoka Hoka Mack X too and cuz that's also the top top lay dual layer yeah the mocha the mocha the Hoka max2 the mocha this doesn't should I mean I didn't wear this shoe I wasn't seated it but this foam and my hands does not feel great for me initial run in the shoe first off the upper is great I thought the upper is really nice it's just like on the ride pretty much and then I felt like the initial step in I was like oh you really can feel the incred run this is going to be a nice switch up but then as I ran in it it just felt like a normal daily trainer and for a shoe that has in credit run a plate and a power run underneath I'm like you're making this really complicated shoe that could just be yeah done better like I feel like the ride is a better version of this shoe yeah I mean it's a softer feel than the cavar pro because of that top layer but it just it even feels a little bit clunky just not harsh it's just I don't know like would you say it's just like a normal Eva daily trainer yeah with all that work and all that stuff put into that that should feel like something else and I know it's a rubberized Eva midsole but there's really no rubber on the out soole right we're talking this little patch here and here and I think it works okay though you don't think so I felt the grip was fine I mean I guess I didn't run in in the rain at all but I don't know I I I I thought the fit was a little big but similar to the just maybe I needed to get a different size but I didn't think it was that I thought it was a little bit roomy I put in my miles and and I never will wear that shoe again that's how you know it's good uh I think Ryan said the same thing or other assistant editor Ryan I think he has a pair okay and I think he said the same thing he's just like yeah it's not I just don't know about the shoe like I don't know why they're trying to make it work but I I think they want a daily trainer in the endorphins series they have one they just don't realize that's what I was going to say it's the speed it's like why are you fighting it just let it be yeah I it's a little confusing it's basically the same way I felt about the kar Pro not much has changed U but then you ran in the Muno Neo Zen yes so this is a surprisingly good one I really like this one I put I I put in a lot of miles right in a row in it so I did kind of eventually come to a different conclusion oh but but I had to go down a half size so when I first got it the upper was too big and I contacted a friend Justine who you know is Alex's wife uh who works at Muno and I was like hey I like it but I think I like the feeling of the foam but I think the shoe runs a half size Tu big and she agreed with me so I asked and requested to get another pair um in a half size down so a size 10 uhhuh fits perfect yeah I have same thing happen with me so I have another pair on the way okay it may you've run in it I kept my normal size I thought it was fine but I prefer to have a roomier toe box if anything so maybe that's just a personal thing so I guess I want to wait until you get your pair and they're also apparently sending us this is the mystery version they're sending us the actual colorway yeah yeah they've shrouded the whole thing and mystery of odd mystery that's yeah I won't go into relas so the the foam itself though this nerz next NXT uhhuh do you like that foam name yeah it's better than incred I Robbie to come up with a foam name I mean give me 10 minutes and I could beat any of these companies branding name I love fresh foam I think uhh no fresh foam's actually fuel cell is a good one I like that one and I like uh I'm uh zoomx I'm okay with yeah flight flam has way too many iterations I don't like flight foam plus it's a hard to say flight foam is hard to say and it's really hard to say flight foam flight flight foam blast plus flippy floppy anyway so this one you come to this midsole this is a gooey midsole so it's basically it feels similar to the mauno uh Neo Neo Vista but there's no plate so it's a lot gooier mhm I would the closest thing I would compare it to is probably the evos SL from Adidas with the light Pro wow okay so it kind of has that soft give when I said the things kind of changed I love it like when I first tried this I was like this is a phenomenal shoe wow and once I got the fit right and the second run I was also but I was doing some my longer runs in it and I felt like maybe it's a little too soft okay and people always criticize us for liking really soft shoes so if I'm saying it's a little too soft maybe Ian soft in the way that the um Neo Vista is yeah it gives like I'm not sure something in my the only thing I will disagree with you is I feel like the Neo Vista felt more narrow to me whereas this platform feels wider so I feel like you get more of that stable ride with the squish so it feels better to me okay and it could have just been look last week I was he kept ramping up my miles M and I had two 10 Mile runs in a row and you know maybe I was just like tired and so the soft felt like non fast yeah I got you and also like I'm not sure there's like on my foot as like the front of my foot started hurting and I'm wondering if it's because I was like spreading as like it collapsed yeah and spreading my foot but it that could just be me but honestly the the shoe feels amazing 150 bucks which is a really nice price point there you go so I do think I do think overall I would still highly highly rate this shoe yeah um I don't know that it' be the only shoe I'd want my rotation because of the softness I think I'd want like to have something that felt little easier to pick up the pace weight feels light I haven't weighted though let me see and this shoe's out now so if people want to get it they 150 for this shoe seems like a steal like I definitely it does like it the upper feels like a premium quality shoe all right yeah it weighs 8.8 o for my size 10 so I went down a half size so if you're 10 and a half you would go down to a 10 8.8 o I know some of you love the gram so here we go oh do you know what my goal is for 2025 to learn the conversion of gr yeah like and be able to miles to cams do it in my head oh why don't you go full uh metric European okay you want to know how many Grand I don't know if I'm willing to give give up that much American in my life but um don't look oh I was not paying it I was looking Without You processing what you were saying so I can already kind of see 8.8 ounces is how many grams go I don't know I haven't done 249 yeah so 249 gram well I know that 10 I think 10 oz is 200 uh 284 I think okay that's right so that's where I'm starting out at that's a good starting so we talk about knit uppers and uh when they work and they don't work getting this in the right size really made a big difference uh for me I did find it's a little tough sometimes to find the right tension on the laces and this has that ribbon lacing mhm which I don't I didn't love the laces that was the other thing I hated about the Endorphin trainer was the laces yeah I don't know what it is with sock and laces though like I'm running in the ride and it's got that yarney stretchy lace and I just I I hate and it curls weird the wor I'm like what are you guys doing just put in I think if if this was my shoe that I like we review so many shoes that we'll switch out but I think if I purchased a shoe and I was going to go for it I'd probably try to put the saw tooth laces in this yeah that'd be good that'd be a good move yeah but overall I really liked it Megan likes it all right cool I I'm hoping Robbie likes I think we should probably wait to do the full review until I'll probably like it you try and Carl uh got Carl he's taking the 10 and a halfs I have have you tried it on fits me fine oh so he's at 10 and a half and he says it fits him fine oh maybe you maybe you are your feet are shrinking like mine Thomas they could be I do get them wet quite often oh yeah raisin raisin On The Run yeah so my this is definitely one that we're going to yeah Raisin in the Sun pretty good one I got it yeah I got it take credit for that one all right that'll be oh biography it's about that time anyway this's definitely a shoe that we're going to have to put in contention for uh like I feel when we get shoes this early in the year for well this one's available this year so is it's still 2024 so do we call this a 2025 shoe or a 2024 shoe it is no anything that comes out in the second half of December I think is we just kick that over wait it does it does come out this year it's already out get it right now but it came out like the 13th yeah I still think it I think that was the idea that's what we decided know you know when we're doing our round at the end of next year there's going to be so many other shoes but that's why I'm saying we got to we got to start charting but we can't like we had we put out our any any normal we had to put out our list in November so it's like anything that comes after that yeah yeah I think that's how we do it we just a bad move though for Brands they're going to get lost it is the worst time to come out with a because we're going to get to the end of the year and be like what sh do we like we'll be like oh the one that came out last month yeah yeah you know but we should recency bias I'm putting this in the eosl all right on my 225 list of shoes to consider well and we usually try to do a list halfway through the year anyways I want to do one halfway through and then one at the end I don't want to give other people ideas but I have an idea of how we should make this shoe relevant okay so make a list all right we'll talk all right uh anything else I don't know Merry Christmas Happy Hanukkah yeah all the things I hope you got what you wished for is is the thing that you want most in life is it an object or is it a goal or uh feeling wow what dropping that at the end like yeah we're ending the podcast like happiness do I want happiness most in life I mean happiness is vague thing I want most in life I mean I feel like I have most of it I don't think I need anything else really What About Love um yeah but I mean I don't know if that I'm lacking in any of those departments you can't take more I'm good what's happening I got enough dude it's there's the the reservoir is filled probably want less love okay yeah let's let's this podcast is over yeah I mean if more barbecue sauce is never I need a a bar a smoker that's what I need there we go mexic life oh my God if Robbie has a smoker and then he's going to get a dehydrator we're going to have jerky and smoke I'll be hunting de start making cured meats yeah I would be okay with that you know you and Rob James should get together because you guys could start like a little barbecue thing he used to smoke right off his back porch right yeah few doors down for me yeah I just feel like I don't need another hobby that's the thing I just get into another thing and then it's another time suck yeah I'm like I can buy barbecue yeah yeah somay though all right m is there anybody important you got to say goodbye to hi Ma or hi do you say hi Ma or goodbye ma hi you know what yeah one more thing the one thing I would actually at some point I need a cabin on a Creek in a in the mountains see Lake KO or Deep Creek Como Creek yeah that's where that's the goal Como Carl yeah um so anyways that's uh uh that's that's my thing that's our own all right someday all right we'll be picking in a grinning on your porch yeah as people go out to do a

  "text": "when it comes to running shoes softness is a deceptively complex feature and previously Brooks's take on softness for me personally always felt uncomfortably firm but this is the new glycerin Max with its new foam and bold design will this be the max cushion Brooks that I've always been wanting it's time to lace up the glycerin Max and take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm a non Elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the allnew Brooks Glycerin Max but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that Fleet Feet sent to me for the purpose of review so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the Brooks Glycerin Max and let's start with the specs this is a tall shoe 45 mm of total stack height in the heel with a 6 mm drop giving you 39 mm of Stack height in the 4 foot and the main story for this shoe at least for me is that they're using an all new foam in this shoe Brooks calls this foam DNA tuned it's a Nitro based foam which means they're using nitrogen gas is part of the manufacturing process and it's kind of a two foam system in a way it seems to me like it's all kind of like one piece of foam but there are two different size cells that they're using in the foam itself and by cells there're using little beads of material Source material compressing it and heating it up to a very high level and then injecting the gas in it and that makes bubbles and then they're using larger cells or larger bubbles in the heel of the shoe and then smaller bubbles in the forefoot and Brooks tells me that the reason for that is that the larger cell foam gives them more cushiness more softness and then the smaller cell foam is more tightly compressed and packed together and so that's going to give you a little bit more sense of Bounce and I think there's two main things that are notable about this one is that I'm excited when ever Brooks experiments with new Foams they're notoriously a little bit reluctant or conservative when it comes to experimenting with their shoes especially for a storyed line from Brooks like the glycerin and that's why I think there's this glycerin Max which is an offshoot that lets them play around a little bit more but the other thing that's notable about this is that it switches the Paradigm that Brooks typically uses in their shoes so like at least in older shoes like the shoes that I first started testing in Brooks which would have been like the Brooks ghost 10 several years years ago they flipped it around where the firmer foam was in the heel and the softer foam was in the forefoot and the idea being when you come crashing down on that heel they needed that part of the shoe to be firmer so they could better absorb the full force of your foot and body hitting the ground and then inevitably because of that 12 mm drop when your foot slapped down you needed to have a soft material to absorb the impact from that Heel To Toe slapping that a 12 mm drop can create for some people like it did for me now it's reversed where the softer foam is in the heel so you have a softer Landing if you are a heel Striker and then as you're rolling forward you're bouncing and pushing off of a more responsive foam and that whole motion is aided by what Brooks calls its Glide roll rocker geometry in other words the front of the shoe is carved a little bit so that way it helps you roll forward and this large stack height is a little bit easier for your foot to manage now to protect all this fo Brooks has put a bunch of rubber on the outsole it's not full coverage rubber outsole so we're not looking at some of those old Brooks ghost 10 uh there is some exposed foam in here to help shed weight and make it easier for this foam to bend and squish uh but also there is plenty of rubber where there is rubber on the shoe so not only do I think that this foam based on the way they've made it is going to last a long time I think this rubber is also going to give you plenty of grip for a long time as well moving to the upper I think that the design on this shoe is fantastic and the upper is very comfortable as Brooks uppers always tend to be we're using a pretty standard material for a Brooks shoe in the upper here uh the tongue I think is pulled straight from uh Brooks ghost uh and there is a decent amount of padding in the back of the heel and into this Achilles flare a little bit more padding than I would have liked to have seen uh and there's also a lot of structure in this heel cup again more than I would have liked to have seen but something that's pretty common for shoes in this category of Max cushion shoe and overall I do really like the design I also really enjoy this Brooks logo that they put on the side of this shoe it's over the top and it definitely adds unnecessary weight but I do think it overall adds to the aesthetic that makes this probably the best looking Brooks shoe that I've ever seen now Brooks tells me that this shoe comes in at a weight of 10.5 o for their reference size but I am reference size and my size n that Brook sent to me came in a little bit heavier coming in at 10.8 Oz or 308 G now that we've talked about what the shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on foot and I got to say the Brooks Glycerin Max is the max cushion shoe from Brooks that I've always been waiting for I love the amount of cushion and softness that I'm feeling in this shoe I'm feeling absolutely pampered every time I put my foot into it the softness here is what I think softness should be every time my foot hits the ground I feel like I'm compressing the foam really nicely it's absorbing the impact of my foot strike and then I'm rolling through with that gly roll rocker geometry and then the foam is decompressing and giving me a nice pleasant amount of Pop as I head into the next step I feel like it's a very modern shoe and a very comfortable shoe I feel like they're using technology to the runner's benefit in it it's comfortable it's going to be great on feet for a long period of time whether you're running a recovery run or looking to set a longdistance PR this is a very comfortable shoe to be in it's also looks great and very comfortable for all day casual wear the one thing that I wouldn't do in this shoe is take it for workouts it is a heavy shoe with my size 9 weighing in over 300 G and over 10 o by a hefty margin uh you can do things like uh strides where you're picking up the pace for a very short bursts of time and the actual speed really isn't the point of strides but anything that's longer than strides in terms of picking up the pace workouts I really would reach for something else uh and and save the Brooks Glycerin Max for a day where I just want to have a comfortable experience now there is a quite wide footprint on this shoe as well and so that's going to help the shoe from getting too unstable when your foot hits the ground so without having traditional stability elements the shoe does have some stability or motion control kind of built into it I didn't find this to be a problem and I felt like the shoe was ultimately quite comfortable and it all made sense to me but for those of you who are traditional glycerin fans you might find this shoe to be a little bit too mushy and a little bit too wobbly so you might want to stay away from something that's this soft I went true to size for my glycerin Max and that worked out really well for me if you're familiar with Brooks I would go with your normal Brooks sizing [Music] now before we wrap up this video let's take a step back and look at the Brooks lineup a little bit more generally to see where the glycerin Max fits in and right now with Brooks they have pretty much an entire lineup of Max shoes so let's try and make a lineup using that with the daily trainer we have the ghost Max which is the ghost that I've always wished that Brooks would make and so that's going to be the kind of centerpiece of a Brooks lineup if you like the Max shoes and then I think for workouts a shoe that you can hop into is another Max shoe and that's the Hyperion Max I think that would go over here that's something you could use whever you want to go a little bit faster than you might want to go in your ghost or ghost Max that's where I reached for the Hyperion Max the Hyperion being one of my favorite shoes that Brooks had ever made at the time that it first came out now there's a Max version of it a little bit more stack height a little bit more softness to it but still very much a speed oriented shoe not a shoe that I would necessarily reach for for every day but for the fast days that's when I'd reach for the Hyperion Max and then the glycerin Max fits in on the other side of the spectrum over here for those days where you want to be on feet for a long time and as comfortable as possible this is where I would reach for the glycerin Max now for racing there is the Hyperion Elite shoe and technically that would fit over here it has a carbon plate in it and it's even lighter the upper is absolutely fantastic very minimal padding very floppy heel cup the kind of things that I want to see when I want to go fast but I don't actually love this shoe and I think that this rotation is better served if you just leave it at these three shoes use the ghost Max for every day glycerin Max for Recovery days and long runs and then you reach for your Hyperion Max for your workouts and for your racing I think right now the Hyperion Max is the best racing shoe that Brooks makes now Chicago marathon was earlier this week and I did just see it what looked like maybe perhaps just a color update but I think there's a little bit more to that story I don't have any information that's been confirmed yet that I can report on so keep an eye out for something new from Brooks in the race category but for now this is the lineup that I would go with and I will note that both the ghost Max and the Hyperion Max do have updates so we're on version two of each of these shoes I have put in a request to Brooks to see if they would send me a pair of those those are all on the way so stay tuned And subscribe if you want to see updates of those videos but this is the Brooks lineup that I am really excited [Music] about now let's wrap up the video by talking about the buying guide and then we'll also go into some Alternatives that you're going to want to consider if you're interested in the glycerin Max the Brooks Glycerin Max is the max cushion shoe that I've always been wanting for Brooks to make and I hope that shoes like this and the ghost Max are signs of shoes to come and not just one-off experiments that languish in the BL labs this is a brand new shoe so there isn't a PRI years version that you might be able to save a couple of bucks on and I also think that this shoe is substantially different than the existing glycerin Series so I don't really feel like these are meaningful substitutes so if you want to get your foot into the new newness from Brooks you're going to be looking at $200 I think that price is a little bit High I wish it were lower than that but let's take a look at some of the competition to see where that $200 Stacks up the first shoe I want to talk about I think is the shoe that is the closest to the glycerin Max and it's also a shoe that I very recently reviewed on the channel and that's from Puma it's the mag Max another Max suffix shoe like the glycerin Max this is a very tall shoe using Nitro based Foams The Source material for the magmax is a little bit different and I think that's the main differentiator between these two shoes well they both look like they could be big cushy comfortable shoes and in many respects they are I do think that the magmax is a little bit bouncier and a little bit less mushy or in other words the glycerin Max is a little bit more comfortable and a little bit more plush but they're both really great examples of the max cushion genre the mag Max though comes in at a $20 discount of 180 bucks and then the other shoe that I don't think really lines up all that well but I think because of the pricing and because of the size of the shoes a lot of you guys have been asking me to compare these two so I will and that's from as6 that's the super Blast 2 these are both very tall shoes that look like they're going to be all day low and slow Cruisers but I actually use these two shoes quite differently the giser max is an excellent example of Max cushion shoe where I don't care about Pace but I'm trying to log time on feet and get those miles in in the most comfortable way possible the super Blast 2 can be used that way and it's pretty good for that but at $200 I think that's overkill for that task the way I love to use the super Blast 2 is for something where I am going to be on feet for a long time but it's a situation where I'm going to want to go fast for an extended period of time now it doesn't have a carbon fiber plate so it's not per se a race shoe but it does have racing foam in it as its main ingredient there's also a daily training foam on the bottom to help kind of stabilize all this foam and keep it from getting too unstable but this is a shoe where if I have a long run where I'm going to be running a lot of marathon pce miles or if I'm going to be doing a workout where the reps are very long this is a really great shoe for for me to be in so it gives me that combination of Max cushion and racing shoe kind of sandwiched into one in a way that on paper doesn't always Mak sense but on foot it just does even then I think that $200 is touch high for what the super blast offers but they both come in at the same price and depending on what you want out of your big shoe I think that's really going to Define which of these two options you're going to pick so those are my thoughts on the Brooks Glycerin Max great job Brooks I really love this one let's see more just like it if you have any questions about this shoe or any of the shoes that I talked about today feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet stop by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all I for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music] I",

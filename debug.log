name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex super Blast [Music] 2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are not necessarily directly comparable shoes because the zoomfly has a plate in the midsole whereas the super blast doesn't but they are both super trainers that are designed to do a wide range of runs they're both very popular shoes and people are quite Keen to see this comparison so so here it is the zoom fly is the cheapest shoe it cost £155 or $170 the super Blast 2 is £200 or $200 the zoomfly is a little bit heavier is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super blast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size they both have an 8 mm drop and the stack height on the superlast is a little bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel 37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly is 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the 4ot comes to the design with the Nike you got two layer woven mesh upper with a fair amount of padding around the heel significant internal heel counter as well to add some structure at the back of the shoe you got a duel density midsole the top layer is made from Nike zoomx foam there's a carbon plate running the full length of the shoe in between that it's a fairly flexible plate a little bit more so than on their Racing shoes but still a stiffening agent to add to the midside to add a bit more propulsion and then you have Nike's sr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the shoe there which is little bit less lively than the zoomx foam above it but adds a bit more kind of durability and stability to the shoe got a waffle full out sole coverage at the forefoot and heel big cutout in the middle that shows off the carbon plate in the mids soole and then with the super blast you also have a dual density mids soole but most of it is made from asx's FF turbo plus foam their best foam the bounciest foam the most responsive foam used in shoes like the metas speed Paris racing shoe series and then you have some FF blast Plus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe there as well got a pretty simple engineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of padding at the back bit of structure at the back you nothing too much going on with the upper there and then you've got reasonable outsole coverage there on the bottom you these patches of the ahar plus rubber which is pretty good in terms of grip lots of exposed phone but you know the key areas are covered there not any problems with grip with either [Music] shoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 for both of these Brands that's the size I use across the Nike and aex range and I've had no problems with the fit of either both have enough room around the toes good hold around the heer mid foot they're both pretty comfortable uppers all around I would say know four super trainers that can do very fast running as well as easy running they do have very accommodating uppers that make them comfortable to pull on every single day Nikes are probably a little bit more dialed in around the toes you know it's a slightly more cramped fit I'd say than a super blast but not in a way that was unpleasant at all it just gives it maybe a slightly racier feel at times but overall I was very happy with the fit of both shoes yeah great uppers good comfort and I would stick to your normal running shoe [Music] size onto the run test then and I think these are two excellent shoes two of the shoes I've really enjoyed running in this year the superl 2 more or less just picked up where the super blast one left off in being pretty much the standard Setter for plate free super trainers like it's a pretty unique shoe and one that I don't think any other brands really been able to emulate in terms of that very versatile plate free design whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big upgrade on previous models of the shoe which were heavy clunky not that good and the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's a plated super trainer that can match up to the best in that category including shoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or the H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good competitor for someone like a super blast as well if you don't mind training with the plate so super Blast 2 we had in for testing first did a lot of running when we initially had it in and I actually took it away last week for a trip and just used it for everything you know just walking around all my runs one of those trips where you only have a very small bag on a budget Airline so you have one pair of shoes for everything and it's perfect for that because it is such a versatile shoe it is comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it you know does everything really well it's also quite a nice looking shoe I think in this colorway although some will disagree it's also just amazingly light for its size which really helps you pick up the pace in it so I did like kind of a progression running the shoe while I was away I've done some full sessions in the shoe as well and while it is quite a big shoe something I always noticed because of the way I am quite a high Cadence Runner quite a shuffly runner and a big kind of boatlike design like this sometimes feels a bit big on my foot but if I kind of get over that I can run fast in the shoe without any problems got a lot of response from the foam and you know it does feel good for those fast Paces but really excels I think for kind of cruising around daily runs like progression runs you're moving to kind of steady Paces kind of quick but not fast I guess how I describe those kind of runs where you are moving with a bit of effort but you're not really going for it and long runs in particular just really good shoe for eating up a lot of mileage and just amazingly light for its size like all these super trainers that come out with plates designed very explicitly for fast running things like the Nike and other shoes like that are all heavier than the super loss despite the fact has a higher stack just because that foam is so light and that does really help it be a more versatile shoe the Nike is also a very versatile shoe though and that certainly wasn't the case with previous models of The Zo flight like this is now isue you can go and do fast runs in I've done a couple of hard sessions in it I've gone down the track and done a 10 times one mile session a nasty progression run on the road done a pretty decent steady run again quick but not fast over about 90 minutes where I was running pretty well and you know at the back end of marathon training this was a shoe that I really enjoyed using for all the runs I was doing around that time so pretty good workouts lots of long runs of progression runs and it just felt really good for them like it's an exceptionally comfortable shoe given the speed you have here I would say it starts with the upper which is really nice to slip on and then the underfoot feel is really quite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that you can run very fast in and that's a bit similar to the super blast but I think you have a slightly smaller and more Nimble design with the Nike and although it's know heavier does feel a bit more kind of fast and direct than the super blast because it has a I think a slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker like kind of you know you get pushed off the toes a bit more on the Nike I would say and it just has a slightly smaller design around the heel which has a heel Striker with a high Cadence I do notice if I'm trying to run fast so I tell you like when it comes to you know really allout sessions or trying to hold a fast pace for a long time if you're looking for a stand in racing shoe I think that's where the Nike excels a little bit more than the super blast just because it does have a bit more of a racy feel a faster feel I find it easier to sustain Paces in the Nike than the super blast super blast really for me fits more in the daily trainer mold where you know can do everything and it can go fast but I think it excels more at kind of slightly more relaxed places than the Nike both I would also say are surprisingly stable for such big shoes like they both got pretty wide bases both got designs that you know are not necessarily going to be inherently stable with those big stacks of foam on there but they're welld designed I had no concerns about running in them kind of on any terrain uh and certainly no concerns in terms of pronation or anything like that so I did do a short run wearing both shoes at the same time you actually have a softer feel with the Nike I think it almost feels a little bit more flexible like the superlast is quite renowned for being quite a stiff shoe despite the fact it doesn't have a plate which does help it run fast but I know not everyone loves that for kind of more relaxed Paces like I quite like it for those relaxed Paces that stiffness kind of pushes you through and rolls you on it's not uncomfortable at all but it's surprising actually that even though the Nike has a plate it didn't really feel that much different in terms of stiffness when you comparing these two shoes directly on the run and you get I think a little bit more pop and lift off the toes with the Nike with that plate in there and the way the rocket I think just works a bit better for me rolling me through my foot strike where youve got the quite sharp tapered rocker on the super blast I think that helps a lot in terms of like a big amount of Bounce and if you're a bit more of a loping runner I think you'll probably engage that and enjoy that a bit more than I do but I do think just get yeah a bit more punch off the Nike superlast feels a bit more relaxed it's kind of a strange to both of these shoes actually I would say feel quite similar at a range of Paces like there are some shoes where you really feel that they're a bit more direct and firm and aggressive when you start running quick in them but both of these feel like oh you can run in these at very relax Paces Run them at fast Paces they still feel quite similar which is nice like it's great for a training Sho to be able to do lots of different runs in like that and they always feel quite comfortable and have stability but you can run nice and quick in them as [Music] well so verdict this is a really tough choice I think these are both excellent shoes that do a range of jobs really well they're really versatile shoes they're comfortable I like wearing them both for easy runs and then they do both have Pace you can go and do fast sessions in them and you can even use both as standing Racing shoes especially for longer distances because there is a lot of pace there as well as protection and comfort with all the foam you have Under Foot so when it comes to picking between the two shoes there a few things you could look at to help you on that front I mean one is just simply the price the Nike is cheaper so that's an easy objective win for the Nike and given that both these shoes are quite similar in performance that is quite a big deal you know you could certainly pick up the Nike make a saving and have a really good shoe then the ride field I think you've got a slightly more cruisy feel with the super blast it's a bit better for kind of loping through those easy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a bit more comfortable pulling on for every single day because it doesn't have a plate in there it's got a nice relaxed upper it feels really good at easy paces and you can step up the pace when you want to and the Nike is a bit nimbler bit more punch from the plate if you are looking for more of an explicit fast trainer to add to your rotation I think it does the job a little bit better but it is also very versatile for sure got choice about whether to plate or not to plate like not sure it makes a huge difference in this case myself like certainly there's a nice feeling in running a shoe without a plate and running fast and all that but superlast has got a big old super foam in there it's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a similar way in many ways as having the plate that said I do think it's a bit easier to maintain you know fast Paces over long distances in the Nike so maybe that's a mental thing or maybe that actually is the plate coming into play so if you don't want to use a plate to shoot obviously a super Blaster is an easy winner there so that is something that you know some people want to consider so obviously if you're looking for one shoe to do it all I'd probably get the Nike myself if you're quite keen on racing because I think it's a slightly better racing shoe and it does those easy runs well if you're looking for a shoe to add to rotation just to have with like a carbon plate racing shoe to do to do those really fast workouts in I think the super blast works really well I think that's the Fantastic that's probably the best two shoe rotation out there I think at the moment is to get the super blast for pretty much all your training and then a carbon plate racing shoe for races and the odd really hard session super blast just does that role so well and if you're looking for like a fast trainer to slip in the middle of a rot I think both work pretty much equally well so it's more whether you want the kind of lighter but bigger design of the super blast the slightly punchier kind of plated Nimble design of the zoom fly like again it's really close here so I think I'd really struggle to pick between them I think I'd probably just lean towards the Nike myself I just suits my running style a little bit better just because I have a high Cadence I said I really enjoyed just having the super blast as my only shoe away on a trip it was really nice to put it on every day it's a shoe you can really fall in love with by using over and over again so yeah very hard to call probably the Nike just as it for me especially as it's a little bit cheaper but certainly very case for either shoe both very much stand out of [Music] 2024 that's our comparison of the zoom fly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know what you think in the comments below please like And subscribe ring the little bell we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Asics Novablast 5 vs Superblast 2: Top new Asics running shoes compared':\n\nhey this is mik from the r testers this is the aex no blast 5 and this is the aex super Blast 2 two shoes as you'll know from our multitester reviews we are big fans of now these are also two shoes that sit at very different price points super blast do is the more expensive the no blast 5 is a lot cheaper and it's a lot easier to get a hold of than this shoe now what we're going to do in this video is take you through the key differences and give you a sense of whether there is any kind of overlap in terms of experience in terms of the types of runs that these shoes can work for and whether no blast 5 could give you a super blast like experience for a little bit less money so first we'll get into those key differences then give you our multi test to take on whether you should go for the Nova blast 5 or the super Blast 2 so let's get into those nitty-gritty details and differences between the Nova blast 5 and Super Blast 2 let's start with price and the noov blast 5 is considerably cheaper than the super Blast 2 while both are offered in stand width size options only weightwise the Nova blast 5 weighed in heavier for us than the super Blast 2 in a UK men's size eight you're getting shoes both of 8 mm drops with the super Blast 2 offering a bigger stack of cushioning at both the heel and the 4f foot compared to the latest Nova blast at the upper it's engineered woven mesh versus jackard mesh with similar tongue and lacing combinations used and the Nova blast 5 heel collar offering a touch more padding there's big differences at the midsole where the no no blast uses the new FF blast Max for a softer feel compared to the Eco plus included in the Nova blast 4 and also the super Blast 2 where it's combined with the FF blast turbo plus found in asx's metas Speed Carbon races asex adopts a similar trampoline inspired outs soole design on both shoes to spread those Foams across a relatively broad base to bring that bounce throughout the shoe you're also getting similar outo designs with the no blast offering a bit more coverage at the for foot and lateral areas of the shoe comes to the fit of the super Blast 2 and the no blast 5 I've got the same size in both shoes which is a uk9 us10 with aex it's the same size I use across the aex range and both of them have a really good fit for me I'd say you have got really roomy forfoot on the no blast 5 but even as someone with a narrow foot like I am you know have too much room there as someone with a narrow foot but it's not being a problem in any way with lockdown or anything like that got right amount of length at the front there in terms of room for my toes good hold around the heel and midfoot I find them both very comfortable shoes just to slip on day after day so yeah no concerns with the fit I'd stick to your normal size okay so the fit for me in the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 quite a similar fit actually um both very comfortable I'm a size eight in the UK i' very much like wearing both these shoes they're both AIC shoes so a similar fit what I would say is that the um nov blast 5 is a little bit more forgiving it feels a little bit wider and the upper just feels a little bit um more flexible in in terms of how it puts pressure on your feet so uh if you maybe have a slightly wider foot you're probably going to be better off with the Nova blast 5 over the super Blast 2 but there's not a lot in it and I find both of these shoes very very comfortable so I would stick to my size in both of them so in terms of fit it's been very good for me in both of the shoes I've got them both in a UK size a that my typical run shoe size and that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in ax shoes now what I would say is the key differences for me is that with the Nova blast 5 it definitely has a more of a relaxed fit and I would say you know it's a bit more roomy in the toe box of the shoe I think it opens up a little bit more of going further back in the shoe as well and if you prefer something that's a bit more accommodating particularly if you've got slightly wider feet then I think that would be a better fit for most people I've got quite skinny narrow feet and while it is a lot rier I found it's not been overly roomier or generous with that space I think with the super blast too definitely does narrow a little bit more it's not super narrow in any way but I do think like the space up front in the toe box is still very good that hold at the midfoot is very good as well too another area I think is a key difference for me is that there's just a bit more padding around the hill col in the Nova blast 5 where you know it's definitely issue for me that's geared towards kind of giving you a little bit more of that Comfort side where you're getting that padding a pretty good amount of padding on the hill col and the super Blast 2 but it definitely isn't as much as it is on the no blast 5 so the things for me would be that the Nova blast 5 is a lot more roomy particularly the front of the shoe and and the middle section of the shoe the super blast to has less kind of padding at the hill collar but generally for me I think going through the size for both of these shoes should be fine for most people let's give you a quick word on fit then in amongst the pistachio shells on this bench and in the ax superlast 2 and the over blast five i r in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half I think these are both really kind of roomy accommodating shoes there's loads of space in the toe box up front big thumbs width there nice clearance across the top of the toes super lastar to for me they hold really well in the midfoot the heels are nicely padded I have no slipping at all Everything feels locked down and comfortable and nice and I would recommend going through to issues particularly if you want to go Long Haul because they're plenty roomy in the Nova blast 5 these are even area I mean there's so much Flex in the toe box here these are sort of spacious some people have complained about the fact that they feel too spacious particularly if you've got narrow feet maybe they will feel a bit wide but I ran in my regular running shoe size and I found everything good I I really look for lots of toebox room so look you can see you've got lots of clearance on the end there's plenty of Flex for the toes that TOS the top lock down across the midfoot was nice and secure I had good hold in the heels as well tongues take the Ed jof no problems with this and I I recommend going true to Siz in the shoe unless you really want a snug fit where or you've got a narrow foot where you might want to think about going half a size down so the aex super Blast 2 and the aex no blast 5 are both shoes that I've really liked testing this year I think they both fit their roles very well within the ax lineup with the no blast 5 being more of the mid-range shoe the daily trainer that's designed to be pretty good value appeal to a wide range of Runners have a fairly inoffensive ride that's actually no very pleasant ride in fact and one that I think will work for lots of different Runners you obvious got a load of cushioning there under foot but it's still a fairly lightweight shoe got a slight rocker there that does help you roll through your stri foot strike smoothly and actually that's been improved a little bit on the no blast 5 compared to the no blast 4 for me thanks to the redesigned heel bevel which is a little bit less huge than the one on the no blast 4 which does make it a slightly smoother ride but you've got a good foam in the Mido there which is comfortable but it's not necessarily as responsive as exciting as the stuff you are going to get on the super Blast 2 for me the no blast 5 definitely works best for kind of easy runs relaxed da training long runs that kind of thing you can pick up the pace in the shoe but you're not getting a huge amount of responsiveness out of this foam it's more just the fact that it's a pretty lightweight shoe and one with a nice rocker that means you can turn your feet over quite well the foam is soft but not too mushy for me so I find I can run faster in the shoe without it feeling like I'm you know waiting through a big wedge of soft foam so it's reasonably versatile but certainly not as versatile as something like the super blast which is a kind of a special shoe so it's obviously a lot more expensive than an overlast 5 it's build as a super training without a plate you've got the huge stack of asx's best foam there the FF turbo plus and that foam just is a lot livelier a lot more responsive and it it really makes it a lot easier to pick up the pace in the super blast compared to the no blast it's also a lighter shoe than the no blast and really you can kind of do everything that you would do in the no blast you can do it in the super blast and then it's got a lot more range in terms of that top end speed like it's not necessarily a shoe that I absolutely adore running fast in myself because style of Runner I am I've got a high Cadence fairly short stride like quite a shuffly runner and you know it's a big shoe so it's not a heavy shoe but it is a big shoe and sometimes turning it over it can a little bit too boatlike and big for me I actually would be quite Keen for them to shave off a bit of that heel bevel on the super Blast 3 as they have done with the no blast 5 I think that would probably improve it a little bit for me but I certainly can pick up the pace in it I do enjoy running it a lot recently I took it away for a trip was the only shoe I had for everything and you know it's a comfortable shoe to walk around in it then can do all the runs I did on that trip at a range of paces and it just works all of for all of them you know really very well and you do get a much livelier feel from the foam in this midsole compared to the one in the nose blast 5 so when I was running both of them at the same time that's the thing that really comes across like the super blast feels lighter and it feels a lot poppier and more responsive under the for foot in particular you get a lot more lift off the toes in general just feels like a you know more exciting ride got a denser foam on the nose blast it feels like a much more solid shoe you know a heavier shoe which it is and one that's a bit more suited just for cruising along it is still a pretty lightweight shoe like I say and it turns over well but compared to the superl you can get a lot more kind of pace and liveliness out the shoe and it's also stiffer which I think does make it more comfortable that pace that stiffness might detract from the ride a little bit at easier PES for some people like I don't really mind it myself you know it's not a shoe that's designed for Pure Comfort but it does feel fine for me on easy runs but then the extra flexibility you get from the NOA blast might appeal to some people when they're looking at just cruising around their daily training like there's a fairly big wedge of foam you get on the super blast and it does help with pushing you along but it is quite stiff like I say okay so you'll notice that I'm still not holding up the super Blast 2 because Mike still has it so I need to go and get that off him at some point desperate to get that shoe back so I can do some training um for uh Dubai Marathon uh that's coming up in a few weeks uh so these two shoes are shoes that um if you if I reviewed the no blast 4 and the super Blast 2 and compared them they're quite similar in a in in in how they run they both have a same level of firmness in the midsole they both have similar level of respons and it feels like uh the Nova blast 4 took a lot of learnings from the super blast um to provide a better all round versatile experience for runners um and I very much like both of those shoes especially for training uh a longer distance where I want to retain a consistent effort but I still want a bit of comfort and a lot of padding as well uh the Nova blast 5 uh it's quite different than superlast 2 now U because this new midell phone this FF blast Max is um a bit softer than what was in the Nova blast 4 and as a result it changes the ride of the shoe uh quite a bit for me in comparison to the to the Nova blast 4 the result of that is that um it's definitely a lot softer than the super Blast 2 um but also you don't get that same um turnover that you get in the super Blast 2 Su Blast 2 is a shoe that isn't very soft um and it has a quite a rigid midsole so it rolls your foot forward and really helps you maintain a nice fluid Pace I use the superlast 2 quite a lot for longer training sessions um where I'm trying to maintain maybe my marathon pace and it just really helps you just smoothly just cover that pace it's not really noticeable like a carbon plate shoe or something where you can feel the the carbon plate doing something uh to to impact the way that that you're running it's just a really smooth motion very comfortable nice level of padding for running at PACE and doesn't in any way um sap your energy or slow you down or anything like that but still retains a good level of comfort as well uh the no blast 5 is a Sho that um because of this softer midell foam it doesn't work so well as the no blast 4 or the super Blast 2 when you are uh running faster because for me it feels like I'm hitting that a little bit too hard um and I'm not getting a lot back there's a little of energy return you get back from this phone when you're running at a slower Pace or more of a consistent Pace but when you're picking picking up the speed um I feel like I'm really putting too much pressure into that mid cell Pham and it's not giving it me back it's it's it's sapping the energy a little bit um when I'm running faster uh I think that's really the the the key to what the Nova blast 5 is now I think it's more a daily shoe that fits more into that easier realm longer runs maybe where you just want comfort and you're not trying to pick up the pace or maintain the tempo Pace or anything like that um and and the superlast 2 is all all out designed for uh those consistent long run Paces uh it's a fantastic marathon training shoe probably be a great Marathon shoe I haven't used it for a marathon uh race but the way that the shoe rides is just very fluid very comfortable um but really allows you to maintain a pace which for me for marathan training would be about 4 minute 30 km uh if I'm going out to do like a 25k 30k long run and and that shoe just Smooths your feet and just makes you just be able to do that run really really comfortably without really adding anything to it it's a very natural ride as well it's not really forcing your foot into a specific position no blast 5 I wouldn't use it for those sorts of runs I think it I'd really feel it after a while it just deadening the the impact and not really giving me a lot back but it is a very enjoyable shoe to wear for those easier runs or a longer run where you're just trying to just maintain a nice comfortable effort you get a little bit of bounce back back it's definitely very comfortable shoot to a but for me it definitely sits into that realm of easier day shoes now um as opposed to a versatile option Su Blast 2 is very very versatile shoe great for easy runs I know Kieran thinks it's a fantastic easy run shoe I don't use it for easy runs uh I prefer a lot more softness when I'm running easy runs so if I'm just doing easy runs I'd probably pick the no blast 5 but for a shoe that is really really well designed for faster training sessions at longer at longer distance uh you can also do a lot more with it so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I've done over 50k in the Nova blast 5 now I have done near to 100 miles in the super Blast 2 and what I would say is these are two shoes that are very good at being ones that you just throw on and they are very easy to forget about what's going on in and around your foot to be ones that you know really can kind of tick that mileage off you know really get that running time in your feet without really thinking too much about it there definitely are some differences between these two shoes I think does kind of influence how I would use them how I think a lot of people may end up using them and want to use them I think the first uh Factor area for me is the weights now these aren't heavy shoes either than my heavy shoes but when you consider at least for me that the super L 2 is you know is a bigger stack shoe comes in a ways in lighter for me than no last five you know it just you know feels like it runs a little bit nicer with that weight just handles that weight a little bit better now it isn't sloppy and isn't heavy or cumbersome and the no blast 5 and it's not a lower stack shoe by a huge amount but I just found that you know having that kind of light away on a on a Max taoe is is a very nice kind of experience overall and it really kind of kind of feeds into what you're getting in the midsole what you're getting below you know uh in the out soole as well and what that kind of does for the ride in these shoes I think for me the no blast youve got the FF blast Max for me it's spread across a kind of larger surface area and what that does first and foremost is just create something that is a lot or kind of naturally very stable I think it's also a lot sof the feeling than the kind of dual density mids cell makeup in the super Blast 2 I think that what does for me the no blast 5 it just you know Comfort is the first thing it ticks off it rolls through very nicely very smoothly and for me when I've running it I found it felt more comfortable to do that kind of easier and moderate Paces when I've tried to run a little bit quicker in it it's not you know been totally uncomfortable to do that but I've just felt that when I've tried to do that in the super Blast 2 it's felt more at home it's felt more depth and that's really down to that midsole that dual density midell being you know there's some softness there but there's definitely some firmness as well too there's some bounce as well I think there a more prominent bounce for me in the super blast 2it I think the rocker is more prominent as well you know the rocker is pretty good in this in the no blast 5 but I think coupled with all the things that you're getting in these super Blast 2 it just rolls through a little bit more aggressively for me and I've raced in it I've done track sessions in it I've done faster sessions I've done shorter and long kind of runs in it as well and I felt it's covered you or felt comfortable to do it at all of those Paces I think the other thing I mentioned other videos I think transitioning from those different Paces you know the super Blu does a very good job of that and that's why is kind of a standout do it all shoot I think the Nova blast five for me when I have tried to mix the Pacers in a single run I haven't found it as comfortable I haven't found it as Lively and bouncy barring the first run that I did in it but it's a definitely good experience in both these shoes just for very different runs so I think these are good daily trainer shoes you know relatively kind of big stack shoes as well for me there clearly one that is a little bit more versatile and a little bit more friendly towards running a little bit more Tempo and faster um but definitely good shoes for me other areas I think the out Souls I think you know for me I think the no blast 5 is giving you a little bit more rubber on that outsole and I think durability wise I'm seeing less wear obviously less running time but for me the super plus 2 has been H holding up pretty well obviously still getting some exposed areas there's definitely a bit more more rubber on the Nova blast 5 for me in those kind of similar areas as well so for me from a you know durability point of view I think you're going to get a bit more from no blast 5 gripping has been fine for me I've run in kind of wetter and drri conditions for both these aren't the best kind of you know Road running outsoles available but they seem to be up to task or have been up to task in my run so yeah two very good shoes two very good Asic shoes two very good daily trainer shoes but it's definitely one that I pick of the other that's not to say the other one is bad but I just think the other or there's one shoe here that works a little bit better for me and I'll get to that in my verdict so in testing I've run north of 30 mil in the new Nova blast 5 I've run much more in the super Blast 2 including a full Marathon test in this shoe that's on the channel now if you want to go and find it all of that has been across a range of paces and terrain I also did a side bys side Mile with one shoe on each foot to really tease out the differences between these two shoes and here's how that went so I've just done my side by side Mile with the super Blast 2 on my right foot I've got the Nova blast five on my left foot minute you put the shoes on you feel the higher stack in the super blast you can feel that there's that extra stiffness and firmness in the midsole compared to the softer novablast 5 which feel sort of sinky when you first put them on by comparison superlast to sort of you know they're cushion but they sort of hold you up and you're expecting that kind of stiffness and that roll through and that transition to come uh as a result of a slightly kind of stiffer ride there's a more immediacy as a result of that they're both big Cush C shoes though I don't think the superlast 2 you know sacrificing that much cushion for me anyway they it does feel like a bigger shoe on the foot there's a lot more kind of heft to it doesn't feel quite as Nimble you know it's a thing to say that NOA blast feels a bit more compact by comparison because the Nova blast is not a compact shoe by any stretch of the imagination but it does feel I mean they're about the same weight but I would say the no blast 5 actually feels a bit lighter I think it's just because you've got more of the superlast underf foot stability wise I quite like the firmness of the super Blast 2 I think that provides a bit more of a stable platform for me a bit more reliability you do feel a little bit of mush and wobble I think into the Nova blast five if anything I expected over blast 5 in my head for the runs that i' done with it initially to be a bit more like the super Blast 2 but actually I think the over blast 4 which had that kind of slightly additional stiffness firmness underf foot now feels much more like the super blast than the Nova blast 5 does the Nova blast 5 brings softness so how does that translate then well if you've run in the super blast to if you've watched reviews and you've thought actually maybe they might be a little bit too stiff for you to go Long Haul into the long miles and you wanted more softness and the Nova blast 5 is going to add that it gets to the energy in a different way though it's slightly more reliant on a sink and a bounce for the energy to come back where you get a lot of energy and bounce from the super Blast 2 but you also get a little bit of that kind of immediacy from the stiffness that comes so it's a bit quicker to respond it's a bit punchier as a result there's a bit more kind of top speed potential I think of the superlast 2 it's overall just a bit more of an energetic shoe where the Nova blast 5 now I think bit more cushioning probably bit more accommodating for going slower and longer whereas the super Blast 2 is probably better you know cruising those kind of tempo Paces maybe a little bit higher up if you don't mind running in a big shoe that is how I would divide those shoes but we'll do the verdict back in the office it comes to my verdict like these are both good shoes and shoes that fit their roles well within the aex lineup if you are looking for one shoe absolutely everything and you want you're prepare to pay for a special feeling under fit you are going to get it with a super blast 2 like it's a pretty amazing shoe it's not one that's entirely to my taste like I've picked out shoes that I prefer to it that are also you know really fun all rounders and all that but it's certainly an amazing shoe one that I do like running in and one that obviously is very popular with people at large like if you are just looking for one shoe to do everything the super blast is the one to do it in if you're looking for a fast training shoe then the super blast is the one to pick over the no blast the no blast is certainly better value you can use it for the same kind of runs as the super blast you're just not going to get the same energetic ride feel and is a bit more kind of cushy and relaxed when it comes to easy runs like you're looking at putting these shoes in a rotation superlast either could be you know a rotation killer a shoe you're used for everything or one that fits into rotation in the middle of it there like picking up the bulk of your mileage with a maybe a very easy comfortable cushion shoe for some easy runs and then a fast plated shoe for you know really top end Speedy stuff whereas the no blast 5 I position more towards the cushion end of things in a rotation I'd want to have you know a faster training shoe alongside this and maybe a racer as well though you can use it for a bit of everything like it doesn't really have the pace that I'd be looking for in an allrounder if you are a newer runner though I think the no blast 5 is a really good allrounder actually I think it's one that will protect the legs well but is fairly lightweight you can use it for some Speedy stuff like if I was a new Runner I wanted one you to do everything I would get the no blast first before know spending loads of money on something like the super blast I think the no blast does play a role in being you know a cheaper version of the super blast in a way and it is a fair bit cheaper but the super blast you know you are paying more for it but you are going to get a big upgrade in performance if you do spend that money okay so my verdict on the super Blast 2 and the Nova blast 5 is obviously the super Blast 2 is a much more expensive shoe um so if it came down to cost and the fact that it's almost impossible to buy the super Blast 2 and I know many of you will comment on this video uh saying that you can't get hold of it sorry about that there's nothing we can do to get them to stock more super blast 2os um but because of that no blast 5 is probably going to be the only option for most people anyway if even if you could get it it's a very expensive shoe2 200 is a lot of money to spend on a training shoe um which is above a lot of people's budget so the no blast 5 comes in under that it's a shoe design for more General Runners it's a shoe design for people that don't want to spend £200 on a running shoe um but it's not as good a shoe um obviously uh it's a lot significantly cheaper than the super Blast 2 um if I was looking at purely the shoes themselves and ignoring the price and the availability of them I would say that super Blast 2 is a far superior shoe um for most runs if you're going to go out and buy a shoe then you wanted something that you could do a lot of stuff in easier runs daily sessions faster sessions um long runs super Blast 2 just ticks off all of those really really well noas 5 doesn't really take off all of those well at all it really ticks off the easier runs and the comfortable training sessions the daily runs where you just want a nice bit of softness uh and comfort and you want to take off the miles uh in as much um with as much padding and and comfort as you can get um but it's really not a huge design for versatility or uh it's defin not sure I'd use if I was training for a marathon I was doing lots of longer sessions or faster sessions so I think it really comes down to that if you're looking between these two shoes and you're not worried about price or availability but obviously if you're just a general Runner that's looking for a comfortable daily shoe you're not going to go for the superlast 2 because it's just so expensive uh and hard to get so out of for me I'm going to go superlast 2 all the way but I understand that the no plus 5 is a more cost effective option but it's limited to easier sessions you can't really do a lot in this shoe after my first run in the no blast 5 where I ran well and the NOA blast 5 gave back good energy I was wondering if they might be a more affordable alternative to the super Blast 2 a sort of super blast light if you will but after logging many more miles in both shoes I don't think that's quite the case here both shoes are enticingly versatile but the superlast 2 is by far the more energetic shoe with a smoother ride and I think a more consistent punch across all the ranges of pace the no boss 5 has energy and it's also a capable Cruiser but but for me the softer Edge just isn't quite as encouraging as the ride you get from the super Blast 2 it just doesn't quite give you that extra oomph I actually think the Nova blast 4 runs more like the super Blast 2 it's a bit firmer a bit snappier now The Sweet Spot for the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 is really cruising from around my marathon pace up to Tempo there's enough cushion on both shoes to eat easy miles in relative Comfort too I could Long Haul in both of these shoes but I find both shoes can get a bit sluggish at my very slowest pace at least when I'm running in my heaviest form when it comes to the fastest training both shoes can be a bit too much shoe on the foot I find for me to want to tackle things like all out of intervals again you can do these sessions in either shoe but I wouldn't say either of them really excels at it over and above some other shoes now the superl 2 is a better shoe all round the grip Superior the ride is snappier but if you're on a budget could you cover the same runs in the over blast five the answer I think is probably yes would they be as good I don't think quite if you're taking money out of the question I'd certainly choose the superlast two out of these two shoes I think on balance is the more accomplished all rounder and the slightly snappier ride which appeals more to the way I run so my take with you should go the A6 blast 5 or the as6 super Blast 2 now the first thing I'll say is that these are two very good daily trainer shoes if you're telling me which one is the best it's a no-brainer it's a super blast too this is the shoe if you want a shoe that can do uncover all of your runs and do it in a really good way then that's what the super Blast 2 is going to give you in terms of the Nova blast 5 being a super blast light I think it works for some of the runs that the super Blast 2 works well at but not all of them I think this is a shoe you get if you you know can't get hold of the super Blast 2 you want a shoe that's accommodating that is comfortable works for shorter and longer runs and I think for me easy to moderate Paces that's really where you know it fits best for me so if that's what would work for you that's what you would look for in a daily trainer Sho and go for the over blast 5 if you want the best shoe between these two shoes the one that can work for faster Paces longer runs shorter runs could be used for track sessions as well it's a super blast 2 you1 I appreciate it's hard to get a hold of but if you can you're going to be rewarded with a very good daily Trainer shoe that weighs in at the kind of standard daily trainer weight and overall it's just a very good shoe one of my favorite shoes to running or to have running this year so for me if I could get a hold of it and you know I'm fortunate that I do have one I would be going for the super Blast 2 if you wanted a shoe that you know and that daily trainer profile that definitely Vees towards being more comfortable but can definitely work for shorter and longer runs easy to modate Paces I'd be going for the Nova blast 5 okay so there you have it that our take on how the Nova blast 5 compares to the super Blast 2 if you got any questions about either of these shoes or other shoes you want to see them compared to do let us know in the comments as always like And subscribe hit that little bell to find out about our latest videos and yeah we'll see you next run test this video\n\nFrom video 'ASICS SUPERBLAST 2 (completely unbiased review)':\n\nthe most anticipated shoe of the year is finally here the aex super blast version 2 the original super blast burst onto the scene last year and almost immediately became one of my absolute favorite alltime training shoes and when I'm not out running testing other shoes this was the shoe I'd reach for about 90% of the time clocking it over 3,000 km in a few different versions of version one with two big updates to version two with the out soole and the upper hereit I was really worried that aex might be messing this one up so is this new model going to live up to my very high expectations or am I going to be scaring eBay to try and find some pairs of version one and as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review right let's get stuck into all of the changes between the version one and version two the price of the Superglass 2 is a little bit more expensive here in the UK now costing £200 most markets around the world it's pretty much the same we have got an updated midsole this big chunk through the middle here which now uses the FF turbo the same as the updated metas speed sky and Edge asex is most premium responsive foam that they offer out there and then we've got a thin layer along the bottom of here of asx's FF blast plus which is what they use for a little bit more durability and also sort of stabilizing the shoe we've got an updated outsole much welcome updated outo this is new aex grip rubber on the bottom here a little bit more grippy here in the wet weather we'll come on to chat about that a little bit later on the review and also you can't get any stones and Pebbles and little hitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe here which I you get all the time on version one when you'd run on sort of more grally areas they filled in all of those holes in slightly different design and pattern on version two and then finally we've got a different updated upper to the shoe here which is now this one piece woven engineered mesh so it's a little bit more stretchy and just has a little bit more movement with the shoe versus version one right let's get stuck into the facts and figures this is is your long distance mileage monster for crushing those long runs out there and it's also one of the very best non-plated racing shoes perfect for like 10K half marathons marathons and also Ultra marathons if they're going to be on the road as well is very much a road shoe although you could do have a little bit of light trail with this great aex grip on the bottom here price-wise this sent me back £200 here in the UK around about €220 $200 around about $320 Australian dollars stack Heights we've got 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and it's basically the same weight as the outgoing model for me this is coming at 288 G that's really really quite light for sure of this size this is in my particular size UK 11 A2 here the old version was 290 so basically exactly the same it is a neutral shoe the upper as I've just said is this lovely engineered mesh upper which Asic say is going to improve the air flow through the shoe midso we've got the FF Turbo plus through the middle here and then the FF blast plus Eco along the bottom of the shoe there there is famously no carbon plate in the shoe and the outsole Now features this aex grip which is these yellow sections here and aex also put this on some of their trail shoes as well so it's very tacky very sticky a lce sort of slow density rubber to try and improve on asx's usually quite poor wet weather performance there are no different wits available at launch but it's pretty good here on the witth side there's also this one Flagship color at launch which is asx's Paris colorway personally I absolutely love this let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments asex say that this is to do with Paris called the city of lights and we've got sunset and sunrise colors here and finally this wasn't true to size I actually ordered a size 12 my usual size and a size 11 and 1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version one and I've stuck with that in version two basically i' just say go half a size down from your regular size or go exactly the same size you had in version one if you had that shoe if you could like and share this video and let us know down in the comments your thoughts on the superl 2 that be great and please check out my website benp parks.com we've got training plans the best running hats in the world some technical gear and Casual gear to keep you going through your training right let's get stuck into the likes my first like here is they didn't mess it up come on I get so worried when you have your absolute favorite shoe out there and a manufacturer releases a new one and you're like please don't mess it up please don't make it really heavy bulky use different materials they have used different materials but all the updates in the shoe have worked really well the upper is just a little bit more breathable the key area such as the ankle lock down absolutely fantastic no slipping no blisses no hot spots nice gusseted tongue here just gives the perfect right amount of padding so your foot stays nicely locked down yes I was a bit worried my foot might move around a little bit at the front of the shoe with this woven mesh upper but it just stays perfectly in place so no problems there and also finally thank you to ax for not increasing the weight actually for me brought it down very very so slightly super lightweight shoe it is absolutely amazing how a shoe can be this light and it just feels so much fun to run in my second like with the shoe is this updated midsole foam it's just ever so slightly more Poppy and responsive but really very very similar if you're a fan of version one you're going to love this updated foam in version two It just strikes that perfect balance in a shoe that can just have that sudden turn with speed of course there's plenty of faster dedicated 5K and 10K shoes with plates and things like that there but that's not what this shoe is all about this shoe is perfect for crunching those long distance marathon training runs or marathon races as well if you don't want to be using a carbon plate and really if you don't want to have a carbon plate in your shoe there really is nothing faster out there than the aex super blast version 2 and then finally my third like with the shoe is this updated outsole the super blast was okay in the wet it really wasn't that great but the new aex grip they put on the bottom of the shoe here just means all of that worry has gone away when I have running it in the wet it's just gripped super fantastically and you really can feel the difference even walking around the house the you one it just feels different it's lot more tacky when aex had all their problems with their grip with their wet weather grip in like the Nova Blast 2 and three it really wasn't very good this you don't have to worry about it at all fantastic update aex well done finally got a shoe that you can trust in the wet weather and also you can just take this out on some light Trails as well and it will handle those absolutely fine some fire roads and things like that you'll be good to go here moving on to the dislikes this is really hard to be honest my first dislike isn't really even about the shoe it's just about all the supply issues that you have with the superlast and I don't know why aexs are like this the shoe sells out so quickly pretty much sold out on launch day all around the world maybe it's all just marketing I don't know there's nothing in this shoe that you can't get on all of the other ax shoes the materials are all available but they really seem to limit Supply I can only assume I don't know why that is but this shoe will be selling out very very quickly if you can get a pair you want to get a pair don't dilly dally just go and get that order in and also the shoe was meant to launch on Friday just gone on the aex website here in the UK they didn't even launch because I think they had supply issues themselves and they delayed their launch again I don't know that's just what I suspect even assets can't get it right I got my player from sport shoes got up at 5:30 in the morning to try and secure a pair which I managed to do so very very happy with that got the 11 and a half and 12 come in and now yeah need to send the 12's back cuz I just a bit worried about the sizing but we're all good the second sort of dislike I've got with a shoe yeah it is a little bit on the expensive side it's so hard to be talking about a 200 shoe and saying this is great it is a fantastic shoe but also what you're getting with that 200 L is a super durable shoe as well I'd always get at least 1,000 k out of my version one the updated outsol in the shoe should be even better so it should be getting a little bit more mileage out of this but it does last a long time I can't wait to bring a full whizbang pop review once I've done my thks in the shoe will slot it into a review somewhere down the line and speaking of cost maybe you're better off at going for something like the Nova blast 4 for example £65 less that's a big chunk of cash and really the Nova blast is a superb allaround shoe the super blast it is slightly quicker without a doubt it's just a little bit more responsive less bouncy foam you get here and it is better suited for your long runs just a bit firmer bit lighter and just a bit Smo smoother through the footstrike overall but I'd say stick with the Nova blast if you're just looking for something that you can do all of your runs pretty well and you're not doing too many long runs it's a shoe that's I'd say around about 90% as fast and really will suit the vast majority of people unless you're looking for the absolute Crema creme or if you're very fortunate to have the budget and you want to get both of them then you could use you all your sort of regular daily training in the Nova blast and then use this for your marathon training long runs and maybe even a marathon racing shoe at the weekend moving on the Neo Vista hit the scene a few weeks ago I gave it a rave review it was fantastic £50 cheaper and it really is a bit of a shoe at the moment has a nylon plate in it so slightly different feel very different ride going through the shoe it's bouncier and it's softer and it does soak up those easy Mars a little bit better the super blast picks up the pace a little bit better and it does have a firmer ride both these shoes supremely comfortable I could personally choose this type of upper rather than the booty upper just get a better lock down in this one and with the near Vista it's just a little less stable around the corners where this is absolutely Rock Solid and the super blast will probably last a little bit longer with this better out soole with the shoe there as well so I really think you're getting about the same sort of value yes the super blast is a little bit more expensive but it will last a lot longer I think in my opinion then finally something like the Nike Invincible version 3 around about 20 cheaper here the Invincible is a lot bouncier it's roomier it's heavier it's perfect for those easy recovery runs but again a shoe manufacturers using their Flagship foam without putting that carbon plate in the shoe the super blast is just much smoo through the stride a lot firmer much more Nimble and lightweight and just better at a more wider range of speeds where something like the Invincible it's really is just your sort of steady marathon pace really steady marathon pace and easing recovery run sort of shoe so let's bring this all together what do I think of the superlast well it's a fantastic shoe without a doubt it is definitely going into my rotation I'm going to finish my miles I've got about 300 miles left in my last pair of version one so I'm not going to use this straight away it's not a revolutionary update get subscribed and see if this shoe will be making into my top three shoes of the year which we normally launch around about December time if you are interested in other asset shoes we've got a complete assets comparison guide again completely unsponsored B all the asset shoes with I money check that out that is up here coming up next let me know if you've got any questions down in the comments about the super blast I'll catch up and answer all of those down there keep it working hard guys keep done I'm have to get some more marathon training done we see you very soon in the next one\n\nUser Question: asics superblast 2\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context above."}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'temperature':

welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex super Blast [Music] 2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are not necessarily directly comparable shoes because the zoomfly has a plate in the midsole whereas the super blast doesn't but they are both super trainers that are designed to do a wide range of runs they're both very popular shoes and people are quite Keen to see this comparison so so here it is the zoom fly is the cheapest shoe it cost £155 or $170 the super Blast 2 is £200 or $200 the zoomfly is a little bit heavier is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super blast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size they both have an 8 mm drop and the stack height on the superlast is a little bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel 37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly is 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the 4ot comes to the design with the Nike you got two layer woven mesh upper with a fair amount of padding around the heel significant internal heel counter as well to add some structure at the back of the shoe you got a duel density midsole the top layer is made from Nike zoomx foam there's a carbon plate running the full length of the shoe in between that it's a fairly flexible plate a little bit more so than on their Racing shoes but still a stiffening agent to add to the midside to add a bit more propulsion and then you have Nike's sr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the shoe there which is little bit less lively than the zoomx foam above it but adds a bit more kind of durability and stability to the shoe got a waffle full out sole coverage at the forefoot and heel big cutout in the middle that shows off the carbon plate in the mids soole and then with the super blast you also have a dual density mids soole but most of it is made from asx's FF turbo plus foam their best foam the bounciest foam the most responsive foam used in shoes like the metas speed Paris racing shoe series and then you have some FF blast Plus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe there as well got a pretty simple engineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of padding at the back bit of structure at the back you nothing too much going on with the upper there and then you've got reasonable outsole coverage there on the bottom you these patches of the ahar plus rubber which is pretty good in terms of grip lots of exposed phone but you know the key areas are covered there not any problems with grip with either [Music] shoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 for both of these Brands that's the size I use across the Nike and aex range and I've had no problems with the fit of either both have enough room around the toes good hold around the heer mid foot they're both pretty comfortable uppers all around I would say know four super trainers that can do very fast running as well as easy running they do have very accommodating uppers that make them comfortable to pull on every single day Nikes are probably a little bit more dialed in around the toes you know it's a slightly more cramped fit I'd say than a super blast but not in a way that was unpleasant at all it just gives it maybe a slightly racier feel at times but overall I was very happy with the fit of both shoes yeah great uppers good comfort and I would stick to your normal running shoe [Music] size onto the run test then and I think these are two excellent shoes two of the shoes I've really enjoyed running in this year the superl 2 more or less just picked up where the super blast one left off in being pretty much the standard Setter for plate free super trainers like it's a pretty unique shoe and one that I don't think any other brands really been able to emulate in terms of that very versatile plate free design whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big upgrade on previous models of the shoe which were heavy clunky not that good and the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's a plated super trainer that can match up to the best in that category including shoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or the H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good competitor for someone like a super blast as well if you don't mind training with the plate so super Blast 2 we had in for testing first did a lot of running when we initially had it in and I actually took it away last week for a trip and just used it for everything you know just walking around all my runs one of those trips where you only have a very small bag on a budget Airline so you have one pair of shoes for everything and it's perfect for that because it is such a versatile shoe it is comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it you know does everything really well it's also quite a nice looking shoe I think in this colorway although some will disagree it's also just amazingly light for its size which really helps you pick up the pace in it so I did like kind of a progression running the shoe while I was away I've done some full sessions in the shoe as well and while it is quite a big shoe something I always noticed because of the way I am quite a high Cadence Runner quite a shuffly runner and a big kind of boatlike design like this sometimes feels a bit big on my foot but if I kind of get over that I can run fast in the shoe without any problems got a lot of response from the foam and you know it does feel good for those fast Paces but really excels I think for kind of cruising around daily runs like progression runs you're moving to kind of steady Paces kind of quick but not fast I guess how I describe those kind of runs where you are moving with a bit of effort but you're not really going for it and long runs in particular just really good shoe for eating up a lot of mileage and just amazingly light for its size like all these super trainers that come out with plates designed very explicitly for fast running things like the Nike and other shoes like that are all heavier than the super loss despite the fact has a higher stack just because that foam is so light and that does really help it be a more versatile shoe the Nike is also a very versatile shoe though and that certainly wasn't the case with previous models of The Zo flight like this is now isue you can go and do fast runs in I've done a couple of hard sessions in it I've gone down the track and done a 10 times one mile session a nasty progression run on the road done a pretty decent steady run again quick but not fast over about 90 minutes where I was running pretty well and you know at the back end of marathon training this was a shoe that I really enjoyed using for all the runs I was doing around that time so pretty good workouts lots of long runs of progression runs and it just felt really good for them like it's an exceptionally comfortable shoe given the speed you have here I would say it starts with the upper which is really nice to slip on and then the underfoot feel is really quite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that you can run very fast in and that's a bit similar to the super blast but I think you have a slightly smaller and more Nimble design with the Nike and although it's know heavier does feel a bit more kind of fast and direct than the super blast because it has a I think a slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker like kind of you know you get pushed off the toes a bit more on the Nike I would say and it just has a slightly smaller design around the heel which has a heel Striker with a high Cadence I do notice if I'm trying to run fast so I tell you like when it comes to you know really allout sessions or trying to hold a fast pace for a long time if you're looking for a stand in racing shoe I think that's where the Nike excels a little bit more than the super blast just because it does have a bit more of a racy feel a faster feel I find it easier to sustain Paces in the Nike than the super blast super blast really for me fits more in the daily trainer mold where you know can do everything and it can go fast but I think it excels more at kind of slightly more relaxed places than the Nike both I would also say are surprisingly stable for such big shoes like they both got pretty wide bases both got designs that you know are not necessarily going to be inherently stable with those big stacks of foam on there but they're welld designed I had no concerns about running in them kind of on any terrain uh and certainly no concerns in terms of pronation or anything like that so I did do a short run wearing both shoes at the same time you actually have a softer feel with the Nike I think it almost feels a little bit more flexible like the superlast is quite renowned for being quite a stiff shoe despite the fact it doesn't have a plate which does help it run fast but I know not everyone loves that for kind of more relaxed Paces like I quite like it for those relaxed Paces that stiffness kind of pushes you through and rolls you on it's not uncomfortable at all but it's surprising actually that even though the Nike has a plate it didn't really feel that much different in terms of stiffness when you comparing these two shoes directly on the run and you get I think a little bit more pop and lift off the toes with the Nike with that plate in there and the way the rocket I think just works a bit better for me rolling me through my foot strike where youve got the quite sharp tapered rocker on the super blast I think that helps a lot in terms of like a big amount of Bounce and if you're a bit more of a loping runner I think you'll probably engage that and enjoy that a bit more than I do but I do think just get yeah a bit more punch off the Nike superlast feels a bit more relaxed it's kind of a strange to both of these shoes actually I would say feel quite similar at a range of Paces like there are some shoes where you really feel that they're a bit more direct and firm and aggressive when you start running quick in them but both of these feel like oh you can run in these at very relax Paces Run them at fast Paces they still feel quite similar which is nice like it's great for a training Sho to be able to do lots of different runs in like that and they always feel quite comfortable and have stability but you can run nice and quick in them as [Music] well so verdict this is a really tough choice I think these are both excellent shoes that do a range of jobs really well they're really versatile shoes they're comfortable I like wearing them both for easy runs and then they do both have Pace you can go and do fast sessions in them and you can even use both as standing Racing shoes especially for longer distances because there is a lot of pace there as well as protection and comfort with all the foam you have Under Foot so when it comes to picking between the two shoes there a few things you could look at to help you on that front I mean one is just simply the price the Nike is cheaper so that's an easy objective win for the Nike and given that both these shoes are quite similar in performance that is quite a big deal you know you could certainly pick up the Nike make a saving and have a really good shoe then the ride field I think you've got a slightly more cruisy feel with the super blast it's a bit better for kind of loping through those easy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a bit more comfortable pulling on for every single day because it doesn't have a plate in there it's got a nice relaxed upper it feels really good at easy paces and you can step up the pace when you want to and the Nike is a bit nimbler bit more punch from the plate if you are looking for more of an explicit fast trainer to add to your rotation I think it does the job a little bit better but it is also very versatile for sure got choice about whether to plate or not to plate like not sure it makes a huge difference in this case myself like certainly there's a nice feeling in running a shoe without a plate and running fast and all that but superlast has got a big old super foam in there it's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a similar way in many ways as having the plate that said I do think it's a bit easier to maintain you know fast Paces over long distances in the Nike so maybe that's a mental thing or maybe that actually is the plate coming into play so if you don't want to use a plate to shoot obviously a super Blaster is an easy winner there so that is something that you know some people want to consider so obviously if you're looking for one shoe to do it all I'd probably get the Nike myself if you're quite keen on racing because I think it's a slightly better racing shoe and it does those easy runs well if you're looking for a shoe to add to rotation just to have with like a carbon plate racing shoe to do to do those really fast workouts in I think the super blast works really well I think that's the Fantastic that's probably the best two shoe rotation out there I think at the moment is to get the super blast for pretty much all your training and then a carbon plate racing shoe for races and the odd really hard session super blast just does that role so well and if you're looking for like a fast trainer to slip in the middle of a rot I think both work pretty much equally well so it's more whether you want the kind of lighter but bigger design of the super blast the slightly punchier kind of plated Nimble design of the zoom fly like again it's really close here so I think I'd really struggle to pick between them I think I'd probably just lean towards the Nike myself I just suits my running style a little bit better just because I have a high Cadence I said I really enjoyed just having the super blast as my only shoe away on a trip it was really nice to put it on every day it's a shoe you can really fall in love with by using over and over again so yeah very hard to call probably the Nike just as it for me especially as it's a little bit cheaper but certainly very case for either shoe both very much stand out of [Music] 2024 that's our comparison of the zoom fly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know what you think in the comments below please like And subscribe ring the little bell we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Asics Novablast 5 vs Superblast 2: Top new Asics running shoes compared':\n\nhey this is mik from the r testers this is the aex no blast 5 and this is the aex super Blast 2 two shoes as you'll know from our multitester reviews we are big fans of now these are also two shoes that sit at very different price points super blast do is the more expensive the no blast 5 is a lot cheaper and it's a lot easier to get a hold of than this shoe now what we're going to do in this video is take you through the key differences and give you a sense of whether there is any kind of overlap in terms of experience in terms of the types of runs that these shoes can work for and whether no blast 5 could give you a super blast like experience for a little bit less money so first we'll get into those key differences then give you our multi test to take on whether you should go for the Nova blast 5 or the super Blast 2 so let's get into those nitty-gritty details and differences between the Nova blast 5 and Super Blast 2 let's start with price and the noov blast 5 is considerably cheaper than the super Blast 2 while both are offered in stand width size options only weightwise the Nova blast 5 weighed in heavier for us than the super Blast 2 in a UK men's size eight you're getting shoes both of 8 mm drops with the super Blast 2 offering a bigger stack of cushioning at both the heel and the 4f foot compared to the latest Nova blast at the upper it's engineered woven mesh versus jackard mesh with similar tongue and lacing combinations used and the Nova blast 5 heel collar offering a touch more padding there's big differences at the midsole where the no no blast uses the new FF blast Max for a softer feel compared to the Eco plus included in the Nova blast 4 and also the super Blast 2 where it's combined with the FF blast turbo plus found in asx's metas Speed Carbon races asex adopts a similar trampoline inspired outs soole design on both shoes to spread those Foams across a relatively broad base to bring that bounce throughout the shoe you're also getting similar outo designs with the no blast offering a bit more coverage at the for foot and lateral areas of the shoe comes to the fit of the super Blast 2 and the no blast 5 I've got the same size in both shoes which is a uk9 us10 with aex it's the same size I use across the aex range and both of them have a really good fit for me I'd say you have got really roomy forfoot on the no blast 5 but even as someone with a narrow foot like I am you know have too much room there as someone with a narrow foot but it's not being a problem in any way with lockdown or anything like that got right amount of length at the front there in terms of room for my toes good hold around the heel and midfoot I find them both very comfortable shoes just to slip on day after day so yeah no concerns with the fit I'd stick to your normal size okay so the fit for me in the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 quite a similar fit actually um both very comfortable I'm a size eight in the UK i' very much like wearing both these shoes they're both AIC shoes so a similar fit what I would say is that the um nov blast 5 is a little bit more forgiving it feels a little bit wider and the upper just feels a little bit um more flexible in in terms of how it puts pressure on your feet so uh if you maybe have a slightly wider foot you're probably going to be better off with the Nova blast 5 over the super Blast 2 but there's not a lot in it and I find both of these shoes very very comfortable so I would stick to my size in both of them so in terms of fit it's been very good for me in both of the shoes I've got them both in a UK size a that my typical run shoe size and that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in ax shoes now what I would say is the key differences for me is that with the Nova blast 5 it definitely has a more of a relaxed fit and I would say you know it's a bit more roomy in the toe box of the shoe I think it opens up a little bit more of going further back in the shoe as well and if you prefer something that's a bit more accommodating particularly if you've got slightly wider feet then I think that would be a better fit for most people I've got quite skinny narrow feet and while it is a lot rier I found it's not been overly roomier or generous with that space I think with the super blast too definitely does narrow a little bit more it's not super narrow in any way but I do think like the space up front in the toe box is still very good that hold at the midfoot is very good as well too another area I think is a key difference for me is that there's just a bit more padding around the hill col in the Nova blast 5 where you know it's definitely issue for me that's geared towards kind of giving you a little bit more of that Comfort side where you're getting that padding a pretty good amount of padding on the hill col and the super Blast 2 but it definitely isn't as much as it is on the no blast 5 so the things for me would be that the Nova blast 5 is a lot more roomy particularly the front of the shoe and and the middle section of the shoe the super blast to has less kind of padding at the hill collar but generally for me I think going through the size for both of these shoes should be fine for most people let's give you a quick word on fit then in amongst the pistachio shells on this bench and in the ax superlast 2 and the over blast five i r in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half I think these are both really kind of roomy accommodating shoes there's loads of space in the toe box up front big thumbs width there nice clearance across the top of the toes super lastar to for me they hold really well in the midfoot the heels are nicely padded I have no slipping at all Everything feels locked down and comfortable and nice and I would recommend going through to issues particularly if you want to go Long Haul because they're plenty roomy in the Nova blast 5 these are even area I mean there's so much Flex in the toe box here these are sort of spacious some people have complained about the fact that they feel too spacious particularly if you've got narrow feet maybe they will feel a bit wide but I ran in my regular running shoe size and I found everything good I I really look for lots of toebox room so look you can see you've got lots of clearance on the end there's plenty of Flex for the toes that TOS the top lock down across the midfoot was nice and secure I had good hold in the heels as well tongues take the Ed jof no problems with this and I I recommend going true to Siz in the shoe unless you really want a snug fit where or you've got a narrow foot where you might want to think about going half a size down so the aex super Blast 2 and the aex no blast 5 are both shoes that I've really liked testing this year I think they both fit their roles very well within the ax lineup with the no blast 5 being more of the mid-range shoe the daily trainer that's designed to be pretty good value appeal to a wide range of Runners have a fairly inoffensive ride that's actually no very pleasant ride in fact and one that I think will work for lots of different Runners you obvious got a load of cushioning there under foot but it's still a fairly lightweight shoe got a slight rocker there that does help you roll through your stri foot strike smoothly and actually that's been improved a little bit on the no blast 5 compared to the no blast 4 for me thanks to the redesigned heel bevel which is a little bit less huge than the one on the no blast 4 which does make it a slightly smoother ride but you've got a good foam in the Mido there which is comfortable but it's not necessarily as responsive as exciting as the stuff you are going to get on the super Blast 2 for me the no blast 5 definitely works best for kind of easy runs relaxed da training long runs that kind of thing you can pick up the pace in the shoe but you're not getting a huge amount of responsiveness out of this foam it's more just the fact that it's a pretty lightweight shoe and one with a nice rocker that means you can turn your feet over quite well the foam is soft but not too mushy for me so I find I can run faster in the shoe without it feeling like I'm you know waiting through a big wedge of soft foam so it's reasonably versatile but certainly not as versatile as something like the super blast which is a kind of a special shoe so it's obviously a lot more expensive than an overlast 5 it's build as a super training without a plate you've got the huge stack of asx's best foam there the FF turbo plus and that foam just is a lot livelier a lot more responsive and it it really makes it a lot easier to pick up the pace in the super blast compared to the no blast it's also a lighter shoe than the no blast and really you can kind of do everything that you would do in the no blast you can do it in the super blast and then it's got a lot more range in terms of that top end speed like it's not necessarily a shoe that I absolutely adore running fast in myself because style of Runner I am I've got a high Cadence fairly short stride like quite a shuffly runner and you know it's a big shoe so it's not a heavy shoe but it is a big shoe and sometimes turning it over it can a little bit too boatlike and big for me I actually would be quite Keen for them to shave off a bit of that heel bevel on the super Blast 3 as they have done with the no blast 5 I think that would probably improve it a little bit for me but I certainly can pick up the pace in it I do enjoy running it a lot recently I took it away for a trip was the only shoe I had for everything and you know it's a comfortable shoe to walk around in it then can do all the runs I did on that trip at a range of paces and it just works all of for all of them you know really very well and you do get a much livelier feel from the foam in this midsole compared to the one in the nose blast 5 so when I was running both of them at the same time that's the thing that really comes across like the super blast feels lighter and it feels a lot poppier and more responsive under the for foot in particular you get a lot more lift off the toes in general just feels like a you know more exciting ride got a denser foam on the nose blast it feels like a much more solid shoe you know a heavier shoe which it is and one that's a bit more suited just for cruising along it is still a pretty lightweight shoe like I say and it turns over well but compared to the superl you can get a lot more kind of pace and liveliness out the shoe and it's also stiffer which I think does make it more comfortable that pace that stiffness might detract from the ride a little bit at easier PES for some people like I don't really mind it myself you know it's not a shoe that's designed for Pure Comfort but it does feel fine for me on easy runs but then the extra flexibility you get from the NOA blast might appeal to some people when they're looking at just cruising around their daily training like there's a fairly big wedge of foam you get on the super blast and it does help with pushing you along but it is quite stiff like I say okay so you'll notice that I'm still not holding up the super Blast 2 because Mike still has it so I need to go and get that off him at some point desperate to get that shoe back so I can do some training um for uh Dubai Marathon uh that's coming up in a few weeks uh so these two shoes are shoes that um if you if I reviewed the no blast 4 and the super Blast 2 and compared them they're quite similar in a in in in how they run they both have a same level of firmness in the midsole they both have similar level of respons and it feels like uh the Nova blast 4 took a lot of learnings from the super blast um to provide a better all round versatile experience for runners um and I very much like both of those shoes especially for training uh a longer distance where I want to retain a consistent effort but I still want a bit of comfort and a lot of padding as well uh the Nova blast 5 uh it's quite different than superlast 2 now U because this new midell phone this FF blast Max is um a bit softer than what was in the Nova blast 4 and as a result it changes the ride of the shoe uh quite a bit for me in comparison to the to the Nova blast 4 the result of that is that um it's definitely a lot softer than the super Blast 2 um but also you don't get that same um turnover that you get in the super Blast 2 Su Blast 2 is a shoe that isn't very soft um and it has a quite a rigid midsole so it rolls your foot forward and really helps you maintain a nice fluid Pace I use the superlast 2 quite a lot for longer training sessions um where I'm trying to maintain maybe my marathon pace and it just really helps you just smoothly just cover that pace it's not really noticeable like a carbon plate shoe or something where you can feel the the carbon plate doing something uh to to impact the way that that you're running it's just a really smooth motion very comfortable nice level of padding for running at PACE and doesn't in any way um sap your energy or slow you down or anything like that but still retains a good level of comfort as well uh the no blast 5 is a Sho that um because of this softer midell foam it doesn't work so well as the no blast 4 or the super Blast 2 when you are uh running faster because for me it feels like I'm hitting that a little bit too hard um and I'm not getting a lot back there's a little of energy return you get back from this phone when you're running at a slower Pace or more of a consistent Pace but when you're picking picking up the speed um I feel like I'm really putting too much pressure into that mid cell Pham and it's not giving it me back it's it's it's sapping the energy a little bit um when I'm running faster uh I think that's really the the the key to what the Nova blast 5 is now I think it's more a daily shoe that fits more into that easier realm longer runs maybe where you just want comfort and you're not trying to pick up the pace or maintain the tempo Pace or anything like that um and and the superlast 2 is all all out designed for uh those consistent long run Paces uh it's a fantastic marathon training shoe probably be a great Marathon shoe I haven't used it for a marathon uh race but the way that the shoe rides is just very fluid very comfortable um but really allows you to maintain a pace which for me for marathan training would be about 4 minute 30 km uh if I'm going out to do like a 25k 30k long run and and that shoe just Smooths your feet and just makes you just be able to do that run really really comfortably without really adding anything to it it's a very natural ride as well it's not really forcing your foot into a specific position no blast 5 I wouldn't use it for those sorts of runs I think it I'd really feel it after a while it just deadening the the impact and not really giving me a lot back but it is a very enjoyable shoe to wear for those easier runs or a longer run where you're just trying to just maintain a nice comfortable effort you get a little bit of bounce back back it's definitely very comfortable shoot to a but for me it definitely sits into that realm of easier day shoes now um as opposed to a versatile option Su Blast 2 is very very versatile shoe great for easy runs I know Kieran thinks it's a fantastic easy run shoe I don't use it for easy runs uh I prefer a lot more softness when I'm running easy runs so if I'm just doing easy runs I'd probably pick the no blast 5 but for a shoe that is really really well designed for faster training sessions at longer at longer distance uh you can also do a lot more with it so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I've done over 50k in the Nova blast 5 now I have done near to 100 miles in the super Blast 2 and what I would say is these are two shoes that are very good at being ones that you just throw on and they are very easy to forget about what's going on in and around your foot to be ones that you know really can kind of tick that mileage off you know really get that running time in your feet without really thinking too much about it there definitely are some differences between these two shoes I think does kind of influence how I would use them how I think a lot of people may end up using them and want to use them I think the first uh Factor area for me is the weights now these aren't heavy shoes either than my heavy shoes but when you consider at least for me that the super L 2 is you know is a bigger stack shoe comes in a ways in lighter for me than no last five you know it just you know feels like it runs a little bit nicer with that weight just handles that weight a little bit better now it isn't sloppy and isn't heavy or cumbersome and the no blast 5 and it's not a lower stack shoe by a huge amount but I just found that you know having that kind of light away on a on a Max taoe is is a very nice kind of experience overall and it really kind of kind of feeds into what you're getting in the midsole what you're getting below you know uh in the out soole as well and what that kind of does for the ride in these shoes I think for me the no blast youve got the FF blast Max for me it's spread across a kind of larger surface area and what that does first and foremost is just create something that is a lot or kind of naturally very stable I think it's also a lot sof the feeling than the kind of dual density mids cell makeup in the super Blast 2 I think that what does for me the no blast 5 it just you know Comfort is the first thing it ticks off it rolls through very nicely very smoothly and for me when I've running it I found it felt more comfortable to do that kind of easier and moderate Paces when I've tried to run a little bit quicker in it it's not you know been totally uncomfortable to do that but I've just felt that when I've tried to do that in the super Blast 2 it's felt more at home it's felt more depth and that's really down to that midsole that dual density midell being you know there's some softness there but there's definitely some firmness as well too there's some bounce as well I think there a more prominent bounce for me in the super blast 2it I think the rocker is more prominent as well you know the rocker is pretty good in this in the no blast 5 but I think coupled with all the things that you're getting in these super Blast 2 it just rolls through a little bit more aggressively for me and I've raced in it I've done track sessions in it I've done faster sessions I've done shorter and long kind of runs in it as well and I felt it's covered you or felt comfortable to do it at all of those Paces I think the other thing I mentioned other videos I think transitioning from those different Paces you know the super Blu does a very good job of that and that's why is kind of a standout do it all shoot I think the Nova blast five for me when I have tried to mix the Pacers in a single run I haven't found it as comfortable I haven't found it as Lively and bouncy barring the first run that I did in it but it's a definitely good experience in both these shoes just for very different runs so I think these are good daily trainer shoes you know relatively kind of big stack shoes as well for me there clearly one that is a little bit more versatile and a little bit more friendly towards running a little bit more Tempo and faster um but definitely good shoes for me other areas I think the out Souls I think you know for me I think the no blast 5 is giving you a little bit more rubber on that outsole and I think durability wise I'm seeing less wear obviously less running time but for me the super plus 2 has been H holding up pretty well obviously still getting some exposed areas there's definitely a bit more more rubber on the Nova blast 5 for me in those kind of similar areas as well so for me from a you know durability point of view I think you're going to get a bit more from no blast 5 gripping has been fine for me I've run in kind of wetter and drri conditions for both these aren't the best kind of you know Road running outsoles available but they seem to be up to task or have been up to task in my run so yeah two very good shoes two very good Asic shoes two very good daily trainer shoes but it's definitely one that I pick of the other that's not to say the other one is bad but I just think the other or there's one shoe here that works a little bit better for me and I'll get to that in my verdict so in testing I've run north of 30 mil in the new Nova blast 5 I've run much more in the super Blast 2 including a full Marathon test in this shoe that's on the channel now if you want to go and find it all of that has been across a range of paces and terrain I also did a side bys side Mile with one shoe on each foot to really tease out the differences between these two shoes and here's how that went so I've just done my side by side Mile with the super Blast 2 on my right foot I've got the Nova blast five on my left foot minute you put the shoes on you feel the higher stack in the super blast you can feel that there's that extra stiffness and firmness in the midsole compared to the softer novablast 5 which feel sort of sinky when you first put them on by comparison superlast to sort of you know they're cushion but they sort of hold you up and you're expecting that kind of stiffness and that roll through and that transition to come uh as a result of a slightly kind of stiffer ride there's a more immediacy as a result of that they're both big Cush C shoes though I don't think the superlast 2 you know sacrificing that much cushion for me anyway they it does feel like a bigger shoe on the foot there's a lot more kind of heft to it doesn't feel quite as Nimble you know it's a thing to say that NOA blast feels a bit more compact by comparison because the Nova blast is not a compact shoe by any stretch of the imagination but it does feel I mean they're about the same weight but I would say the no blast 5 actually feels a bit lighter I think it's just because you've got more of the superlast underf foot stability wise I quite like the firmness of the super Blast 2 I think that provides a bit more of a stable platform for me a bit more reliability you do feel a little bit of mush and wobble I think into the Nova blast five if anything I expected over blast 5 in my head for the runs that i' done with it initially to be a bit more like the super Blast 2 but actually I think the over blast 4 which had that kind of slightly additional stiffness firmness underf foot now feels much more like the super blast than the Nova blast 5 does the Nova blast 5 brings softness so how does that translate then well if you've run in the super blast to if you've watched reviews and you've thought actually maybe they might be a little bit too stiff for you to go Long Haul into the long miles and you wanted more softness and the Nova blast 5 is going to add that it gets to the energy in a different way though it's slightly more reliant on a sink and a bounce for the energy to come back where you get a lot of energy and bounce from the super Blast 2 but you also get a little bit of that kind of immediacy from the stiffness that comes so it's a bit quicker to respond it's a bit punchier as a result there's a bit more kind of top speed potential I think of the superlast 2 it's overall just a bit more of an energetic shoe where the Nova blast 5 now I think bit more cushioning probably bit more accommodating for going slower and longer whereas the super Blast 2 is probably better you know cruising those kind of tempo Paces maybe a little bit higher up if you don't mind running in a big shoe that is how I would divide those shoes but we'll do the verdict back in the office it comes to my verdict like these are both good shoes and shoes that fit their roles well within the aex lineup if you are looking for one shoe absolutely everything and you want you're prepare to pay for a special feeling under fit you are going to get it with a super blast 2 like it's a pretty amazing shoe it's not one that's entirely to my taste like I've picked out shoes that I prefer to it that are also you know really fun all rounders and all that but it's certainly an amazing shoe one that I do like running in and one that obviously is very popular with people at large like if you are just looking for one shoe to do everything the super blast is the one to do it in if you're looking for a fast training shoe then the super blast is the one to pick over the no blast the no blast is certainly better value you can use it for the same kind of runs as the super blast you're just not going to get the same energetic ride feel and is a bit more kind of cushy and relaxed when it comes to easy runs like you're looking at putting these shoes in a rotation superlast either could be you know a rotation killer a shoe you're used for everything or one that fits into rotation in the middle of it there like picking up the bulk of your mileage with a maybe a very easy comfortable cushion shoe for some easy runs and then a fast plated shoe for you know really top end Speedy stuff whereas the no blast 5 I position more towards the cushion end of things in a rotation I'd want to have you know a faster training shoe alongside this and maybe a racer as well though you can use it for a bit of everything like it doesn't really have the pace that I'd be looking for in an allrounder if you are a newer runner though I think the no blast 5 is a really good allrounder actually I think it's one that will protect the legs well but is fairly lightweight you can use it for some Speedy stuff like if I was a new Runner I wanted one you to do everything I would get the no blast first before know spending loads of money on something like the super blast I think the no blast does play a role in being you know a cheaper version of the super blast in a way and it is a fair bit cheaper but the super blast you know you are paying more for it but you are going to get a big upgrade in performance if you do spend that money okay so my verdict on the super Blast 2 and the Nova blast 5 is obviously the super Blast 2 is a much more expensive shoe um so if it came down to cost and the fact that it's almost impossible to buy the super Blast 2 and I know many of you will comment on this video uh saying that you can't get hold of it sorry about that there's nothing we can do to get them to stock more super blast 2os um but because of that no blast 5 is probably going to be the only option for most people anyway if even if you could get it it's a very expensive shoe2 200 is a lot of money to spend on a training shoe um which is above a lot of people's budget so the no blast 5 comes in under that it's a shoe design for more General Runners it's a shoe design for people that don't want to spend £200 on a running shoe um but it's not as good a shoe um obviously uh it's a lot significantly cheaper than the super Blast 2 um if I was looking at purely the shoes themselves and ignoring the price and the availability of them I would say that super Blast 2 is a far superior shoe um for most runs if you're going to go out and buy a shoe then you wanted something that you could do a lot of stuff in easier runs daily sessions faster sessions um long runs super Blast 2 just ticks off all of those really really well noas 5 doesn't really take off all of those well at all it really ticks off the easier runs and the comfortable training sessions the daily runs where you just want a nice bit of softness uh and comfort and you want to take off the miles uh in as much um with as much padding and and comfort as you can get um but it's really not a huge design for versatility or uh it's defin not sure I'd use if I was training for a marathon I was doing lots of longer sessions or faster sessions so I think it really comes down to that if you're looking between these two shoes and you're not worried about price or availability but obviously if you're just a general Runner that's looking for a comfortable daily shoe you're not going to go for the superlast 2 because it's just so expensive uh and hard to get so out of for me I'm going to go superlast 2 all the way but I understand that the no plus 5 is a more cost effective option but it's limited to easier sessions you can't really do a lot in this shoe after my first run in the no blast 5 where I ran well and the NOA blast 5 gave back good energy I was wondering if they might be a more affordable alternative to the super Blast 2 a sort of super blast light if you will but after logging many more miles in both shoes I don't think that's quite the case here both shoes are enticingly versatile but the superlast 2 is by far the more energetic shoe with a smoother ride and I think a more consistent punch across all the ranges of pace the no boss 5 has energy and it's also a capable Cruiser but but for me the softer Edge just isn't quite as encouraging as the ride you get from the super Blast 2 it just doesn't quite give you that extra oomph I actually think the Nova blast 4 runs more like the super Blast 2 it's a bit firmer a bit snappier now The Sweet Spot for the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 is really cruising from around my marathon pace up to Tempo there's enough cushion on both shoes to eat easy miles in relative Comfort too I could Long Haul in both of these shoes but I find both shoes can get a bit sluggish at my very slowest pace at least when I'm running in my heaviest form when it comes to the fastest training both shoes can be a bit too much shoe on the foot I find for me to want to tackle things like all out of intervals again you can do these sessions in either shoe but I wouldn't say either of them really excels at it over and above some other shoes now the superl 2 is a better shoe all round the grip Superior the ride is snappier but if you're on a budget could you cover the same runs in the over blast five the answer I think is probably yes would they be as good I don't think quite if you're taking money out of the question I'd certainly choose the superlast two out of these two shoes I think on balance is the more accomplished all rounder and the slightly snappier ride which appeals more to the way I run so my take with you should go the A6 blast 5 or the as6 super Blast 2 now the first thing I'll say is that these are two very good daily trainer shoes if you're telling me which one is the best it's a no-brainer it's a super blast too this is the shoe if you want a shoe that can do uncover all of your runs and do it in a really good way then that's what the super Blast 2 is going to give you in terms of the Nova blast 5 being a super blast light I think it works for some of the runs that the super Blast 2 works well at but not all of them I think this is a shoe you get if you you know can't get hold of the super Blast 2 you want a shoe that's accommodating that is comfortable works for shorter and longer runs and I think for me easy to moderate Paces that's really where you know it fits best for me so if that's what would work for you that's what you would look for in a daily trainer Sho and go for the over blast 5 if you want the best shoe between these two shoes the one that can work for faster Paces longer runs shorter runs could be used for track sessions as well it's a super blast 2 you1 I appreciate it's hard to get a hold of but if you can you're going to be rewarded with a very good daily Trainer shoe that weighs in at the kind of standard daily trainer weight and overall it's just a very good shoe one of my favorite shoes to running or to have running this year so for me if I could get a hold of it and you know I'm fortunate that I do have one I would be going for the super Blast 2 if you wanted a shoe that you know and that daily trainer profile that definitely Vees towards being more comfortable but can definitely work for shorter and longer runs easy to modate Paces I'd be going for the Nova blast 5 okay so there you have it that our take on how the Nova blast 5 compares to the super Blast 2 if you got any questions about either of these shoes or other shoes you want to see them compared to do let us know in the comments as always like And subscribe hit that little bell to find out about our latest videos and yeah we'll see you next run test this video\n\nFrom video 'ASICS SUPERBLAST 2 (completely unbiased review)':\n\nthe most anticipated shoe of the year is finally here the aex super blast version 2 the original super blast burst onto the scene last year and almost immediately became one of my absolute favorite alltime training shoes and when I'm not out running testing other shoes this was the shoe I'd reach for about 90% of the time clocking it over 3,000 km in a few different versions of version one with two big updates to version two with the out soole and the upper hereit I was really worried that aex might be messing this one up so is this new model going to live up to my very high expectations or am I going to be scaring eBay to try and find some pairs of version one and as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review right let's get stuck into all of the changes between the version one and version two the price of the Superglass 2 is a little bit more expensive here in the UK now costing £200 most markets around the world it's pretty much the same we have got an updated midsole this big chunk through the middle here which now uses the FF turbo the same as the updated metas speed sky and Edge asex is most premium responsive foam that they offer out there and then we've got a thin layer along the bottom of here of asx's FF blast plus which is what they use for a little bit more durability and also sort of stabilizing the shoe we've got an updated outsole much welcome updated outo this is new aex grip rubber on the bottom here a little bit more grippy here in the wet weather we'll come on to chat about that a little bit later on the review and also you can't get any stones and Pebbles and little hitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe here which I you get all the time on version one when you'd run on sort of more grally areas they filled in all of those holes in slightly different design and pattern on version two and then finally we've got a different updated upper to the shoe here which is now this one piece woven engineered mesh so it's a little bit more stretchy and just has a little bit more movement with the shoe versus version one right let's get stuck into the facts and figures this is is your long distance mileage monster for crushing those long runs out there and it's also one of the very best non-plated racing shoes perfect for like 10K half marathons marathons and also Ultra marathons if they're going to be on the road as well is very much a road shoe although you could do have a little bit of light trail with this great aex grip on the bottom here price-wise this sent me back £200 here in the UK around about €220 $200 around about $320 Australian dollars stack Heights we've got 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and it's basically the same weight as the outgoing model for me this is coming at 288 G that's really really quite light for sure of this size this is in my particular size UK 11 A2 here the old version was 290 so basically exactly the same it is a neutral shoe the upper as I've just said is this lovely engineered mesh upper which Asic say is going to improve the air flow through the shoe midso we've got the FF Turbo plus through the middle here and then the FF blast plus Eco along the bottom of the shoe there there is famously no carbon plate in the shoe and the outsole Now features this aex grip which is these yellow sections here and aex also put this on some of their trail shoes as well so it's very tacky very sticky a lce sort of slow density rubber to try and improve on asx's usually quite poor wet weather performance there are no different wits available at launch but it's pretty good here on the witth side there's also this one Flagship color at launch which is asx's Paris colorway personally I absolutely love this let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments asex say that this is to do with Paris called the city of lights and we've got sunset and sunrise colors here and finally this wasn't true to size I actually ordered a size 12 my usual size and a size 11 and 1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version one and I've stuck with that in version two basically i' just say go half a size down from your regular size or go exactly the same size you had in version one if you had that shoe if you could like and share this video and let us know down in the comments your thoughts on the superl 2 that be great and please check out my website benp parks.com we've got training plans the best running hats in the world some technical gear and Casual gear to keep you going through your training right let's get stuck into the likes my first like here is they didn't mess it up come on I get so worried when you have your absolute favorite shoe out there and a manufacturer releases a new one and you're like please don't mess it up please don't make it really heavy bulky use different materials they have used different materials but all the updates in the shoe have worked really well the upper is just a little bit more breathable the key area such as the ankle lock down absolutely fantastic no slipping no blisses no hot spots nice gusseted tongue here just gives the perfect right amount of padding so your foot stays nicely locked down yes I was a bit worried my foot might move around a little bit at the front of the shoe with this woven mesh upper but it just stays perfectly in place so no problems there and also finally thank you to ax for not increasing the weight actually for me brought it down very very so slightly super lightweight shoe it is absolutely amazing how a shoe can be this light and it just feels so much fun to run in my second like with the shoe is this updated midsole foam it's just ever so slightly more Poppy and responsive but really very very similar if you're a fan of version one you're going to love this updated foam in version two It just strikes that perfect balance in a shoe that can just have that sudden turn with speed of course there's plenty of faster dedicated 5K and 10K shoes with plates and things like that there but that's not what this shoe is all about this shoe is perfect for crunching those long distance marathon training runs or marathon races as well if you don't want to be using a carbon plate and really if you don't want to have a carbon plate in your shoe there really is nothing faster out there than the aex super blast version 2 and then finally my third like with the shoe is this updated outsole the super blast was okay in the wet it really wasn't that great but the new aex grip they put on the bottom of the shoe here just means all of that worry has gone away when I have running it in the wet it's just gripped super fantastically and you really can feel the difference even walking around the house the you one it just feels different it's lot more tacky when aex had all their problems with their grip with their wet weather grip in like the Nova Blast 2 and three it really wasn't very good this you don't have to worry about it at all fantastic update aex well done finally got a shoe that you can trust in the wet weather and also you can just take this out on some light Trails as well and it will handle those absolutely fine some fire roads and things like that you'll be good to go here moving on to the dislikes this is really hard to be honest my first dislike isn't really even about the shoe it's just about all the supply issues that you have with the superlast and I don't know why aexs are like this the shoe sells out so quickly pretty much sold out on launch day all around the world maybe it's all just marketing I don't know there's nothing in this shoe that you can't get on all of the other ax shoes the materials are all available but they really seem to limit Supply I can only assume I don't know why that is but this shoe will be selling out very very quickly if you can get a pair you want to get a pair don't dilly dally just go and get that order in and also the shoe was meant to launch on Friday just gone on the aex website here in the UK they didn't even launch because I think they had supply issues themselves and they delayed their launch again I don't know that's just what I suspect even assets can't get it right I got my player from sport shoes got up at 5:30 in the morning to try and secure a pair which I managed to do so very very happy with that got the 11 and a half and 12 come in and now yeah need to send the 12's back cuz I just a bit worried about the sizing but we're all good the second sort of dislike I've got with a shoe yeah it is a little bit on the expensive side it's so hard to be talking about a 200 shoe and saying this is great it is a fantastic shoe but also what you're getting with that 200 L is a super durable shoe as well I'd always get at least 1,000 k out of my version one the updated outsol in the shoe should be even better so it should be getting a little bit more mileage out of this but it does last a long time I can't wait to bring a full whizbang pop review once I've done my thks in the shoe will slot it into a review somewhere down the line and speaking of cost maybe you're better off at going for something like the Nova blast 4 for example £65 less that's a big chunk of cash and really the Nova blast is a superb allaround shoe the super blast it is slightly quicker without a doubt it's just a little bit more responsive less bouncy foam you get here and it is better suited for your long runs just a bit firmer bit lighter and just a bit Smo smoother through the footstrike overall but I'd say stick with the Nova blast if you're just looking for something that you can do all of your runs pretty well and you're not doing too many long runs it's a shoe that's I'd say around about 90% as fast and really will suit the vast majority of people unless you're looking for the absolute Crema creme or if you're very fortunate to have the budget and you want to get both of them then you could use you all your sort of regular daily training in the Nova blast and then use this for your marathon training long runs and maybe even a marathon racing shoe at the weekend moving on the Neo Vista hit the scene a few weeks ago I gave it a rave review it was fantastic £50 cheaper and it really is a bit of a shoe at the moment has a nylon plate in it so slightly different feel very different ride going through the shoe it's bouncier and it's softer and it does soak up those easy Mars a little bit better the super blast picks up the pace a little bit better and it does have a firmer ride both these shoes supremely comfortable I could personally choose this type of upper rather than the booty upper just get a better lock down in this one and with the near Vista it's just a little less stable around the corners where this is absolutely Rock Solid and the super blast will probably last a little bit longer with this better out soole with the shoe there as well so I really think you're getting about the same sort of value yes the super blast is a little bit more expensive but it will last a lot longer I think in my opinion then finally something like the Nike Invincible version 3 around about 20 cheaper here the Invincible is a lot bouncier it's roomier it's heavier it's perfect for those easy recovery runs but again a shoe manufacturers using their Flagship foam without putting that carbon plate in the shoe the super blast is just much smoo through the stride a lot firmer much more Nimble and lightweight and just better at a more wider range of speeds where something like the Invincible it's really is just your sort of steady marathon pace really steady marathon pace and easing recovery run sort of shoe so let's bring this all together what do I think of the superlast well it's a fantastic shoe without a doubt it is definitely going into my rotation I'm going to finish my miles I've got about 300 miles left in my last pair of version one so I'm not going to use this straight away it's not a revolutionary update get subscribed and see if this shoe will be making into my top three shoes of the year which we normally launch around about December time if you are interested in other asset shoes we've got a complete assets comparison guide again completely unsponsored B all the asset shoes with I money check that out that is up here coming up next let me know if you've got any questions down in the comments about the super blast I'll catch up and answer all of those down there keep it working hard guys keep done I'm have to get some more marathon training done we see you very soon in the next one\n\nUser Question: asics superblast 2\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context

welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex super Blast [Music] 2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are not necessarily directly comparable shoes because the zoomfly has a plate in the midsole whereas the super blast doesn't but they are both super trainers that are designed to do a wide range of runs they're both very popular shoes and people are quite Keen to see this comparison so so here it is the zoom fly is the cheapest shoe it cost £155 or $170 the super Blast 2 is £200 or $200 the zoomfly is a little bit heavier is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super blast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size they both have an 8 mm drop and the stack height on the superlast is a little bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel 37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly is 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the 4ot comes to the design with the Nike you got two layer woven mesh upper with a fair amount of padding around the heel significant internal heel counter as well to add some structure at the back of the shoe you got a duel density midsole the top layer is made from Nike zoomx foam there's a carbon plate running the full length of the shoe in between that it's a fairly flexible plate a little bit more so than on their Racing shoes but still a stiffening agent to add to the midside to add a bit more propulsion and then you have Nike's sr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the shoe there which is little bit less lively than the zoomx foam above it but adds a bit more kind of durability and stability to the shoe got a waffle full out sole coverage at the forefoot and heel big cutout in the middle that shows off the carbon plate in the mids soole and then with the super blast you also have a dual density mids soole but most of it is made from asx's FF turbo plus foam their best foam the bounciest foam the most responsive foam used in shoes like the metas speed Paris racing shoe series and then you have some FF blast Plus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe there as well got a pretty simple engineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of padding at the back bit of structure at the back you nothing too much going on with the upper there and then you've got reasonable outsole coverage there on the bottom you these patches of the ahar plus rubber which is pretty good in terms of grip lots of exposed phone but you know the key areas are covered there not any problems with grip with either [Music] shoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 for both of these Brands that's the size I use across the Nike and aex range and I've had no problems with the fit of either both have enough room around the toes good hold around the heer mid foot they're both pretty comfortable uppers all around I would say know four super trainers that can do very fast running as well as easy running they do have very accommodating uppers that make them comfortable to pull on every single day Nikes are probably a little bit more dialed in around the toes you know it's a slightly more cramped fit I'd say than a super blast but not in a way that was unpleasant at all it just gives it maybe a slightly racier feel at times but overall I was very happy with the fit of both shoes yeah great uppers good comfort and I would stick to your normal running shoe [Music] size onto the run test then and I think these are two excellent shoes two of the shoes I've really enjoyed running in this year the superl 2 more or less just picked up where the super blast one left off in being pretty much the standard Setter for plate free super trainers like it's a pretty unique shoe and one that I don't think any other brands really been able to emulate in terms of that very versatile plate free design whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big upgrade on previous models of the shoe which were heavy clunky not that good and the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's a plated super trainer that can match up to the best in that category including shoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or the H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good competitor for someone like a super blast as well if you don't mind training with the plate so super Blast 2 we had in for testing first did a lot of running when we initially had it in and I actually took it away last week for a trip and just used it for everything you know just walking around all my runs one of those trips where you only have a very small bag on a budget Airline so you have one pair of shoes for everything and it's perfect for that because it is such a versatile shoe it is comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it you know does everything really well it's also quite a nice looking shoe I think in this colorway although some will disagree it's also just amazingly light for its size which really helps you pick up the pace in it so I did like kind of a progression running the shoe while I was away I've done some full sessions in the shoe as well and while it is quite a big shoe something I always noticed because of the way I am quite a high Cadence Runner quite a shuffly runner and a big kind of boatlike design like this sometimes feels a bit big on my foot but if I kind of get over that I can run fast in the shoe without any problems got a lot of response from the foam and you know it does feel good for those fast Paces but really excels I think for kind of cruising around daily runs like progression runs you're moving to kind of steady Paces kind of quick but not fast I guess how I describe those kind of runs where you are moving with a bit of effort but you're not really going for it and long runs in particular just really good shoe for eating up a lot of mileage and just amazingly light for its size like all these super trainers that come out with plates designed very explicitly for fast running things like the Nike and other shoes like that are all heavier than the super loss despite the fact has a higher stack just because that foam is so light and that does really help it be a more versatile shoe the Nike is also a very versatile shoe though and that certainly wasn't the case with previous models of The Zo flight like this is now isue you can go and do fast runs in I've done a couple of hard sessions in it I've gone down the track and done a 10 times one mile session a nasty progression run on the road done a pretty decent steady run again quick but not fast over about 90 minutes where I was running pretty well and you know at the back end of marathon training this was a shoe that I really enjoyed using for all the runs I was doing around that time so pretty good workouts lots of long runs of progression runs and it just felt really good for them like it's an exceptionally comfortable shoe given the speed you have here I would say it starts with the upper which is really nice to slip on and then the underfoot feel is really quite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that you can run very fast in and that's a bit similar to the super blast but I think you have a slightly smaller and more Nimble design with the Nike and although it's know heavier does feel a bit more kind of fast and direct than the super blast because it has a I think a slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker like kind of you know you get pushed off the toes a bit more on the Nike I would say and it just has a slightly smaller design around the heel which has a heel Striker with a high Cadence I do notice if I'm trying to run fast so I tell you like when it comes to you know really allout sessions or trying to hold a fast pace for a long time if you're looking for a stand in racing shoe I think that's where the Nike excels a little bit more than the super blast just because it does have a bit more of a racy feel a faster feel I find it easier to sustain Paces in the Nike than the super blast super blast really for me fits more in the daily trainer mold where you know can do everything and it can go fast but I think it excels more at kind of slightly more relaxed places than the Nike both I would also say are surprisingly stable for such big shoes like they both got pretty wide bases both got designs that you know are not necessarily going to be inherently stable with those big stacks of foam on there but they're welld designed I had no concerns about running in them kind of on any terrain uh and certainly no concerns in terms of pronation or anything like that so I did do a short run wearing both shoes at the same time you actually have a softer feel with the Nike I think it almost feels a little bit more flexible like the superlast is quite renowned for being quite a stiff shoe despite the fact it doesn't have a plate which does help it run fast but I know not everyone loves that for kind of more relaxed Paces like I quite like it for those relaxed Paces that stiffness kind of pushes you through and rolls you on it's not uncomfortable at all but it's surprising actually that even though the Nike has a plate it didn't really feel that much different in terms of stiffness when you comparing these two shoes directly on the run and you get I think a little bit more pop and lift off the toes with the Nike with that plate in there and the way the rocket I think just works a bit better for me rolling me through my foot strike where youve got the quite sharp tapered rocker on the super blast I think that helps a lot in terms of like a big amount of Bounce and if you're a bit more of a loping runner I think you'll probably engage that and enjoy that a bit more than I do but I do think just get yeah a bit more punch off the Nike superlast feels a bit more relaxed it's kind of a strange to both of these shoes actually I would say feel quite similar at a range of Paces like there are some shoes where you really feel that they're a bit more direct and firm and aggressive when you start running quick in them but both of these feel like oh you can run in these at very relax Paces Run them at fast Paces they still feel quite similar which is nice like it's great for a training Sho to be able to do lots of different runs in like that and they always feel quite comfortable and have stability but you can run nice and quick in them as [Music] well so verdict this is a really tough choice I think these are both excellent shoes that do a range of jobs really well they're really versatile shoes they're comfortable I like wearing them both for easy runs and then they do both have Pace you can go and do fast sessions in them and you can even use both as standing Racing shoes especially for longer distances because there is a lot of pace there as well as protection and comfort with all the foam you have Under Foot so when it comes to picking between the two shoes there a few things you could look at to help you on that front I mean one is just simply the price the Nike is cheaper so that's an easy objective win for the Nike and given that both these shoes are quite similar in performance that is quite a big deal you know you could certainly pick up the Nike make a saving and have a really good shoe then the ride field I think you've got a slightly more cruisy feel with the super blast it's a bit better for kind of loping through those easy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a bit more comfortable pulling on for every single day because it doesn't have a plate in there it's got a nice relaxed upper it feels really good at easy paces and you can step up the pace when you want to and the Nike is a bit nimbler bit more punch from the plate if you are looking for more of an explicit fast trainer to add to your rotation I think it does the job a little bit better but it is also very versatile for sure got choice about whether to plate or not to plate like not sure it makes a huge difference in this case myself like certainly there's a nice feeling in running a shoe without a plate and running fast and all that but superlast has got a big old super foam in there it's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a similar way in many ways as having the plate that said I do think it's a bit easier to maintain you know fast Paces over long distances in the Nike so maybe that's a mental thing or maybe that actually is the plate coming into play so if you don't want to use a plate to shoot obviously a super Blaster is an easy winner there so that is something that you know some people want to consider so obviously if you're looking for one shoe to do it all I'd probably get the Nike myself if you're quite keen on racing because I think it's a slightly better racing shoe and it does those easy runs well if you're looking for a shoe to add to rotation just to have with like a carbon plate racing shoe to do to do those really fast workouts in I think the super blast works really well I think that's the Fantastic that's probably the best two shoe rotation out there I think at the moment is to get the super blast for pretty much all your training and then a carbon plate racing shoe for races and the odd really hard session super blast just does that role so well and if you're looking for like a fast trainer to slip in the middle of a rot I think both work pretty much equally well so it's more whether you want the kind of lighter but bigger design of the super blast the slightly punchier kind of plated Nimble design of the zoom fly like again it's really close here so I think I'd really struggle to pick between them I think I'd probably just lean towards the Nike myself I just suits my running style a little bit better just because I have a high Cadence I said I really enjoyed just having the super blast as my only shoe away on a trip it was really nice to put it on every day it's a shoe you can really fall in love with by using over and over again so yeah very hard to call probably the Nike just as it for me especially as it's a little bit cheaper but certainly very case for either shoe both very much stand out of [Music] 2024 that's our comparison of the zoom fly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know what you think in the comments below please like And subscribe ring the little bell we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Asics Novablast 5 vs Superblast 2: Top new Asics running shoes compared':\n\nhey this is mik from the r testers this is the aex no blast 5 and this is the aex super Blast 2 two shoes as you'll know from our multitester reviews we are big fans of now these are also two shoes that sit at very different price points super blast do is the more expensive the no blast 5 is a lot cheaper and it's a lot easier to get a hold of than this shoe now what we're going to do in this video is take you through the key differences and give you a sense of whether there is any kind of overlap in terms of experience in terms of the types of runs that these shoes can work for and whether no blast 5 could give you a super blast like experience for a little bit less money so first we'll get into those key differences then give you our multi test to take on whether you should go for the Nova blast 5 or the super Blast 2 so let's get into those nitty-gritty details and differences between the Nova blast 5 and Super Blast 2 let's start with price and the noov blast 5 is considerably cheaper than the super Blast 2 while both are offered in stand width size options only weightwise the Nova blast 5 weighed in heavier for us than the super Blast 2 in a UK men's size eight you're getting shoes both of 8 mm drops with the super Blast 2 offering a bigger stack of cushioning at both the heel and the 4f foot compared to the latest Nova blast at the upper it's engineered woven mesh versus jackard mesh with similar tongue and lacing combinations used and the Nova blast 5 heel collar offering a touch more padding there's big differences at the midsole where the no no blast uses the new FF blast Max for a softer feel compared to the Eco plus included in the Nova blast 4 and also the super Blast 2 where it's combined with the FF blast turbo plus found in asx's metas Speed Carbon races asex adopts a similar trampoline inspired outs soole design on both shoes to spread those Foams across a relatively broad base to bring that bounce throughout the shoe you're also getting similar outo designs with the no blast offering a bit more coverage at the for foot and lateral areas of the shoe comes to the fit of the super Blast 2 and the no blast 5 I've got the same size in both shoes which is a uk9 us10 with aex it's the same size I use across the aex range and both of them have a really good fit for me I'd say you have got really roomy forfoot on the no blast 5 but even as someone with a narrow foot like I am you know have too much room there as someone with a narrow foot but it's not being a problem in any way with lockdown or anything like that got right amount of length at the front there in terms of room for my toes good hold around the heel and midfoot I find them both very comfortable shoes just to slip on day after day so yeah no concerns with the fit I'd stick to your normal size okay so the fit for me in the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 quite a similar fit actually um both very comfortable I'm a size eight in the UK i' very much like wearing both these shoes they're both AIC shoes so a similar fit what I would say is that the um nov blast 5 is a little bit more forgiving it feels a little bit wider and the upper just feels a little bit um more flexible in in terms of how it puts pressure on your feet so uh if you maybe have a slightly wider foot you're probably going to be better off with the Nova blast 5 over the super Blast 2 but there's not a lot in it and I find both of these shoes very very comfortable so I would stick to my size in both of them so in terms of fit it's been very good for me in both of the shoes I've got them both in a UK size a that my typical run shoe size and that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in ax shoes now what I would say is the key differences for me is that with the Nova blast 5 it definitely has a more of a relaxed fit and I would say you know it's a bit more roomy in the toe box of the shoe I think it opens up a little bit more of going further back in the shoe as well and if you prefer something that's a bit more accommodating particularly if you've got slightly wider feet then I think that would be a better fit for most people I've got quite skinny narrow feet and while it is a lot rier I found it's not been overly roomier or generous with that space I think with the super blast too definitely does narrow a little bit more it's not super narrow in any way but I do think like the space up front in the toe box is still very good that hold at the midfoot is very good as well too another area I think is a key difference for me is that there's just a bit more padding around the hill col in the Nova blast 5 where you know it's definitely issue for me that's geared towards kind of giving you a little bit more of that Comfort side where you're getting that padding a pretty good amount of padding on the hill col and the super Blast 2 but it definitely isn't as much as it is on the no blast 5 so the things for me would be that the Nova blast 5 is a lot more roomy particularly the front of the shoe and and the middle section of the shoe the super blast to has less kind of padding at the hill collar but generally for me I think going through the size for both of these shoes should be fine for most people let's give you a quick word on fit then in amongst the pistachio shells on this bench and in the ax superlast 2 and the over blast five i r in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half I think these are both really kind of roomy accommodating shoes there's loads of space in the toe box up front big thumbs width there nice clearance across the top of the toes super lastar to for me they hold really well in the midfoot the heels are nicely padded I have no slipping at all Everything feels locked down and comfortable and nice and I would recommend going through to issues particularly if you want to go Long Haul because they're plenty roomy in the Nova blast 5 these are even area I mean there's so much Flex in the toe box here these are sort of spacious some people have complained about the fact that they feel too spacious particularly if you've got narrow feet maybe they will feel a bit wide but I ran in my regular running shoe size and I found everything good I I really look for lots of toebox room so look you can see you've got lots of clearance on the end there's plenty of Flex for the toes that TOS the top lock down across the midfoot was nice and secure I had good hold in the heels as well tongues take the Ed jof no problems with this and I I recommend going true to Siz in the shoe unless you really want a snug fit where or you've got a narrow foot where you might want to think about going half a size down so the aex super Blast 2 and the aex no blast 5 are both shoes that I've really liked testing this year I think they both fit their roles very well within the ax lineup with the no blast 5 being more of the mid-range shoe the daily trainer that's designed to be pretty good value appeal to a wide range of Runners have a fairly inoffensive ride that's actually no very pleasant ride in fact and one that I think will work for lots of different Runners you obvious got a load of cushioning there under foot but it's still a fairly lightweight shoe got a slight rocker there that does help you roll through your stri foot strike smoothly and actually that's been improved a little bit on the no blast 5 compared to the no blast 4 for me thanks to the redesigned heel bevel which is a little bit less huge than the one on the no blast 4 which does make it a slightly smoother ride but you've got a good foam in the Mido there which is comfortable but it's not necessarily as responsive as exciting as the stuff you are going to get on the super Blast 2 for me the no blast 5 definitely works best for kind of easy runs relaxed da training long runs that kind of thing you can pick up the pace in the shoe but you're not getting a huge amount of responsiveness out of this foam it's more just the fact that it's a pretty lightweight shoe and one with a nice rocker that means you can turn your feet over quite well the foam is soft but not too mushy for me so I find I can run faster in the shoe without it feeling like I'm you know waiting through a big wedge of soft foam so it's reasonably versatile but certainly not as versatile as something like the super blast which is a kind of a special shoe so it's obviously a lot more expensive than an overlast 5 it's build as a super training without a plate you've got the huge stack of asx's best foam there the FF turbo plus and that foam just is a lot livelier a lot more responsive and it it really makes it a lot easier to pick up the pace in the super blast compared to the no blast it's also a lighter shoe than the no blast and really you can kind of do everything that you would do in the no blast you can do it in the super blast and then it's got a lot more range in terms of that top end speed like it's not necessarily a shoe that I absolutely adore running fast in myself because style of Runner I am I've got a high Cadence fairly short stride like quite a shuffly runner and you know it's a big shoe so it's not a heavy shoe but it is a big shoe and sometimes turning it over it can a little bit too boatlike and big for me I actually would be quite Keen for them to shave off a bit of that heel bevel on the super Blast 3 as they have done with the no blast 5 I think that would probably improve it a little bit for me but I certainly can pick up the pace in it I do enjoy running it a lot recently I took it away for a trip was the only shoe I had for everything and you know it's a comfortable shoe to walk around in it then can do all the runs I did on that trip at a range of paces and it just works all of for all of them you know really very well and you do get a much livelier feel from the foam in this midsole compared to the one in the nose blast 5 so when I was running both of them at the same time that's the thing that really comes across like the super blast feels lighter and it feels a lot poppier and more responsive under the for foot in particular you get a lot more lift off the toes in general just feels like a you know more exciting ride got a denser foam on the nose blast it feels like a much more solid shoe you know a heavier shoe which it is and one that's a bit more suited just for cruising along it is still a pretty lightweight shoe like I say and it turns over well but compared to the superl you can get a lot more kind of pace and liveliness out the shoe and it's also stiffer which I think does make it more comfortable that pace that stiffness might detract from the ride a little bit at easier PES for some people like I don't really mind it myself you know it's not a shoe that's designed for Pure Comfort but it does feel fine for me on easy runs but then the extra flexibility you get from the NOA blast might appeal to some people when they're looking at just cruising around their daily training like there's a fairly big wedge of foam you get on the super blast and it does help with pushing you along but it is quite stiff like I say okay so you'll notice that I'm still not holding up the super Blast 2 because Mike still has it so I need to go and get that off him at some point desperate to get that shoe back so I can do some training um for uh Dubai Marathon uh that's coming up in a few weeks uh so these two shoes are shoes that um if you if I reviewed the no blast 4 and the super Blast 2 and compared them they're quite similar in a in in in how they run they both have a same level of firmness in the midsole they both have similar level of respons and it feels like uh the Nova blast 4 took a lot of learnings from the super blast um to provide a better all round versatile experience for runners um and I very much like both of those shoes especially for training uh a longer distance where I want to retain a consistent effort but I still want a bit of comfort and a lot of padding as well uh the Nova blast 5 uh it's quite different than superlast 2 now U because this new midell phone this FF blast Max is um a bit softer than what was in the Nova blast 4 and as a result it changes the ride of the shoe uh quite a bit for me in comparison to the to the Nova blast 4 the result of that is that um it's definitely a lot softer than the super Blast 2 um but also you don't get that same um turnover that you get in the super Blast 2 Su Blast 2 is a shoe that isn't very soft um and it has a quite a rigid midsole so it rolls your foot forward and really helps you maintain a nice fluid Pace I use the superlast 2 quite a lot for longer training sessions um where I'm trying to maintain maybe my marathon pace and it just really helps you just smoothly just cover that pace it's not really noticeable like a carbon plate shoe or something where you can feel the the carbon plate doing something uh to to impact the way that that you're running it's just a really smooth motion very comfortable nice level of padding for running at PACE and doesn't in any way um sap your energy or slow you down or anything like that but still retains a good level of comfort as well uh the no blast 5 is a Sho that um because of this softer midell foam it doesn't work so well as the no blast 4 or the super Blast 2 when you are uh running faster because for me it feels like I'm hitting that a little bit too hard um and I'm not getting a lot back there's a little of energy return you get back from this phone when you're running at a slower Pace or more of a consistent Pace but when you're picking picking up the speed um I feel like I'm really putting too much pressure into that mid cell Pham and it's not giving it me back it's it's it's sapping the energy a little bit um when I'm running faster uh I think that's really the the the key to what the Nova blast 5 is now I think it's more a daily shoe that fits more into that easier realm longer runs maybe where you just want comfort and you're not trying to pick up the pace or maintain the tempo Pace or anything like that um and and the superlast 2 is all all out designed for uh those consistent long run Paces uh it's a fantastic marathon training shoe probably be a great Marathon shoe I haven't used it for a marathon uh race but the way that the shoe rides is just very fluid very comfortable um but really allows you to maintain a pace which for me for marathan training would be about 4 minute 30 km uh if I'm going out to do like a 25k 30k long run and and that shoe just Smooths your feet and just makes you just be able to do that run really really comfortably without really adding anything to it it's a very natural ride as well it's not really forcing your foot into a specific position no blast 5 I wouldn't use it for those sorts of runs I think it I'd really feel it after a while it just deadening the the impact and not really giving me a lot back but it is a very enjoyable shoe to wear for those easier runs or a longer run where you're just trying to just maintain a nice comfortable effort you get a little bit of bounce back back it's definitely very comfortable shoot to a but for me it definitely sits into that realm of easier day shoes now um as opposed to a versatile option Su Blast 2 is very very versatile shoe great for easy runs I know Kieran thinks it's a fantastic easy run shoe I don't use it for easy runs uh I prefer a lot more softness when I'm running easy runs so if I'm just doing easy runs I'd probably pick the no blast 5 but for a shoe that is really really well designed for faster training sessions at longer at longer distance uh you can also do a lot more with it so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I've done over 50k in the Nova blast 5 now I have done near to 100 miles in the super Blast 2 and what I would say is these are two shoes that are very good at being ones that you just throw on and they are very easy to forget about what's going on in and around your foot to be ones that you know really can kind of tick that mileage off you know really get that running time in your feet without really thinking too much about it there definitely are some differences between these two shoes I think does kind of influence how I would use them how I think a lot of people may end up using them and want to use them I think the first uh Factor area for me is the weights now these aren't heavy shoes either than my heavy shoes but when you consider at least for me that the super L 2 is you know is a bigger stack shoe comes in a ways in lighter for me than no last five you know it just you know feels like it runs a little bit nicer with that weight just handles that weight a little bit better now it isn't sloppy and isn't heavy or cumbersome and the no blast 5 and it's not a lower stack shoe by a huge amount but I just found that you know having that kind of light away on a on a Max taoe is is a very nice kind of experience overall and it really kind of kind of feeds into what you're getting in the midsole what you're getting below you know uh in the out soole as well and what that kind of does for the ride in these shoes I think for me the no blast youve got the FF blast Max for me it's spread across a kind of larger surface area and what that does first and foremost is just create something that is a lot or kind of naturally very stable I think it's also a lot sof the feeling than the kind of dual density mids cell makeup in the super Blast 2 I think that what does for me the no blast 5 it just you know Comfort is the first thing it ticks off it rolls through very nicely very smoothly and for me when I've running it I found it felt more comfortable to do that kind of easier and moderate Paces when I've tried to run a little bit quicker in it it's not you know been totally uncomfortable to do that but I've just felt that when I've tried to do that in the super Blast 2 it's felt more at home it's felt more depth and that's really down to that midsole that dual density midell being you know there's some softness there but there's definitely some firmness as well too there's some bounce as well I think there a more prominent bounce for me in the super blast 2it I think the rocker is more prominent as well you know the rocker is pretty good in this in the no blast 5 but I think coupled with all the things that you're getting in these super Blast 2 it just rolls through a little bit more aggressively for me and I've raced in it I've done track sessions in it I've done faster sessions I've done shorter and long kind of runs in it as well and I felt it's covered you or felt comfortable to do it at all of those Paces I think the other thing I mentioned other videos I think transitioning from those different Paces you know the super Blu does a very good job of that and that's why is kind of a standout do it all shoot I think the Nova blast five for me when I have tried to mix the Pacers in a single run I haven't found it as comfortable I haven't found it as Lively and bouncy barring the first run that I did in it but it's a definitely good experience in both these shoes just for very different runs so I think these are good daily trainer shoes you know relatively kind of big stack shoes as well for me there clearly one that is a little bit more versatile and a little bit more friendly towards running a little bit more Tempo and faster um but definitely good shoes for me other areas I think the out Souls I think you know for me I think the no blast 5 is giving you a little bit more rubber on that outsole and I think durability wise I'm seeing less wear obviously less running time but for me the super plus 2 has been H holding up pretty well obviously still getting some exposed areas there's definitely a bit more more rubber on the Nova blast 5 for me in those kind of similar areas as well so for me from a you know durability point of view I think you're going to get a bit more from no blast 5 gripping has been fine for me I've run in kind of wetter and drri conditions for both these aren't the best kind of you know Road running outsoles available but they seem to be up to task or have been up to task in my run so yeah two very good shoes two very good Asic shoes two very good daily trainer shoes but it's definitely one that I pick of the other that's not to say the other one is bad but I just think the other or there's one shoe here that works a little bit better for me and I'll get to that in my verdict so in testing I've run north of 30 mil in the new Nova blast 5 I've run much more in the super Blast 2 including a full Marathon test in this shoe that's on the channel now if you want to go and find it all of that has been across a range of paces and terrain I also did a side bys side Mile with one shoe on each foot to really tease out the differences between these two shoes and here's how that went so I've just done my side by side Mile with the super Blast 2 on my right foot I've got the Nova blast five on my left foot minute you put the shoes on you feel the higher stack in the super blast you can feel that there's that extra stiffness and firmness in the midsole compared to the softer novablast 5 which feel sort of sinky when you first put them on by comparison superlast to sort of you know they're cushion but they sort of hold you up and you're expecting that kind of stiffness and that roll through and that transition to come uh as a result of a slightly kind of stiffer ride there's a more immediacy as a result of that they're both big Cush C shoes though I don't think the superlast 2 you know sacrificing that much cushion for me anyway they it does feel like a bigger shoe on the foot there's a lot more kind of heft to it doesn't feel quite as Nimble you know it's a thing to say that NOA blast feels a bit more compact by comparison because the Nova blast is not a compact shoe by any stretch of the imagination but it does feel I mean they're about the same weight but I would say the no blast 5 actually feels a bit lighter I think it's just because you've got more of the superlast underf foot stability wise I quite like the firmness of the super Blast 2 I think that provides a bit more of a stable platform for me a bit more reliability you do feel a little bit of mush and wobble I think into the Nova blast five if anything I expected over blast 5 in my head for the runs that i' done with it initially to be a bit more like the super Blast 2 but actually I think the over blast 4 which had that kind of slightly additional stiffness firmness underf foot now feels much more like the super blast than the Nova blast 5 does the Nova blast 5 brings softness so how does that translate then well if you've run in the super blast to if you've watched reviews and you've thought actually maybe they might be a little bit too stiff for you to go Long Haul into the long miles and you wanted more softness and the Nova blast 5 is going to add that it gets to the energy in a different way though it's slightly more reliant on a sink and a bounce for the energy to come back where you get a lot of energy and bounce from the super Blast 2 but you also get a little bit of that kind of immediacy from the stiffness that comes so it's a bit quicker to respond it's a bit punchier as a result there's a bit more kind of top speed potential I think of the superlast 2 it's overall just a bit more of an energetic shoe where the Nova blast 5 now I think bit more cushioning probably bit more accommodating for going slower and longer whereas the super Blast 2 is probably better you know cruising those kind of tempo Paces maybe a little bit higher up if you don't mind running in a big shoe that is how I would divide those shoes but we'll do the verdict back in the office it comes to my verdict like these are both good shoes and shoes that fit their roles well within the aex lineup if you are looking for one shoe absolutely everything and you want you're prepare to pay for a special feeling under fit you are going to get it with a super blast 2 like it's a pretty amazing shoe it's not one that's entirely to my taste like I've picked out shoes that I prefer to it that are also you know really fun all rounders and all that but it's certainly an amazing shoe one that I do like running in and one that obviously is very popular with people at large like if you are just looking for one shoe to do everything the super blast is the one to do it in if you're looking for a fast training shoe then the super blast is the one to pick over the no blast the no blast is certainly better value you can use it for the same kind of runs as the super blast you're just not going to get the same energetic ride feel and is a bit more kind of cushy and relaxed when it comes to easy runs like you're looking at putting these shoes in a rotation superlast either could be you know a rotation killer a shoe you're used for everything or one that fits into rotation in the middle of it there like picking up the bulk of your mileage with a maybe a very easy comfortable cushion shoe for some easy runs and then a fast plated shoe for you know really top end Speedy stuff whereas the no blast 5 I position more towards the cushion end of things in a rotation I'd want to have you know a faster training shoe alongside this and maybe a racer as well though you can use it for a bit of everything like it doesn't really have the pace that I'd be looking for in an allrounder if you are a newer runner though I think the no blast 5 is a really good allrounder actually I think it's one that will protect the legs well but is fairly lightweight you can use it for some Speedy stuff like if I was a new Runner I wanted one you to do everything I would get the no blast first before know spending loads of money on something like the super blast I think the no blast does play a role in being you know a cheaper version of the super blast in a way and it is a fair bit cheaper but the super blast you know you are paying more for it but you are going to get a big upgrade in performance if you do spend that money okay so my verdict on the super Blast 2 and the Nova blast 5 is obviously the super Blast 2 is a much more expensive shoe um so if it came down to cost and the fact that it's almost impossible to buy the super Blast 2 and I know many of you will comment on this video uh saying that you can't get hold of it sorry about that there's nothing we can do to get them to stock more super blast 2os um but because of that no blast 5 is probably going to be the only option for most people anyway if even if you could get it it's a very expensive shoe2 200 is a lot of money to spend on a training shoe um which is above a lot of people's budget so the no blast 5 comes in under that it's a shoe design for more General Runners it's a shoe design for people that don't want to spend £200 on a running shoe um but it's not as good a shoe um obviously uh it's a lot significantly cheaper than the super Blast 2 um if I was looking at purely the shoes themselves and ignoring the price and the availability of them I would say that super Blast 2 is a far superior shoe um for most runs if you're going to go out and buy a shoe then you wanted something that you could do a lot of stuff in easier runs daily sessions faster sessions um long runs super Blast 2 just ticks off all of those really really well noas 5 doesn't really take off all of those well at all it really ticks off the easier runs and the comfortable training sessions the daily runs where you just want a nice bit of softness uh and comfort and you want to take off the miles uh in as much um with as much padding and and comfort as you can get um but it's really not a huge design for versatility or uh it's defin not sure I'd use if I was training for a marathon I was doing lots of longer sessions or faster sessions so I think it really comes down to that if you're looking between these two shoes and you're not worried about price or availability but obviously if you're just a general Runner that's looking for a comfortable daily shoe you're not going to go for the superlast 2 because it's just so expensive uh and hard to get so out of for me I'm going to go superlast 2 all the way but I understand that the no plus 5 is a more cost effective option but it's limited to easier sessions you can't really do a lot in this shoe after my first run in the no blast 5 where I ran well and the NOA blast 5 gave back good energy I was wondering if they might be a more affordable alternative to the super Blast 2 a sort of super blast light if you will but after logging many more miles in both shoes I don't think that's quite the case here both shoes are enticingly versatile but the superlast 2 is by far the more energetic shoe with a smoother ride and I think a more consistent punch across all the ranges of pace the no boss 5 has energy and it's also a capable Cruiser but but for me the softer Edge just isn't quite as encouraging as the ride you get from the super Blast 2 it just doesn't quite give you that extra oomph I actually think the Nova blast 4 runs more like the super Blast 2 it's a bit firmer a bit snappier now The Sweet Spot for the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 is really cruising from around my marathon pace up to Tempo there's enough cushion on both shoes to eat easy miles in relative Comfort too I could Long Haul in both of these shoes but I find both shoes can get a bit sluggish at my very slowest pace at least when I'm running in my heaviest form when it comes to the fastest training both shoes can be a bit too much shoe on the foot I find for me to want to tackle things like all out of intervals again you can do these sessions in either shoe but I wouldn't say either of them really excels at it over and above some other shoes now the superl 2 is a better shoe all round the grip Superior the ride is snappier but if you're on a budget could you cover the same runs in the over blast five the answer I think is probably yes would they be as good I don't think quite if you're taking money out of the question I'd certainly choose the superlast two out of these two shoes I think on balance is the more accomplished all rounder and the slightly snappier ride which appeals more to the way I run so my take with you should go the A6 blast 5 or the as6 super Blast 2 now the first thing I'll say is that these are two very good daily trainer shoes if you're telling me which one is the best it's a no-brainer it's a super blast too this is the shoe if you want a shoe that can do uncover all of your runs and do it in a really good way then that's what the super Blast 2 is going to give you in terms of the Nova blast 5 being a super blast light I think it works for some of the runs that the super Blast 2 works well at but not all of them I think this is a shoe you get if you you know can't get hold of the super Blast 2 you want a shoe that's accommodating that is comfortable works for shorter and longer runs and I think for me easy to moderate Paces that's really where you know it fits best for me so if that's what would work for you that's what you would look for in a daily trainer Sho and go for the over blast 5 if you want the best shoe between these two shoes the one that can work for faster Paces longer runs shorter runs could be used for track sessions as well it's a super blast 2 you1 I appreciate it's hard to get a hold of but if you can you're going to be rewarded with a very good daily Trainer shoe that weighs in at the kind of standard daily trainer weight and overall it's just a very good shoe one of my favorite shoes to running or to have running this year so for me if I could get a hold of it and you know I'm fortunate that I do have one I would be going for the super Blast 2 if you wanted a shoe that you know and that daily trainer profile that definitely Vees towards being more comfortable but can definitely work for shorter and longer runs easy to modate Paces I'd be going for the Nova blast 5 okay so there you have it that our take on how the Nova blast 5 compares to the super Blast 2 if you got any questions about either of these shoes or other shoes you want to see them compared to do let us know in the comments as always like And subscribe hit that little bell to find out about our latest videos and yeah we'll see you next run test this video\n\nFrom video 'ASICS SUPERBLAST 2 (completely unbiased review)':\n\nthe most anticipated shoe of the year is finally here the aex super blast version 2 the original super blast burst onto the scene last year and almost immediately became one of my absolute favorite alltime training shoes and when I'm not out running testing other shoes this was the shoe I'd reach for about 90% of the time clocking it over 3,000 km in a few different versions of version one with two big updates to version two with the out soole and the upper hereit I was really worried that aex might be messing this one up so is this new model going to live up to my very high expectations or am I going to be scaring eBay to try and find some pairs of version one and as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review right let's get stuck into all of the changes between the version one and version two the price of the Superglass 2 is a little bit more expensive here in the UK now costing £200 most markets around the world it's pretty much the same we have got an updated midsole this big chunk through the middle here which now uses the FF turbo the same as the updated metas speed sky and Edge asex is most premium responsive foam that they offer out there and then we've got a thin layer along the bottom of here of asx's FF blast plus which is what they use for a little bit more durability and also sort of stabilizing the shoe we've got an updated outsole much welcome updated outo this is new aex grip rubber on the bottom here a little bit more grippy here in the wet weather we'll come on to chat about that a little bit later on the review and also you can't get any stones and Pebbles and little hitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe here which I you get all the time on version one when you'd run on sort of more grally areas they filled in all of those holes in slightly different design and pattern on version two and then finally we've got a different updated upper to the shoe here which is now this one piece woven engineered mesh so it's a little bit more stretchy and just has a little bit more movement with the shoe versus version one right let's get stuck into the facts and figures this is is your long distance mileage monster for crushing those long runs out there and it's also one of the very best non-plated racing shoes perfect for like 10K half marathons marathons and also Ultra marathons if they're going to be on the road as well is very much a road shoe although you could do have a little bit of light trail with this great aex grip on the bottom here price-wise this sent me back £200 here in the UK around about €220 $200 around about $320 Australian dollars stack Heights we've got 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and it's basically the same weight as the outgoing model for me this is coming at 288 G that's really really quite light for sure of this size this is in my particular size UK 11 A2 here the old version was 290 so basically exactly the same it is a neutral shoe the upper as I've just said is this lovely engineered mesh upper which Asic say is going to improve the air flow through the shoe midso we've got the FF Turbo plus through the middle here and then the FF blast plus Eco along the bottom of the shoe there there is famously no carbon plate in the shoe and the outsole Now features this aex grip which is these yellow sections here and aex also put this on some of their trail shoes as well so it's very tacky very sticky a lce sort of slow density rubber to try and improve on asx's usually quite poor wet weather performance there are no different wits available at launch but it's pretty good here on the witth side there's also this one Flagship color at launch which is asx's Paris colorway personally I absolutely love this let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments asex say that this is to do with Paris called the city of lights and we've got sunset and sunrise colors here and finally this wasn't true to size I actually ordered a size 12 my usual size and a size 11 and 1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version one and I've stuck with that in version two basically i' just say go half a size down from your regular size or go exactly the same size you had in version one if you had that shoe if you could like and share this video and let us know down in the comments your thoughts on the superl 2 that be great and please check out my website benp parks.com we've got training plans the best running hats in the world some technical gear and Casual gear to keep you going through your training right let's get stuck into the likes my first like here is they didn't mess it up come on I get so worried when you have your absolute favorite shoe out there and a manufacturer releases a new one and you're like please don't mess it up please don't make it really heavy bulky use different materials they have used different materials but all the updates in the shoe have worked really well the upper is just a little bit more breathable the key area such as the ankle lock down absolutely fantastic no slipping no blisses no hot spots nice gusseted tongue here just gives the perfect right amount of padding so your foot stays nicely locked down yes I was a bit worried my foot might move around a little bit at the front of the shoe with this woven mesh upper but it just stays perfectly in place so no problems there and also finally thank you to ax for not increasing the weight actually for me brought it down very very so slightly super lightweight shoe it is absolutely amazing how a shoe can be this light and it just feels so much fun to run in my second like with the shoe is this updated midsole foam it's just ever so slightly more Poppy and responsive but really very very similar if you're a fan of version one you're going to love this updated foam in version two It just strikes that perfect balance in a shoe that can just have that sudden turn with speed of course there's plenty of faster dedicated 5K and 10K shoes with plates and things like that there but that's not what this shoe is all about this shoe is perfect for crunching those long distance marathon training runs or marathon races as well if you don't want to be using a carbon plate and really if you don't want to have a carbon plate in your shoe there really is nothing faster out there than the aex super blast version 2 and then finally my third like with the shoe is this updated outsole the super blast was okay in the wet it really wasn't that great but the new aex grip they put on the bottom of the shoe here just means all of that worry has gone away when I have running it in the wet it's just gripped super fantastically and you really can feel the difference even walking around the house the you one it just feels different it's lot more tacky when aex had all their problems with their grip with their wet weather grip in like the Nova Blast 2 and three it really wasn't very good this you don't have to worry about it at all fantastic update aex well done finally got a shoe that you can trust in the wet weather and also you can just take this out on some light Trails as well and it will handle those absolutely fine some fire roads and things like that you'll be good to go here moving on to the dislikes this is really hard to be honest my first dislike isn't really even about the shoe it's just about all the supply issues that you have with the superlast and I don't know why aexs are like this the shoe sells out so quickly pretty much sold out on launch day all around the world maybe it's all just marketing I don't know there's nothing in this shoe that you can't get on all of the other ax shoes the materials are all available but they really seem to limit Supply I can only assume I don't know why that is but this shoe will be selling out very very quickly if you can get a pair you want to get a pair don't dilly dally just go and get that order in and also the shoe was meant to launch on Friday just gone on the aex website here in the UK they didn't even launch because I think they had supply issues themselves and they delayed their launch again I don't know that's just what I suspect even assets can't get it right I got my player from sport shoes got up at 5:30 in the morning to try and secure a pair which I managed to do so very very happy with that got the 11 and a half and 12 come in and now yeah need to send the 12's back cuz I just a bit worried about the sizing but we're all good the second sort of dislike I've got with a shoe yeah it is a little bit on the expensive side it's so hard to be talking about a 200 shoe and saying this is great it is a fantastic shoe but also what you're getting with that 200 L is a super durable shoe as well I'd always get at least 1,000 k out of my version one the updated outsol in the shoe should be even better so it should be getting a little bit more mileage out of this but it does last a long time I can't wait to bring a full whizbang pop review once I've done my thks in the shoe will slot it into a review somewhere down the line and speaking of cost maybe you're better off at going for something like the Nova blast 4 for example £65 less that's a big chunk of cash and really the Nova blast is a superb allaround shoe the super blast it is slightly quicker without a doubt it's just a little bit more responsive less bouncy foam you get here and it is better suited for your long runs just a bit firmer bit lighter and just a bit Smo smoother through the footstrike overall but I'd say stick with the Nova blast if you're just looking for something that you can do all of your runs pretty well and you're not doing too many long runs it's a shoe that's I'd say around about 90% as fast and really will suit the vast majority of people unless you're looking for the absolute Crema creme or if you're very fortunate to have the budget and you want to get both of them then you could use you all your sort of regular daily training in the Nova blast and then use this for your marathon training long runs and maybe even a marathon racing shoe at the weekend moving on the Neo Vista hit the scene a few weeks ago I gave it a rave review it was fantastic £50 cheaper and it really is a bit of a shoe at the moment has a nylon plate in it so slightly different feel very different ride going through the shoe it's bouncier and it's softer and it does soak up those easy Mars a little bit better the super blast picks up the pace a little bit better and it does have a firmer ride both these shoes supremely comfortable I could personally choose this type of upper rather than the booty upper just get a better lock down in this one and with the near Vista it's just a little less stable around the corners where this is absolutely Rock Solid and the super blast will probably last a little bit longer with this better out soole with the shoe there as well so I really think you're getting about the same sort of value yes the super blast is a little bit more expensive but it will last a lot longer I think in my opinion then finally something like the Nike Invincible version 3 around about 20 cheaper here the Invincible is a lot bouncier it's roomier it's heavier it's perfect for those easy recovery runs but again a shoe manufacturers using their Flagship foam without putting that carbon plate in the shoe the super blast is just much smoo through the stride a lot firmer much more Nimble and lightweight and just better at a more wider range of speeds where something like the Invincible it's really is just your sort of steady marathon pace really steady marathon pace and easing recovery run sort of shoe so let's bring this all together what do I think of the superlast well it's a fantastic shoe without a doubt it is definitely going into my rotation I'm going to finish my miles I've got about 300 miles left in my last pair of version one so I'm not going to use this straight away it's not a revolutionary update get subscribed and see if this shoe will be making into my top three shoes of the year which we normally launch around about December time if you are interested in other asset shoes we've got a complete assets comparison guide again completely unsponsored B all the asset shoes with I money check that out that is up here coming up next let me know if you've got any questions down in the comments about the super blast I'll catch up and answer all of those down there keep it working hard guys keep done I'm have to get some more marathon training done we see you very soon in the next one\n\nUser Question: asics superblast 2\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context

welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex super Blast [Music] 2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are not necessarily directly comparable shoes because the zoomfly has a plate in the midsole whereas the super blast doesn't but they are both super trainers that are designed to do a wide range of runs they're both very popular shoes and people are quite Keen to see this comparison so so here it is the zoom fly is the cheapest shoe it cost £155 or $170 the super Blast 2 is £200 or $200 the zoomfly is a little bit heavier is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super blast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size they both have an 8 mm drop and the stack height on the superlast is a little bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel 37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly is 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the 4ot comes to the design with the Nike you got two layer woven mesh upper with a fair amount of padding around the heel significant internal heel counter as well to add some structure at the back of the shoe you got a duel density midsole the top layer is made from Nike zoomx foam there's a carbon plate running the full length of the shoe in between that it's a fairly flexible plate a little bit more so than on their Racing shoes but still a stiffening agent to add to the midside to add a bit more propulsion and then you have Nike's sr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the shoe there which is little bit less lively than the zoomx foam above it but adds a bit more kind of durability and stability to the shoe got a waffle full out sole coverage at the forefoot and heel big cutout in the middle that shows off the carbon plate in the mids soole and then with the super blast you also have a dual density mids soole but most of it is made from asx's FF turbo plus foam their best foam the bounciest foam the most responsive foam used in shoes like the metas speed Paris racing shoe series and then you have some FF blast Plus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe there as well got a pretty simple engineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of padding at the back bit of structure at the back you nothing too much going on with the upper there and then you've got reasonable outsole coverage there on the bottom you these patches of the ahar plus rubber which is pretty good in terms of grip lots of exposed phone but you know the key areas are covered there not any problems with grip with either [Music] shoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 for both of these Brands that's the size I use across the Nike and aex range and I've had no problems with the fit of either both have enough room around the toes good hold around the heer mid foot they're both pretty comfortable uppers all around I would say know four super trainers that can do very fast running as well as easy running they do have very accommodating uppers that make them comfortable to pull on every single day Nikes are probably a little bit more dialed in around the toes you know it's a slightly more cramped fit I'd say than a super blast but not in a way that was unpleasant at all it just gives it maybe a slightly racier feel at times but overall I was very happy with the fit of both shoes yeah great uppers good comfort and I would stick to your normal running shoe [Music] size onto the run test then and I think these are two excellent shoes two of the shoes I've really enjoyed running in this year the superl 2 more or less just picked up where the super blast one left off in being pretty much the standard Setter for plate free super trainers like it's a pretty unique shoe and one that I don't think any other brands really been able to emulate in terms of that very versatile plate free design whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big upgrade on previous models of the shoe which were heavy clunky not that good and the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's a plated super trainer that can match up to the best in that category including shoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or the H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good competitor for someone like a super blast as well if you don't mind training with the plate so super Blast 2 we had in for testing first did a lot of running when we initially had it in and I actually took it away last week for a trip and just used it for everything you know just walking around all my runs one of those trips where you only have a very small bag on a budget Airline so you have one pair of shoes for everything and it's perfect for that because it is such a versatile shoe it is comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it you know does everything really well it's also quite a nice looking shoe I think in this colorway although some will disagree it's also just amazingly light for its size which really helps you pick up the pace in it so I did like kind of a progression running the shoe while I was away I've done some full sessions in the shoe as well and while it is quite a big shoe something I always noticed because of the way I am quite a high Cadence Runner quite a shuffly runner and a big kind of boatlike design like this sometimes feels a bit big on my foot but if I kind of get over that I can run fast in the shoe without any problems got a lot of response from the foam and you know it does feel good for those fast Paces but really excels I think for kind of cruising around daily runs like progression runs you're moving to kind of steady Paces kind of quick but not fast I guess how I describe those kind of runs where you are moving with a bit of effort but you're not really going for it and long runs in particular just really good shoe for eating up a lot of mileage and just amazingly light for its size like all these super trainers that come out with plates designed very explicitly for fast running things like the Nike and other shoes like that are all heavier than the super loss despite the fact has a higher stack just because that foam is so light and that does really help it be a more versatile shoe the Nike is also a very versatile shoe though and that certainly wasn't the case with previous models of The Zo flight like this is now isue you can go and do fast runs in I've done a couple of hard sessions in it I've gone down the track and done a 10 times one mile session a nasty progression run on the road done a pretty decent steady run again quick but not fast over about 90 minutes where I was running pretty well and you know at the back end of marathon training this was a shoe that I really enjoyed using for all the runs I was doing around that time so pretty good workouts lots of long runs of progression runs and it just felt really good for them like it's an exceptionally comfortable shoe given the speed you have here I would say it starts with the upper which is really nice to slip on and then the underfoot feel is really quite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that you can run very fast in and that's a bit similar to the super blast but I think you have a slightly smaller and more Nimble design with the Nike and although it's know heavier does feel a bit more kind of fast and direct than the super blast because it has a I think a slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker like kind of you know you get pushed off the toes a bit more on the Nike I would say and it just has a slightly smaller design around the heel which has a heel Striker with a high Cadence I do notice if I'm trying to run fast so I tell you like when it comes to you know really allout sessions or trying to hold a fast pace for a long time if you're looking for a stand in racing shoe I think that's where the Nike excels a little bit more than the super blast just because it does have a bit more of a racy feel a faster feel I find it easier to sustain Paces in the Nike than the super blast super blast really for me fits more in the daily trainer mold where you know can do everything and it can go fast but I think it excels more at kind of slightly more relaxed places than the Nike both I would also say are surprisingly stable for such big shoes like they both got pretty wide bases both got designs that you know are not necessarily going to be inherently stable with those big stacks of foam on there but they're welld designed I had no concerns about running in them kind of on any terrain uh and certainly no concerns in terms of pronation or anything like that so I did do a short run wearing both shoes at the same time you actually have a softer feel with the Nike I think it almost feels a little bit more flexible like the superlast is quite renowned for being quite a stiff shoe despite the fact it doesn't have a plate which does help it run fast but I know not everyone loves that for kind of more relaxed Paces like I quite like it for those relaxed Paces that stiffness kind of pushes you through and rolls you on it's not uncomfortable at all but it's surprising actually that even though the Nike has a plate it didn't really feel that much different in terms of stiffness when you comparing these two shoes directly on the run and you get I think a little bit more pop and lift off the toes with the Nike with that plate in there and the way the rocket I think just works a bit better for me rolling me through my foot strike where youve got the quite sharp tapered rocker on the super blast I think that helps a lot in terms of like a big amount of Bounce and if you're a bit more of a loping runner I think you'll probably engage that and enjoy that a bit more than I do but I do think just get yeah a bit more punch off the Nike superlast feels a bit more relaxed it's kind of a strange to both of these shoes actually I would say feel quite similar at a range of Paces like there are some shoes where you really feel that they're a bit more direct and firm and aggressive when you start running quick in them but both of these feel like oh you can run in these at very relax Paces Run them at fast Paces they still feel quite similar which is nice like it's great for a training Sho to be able to do lots of different runs in like that and they always feel quite comfortable and have stability but you can run nice and quick in them as [Music] well so verdict this is a really tough choice I think these are both excellent shoes that do a range of jobs really well they're really versatile shoes they're comfortable I like wearing them both for easy runs and then they do both have Pace you can go and do fast sessions in them and you can even use both as standing Racing shoes especially for longer distances because there is a lot of pace there as well as protection and comfort with all the foam you have Under Foot so when it comes to picking between the two shoes there a few things you could look at to help you on that front I mean one is just simply the price the Nike is cheaper so that's an easy objective win for the Nike and given that both these shoes are quite similar in performance that is quite a big deal you know you could certainly pick up the Nike make a saving and have a really good shoe then the ride field I think you've got a slightly more cruisy feel with the super blast it's a bit better for kind of loping through those easy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a bit more comfortable pulling on for every single day because it doesn't have a plate in there it's got a nice relaxed upper it feels really good at easy paces and you can step up the pace when you want to and the Nike is a bit nimbler bit more punch from the plate if you are looking for more of an explicit fast trainer to add to your rotation I think it does the job a little bit better but it is also very versatile for sure got choice about whether to plate or not to plate like not sure it makes a huge difference in this case myself like certainly there's a nice feeling in running a shoe without a plate and running fast and all that but superlast has got a big old super foam in there it's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a similar way in many ways as having the plate that said I do think it's a bit easier to maintain you know fast Paces over long distances in the Nike so maybe that's a mental thing or maybe that actually is the plate coming into play so if you don't want to use a plate to shoot obviously a super Blaster is an easy winner there so that is something that you know some people want to consider so obviously if you're looking for one shoe to do it all I'd probably get the Nike myself if you're quite keen on racing because I think it's a slightly better racing shoe and it does those easy runs well if you're looking for a shoe to add to rotation just to have with like a carbon plate racing shoe to do to do those really fast workouts in I think the super blast works really well I think that's the Fantastic that's probably the best two shoe rotation out there I think at the moment is to get the super blast for pretty much all your training and then a carbon plate racing shoe for races and the odd really hard session super blast just does that role so well and if you're looking for like a fast trainer to slip in the middle of a rot I think both work pretty much equally well so it's more whether you want the kind of lighter but bigger design of the super blast the slightly punchier kind of plated Nimble design of the zoom fly like again it's really close here so I think I'd really struggle to pick between them I think I'd probably just lean towards the Nike myself I just suits my running style a little bit better just because I have a high Cadence I said I really enjoyed just having the super blast as my only shoe away on a trip it was really nice to put it on every day it's a shoe you can really fall in love with by using over and over again so yeah very hard to call probably the Nike just as it for me especially as it's a little bit cheaper but certainly very case for either shoe both very much stand out of [Music] 2024 that's our comparison of the zoom fly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know what you think in the comments below please like And subscribe ring the

is the aex super Blast 2 two shoes as you'll know from our multitester reviews we are big fans of now these are also two shoes that sit at very different price points super blast do is the more expensive the no blast 5 is a lot cheaper and it's a lot easier to get a hold of than this shoe now what we're going to do in this video is take you through the key differences and give you a sense of whether there is any kind of overlap in terms of experience in terms of the types of runs that these shoes can work for and whether no blast 5 could give you a super blast like experience for a little bit less money so first we'll get into those key differences then give you our multi test to take on whether you should go for the Nova blast 5 or the super Blast 2 so let's get into those nitty-gritty details and differences between the Nova blast 5 and Super Blast 2 let's start with price and the noov blast 5 is considerably cheaper than the super Blast 2 while both are offered in stand width size options only weightwise the Nova blast 5 weighed in heavier for us than the super Blast 2 in a UK men's size eight you're getting shoes both of 8 mm drops with the super Blast 2 offering a bigger stack of cushioning at both the heel and the 4f foot compared to the latest Nova blast at the upper it's engineered woven mesh versus jackard mesh with similar tongue and lacing combinations used and the Nova blast 5 heel collar offering a touch more padding there's big differences at the midsole where the no no blast uses the new FF blast Max for a softer feel compared to the Eco plus included in the Nova blast 4 and also the super Blast 2 where it's combined with the FF blast turbo plus found in asx's metas Speed Carbon races asex adopts a similar trampoline inspired outs soole design on both shoes to spread those Foams across a relatively broad base to bring that bounce throughout the shoe you're also getting similar outo designs with the no blast offering a bit more coverage at the for foot and lateral areas of the shoe comes to the fit of the super Blast 2 and the no blast 5 I've got the same size in both shoes which is a uk9 us10 with aex it's the same size I use across the aex range and both of them have a really good fit for me I'd say you have got really roomy forfoot on the no blast 5 but even as someone with a narrow foot like I am you know have too much room there as someone with a narrow foot but it's not being a problem in any way with lockdown or anything like that got right amount of length at the front there in terms of room for my toes good hold around the heel and midfoot I find them both very comfortable shoes just to slip on day after day so yeah no concerns with the fit I'd stick to your normal size okay so the fit for me in the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 quite a similar fit actually um both very comfortable I'm a size eight in the UK i' very much like wearing both these shoes they're both AIC shoes so a similar fit what I would say is that the um nov blast 5 is a little bit more forgiving it feels a little bit wider and the upper just feels a little bit um more flexible in in terms of how it puts pressure on your feet so uh if you maybe have a slightly wider foot you're probably going to be better off with the Nova blast 5 over the super Blast 2 but there's not a lot in it and I find both of these shoes very very comfortable so I would stick to my size in both of them so in terms of fit it's been very good for me in both of the shoes I've got them both in a UK size a that my typical run shoe size and that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in ax shoes now what I would say is the key differences for me is that with the Nova blast 5 it definitely has a more of a relaxed fit and I would say you know it's a bit more roomy in the toe box of the shoe I think it opens up a little bit more of going further back in the shoe as well and if you prefer something that's a bit more accommodating particularly if you've got slightly wider feet then I think that would be a better fit for most people I've got quite skinny narrow feet and while it is a lot rier I found it's not been overly roomier or generous with that space I think with the super blast too definitely does narrow a little bit more it's not super narrow in any way but I do think like the space up front in the toe box is still very good that hold at the midfoot is very good as well too another area I think is a key difference for me is that there's just a bit more padding around the hill col in the Nova blast 5 where you know it's definitely issue for me that's geared towards kind of giving you a little bit more of that Comfort side where you're getting that padding a pretty good amount of padding on the hill col and the super Blast 2 but it definitely isn't as much as it is on the no blast 5 so the things for me would be that the Nova blast 5 is a lot more roomy particularly the front of the shoe and and the middle section of the shoe the super blast to has less kind of padding at the hill collar but generally for me I think going through the size for both of these shoes should be fine for most people let's give you a quick word on fit then in amongst the pistachio shells on this bench and in the ax superlast 2 and the over blast five i r in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half I think these are both really kind of roomy accommodating shoes there's loads of space in the toe box up front big thumbs width there nice clearance across the top of the toes super lastar to for me they hold really well in the midfoot the heels are nicely padded I have no slipping at all Everything feels locked down and comfortable and nice and I would recommend going through to issues particularly if you want to go Long Haul because they're plenty roomy in the Nova blast 5 these are even area I mean there's so much Flex in the toe box here these are sort of spacious some people have complained about the fact that they feel too spacious particularly if you've got narrow feet maybe they will feel a bit wide but I ran in my regular running shoe size and I found everything good I I really look for lots of toebox room so look you can see you've got lots of clearance on the end there's plenty of Flex for the toes that TOS the top lock down across the midfoot was nice and secure I had good hold in the heels as well tongues take the Ed jof no problems with this and I I recommend going true to Siz in the shoe unless you really want a snug fit where or you've got a narrow foot where you might want to think about going half a size down so the aex super Blast 2 and the aex no blast 5 are both shoes that I've really liked testing this year I think they both fit their roles very well within the ax lineup with the no blast 5 being more of the mid-range shoe the daily trainer that's designed to be pretty good value appeal to a wide range of Runners have a fairly inoffensive ride that's actually no very pleasant ride in fact and one that I think will work for lots of different Runners you obvious got a load of cushioning there under foot but it's still a fairly lightweight shoe got a slight rocker there that does help you roll through your stri foot strike smoothly and actually that's been improved a little bit on the no blast 5 compared to the no blast 4 for me thanks to the redesigned heel bevel which is a little bit less huge than the one on the no blast 4 which does make it a slightly smoother ride but you've got a good foam in the Mido there which is comfortable but it's not necessarily as responsive as exciting as the stuff you are going to get on the super Blast 2 for me the no blast 5 definitely works best for kind of easy runs relaxed da training long runs that kind of thing you can pick up the pace in the shoe but you're not getting a huge amount of responsiveness out of this foam it's more just the fact that it's a pretty lightweight shoe and one with a nice rocker that means you can turn your feet over quite well the foam is soft but not too mushy for me so I find I can run faster in the shoe without it feeling like I'm you know waiting through a big wedge of soft foam so it's reasonably versatile but certainly not as versatile as something like the super blast which is a kind of a special shoe so it's obviously a lot more expensive than an overlast 5 it's build as a super training without a plate you've got the huge stack of asx's best foam there the FF turbo plus and that foam just is a lot livelier a lot more responsive and it it really makes it a lot easier to pick up the pace in the super blast compared to the no blast it's also a lighter shoe than the no blast and really you can kind of do everything that you would do in the no blast you can do it in the super blast and then it's got a lot more range in terms of that top end speed like it's not necessarily a shoe that I absolutely adore running fast in myself because style of Runner I am I've got a high Cadence fairly short stride like quite a shuffly runner and you know it's a big shoe so it's not a heavy shoe but it is a big shoe and sometimes turning it over it can a little bit too boatlike and big for me I actually would be quite Keen for them to shave off a bit of that heel bevel on the super Blast 3 as they have done with the no blast 5 I think that would probably improve it a little bit for me but I certainly can pick up the pace in it I do enjoy running it a lot recently I took it away for a trip was the only shoe I had for everything and you know it's a comfortable shoe to walk around in it then can do all the runs I did on that trip at a range of paces and it just works all of for all of them you know really very well and you do get a much livelier feel from the foam in this midsole compared to the one in the nose blast 5 so when I was running both of them at the same time that's the thing that really comes across like the super blast feels lighter and it feels a lot poppier and more responsive under the for foot in particular you get a lot more lift off the toes in general just feels like a you know more exciting ride got a denser foam on the nose blast it feels like a much more solid shoe you know a heavier shoe which it is and one that's a bit more suited just for cruising along it is still a pretty lightweight shoe like I say and it turns over well but compared to the superl you can get a lot more kind of pace and liveliness out the shoe and it's also stiffer which I think does make it more comfortable that pace that stiffness might detract from the ride a little bit at easier PES for some people like I don't really mind it myself you know it's not a shoe that's designed for Pure Comfort but it does feel fine for me on easy runs but then the extra flexibility you get from the NOA blast might appeal to some people when they're looking at just cruising around their daily training like there's a fairly big wedge of foam you get on the super blast and it does help with pushing you along but it is quite stiff like I say okay so you'll notice that I'm still not holding up the super Blast 2 because Mike still has it so I need to go and get that off him at some point desperate to get that shoe back so I can do some training um for uh Dubai Marathon uh that's coming up in a few weeks uh so these two shoes are shoes that um if you if I reviewed the no blast 4 and the super Blast 2 and compared them they're quite similar in a in in in how they run they both have a same level of firmness in the midsole they both have similar level of respons and it feels like uh the Nova blast 4 took a lot of learnings from the super blast um to provide a better all round versatile experience for runners um and I very much like both of those shoes especially for training uh a longer distance where I want to retain a consistent effort but I still want a bit of comfort and a lot of padding as well uh the Nova blast 5 uh it's quite different than superlast 2 now U because this new midell phone this FF blast Max is um a bit softer than what was in the Nova blast 4 and as a result it changes the ride of the shoe uh quite a bit for me in comparison to the to the Nova blast 4 the result of that is that um it's definitely a lot softer than the super Blast 2 um but also you don't get that same um turnover that you get in the super Blast 2 Su Blast 2 is a shoe that isn't very soft um and it has a quite a rigid midsole so it rolls your foot forward and really helps you maintain a nice fluid Pace I use the superlast 2 quite a lot for longer training sessions um where I'm trying to maintain maybe my marathon pace and it just really helps you just smoothly just cover that pace it's not really noticeable like a carbon plate shoe or something where you can feel the the carbon plate doing something uh to to impact the way that that you're running it's just a really smooth motion very comfortable nice level of padding for running at PACE and doesn't in any way um sap your energy or slow you down or anything like that but still retains a good level of comfort as well uh the no blast 5 is a Sho that um because of this softer midell foam it doesn't work so well as the no blast 4 or the super Blast 2 when you are uh running faster because for me it feels like I'm hitting that a little bit too hard um and I'm not getting a lot back there's a little of energy return you get back from this phone when you're running at a slower Pace or more of a consistent Pace but when you're picking picking up the speed um I feel like I'm really putting too much pressure into that mid cell Pham and it's not giving it me back it's it's it's sapping the energy a little bit um when I'm running faster uh I think that's really the the the key to what the Nova blast 5 is now I think it's more a daily shoe that fits more into that easier realm longer runs maybe where you just want comfort and you're not trying to pick up the pace or maintain the tempo Pace or anything like that um and and the superlast 2 is all all out designed for uh those consistent long run Paces uh it's a fantastic marathon training shoe probably be a great Marathon shoe I haven't used it for a marathon uh race but the way that the shoe rides is just very fluid very comfortable um but really allows you to maintain a pace which for me for marathan training would be about 4 minute 30 km uh if I'm going out to do like a 25k 30k long run and and that shoe just Smooths your feet and just makes you just be able to do that run really really comfortably without really adding anything to it it's a very natural ride as well it's not really forcing your foot into a specific position no blast 5 I wouldn't use it for those sorts of runs I think it I'd really feel it after a while it just deadening the the impact and not really giving me a lot back but it is a very enjoyable shoe to wear for those easier runs or a longer run where you're just trying to just maintain a nice comfortable effort you get a little bit of bounce back back it's definitely very comfortable shoot to a but for me it definitely sits into that realm of easier day shoes now um as opposed to a versatile option Su Blast 2 is very very versatile shoe great for easy runs I know Kieran thinks it's a fantastic easy run shoe I don't use it for easy runs uh I prefer a lot more softness when I'm running easy runs so if I'm just doing easy runs I'd probably pick the no blast 5 but for a shoe that is really really well designed for faster training sessions at longer at longer distance uh you can also do a lot more with it so in terms of my running time in these two shoes I've done over 50k in the Nova blast 5 now I have done near to 100 miles in the super Blast 2 and what I would say is these are two shoes that are very good at being ones that you just throw on and they are very easy to forget about what's going on in and around your foot to be ones that you know really can kind of tick that mileage off you know really get that running time in your feet without really thinking too much about it there definitely are some differences between these two shoes I think does kind of influence how I would use them how I think a lot of people may end up using them and want to use them I think the first uh Factor area for me is the weights now these aren't heavy shoes either than my heavy shoes but when you consider at least for me that the super L 2 is you know is a bigger stack shoe comes in a ways in lighter for me than no last five you know it just you know feels like it runs a little bit nicer with that weight just handles that weight a little bit better now it isn't sloppy and isn't heavy or cumbersome and the no blast 5 and it's not a lower stack shoe by a huge amount but I just found that you know having that kind of light away on a on a Max taoe is is a very nice kind of experience overall and it really kind of kind of feeds into what you're getting in the midsole what you're getting below you know uh in the out soole as well and what that kind of does for the ride in these shoes I think for me the no blast youve got the FF blast Max for me it's spread across a kind of larger surface area and what that does first and foremost is just create something that is a lot or kind of naturally very stable I think it's also a lot sof the feeling than the kind of dual density mids cell makeup in the super Blast 2 I think that what does for me the no blast 5 it just you know Comfort is the first thing it ticks off it rolls through very nicely very smoothly and for me when I've running it I found it felt more comfortable to do that kind of easier and moderate Paces when I've tried to run a little bit quicker in it it's not you know been totally uncomfortable to do that but I've just felt that when I've tried to do that in the super Blast 2 it's felt more at home it's felt more depth and that's really down to that midsole that dual density midell being you know there's some softness there but there's definitely some firmness as well too there's some bounce as well I think there a more prominent bounce for me in the super blast 2it I think the rocker is more prominent as well you know the rocker is pretty good in this in the no blast 5 but I think coupled with all the things that you're getting in these super Blast 2 it just rolls through a little bit more aggressively for me and I've raced in it I've done track sessions in it I've done faster sessions I've done shorter and long kind of runs in it as well and I felt it's covered you or felt comfortable to do it at all of those Paces I think the other thing I mentioned other videos I think transitioning from those different Paces you know the super Blu does a very good job of that and that's why is kind of a standout do it all shoot I think the Nova blast five for me when I have tried to mix the Pacers in a single run I haven't found it as comfortable I haven't found it as Lively and bouncy barring the first run that I did in it but it's a definitely good experience in both these shoes just for very different runs so I think these are good daily trainer shoes you know relatively kind of big stack shoes as well for me there clearly one that is a little bit more versatile and a little bit more friendly towards running a little bit more Tempo and faster um but definitely good shoes for me other areas I think the out Souls I think you know for me I think the no blast 5 is giving you a little bit more rubber on that outsole and I think durability wise I'm seeing less wear obviously less running time but for me the super plus 2 has been H holding up pretty well obviously still getting some exposed areas there's definitely a bit more more rubber on the Nova blast 5 for me in those kind of similar areas as well so for me from a you know durability point of view I think you're going to get a bit more from no blast 5 gripping has been fine for me I've run in kind of wetter and drri conditions for both these aren't the best kind of you know Road running outsoles available but they seem to be up to task or have been up to task in my run so yeah two very good shoes two very good Asic shoes two very good daily trainer shoes but it's definitely one that I pick of the other that's not to say the other one is bad but I just think the other or there's one shoe here that works a little bit better for me and I'll get to that in my verdict so in testing I've run north of 30 mil in the new Nova blast 5 I've run much more in the super Blast 2 including a full Marathon test in this shoe that's on the channel now if you want to go and find it all of that has been across a range of paces and terrain I also did a side bys side Mile with one shoe on each foot to really tease out the differences between these two shoes and here's how that went so I've just done my side by side Mile with the super Blast 2 on my right foot I've got the Nova blast five on my left foot minute you put the shoes on you feel the higher stack in the super blast you can feel that there's that extra stiffness and firmness in the midsole compared to the softer novablast 5 which feel sort of sinky when you first put them on by comparison superlast to sort of you know they're cushion but they sort of hold you up and you're expecting that kind of stiffness and that roll through and that transition to come uh as a result of a slightly kind of stiffer ride there's a more immediacy as a result of that they're both big Cush C shoes though I don't think the superlast 2 you know sacrificing that much cushion for me anyway they it does feel like a bigger shoe on the foot there's a lot more kind of heft to it doesn't feel quite as Nimble you know it's a thing to say that NOA blast feels a bit more compact by comparison because the Nova blast is not a compact shoe by any stretch of the imagination but it does feel I mean they're about the same weight but I would say the no blast 5 actually feels a bit lighter I think it's just because you've got more of the superlast underf foot stability wise I quite like the firmness of the super Blast 2 I think that provides a bit more of a stable platform for me a bit more reliability you do feel a little bit of mush and wobble I think into the Nova blast five if anything I expected over blast 5 in my head for the runs that i' done with it initially to be a bit more like the super Blast 2 but actually I think the over blast 4 which had that kind of slightly additional stiffness firmness underf foot now feels much more like the super blast than the Nova blast 5 does the Nova blast 5 brings softness so how does that translate then well if you've run in the super blast to if you've watched reviews and you've thought actually maybe they might be a little bit too stiff for you to go Long Haul into the long miles and you wanted more softness and the Nova blast 5 is going to add that it gets to the energy in a different way though it's slightly more reliant on a sink and a bounce for the energy to come back where you get a lot of energy and bounce from the super Blast 2 but you also get a little bit of that kind of immediacy from the stiffness that comes so it's a bit quicker to respond it's a bit punchier as a result there's a bit more kind of top speed potential I think of the superlast 2 it's overall just a bit more of an energetic shoe where the Nova blast 5 now I think bit more cushioning probably bit more accommodating for going slower and longer whereas the super Blast 2 is probably better you know cruising those kind of tempo Paces maybe a little bit higher up if you don't mind running in a big shoe that is how I would divide those shoes but we'll do the verdict back in the office it comes to my verdict like these are both good shoes and shoes that fit their roles well within the aex lineup if you are looking for one shoe absolutely everything and you want you're prepare to pay for a special feeling under fit you are going to get it with a super blast 2 like it's a pretty amazing shoe it's not one that's entirely to my taste like I've picked out shoes that I prefer to it that are also you know really fun all rounders and all that but it's certainly an amazing shoe one that I do like running in and one that obviously is very popular with people at large like if you are just looking for one shoe to do everything the super blast is the one to do it in if you're looking for a fast training shoe then the super blast is the one to pick over the no blast the no blast is certainly better value you can use it for the same kind of runs as the super blast you're just not going to get the same energetic ride feel and is a bit more kind of cushy and relaxed when it comes to easy runs like you're looking at putting these shoes in a rotation superlast either could be you know a rotation killer a shoe you're used for everything or one that fits into rotation in the middle of it there like picking up the bulk of your mileage with a maybe a very easy comfortable cushion shoe for some easy runs and then a fast plated shoe for you know really top end Speedy stuff whereas the no blast 5 I position more towards the cushion end of things in a rotation I'd want to have you know a faster training shoe alongside this and maybe a racer as well though you can use it for a bit of everything like it doesn't really have the pace that I'd be looking for in an allrounder if you are a newer runner though I think the no blast 5 is a really good allrounder actually I think it's one that will protect the legs well but is fairly lightweight you can use it for some Speedy stuff like if I was a new Runner I wanted one you to do everything I would get the no blast first before know spending loads of money on something like the super blast I think the no blast does play a role in being you know a cheaper version of the super blast in a way and it is a fair bit cheaper but the super blast you know you are paying more for it but you are going to get a big upgrade in performance if you do spend that money okay so my verdict on the super Blast 2 and the Nova blast 5 is obviously the super Blast 2 is a much more expensive shoe um so if it came down to cost and the fact that it's almost impossible to buy the super Blast 2 and I know many of you will comment on this video uh saying that you can't get hold of it sorry about that there's nothing we can do to get them to stock more super blast 2os um but because of that no blast 5 is probably going to be the only option for most people anyway if even if you could get it it's a very expensive shoe2 200 is a lot of money to spend on a training shoe um which is above a lot of people's budget so the no blast 5 comes in under that it's a shoe design for more General Runners it's a shoe design for people that don't want to spend £200 on a running shoe um but it's not as good a shoe um obviously uh it's a lot significantly cheaper than the super Blast 2 um if I was looking at purely the shoes themselves and ignoring the price and the availability of them I would say that super Blast 2 is a far superior shoe um for most runs if you're going to go out and buy a shoe then you wanted something that you could do a lot of stuff in easier runs daily sessions faster sessions um long runs super Blast 2 just ticks off all of those really really well noas 5 doesn't really take off all of those well at all it really ticks off the easier runs and the comfortable training sessions the daily runs where you just want a nice bit of softness uh and comfort and you want to take off the miles uh in as much um with as much padding and and comfort as you can get um but it's really not a huge design for versatility or uh it's defin not sure I'd use if I was training for a marathon I was doing lots of longer sessions or faster sessions so I think it really comes down to that if you're looking between these two shoes and you're not worried about price or availability but obviously if you're just a general Runner that's looking for a comfortable daily shoe you're not going to go for the superlast 2 because it's just so expensive uh and hard to get so out of for me I'm going to go superlast 2 all the way but I understand that the no plus 5 is a more cost effective option but it's limited to easier sessions you can't really do a lot in this shoe after my first run in the no blast 5 where I ran well and the NOA blast 5 gave back good energy I was wondering if they might be a more affordable alternative to the super Blast 2 a sort of super blast light if you will but after logging many more miles in both shoes I don't think that's quite the case here both shoes are enticingly versatile but the superlast 2 is by far the more energetic shoe with a smoother ride and I think a more consistent punch across all the ranges of pace the no boss 5 has energy and it's also a capable Cruiser but but for me the softer Edge just isn't quite as encouraging as the ride you get from the super Blast 2 it just doesn't quite give you that extra oomph I actually think the Nova blast 4 runs more like the super Blast 2 it's a bit firmer a bit snappier now The Sweet Spot for the Nova blast 5 and the super Blast 2 is really cruising from around my marathon pace up to Tempo there's enough cushion on both shoes to eat easy miles in relative Comfort too I could Long Haul in both of these shoes but I find both shoes can get a bit sluggish at my very slowest pace at least when I'm running in my heaviest form when it comes to the fastest training both shoes can be a bit too much shoe on the foot I find for me to want to tackle things like all out of intervals again you can do these sessions in either shoe but I wouldn't say either of them really excels at it over and above some other shoes now the superl 2 is a better shoe all round the grip Superior the ride is snappier but if you're on a budget could you cover the same runs in the over blast five the answer I think is probably yes would they be as good I don't think quite if you're taking money out of the question I'd certainly choose the superlast two out of these two shoes I think on balance is the more accomplished all rounder and the slightly snappier ride which appeals more to the way I run so my take with you should go the A6 blast 5 or the as6 super Blast 2 now the first thing I'll say is that these are two very good daily trainer shoes if you're telling me which one is the best it's a no-brainer it's a super blast too this is the shoe if you want a shoe that can do uncover all of your runs and do it in a really good way then that's what the super Blast 2 is going to give you in terms of the Nova blast 5 being a super blast light I think it works for some of the runs that the super Blast 2 works well at but not all of them I think this is a shoe you get if you you know can't get hold of the super Blast 2 you want a shoe that's accommodating that is comfortable works for shorter and longer runs and I think for me easy to moderate Paces that's really where you know it fits best for me so if that's what would work for you that's what you would look for in a daily trainer Sho and go for the over blast 5 if you want the best shoe between these two shoes the one that can work for faster Paces longer runs shorter runs could be used for track sessions as well it's a super blast 2 you1 I appreciate it's hard to get a hold of but if you can you're going to be rewarded with a very good daily Trainer shoe that weighs in at the kind of standard daily trainer weight and overall it's just a very good shoe one of my favorite shoes to running or to have running this year so for me if I could get a hold of it and you know I'm fortunate that I do have one I would be going for the super Blast 2 if you wanted a shoe that you know and that daily trainer profile that definitely Vees towards being more comfortable but can definitely work for shorter and longer runs easy to modate Paces I'd be going for the Nova blast 5 okay so there you have it that our take on how the Nova blast 5 compares to the super Blast 2 if you got any questions about either of these shoes or other shoes you want to see them compared to do let us know in the comments as always like And subscribe hit that little bell to find out about our latest videos and yeah we'll see you next run test this video\n\nFrom video 'ASICS SUPERBLAST 2 (completely unbiased review)':\n\nthe most anticipated shoe of the year is finally here the aex super blast version 2 the original super blast burst onto the scene last year and almost immediately became one of my absolute favorite alltime training shoes and when I'm not out running testing other shoes this was the shoe I'd reach for about 90% of the time clocking it over 3,000 km in a few different versions of version one with two big updates to version two with the out soole and the upper hereit I was really worried that aex might be messing this one up so is this new model going to live up to my very high expectations or am I going to be scaring eBay to try and find some pairs of version one and as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review right let's get stuck into all of the changes between the version one and version two the price of the Superglass 2 is a little bit more expensive here in the UK now costing £200 most markets around the world it's pretty much the same we have got an updated midsole this big chunk through the middle here which now uses the FF turbo the same as the updated metas speed sky and Edge asex is most premium responsive foam that they offer out there and then we've got a thin layer along the bottom of here of asx's FF blast plus which is what they use for a little bit more durability and also sort of stabilizing the shoe we've got an updated outsole much welcome updated outo this is new aex grip rubber on the bottom here a little bit more grippy here in the wet weather we'll come on to chat about that a little bit later on the review and also you can't get any stones and Pebbles and little hitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe here which I you get all the time on version one when you'd run on sort of more grally areas they filled in all of those holes in slightly different design and pattern on version two and then finally we've got a different updated upper to the shoe here which is now this one piece woven engineered mesh so it's a little bit more stretchy and just has a little bit more movement with the shoe versus version one right let's get stuck into the facts and figures this is is your long distance mileage monster for crushing those long runs out there and it's also one of the very best non-plated racing shoes perfect for like 10K half marathons marathons and also Ultra marathons if they're going to be on the road as well is very much a road shoe although you could do have a little bit of light trail with this great aex grip on the bottom here price-wise this sent me back £200 here in the UK around about €220 $200 around about $320 Australian dollars stack Heights we've got 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and it's basically the same weight as the outgoing model for me this is coming at 288 G that's really really quite light for sure of this size this is in my particular size UK 11 A2 here the old version was 290 so basically exactly the same it is a neutral shoe the upper as I've just said is this lovely engineered mesh upper which Asic say is going to improve the air flow through the shoe midso we've got the FF Turbo plus through the middle here and then the FF blast plus Eco along the bottom of the shoe there there is famously no carbon plate in the shoe and the outsole Now features this aex grip which is these yellow sections here and aex also put this on some of their trail shoes as well so it's very tacky very sticky a lce sort of slow density rubber to try and improve on asx's usually quite poor wet weather performance there are no different wits available at launch but it's pretty good here on the witth side there's also this one Flagship color at launch which is asx's Paris colorway personally I absolutely love this let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments asex say that this is to do with Paris called the city of lights and we've got sunset and sunrise colors here and finally this wasn't true to size I actually ordered a size 12 my usual size and a size 11 and 1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version one and I've stuck with that in version two basically i' just say go half a size down from your regular size or go exactly the same size you had in version one if you had that shoe if you could like and share this video and let us know down in the comments your thoughts on the superl 2 that be great and please check out my website benp parks.com we've got training plans the best running hats in the world some technical gear and Casual gear to keep you going through your training right let's get stuck into the likes my first like here is they didn't mess it up come on I get so worried when you have your absolute favorite shoe out there and a manufacturer releases a new one and you're like please don't mess it up please don't make it really heavy bulky use different materials they have used different materials but all the updates in the shoe have worked really well the upper is just a little bit more breathable the key area such as the ankle lock down absolutely fantastic no slipping no blisses no hot spots nice gusseted tongue here just gives the perfect right amount of padding so your foot stays nicely locked down yes I was a bit worried my foot might move around a little bit at the front of the shoe with this woven mesh upper but it just stays perfectly in place so no problems there and also finally thank you to ax for not increasing the weight actually for me brought it down very very so slightly super lightweight shoe it is absolutely amazing how a shoe can be this light and it just feels so much fun to run in my second like with the shoe is this updated midsole foam it's just ever so slightly more Poppy and responsive but really very very similar if you're a fan of version one you're going to love this updated foam in version two It just strikes that perfect balance in a shoe that can just have that sudden turn with speed of course there's plenty of faster dedicated 5K and 10K shoes with plates and things like that there but that's not what this shoe is all about this shoe is perfect for crunching those long distance marathon training runs or marathon races as well if you don't want to be using a carbon plate and really if you don't want to have a carbon plate in your shoe there really is nothing faster out there than the aex super blast version 2 and then finally my third like with the shoe is this updated outsole the super blast was okay in the wet it really wasn't that great but the new aex grip they put on the bottom of the shoe here just means all of that worry has gone away when I have running it in the wet it's just gripped super fantastically and you really can feel the difference even walking around the house the you one it just feels different it's lot more tacky when aex had all their problems with their grip with their wet weather grip in like the Nova Blast 2 and three it really wasn't very good this you don't have to worry about it at all fantastic update aex well done finally got a shoe that you can trust in the wet weather and also you can just take this out on some light Trails as well and it will handle those absolutely fine some fire roads and things like that you'll be good to go here moving on to the dislikes this is really hard to be honest my first dislike isn't really even about the shoe it's just about all the supply issues that you have with the superlast and I don't know why aexs are like this the shoe sells out so quickly pretty much sold out on launch day all around the world maybe it's all just marketing I don't know there's nothing in this shoe that you can't get on all of the other ax shoes the materials are all available but they really seem to limit Supply I can only assume I don't know why that is but this shoe will be selling out very very quickly if you can get a pair you want to get a pair don't dilly dally just go and get that order in and also the shoe was meant to launch on Friday just gone on the aex website here in the UK they didn't even launch because I think they had supply issues themselves and they delayed their launch again I don't know that's just what I suspect even assets can't get it right I got my player from sport shoes got up at 5:30 in the morning to try and secure a pair which I managed to do so very very happy with that got the 11 and a half and 12 come in and now yeah need to send the 12's back cuz I just a bit worried about the sizing but we're all good the second sort of dislike I've got with a shoe yeah it is a little bit on the expensive side it's so hard to be talking about a 200 shoe and saying this is great it is a fantastic shoe but also what you're getting with that 200 L is a super durable shoe as well I'd always get at least 1,000 k out of my version one the updated outsol in the shoe should be even better so it should be getting a little bit more mileage out of this but it does last a long time I can't wait to bring a full whizbang pop review once I've done my thks in the shoe will slot it into a review somewhere down the line and speaking of cost maybe you're better off at going for something like the Nova blast 4 for example £65 less that's a big chunk of cash and really the Nova blast is a superb allaround shoe the super blast it is slightly quicker without a doubt it's just a little bit more responsive less bouncy foam you get here and it is better suited for your long runs just a bit firmer bit lighter and just a bit Smo smoother through the footstrike overall but I'd say stick with the Nova blast if you're just looking for something that you can do all of your runs pretty well and you're not doing too many long runs it's a shoe that's I'd say around about 90% as fast and really will suit the vast majority of people unless you're looking for the absolute Crema creme or if you're very fortunate to have the budget and you want to get both of them then you could use you all your sort of regular daily training in the Nova blast and then use this for your marathon training long runs and maybe even a marathon racing shoe at the weekend moving on the Neo Vista hit the scene a few weeks ago I gave it a rave review it was fantastic £50 cheaper and it really is a bit of a shoe at the moment has a nylon plate in it so slightly different feel very different ride going through the shoe it's bouncier and it's softer and it does soak up those easy Mars a little bit better the super blast picks up the pace a little bit better and it does have a firmer ride both these shoes supremely comfortable I could personally choose this type of upper rather than the booty upper just get a better lock down in this one and with the near Vista it's just a little less stable around the corners where this is absolutely Rock Solid and the super blast will probably last a little bit longer with this better out soole with the shoe there as well so I really think you're getting about the same sort of value yes the super blast is a little bit more expensive but it will last a lot longer I think in my opinion then finally something like the Nike Invincible version 3 around about 20 cheaper here the Invincible is a lot bouncier it's roomier it's heavier it's perfect for those easy recovery runs but again a shoe manufacturers using their Flagship foam without putting that carbon plate in the shoe the super blast is just much smoo through the stride a lot firmer much more Nimble and lightweight and just better at a more wider range of speeds where something like the Invincible it's really is just your sort of steady marathon pace really steady marathon pace and easing recovery run sort of shoe so let's bring this all together what do I think of the superlast well it's a fantastic shoe without a doubt it is definitely going into my rotation I'm going to finish my miles I've got about 300 miles left in my last pair of version one so I'm not going to use this straight away it's not a revolutionary update get subscribed and see if this shoe will be making into my top three shoes of the year which we normally launch around about December time if you are interested in other asset shoes we've got a complete assets comparison guide again completely unsponsored B all the asset shoes with I money check that out that is up here coming up next let me know if you've got any questions down in the comments about the super blast I'll catch up and answer all of those down there keep it working hard guys keep done I'm have to get some more marathon training done we see you very soon in the next one\n\nUser Question: asics superblast 2\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context

come at A Rang of prices like I said a pegasus 41 is the cheapest shoe it's £130 or $140 Pegasus plus is £165 or $180 and the Pegasus premium is £185 or $210 then it comes to the weights the Pegasus 41 is 291 G or 10.3 o Pegasus plus is the lightest shoe in the range at 257 G or 9 oz and heaviest shoe in the range is actually the Pegasus premium which is a beefy 328 G or 11.6 Oz all those weights are in my UK size 9 shoes which is a us10 they've all got a 10 mm drop the kind of classic Nike 10 mm drop across the board when it comes to stack IES the Pegasus premium is the highest stack shoe it's 45 mm at the heel 35 at the 4ot not sure on the exact specs on the other two shoes but they're lower than that I think the Pegasus plus is probably the lowest stack shoe but both it and the Pegasus 41 seem to be just under 40 mm at the heel when it comes to design with the Pegasus 41 you have a react x midsole with Air Zoom pods in there the midsoles very much the key differences between the three shoes they've all got a blend of kind of three materials but like I said with the Pegasus 41 it's react X foam Air Zoom pods engineered mesh upper lots of padding on it and then a waffle tread out soole then as you go up to the Pegasus plus you get an improved midsole foam it's all made from Nike's zoomx foam this is not the softest version of zoomx I've ever tested this is the bouncy foam you see in their best shoes in general but it is a more responsive and lightweight pH then the stuff in the Pegasus 41 then you have a fly it upper and then a rubber out soole again you got that kind of waffle tread pretty good coverage on the shoe as well then stepping up to the Pegasus premium there's a whole lot going on in the midell here you've got three different materials basically a blend of the materials used in the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus you got a top layer of zoomx foam with a layer of react X foam going from the heel to the midfit at the bottom and then in between those you've got a full Air Zoom unit which is a first and Nike shoes is a very responsive material obviously it's quite eye-catching design as well you got engineered mesh uper good amount of padding there and then again waffle outsole good coverage on the bottom of the shoe [Music] there comes to fit of the three shoes got all of them in a uk9 which is a US 10 that's the size I use across Nike range and have done for many years have done in many models of the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus turbo and they all fit me really well got a good hold around the he and midfoot enough room in the toes wouldn't say there's much of a difference in fit across the three shoes they've all got fairly padded uh heel collar on the back there and tongue and a good amount of room the toe so I'd stick to your normal running shoe size and the same size across these three [Music] shoes so Pegasus lineup these are all meant to be responsive daily trainers kind of catering for different price points different styles of running perhaps of different preferences and ride feeli they've all got kind of Fairly classic Nike silhouette with that 10 mm drop fairly narrow design not the most rocked shoes all around and it's really the mix of materials you have in the midsole here and the much higher stack height on the Pegasus premium that creates a slight difference in ride feeli so I've run about 50 to 100K in each of these shoes using them for a mix of daily training I've done some short runs where I've been wearing two of the shoes at the same time to kind of directly compare them and certainly I have thoughts and we'll go into those thoughts now we'll go for the shoes in turn let's start with the the Pegasus 41 which is the classic Nike Pegasus it's you a really good model of the Pegasus I think this is a really good mid-range daily trainer that will suit lots of Runners hasn't got the most exciting ride underfoot the Foams in the midsole are kind of comfortable but they're not very responsive especially under the forefoot there but it will work for lots of Runners it's the most stable of the three Pegasus shoes for sure the widest and the most stable it's not too heavy for such a cushion shoe it does offer pretty good blend of comfort and a bit of Versatility for daily training it's not a shoe that I've Loved going fast in particularly myself but you can do a bit of uptempo stuff and it's certainly going to be a durable shoe you know it's in line very much with lots of mid-range trainers from other brands things like the sakon ride 17 the ASX no blast 5 those kind of shoes it's not going to offend many Runners but it's also not going to give you you know a particularly exciting feeling under foot and you do get more of that if you upgrade to the Pegasus Plus plus simply because of the improved foam in the mid soole here so got quite a similar design all around 10 mm drop fairly similar looking shoe little bit narrower the Pegasus plus and with that better foam in the Mido just makes it a fair bit lighter all around and as a result you get a better shoe in terms of Versatility Pegasus plus is certainly the one of these three shoes I would view as the best for faster running I enjoy doing know a wider range of daily training in it I think it's got the pep for kind of tempo runs interval sessions that kind of thing it's still not a really far shoe it's not like a super trainer like something like Nike Zoom fly which is a plate and just you know a more sprightly design all around but you can pick up in the pace in it it's got a nice natural feel on the foot and certainly of these three shoes is the one I'd be looking at if I was looking for you know a really versatile all round shoe that has a bit of speed there it probably Compares best to lightweight plate free shoes from other brands like the Hoka Max 6 New Balance Rebel V4 that kind of thing to show you can do a lot of different running in because it is still cushioned and comfortable enough four easy runs long runs the kind of stuff you do in the Pegasus it's not quite as wide and as stable as the Pegasus it's not quite as cushy on the I'd say at the heel but it is still very comfortable and I enjoyed going long in the shoe uh without any problems and you've got quite a similar ride to the Pegasus 41 with that 10 mm drop kind of snaps through you know you get a little bit of 4ot discomfort sometimes over long distances because they are quite thin under the 4ot because of that 10 mm drop but still a comfortable shoe and one that I do think is the most verstile of these three the Pegasus 41 to the Pegasus plus is quite a natural progression you've got a similar style of shoe just with kind of better materials in the Pegasus plus which you pay a bit more for but then the Pegasus premium is something quite different to the others like it's got a lot more foam Under Foot you've got a bouncier design for sure this is the bounciest Pegasus for sure you've got a really much more responsive feeling under the for foot cuz you've got much higher stack there so you get more comfort with the Pegasus premium under the 4 foot and a lot more response as well like it does give you a really bouncy ride I was running with this shoe at the same time as the other two you do get you know a lot more lift off that 4 foot but the trade-off is that it's a lot heavier this shoe and that's noticeable as well like I have done some faster running in the Pegasus premium and it just feels more natural to do it in something like the Pegasus plus because it's just a lighter shoe it just feels easier to up the pace in this like when you get into a nice flat stretch of road or even a mile downhill you can really bounce along and cruise along very merrily in the Pegasus plus but the weight certainly holds it back and I don't think it's necessarily uh the most well-rounded daily trainer because it's also I think the least stable of these three shoes and it's not just because it's the highest stack height of them but it's also got the narrowest pinch Point around the midfoot which I think is quite a strange design uh Choice from Nike given that you've got this High stack of Foams does mean it's ever so slightly wobbly underfoot like I'm a neutral Runner and I still found you know I was pronating a little bit in this shoe compared to the others and I think if you are someone who needs a bit of stability I'll definitely avoid the Pegasus premium of these three shoes the Pegasus 41 is certainly the most stable so it's definitely the most interesting ride of the three and it's probably a little bit more modern and different to the other Nike shoes because even though it still has that 10 mm drop it does feel a bit more rocket and you transition a bit more smoothly in the Pegasus premium I'd say and having that thick chunk of foam under foot is very different to other the Nike shoes which like I say often because of the 10 mm drop can be a bit thin under the 4 foot compared to lots of more rocked or lower drop shoes on the market Pegasus premium you know has that extra cush there gives you a nice bouncy feeling there gives you a more protective feeling on long runs but yeah the trade-off is weight and also unfortunately stability I would say so this is a shoe that probably lines up more with Max cushion Cruisers from other brands like the Brooks Glycerin Max uh the hoker Skyward X or the puga Puma mag Max it's not really a super trainer per se like one that you'd use for a bit of everything that's the Nike Zoom fly for sure and in this range it feels like you know you've got natural step up from Pegasus 41 to Pegasus plus and something quite different on top of that which you know will probably really appeal to some Runners but I think we'll have less broad appeal than these two shoes the Pegasus 41 and the pegus plus are a pretty good reliable work or daily trainers pegus premium is something quite [Music] different so it comes to my verdict on the Pegasus range I think the Nike Pegasus plus is the best all around shoe in the Pegasus range these days it's the one I'd be picking up if I was looking to add a shoe to rotation or if I was looking for an all around a shoe to do a bit of everything in like it's it's pretty comfortable it's lightweight it's fast it's nippy it's got a nice you know Snappy ride to it you can do bit of everything in it and it like I said it's quite a natural step up on the Pegasus 41 you trade off a little bit of stability and width and comfort at the back of the shoe but you still have a comfortable shoe here it's still pretty stable and you get a lot more response out of the zoomx mile you get a lighter shoe and just a more accomplished all round shoe so that's the one that I think is the best shoe in this range think if you're a newer Runner or you're just looking for a comfortable and durable shoe for easy runs then the Nike Pegasus 41 is a really good choice as well it's a little bit cheaper than the pegas plus it's a shoe that always pops up in sales as well and it's quite a nice shoe as well in terms of looks so you can use it for walking around as well which is good and yeah it's a good shoe as well it's like it's not as responsive and fast for sure it's not a shoe that I view as particularly first time myself it's a very solid all round shoe and one that will work for lots of Runners so I would say these are both pretty good shoes that could find a spot in most people's rotation and the Pegasus premium is something quite different so I think it's not the shoe I'd recommend buying purely from a running perspective for sure if you love The Look of this shoe and you want a shoe that you can use for lifestyle use and the occasional run it will do the job of that just be a bit wary of that stability if you also just want the bounciest liveliest ride possible out of these three shoes then it is the Pegasus premium it's just the tradeoff there is very much the weight so if you're looking for the most fun shoe I guess to do easy runs that kind of thing then it is the Pegasus premium but if you're looking for a more of a Workhorse trainer to do those easy runs and other runs as well then yeah the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus plus I think you know certainly more Compass running shoes and a fair bit cheaper but this is you know it's a bit different especially for Nike with that extra foam under the under the for foot there you are going to get nice bouncy feeling there it is fun to running yeah just got those concerns about weight stability and indeed price so the other shoes I think are probably more natural fits for most Runners and like I say of the three my favorite is definitely the Pegasus [Music] plus that's our run through of the Nike Pegasus lineup for 2025 let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Early Review: How does it compare to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus?':\n\nhello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and this is our early review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so the Pegasus premium is an all new addition to the Nike range the Pegasus premium will sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus plus which is kind of a lightweight responsive allrounder shoe that has a zoomx midsole and then the Pegasus 41 is the entry level model the classic Pegasus which has a mix of react ex and Air Zoom pods in its midso now if you remember all those phones that's important because the Pegasus premium uses all of them in its Mido which has three layers it's a very high stack shoe it's the most expensive Pegasus shoe it's the heaviest Pegasus shoe and it's the shoe with the highest stack in the range and all around it's very very interesting on paper so excited to get out for a couple of runs in it so far it's set to launch next year at the end of January in the UK it's going to cost 18499 not sure on the US price as yet Nike gives the weight as 320 G which which is kind of an average across the line my UK size 9 which is US size 10 weighed in at 328 G or 11.6 o so you fair bit heavier than the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus because of this big stack heite which is 45 mm at the heel 35 mm at the 4ot so the kind of classic Pegasus 10 mm drop but a higher heel height than we've seen before in the line obviously the main interest in the shoe is definitely much in the midsole but looking at the other parts of the shoe the upper is an engineered mesh you've got a bit of padding around the tongue and heill actually it's quite an interesting almost duvet style tongue I found it's quite soft and and thick but it's quite lightweight as well and you've got fairly substantial heel counter and a lot of padding around the heel of the shoe and the outside you got pretty good rubber coverage aside from long section down the middle of the shoe which is a slight cutout that shows off the Air Zoom pod but at the heel and foref foot of the shoe you've got rubber in Nike's kind of typical waffle outsole pattern in the midsole there are three layers to this so the top layer is Nike zox foam this is the bouncy peber foam that introduced on shoes like the vaporfly and alphafly Racing shoes is now used in the Invincible and the Pegasus plus as it's kind of bouncy lightweight responsive foam then you have a fulllength Air Zoom pod running through the shoe which is the key Innovation I guess with the Pegasus premium Nike's been using this Air Zoom technology in pod form across lots of shoes for several years like you see in the alphafly the hidden within the Pegasus midsole as well the Pegasus 41 that is but now they've been able to form this continuous unit that runs the length of the shoe that gives you that responsive feeling all the way from heel to 4 foot also stabilizes what is quite a high stack of foam underneath that you have some react X foone which is the phone used in the Pegasus 41 and the Infiniti rn4 perhaps to try and stabilize the back of the shoe a bit more and also give a bit more durability it's quite hard wearing Pham react X so Pegasus premium was announced earlier this year very exciting looking sh was very interested to get out and tested it I have tested the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus as well done a couple of runs in the Pegasus premium so let's dive into how I found it first have a quick look at the fit and there's not much to say here it was all good in in my normal running shoe size got uk9 here us10 that's the size I've used across Nike's range ever since I've been testing Nike shoes the same size I have across the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus and yeah got a good amount of room in the forf foot it's quite tapered design but that fits me quite well I've got quite narrow foot I don't think it's an especially narrow shoe though good hold around the heel and midfoot on my run so far so yeah no concerns with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size with the Pegasus [Music] premium so far I've done two hourong runs in the Pegasus premium I've done both of them at fairly easy Paces the odd pickup here and there the first one I did I've got a fairly fresh leg so I was running a bit faster than the second one when it was a full recovery run on very heavy legs and yeah the shoe certainly has a very interesting ride like you do really feel the high stack and the combination of Foams in the mids sole in a way that is quite different to the Pegasus plus and the Pegasus 41 so feels very much like a shoe that is built for cruising and just bouncing you along like it doesn't feel like a super Speedy shoe to me and you can feel the weight if you try and pick up the pace or when I was running uphill even at an easy pace you start to feel the weight of the shoe a little bit but if you are on the flat or on a downhill you can get into a really nice Rhythm hitting that big stack of foam getting a nice amount of spring off and you know just really moving along quite nicely and it feels fairly effortless at times despite the fact you know it is quite a big shoe of the Foams in the Mido the one that I felt the most was definitely that Air Zoom unit which adds a bit of firmness for sure and you stabilizes the rer it doesn't feel like a for a high stack shoe like this doesn't feel like a very soft and Squishy shoe to me like you're hitting that Zoom X which does compress a fair bit then you hit the Air Zoom pod which you know gives you a lot of kind of bounce back and response as we've seen it in other shoes like the alphafly even when you hit the zoomx into the Pod you then get that bounce back and now that's running the full length of the shoe you don't get a really soft feeling at the heel but you do get moved quite smoothly onto the forefoot and get a fair bit of response from that Air Zoom unit you do get a little bit of the noise you kind of expect from Nike shoes a pods in and you know Nike shoes in general can be a bit Slappy it does have that slight feel to it the one thing I noticed with it compared to the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus was that these are all 10 mm shoes as a heel striker sometimes get a bit slap through when I'm running in a 10 mm shoe kind of slapping down on the foref foot you get a little bit less of that at the Pegasus premium because of the high stack of Foams that kind of compressed together it almost feels like a slightly lower drop shoe and you kind of get moved through a bit more smoothly onto that forefoot one thing I definitely noticed with the shoe is it feels quite narrow around the midfoot of the shoe so for a really high stack shoe like this with lot of Brands you'll get quite a wide base on the bottom to make sure that they're stable and hasn't happened with Nike it's got quite a tapered midfoot on both sides and your foot overhangs a little bit on the inside now the Air Zoom unit does do I think quite a lot to help stabilize the shoe but I definitely think if you are someone who uses a stability shoe or in general is a bit worried about it you should probably stay clear of the shoe because there's a lot of foam there and it does roll a little bit inwards like I'm a neutral Runner and didn't really notice it too much on the run but I feel like when I'm looking at the cutaways of me running in the shoe and that kind of thing it does feel like yeah that's quite a narrow midell for such a high stack shoe do think stability might be a little bit of a concern for people in the shoe again because of that high stack and narrow midfoot so of the two runs I did in the yearo like I say one was on quite fresh legs and one was on very heavy legs and I definitely prefer the Pegasus premium when I was a bit fresher it feels like you can engage all those Foams a bit more run a bit more with purpose get a bit more bounce back and when I was on very heavy legs tired legs after a lot of like hard workouts I was using it as a recovery run shoe it just felt you know a bit too much shoe I wasn't turning over so well and as someone has got a high Cadence I'm not the heaviest runner in the world I wasn't really engaging all of those phones that well and I was just kind of plodding along so that might be a bit different if you are someone who puts a bit more force in you're slightly heavier Runner or someone who bounds a bit more you might get a bit more engagement from all those phones at kind of any Pace but yeah that that on that run it a bit more just like a big shoe still fine you know seems to protect the legs pretty well but doesn't feel like a shoe that's built for Flatout recovery like you might expect from a big high stack shoe like this with this weight it feels more in the line of things like I guess the Puma magmax or even the Hocus SC X like big heavy High stack shoes that are built to be quite versatile though still like with lots of stuff in the mid I'll try and help you bounce along and if you're not getting all that bounce which I really wasn't on that kind of recovery run then then it doesn't feel so good but when I was on like I say when I was on kind of a more of a classic daily training run and just moving along a fairly relaxed pace it did feel like I was getting a bit more spring back from the [Music] shoe so very early verdict on the Pegasus premium mostly is that I'm not exactly sure where I stand on the shoe still like it is an interesting shoe it is got a bouncy ride it's got a very interesting combination of Foams but it's a heavy shoe has that slight stability issue I think around the midfoot with that narrow design but it was fun to run in but I'm still not convinced this a kind of shoe I would pick myself for any runs compared to the other Pegasus models which probably suit my running style a little bit better as more lightweight shoes with kind of slight more Snappy design to them but certainly an interesting shoe it definitely has a little bit of the ultra boost vibe to it in that it's a very good looking shoe an interesting looking shoe that you want to wear around a street wear but then you can also run in I'll probably do a comparison of those shoes in time but the ultra boost for a long time was very similarly heavy has now come down a bit in weight but doesn't really have I think the same level of kind of Bounce in it because it doesn't have you know such impressive phones in the midy as you get on the Pegasus premium but again two kind of similar shoes cool shoes can run in them as well so will be of interest to sneaker heads as well as Runners but when this shoe was initi announced there was a little bit oh is this going to be Nikes you know super training you've got that Big Air Zoom pod you've got some zoomx foam in there is this going to you know fill a gap in their lineup but that's not really what I'm getting from the shoe myself like the zoomfly 6 which just recently came out fills that Gap that's an excellent super trainer I put in a lot of miles in that shoe over the last week and a half and I'm really enjoying running it the Pegasus premium doesn't feel like a fast versatile super trainer like that shoe which compares to things like the Hoka ma X2 or the Endorphin speed 4 doesn't really feel like the ax super blast either which is a plateless super trainer with the mega stack as well the Pegasus premium to me definitely feels more in line with shoes like the Puma mag Max the hookus Skyward X maybe even like the Brooks Glycerin Max that are you know big Mega stack shoes designed to play more of a daily training role for people who maybe don't get on with those lower attack shoes and have a lot of Bounce have a lot of protection you know do a good job for that and actually are quite versatile because all the stuff in the mids soole but I think one thing that might count against it there is what I've been talking about that midfoot stability whereas you look at something like the glycerin Max it's very wide pum mag Max is very wide so is the Skyward X because with a high stack they want to give stability as well as well as all that cushioning underfoot and that's not something Nike's gone for so much with the Pegasus premium which is more of the classic kind of Pegasus silhouette certainly interesting shoe one I like I liked running in those first two times I've been looking forward to getting out and again but be interesting to see how it ends up being received elsewhere and how it ends up comparing to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus which feel much more classic daily trainers that will work for lots more Runners the Pegasus premium probably will have slightly more Niche appeal I think in terms of the runners who enjoy it the most and also then there's people who might look at it as a nice crossover lifestyle running shoe [Music] that's our first look at the Nike Pegasus premium let us know what you think in the comments below please like subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Review: Is Nike’s max-stack super-trainer a hit or a miss?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so Pegasus premium is an all new shoe for Nike that's going to sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus this is part of Nike's restructuring of its range of shoes into kind of three main silos which is the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers the Vero line which is a more cushioned comfortable shoes it's going to include the next generation of the Invincible and then the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus premium is coming in to sit at the top of the Pegasus line like I say it's coming out at the end of January next year and it's the most expensive shoe in the Pegasus range at £185 or $210 it's also the highest stack shoe I think I've ever seen from Nike standing 45 mm tall at the hill and 35 at the 4T for a 10 mm drop it's pretty hefty it's 328 G or 11.6 oz in my UK size 9 which is a US size 10 so you've got engineered mesh upper Fair bit of padding around the back of the shoe there and a pretty significant internal heel counter to add some support around there quite a fluffy tongue as well almost like a kind of duvet style material here Nike certainly not made a big effort to reduce weight on the upper it's fair to say then you've got a three layer mid soole which is you know the really interesting part of this shoe you've got top layer that is zoomx foam that's the bouncy peber based foam you see in shoes like the Zoom 6 and the Nike Racing shoes and indeed the Invincible then you have an Air Zoom unit running the length of the shoe now we've seen Air Zoom pods in quite a few Nike shoes like you can see them in the alphafly also been embedded into the midsole of shoes like the Pegasus but never seen a full length unit like this in a running shoe to provide a kind of responsive ride along the length of the shoe and then at the back of the shoe that kind of running to the midfoot you have a bottom layer of react ex foam which is a pretty balanced foam it's fairly durable fairly soft it's nothing special it's not as you know exciting as the foam's above it but is there probably to add a bit more stability and durability to the Pegasus premium then you got a waffle tread outsole which is mostly covered actually is good rubber coverage on the four and heel there you can see the bottom of the Air Zoom pod a little bit of exposed react X foam there but nothing too much and the sho's actually been pretty good for me on grip and durability so [Music] far so it comes to the fit of the Nike Pegasus premium I've got my normal size here which is a uk9 US 10 that's a size I've been using in Nike shoes for many years and all the other Pegasus shoes I've tested and it fits me very well in that size I've got enough room in the toe box good hold around the heel and midfoot it's pretty comfortable shoe with the amount of padding you have at the midfoot and back of the shoe there so yeah no concerns at all about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size and if you've ever used a pegasus shoe I would use that size in the Pegasus [Music] premium onto the run test then and I've run about 50k in the Nike Pegasus premium using it for a mix of daily training mostly pretty relaxed runs fairly long runs and then a easy to steady progression run as well to test it out with some faster Paces it's a pretty interesting shoe it's fair to say like I've tested all of the Pegasus shoes released this year and where the Pegasus plus feels like a pretty natural step up from the standard Pegasus 41 with a pretty similar design all around just with a better foam this feels like something completely different it's very much a shoe that I think is Nike's first attempt to really compete in the max stack daily trainer category you know got things like the Brooks Glycerin Max came out this year the Puma mag Max the hoker skywood X came out I think at the start of this year maybe even the back end of last year these are really big shoes lots of foam underfoot but they're not really designed to be very fast shoes or anything like that they're designed to give you a lot of comfort and a fun bouncy ride for your daily training and the rid is bouncy it's the bouncy as Pegasus I can say that for sure you do get a lot of energy return from the combination of Foams in this midsole I think the Air Zoom unit is the dominant thing that I feel on the run it gives a slightly firmer Edge to it than you get from something just like zoomx foam alone it does give you a lot of response especially under the foref foot that's really notable for me compared to the other Pegasus shoes and I've kind of running them at the same time and that kind of thing you do get a lot more lift and bounce off this forfeit in the Pegasus premium because there is such a high stack there for a Nike shoe you know in general Nike often does these kind 10 mm drop shoes and that means the for foot often sits a bit lower to the ground compared to other brands just because of the way you know a 10 mm drop would work unless you have a very high heel stack which you do have on the Pegasus premium which means you still have a lot of foam under the forefoot of the shoe that does give you a really bouncy feeling you know a very energetic feeling there however all those Foams in the midsole does make this a heavy shoe and you do feel the weight on the run like if you're going to try and run at any kind of speed you're going try and charge up a hill or anything like that it does drag a bit because it is a big shoe and it is a heavy shoe as a result the pxas premium doesn't really feel like a very versatile shoot for me it's one that just makes cruising along at easy Paces you know feel quite fun because it is bouncy and everything like that and you do get an enjoyable ride but it's not one that you then really want to lift the pace in I was doing that easy to steady progression run in today like you can run in it at speed you are getting a lot of bounce back but the tradeoff you know bounce to weight just isn't quite tuned to my preferences anyway like Nike's done this quite a lot in the past actually it often feels to me that they put everything into creating a bounce issue some like the alphafly 2 for example like it was a pretty heavy Super Shoe but put a lot of Bounce in there and the trade-off I think was almost balanced there I think I did enjoy the outfly 2 as a racing shoe but here it just feels like there's a bit too much weight for even all these bouncing materials in the mids cell to make up for so it does work as a cruiser for kind of relaxed daily runs but there's a lot of tech and Foams and stuff going into that to create a shoes through that when there's a lot of those around really and then beyond that I think the bigger problem in the way is probably the instability in the shoe so you've got a really narrow pinch point at the mid foot of the shoe and when you look at these Max stack shoes that are built for daily training things like the Hocus skyex you know the glycerin Max they have really wide bases even something like the super Blast 2 has a much wider base than the Nike Pegasus premium and that's done to create a more stable ride when you've got a really big High stack of foam here so I do feel that this is an unstable shoe you can feel yourself rolling inwards a bit I'm a neutral Runner and you know it's fine for me I didn't have any real problems with it on the run but if you do pronate at all I would be certainly ster clear of this shoe and I was coming back from a twisted ankle during my testing of the shoe and it was one that I just basically didn't want to get back into for a while because lot of cambered Pavements around me like you know lot of broken Pavements and it's the kind of isoe where you can land on the wrong spot and it's going to turn you a bit more than other shoes because it does have that narrow pinch point and it just feels like an odd design choice to me obviously they did did make it a lot wider it would be even heavier and you that's going to be even more of a problem so it's a hard one to do but we got all these Foams in the midsole the weights added up you haven't got that wide base for extra support and even if you are a neutral Runner like if I'm going to go and cruise around in a Max stack shoe for my easy training as a neutral Runner I probably still want the width there the extra base that extra support because you know I don't want to have any kind of instability or twist an ankle or anything like that it just feels like a bit of a worry here especially if you are like me someone who often runs on you just normal Pavements which often aren't pristine and flat you often have to dodge around people and there are like little cers and stuff like that so at the same time I was testing the shoe I was testing the ASX over blast 5 for example which is also a pretty high stack shoe comes in a lot lighter though and it has a wider base and it was a shoe I was able to run in very comfortably as I was coming back from twisted ankle without really worrying about that at all so overall it kind of just ends up falling into a roll I don't quite understand the Pegasus premium it's fair to say like it has got a bouncy ride now at a very simple level it's a pretty fun shoe to run in but then the more you run in it the more kind of these little concerns arise and just means to shoe that I'm not really sure exactly what it would do for me because I don't really want to go and bounce around loads of easy runs in it because it isn't the most stable shoe and it is fairly heavy even for long runs at easy Paces I don't really want to use it for those faster runs because like I said pretty heavy shoe not the most versatile so yeah it was pretty fun to run in but not sure I quite get [Music] it so my verdict on Nike Pegasus premium it's an interesting shoe it was a fun shoe to run in nik's had a lot of fun putting all this Tech into a shoe and it' be interesting to see where this Tech ends up in other shoes in the future but unlike the other two Pegasus shoes in the range which I think are really good Workhorse daily Trainers for those who like traditional ride with that 10 mm drop they do a really good job this feels like a shoe I don't really get like I said in the run test I'm not exactly sure we pick it up like if you have a lot of money you want to buy a pretty interesting shoe a shoe that's quite fun for certain types of runs you can do that job but when you're looking at building an effective running shoe rotation it's not one that I'd really better slip in myself some might find the ride just much more enjoyable me of course like you know it's a fun ride I enjoyed it but some might find it really fun and in which case it's worth spending the money just to have that really energetic feeling under foot and you know bounce through some daily training in a really fun way and you get a pretty cool looking shoe as well this will certainly have some appeal as a crossover shoe bit like the ultra Boost from mes which is shoe you can wear around town enjoy wearing It's a good-looking shoe and then do some running in because you know it is a good running shoe like I enjoyed running in it it's not just one of those shoes it's a lifestyle shoe I we get comments like that all the time but no this is a running shoe and it's a shoe I enjoyed running in but I think it's a shoe that probably needs to add value in some other way to really make it worth picking up and if for you that is you love the look you love using it as a casual shoe as well great you've also got a pretty good running shoe here as well you look at the price of the Pegasus premium though it isn't hard to think of running shoes that I'd recommend getting ahead of it within Nike's range I mean immediately the other two Pegasus shoes like I said I have done some runs wearing the Pegasus premium on one foot and then the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus Plus on the other and they just they feel like you know better running shoes like the Pegasus Plus in particular is lighter got that zumex midso gives you a nice bit of a poppy ride and while those shoes are certainly thinner under the forefoot and feel a bit flat under the forefoot compared to the bounce you get from the Pegasus premium all around they're a bit more enjoyable to run in I think and Pegasus 41 being a good Workhorse Cruiser cushion shoe and the Pegasus plus being you know more versatile shoe all round both a bit more stable as well then Nike also has the zoom fly 6 in its range which is cheaper and one of my favorite shoes of the year you've got a really good combo of materials in there with the zoom X foam there carbon plate in there as well really fun versatile shoe great for Speed workor great for easy runs more stable than the Pegasus premium just a lot more fun to run in and a bit cheaper so that would be a really good alternative if you are looking for you know a proper super trainer and you don't mind training with the plate and then if you are looking around these other Max cushion shoes I think the hoker skyw X and the Brooks Glycerin Max are both kind of better shoes in this category of maxed out shoes with loads of stuff going on in the midell that are just a bit more fun to run in for your daily training like they're both a little bit lighter I think the Hocus SC X is a bit more bouncy bit more fun they're both more stable they both just seem a bit better suited to the type of runs you'd be using them for whereas like I said the Pegasus premium has that instability problem for a shoe with a high stack that like if you're going to have that quite narrow design at the bottom there you want it to be in a shoe that you're going to use for Speed work because you're less concerned about stability I think if you're going going to go and pick up a shoe you're going to use for some fast running and I really wouldn't use the Pegasus premium for that myself just cuz it's weight and overall design doesn't really lend itself to fast running for me some other shoes you can look at as well it's obviously the Astic super Blast 2 which is cheaper than this shoe in the US which is you know wild to me that's a much lighter much more responsive much more versatile shoe all around definitely what I'd pick up ahead of the Pegasus premium as a shoe you'd be using for any kind of run really the Puma mag Max Nitro I'm not a huge fan of myself I didn't really get on with I actually prefer running in the Nike Pegasus premium but you know again that does have a wider design that I think lends itself better to regular training then there's also the Muno NE Vista if you just looking for a really fun and bouncy ride that's got a plate in it it's a lot cheaper though but it's again a lot lighter a lot more fun to run in in general also you know very high stack height similar to the Nike new balance ballos as well now that's a really fun shoe like with a big rocker soft foam loads of Bounce you know it's quite expensive but this is also very expensive and I think that's a more fun shoe to do General daily training runs in as well so I did enjoy some runs in the Pegasus premium I did find it pretty fun and bouncy shoe and a pretty interesting shoe I think there are a few problems here that make it a hard shoe to recommend like I think it is too heavy it's not that versatile and I think that has that narrow pinch point that makes it less well suited for kind of General cruising especially you have any kind of stability concerns I really wouldn't be looking at the shoe but even if don't I'd rather been a shoe with a slightly more stable base myself it's not hard to find those shoes that are also a lot lighter cheaper you know equally energetic and all that kind of things there's just too many good shoes on the market for me to really say this is a standout if you love The look you're going to get a pretty decent running shoe as well if you're going to use it for casual use but overall I'd say the other Pegasus shoes are better buys or indeed the zoomfly 6 though I will be interested to see what happens with all this Tech in the future of Nike

welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex super Blast [Music] 2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are not necessarily directly comparable shoes because the zoomfly has a plate in the midsole whereas the super blast doesn't but they are both super trainers that are designed to do a wide range of runs they're both very popular shoes and people are quite Keen to see this comparison so so here it is the zoom fly is the cheapest shoe it cost £155 or $170 the super Blast 2 is £200 or $200 the zoomfly is a little bit heavier is 266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super blast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size they both have an 8 mm drop and the stack height on the superlast is a little bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel 37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly is 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the 4ot comes to the design with the Nike you got two layer woven mesh upper with a fair amount of padding around the heel significant internal heel counter as well to add some structure at the back of the shoe you got a duel density midsole the top layer is made from Nike zoomx foam there's a carbon plate running the full length of the shoe in between that it's a fairly flexible plate a little bit more so than on their Racing shoes but still a stiffening agent to add to the midside to add a bit more propulsion and then you have Nike's sr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the shoe there which is little bit less lively than the zoomx foam above it but adds a bit more kind of durability and stability to the shoe got a waffle full out sole coverage at the forefoot and heel big cutout in the middle that shows off the carbon plate in the mids soole and then with the super blast you also have a dual density mids soole but most of it is made from asx's FF turbo plus foam their best foam the bounciest foam the most responsive foam used in shoes like the metas speed Paris racing shoe series and then you have some FF blast Plus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe there as well got a pretty simple engineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of padding at the back bit of structure at the back you nothing too much going on with the upper there and then you've got reasonable outsole coverage there on the bottom you these patches of the ahar plus rubber which is pretty good in terms of grip lots of exposed phone but you know the key areas are covered there not any problems with grip with either [Music] shoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in both of these shoes which is a us10 for both of these Brands that's the size I use across the Nike and aex range and I've had no problems with the fit of either both have enough room around the toes good hold around the heer mid foot they're both pretty comfortable uppers all around I would say know four super trainers that can do very fast running as well as easy running they do have very accommodating uppers that make them comfortable to pull on every single day Nikes are probably a little bit more dialed in around the toes you know it's a slightly more cramped fit I'd say than a super blast but not in a way that was unpleasant at all it just gives it maybe a slightly racier feel at times but overall I was very happy with the fit of both shoes yeah great uppers good comfort and I would stick to your normal running shoe [Music] size onto the run test then and I think these are two excellent shoes two of the shoes I've really enjoyed running in this year the superl 2 more or less just picked up where the super blast one left off in being pretty much the standard Setter for plate free super trainers like it's a pretty unique shoe and one that I don't think any other brands really been able to emulate in terms of that very versatile plate free design whereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big upgrade on previous models of the shoe which were heavy clunky not that good and the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's a plated super trainer that can match up to the best in that category including shoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or the H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good competitor for someone like a super blast as well if you don't mind training with the plate so super Blast 2 we had in for testing first did a lot of running when we initially had it in and I actually took it away last week for a trip and just used it for everything you know just walking around all my runs one of those trips where you only have a very small bag on a budget Airline so you have one pair of shoes for everything and it's perfect for that because it is such a versatile shoe it is comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it you know does everything really well it's also quite a nice looking shoe I think in this colorway although some will disagree it's also just amazingly light for its size which really helps you pick up the pace in it so I did like kind of a progression running the shoe while I was away I've done some full sessions in the shoe as well and while it is quite a big shoe something I always noticed because of the way I am quite a high Cadence Runner quite a shuffly runner and a big kind of boatlike design like this sometimes feels a bit big on my foot but if I kind of get over that I can run fast in the shoe without any problems got a lot of response from the foam and you know it does feel good for those fast Paces but really excels I think for kind of cruising around daily runs like progression runs you're moving to kind of steady Paces kind of quick but not fast I guess how I describe those kind of runs where you are moving with a bit of effort but you're not really going for it and long runs in particular just really good shoe for eating up a lot of mileage and just amazingly light for its size like all these super trainers that come out with plates designed very explicitly for fast running things like the Nike and other shoes like that are all heavier than the super loss despite the fact has a higher stack just because that foam is so light and that does really help it be a more versatile shoe the Nike is also a very versatile shoe though and that certainly wasn't the case with previous models of The Zo flight like this is now isue you can go and do fast runs in I've done a couple of hard sessions in it I've gone down the track and done a 10 times one mile session a nasty progression run on the road done a pretty decent steady run again quick but not fast over about 90 minutes where I was running pretty well and you know at the back end of marathon training this was a shoe that I really enjoyed using for all the runs I was doing around that time so pretty good workouts lots of long runs of progression runs and it just felt really good for them like it's an exceptionally comfortable shoe given the speed you have here I would say it starts with the upper which is really nice to slip on and then the underfoot feel is really quite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that you can run very fast in and that's a bit similar to the super blast but I think you have a slightly smaller and more Nimble design with the Nike and although it's know heavier does feel a bit more kind of fast and direct than the super blast because it has a I think a slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker like kind of you know you get pushed off the toes a bit more on the Nike I would say and it just has a slightly smaller design around the heel which has a heel Striker with a high Cadence I do notice if I'm trying to run fast so I tell you like when it comes to you know really allout sessions or trying to hold a fast pace for a long time if you're looking for a stand in racing shoe I think that's where the Nike excels a little bit more than the super blast just because it does have a bit more of a racy feel a faster feel I find it easier to sustain Paces in the Nike than the super blast super blast really for me fits more in the daily trainer mold where you know can do everything and it can go fast but I think it excels more at kind of slightly more relaxed places than the Nike both I would also say are surprisingly stable for such big shoes like they both got pretty wide bases both got designs that you know are not necessarily going to be inherently stable with those big stacks of foam on there but they're welld designed I had no concerns about running in them kind of on any terrain uh and certainly no concerns in terms of pronation or anything like that so I did do a short run wearing both shoes at the same time you actually have a softer feel with the Nike I think it almost feels a little bit more flexible like the superlast is quite renowned for being quite a stiff shoe despite the fact it doesn't have a plate which does help it run fast but I know not everyone loves that for kind of more relaxed Paces like I quite like it for those relaxed Paces that stiffness kind of pushes you through and rolls you on it's not uncomfortable at all but it's surprising actually that even though the Nike has a plate it didn't really feel that much different in terms of stiffness when you comparing these two shoes directly on the run and you get I think a little bit more pop and lift off the toes with the Nike with that plate in there and the way the rocket I think just works a bit better for me rolling me through my foot strike where youve got the quite sharp tapered rocker on the super blast I think that helps a lot in terms of like a big amount of Bounce and if you're a bit more of a loping runner I think you'll probably engage that and enjoy that a bit more than I do but I do think just get yeah a bit more punch off the Nike superlast feels a bit more relaxed it's kind of a strange to both of these shoes actually I would say feel quite similar at a range of Paces like there are some shoes where you really feel that they're a bit more direct and firm and aggressive when you start running quick in them but both of these feel like oh you can run in these at very relax Paces Run them at fast Paces they still feel quite similar which is nice like it's great for a training Sho to be able to do lots of different runs in like that and they always feel quite comfortable and have stability but you can run nice and quick in them as [Music] well so verdict this is a really tough choice I think these are both excellent shoes that do a range of jobs really well they're really versatile shoes they're comfortable I like wearing them both for easy runs and then they do both have Pace you can go and do fast sessions in them and you can even use both as standing Racing shoes especially for longer distances because there is a lot of pace there as well as protection and comfort with all the foam you have Under Foot so when it comes to picking between the two shoes there a few things you could look at to help you on that front I mean one is just simply the price the Nike is cheaper so that's an easy objective win for the Nike and given that both these shoes are quite similar in performance that is quite a big deal you know you could certainly pick up the Nike make a saving and have a really good shoe then the ride field I think you've got a slightly more cruisy feel with the super blast it's a bit better for kind of loping through those easy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a bit more comfortable pulling on for every single day because it doesn't have a plate in there it's got a nice relaxed upper it feels really good at easy paces and you can step up the pace when you want to and the Nike is a bit nimbler bit more punch from the plate if you are looking for more of an explicit fast trainer to add to your rotation I think it does the job a little bit better but it is also very versatile for sure got choice about whether to plate or not to plate like not sure it makes a huge difference in this case myself like certainly there's a nice feeling in running a shoe without a plate and running fast and all that but superlast has got a big old super foam in there it's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a similar way in many ways as having the plate that said I do think it's a bit easier to maintain you know fast Paces over long distances in the Nike so maybe that's a mental thing or maybe that actually is the plate coming into play so if you don't want to use a plate to shoot obviously a super Blaster is an easy winner there so that is something that you know some people want to consider so obviously if you're looking for one shoe to do it all I'd probably get the Nike myself if you're quite keen on racing because I think it's a slightly better racing shoe and it does those easy runs well if you're looking for a shoe to add to rotation just to have with like a carbon plate racing shoe to do to do those really fast workouts in I think the super blast works really well I think that's the Fantastic that's probably the best two shoe rotation out there I think at the moment is to get the super blast for pretty much all your training and then a carbon plate racing shoe for races and the odd really hard session super blast just does that role so well and if you're looking for like a fast trainer to slip in the middle of a rot I think both work pretty much equally well so it's more whether you want the kind of lighter but bigger design of the super blast the slightly punchier kind of plated Nimble design of the zoom fly like again it's really close here so I think I'd really struggle to pick between them I think I'd probably just lean towards the Nike myself I just suits my running style a little bit better just because I have a high Cadence I said I really enjoyed just having the super blast as my only shoe away on a trip it was really nice to put it on every day it's a shoe you can really fall in love with by using over and over again so yeah very hard to call probably the Nike just as it for me especially as it's a little bit cheaper but certainly very case for either shoe both very much stand out of [Music] 2024 that's our comparison of the zoom fly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know what you think in the comments below please like And subscribe ring the little bell we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'ASICS SUPERBLAST 2 (completely unbiased review)':\n\nthe most anticipated shoe of the year is finally here the aex super blast version 2 the original super blast burst onto the scene last year and almost immediately became one of my absolute favorite alltime training shoes and when I'm not out running testing other shoes this was the shoe I'd reach for about 90% of the time clocking it over 3,000 km in a few different versions of version one with two big updates to version two with the out soole and the upper hereit I was really worried that aex might be messing this one up so is this new model going to live up to my very high expectations or am I going to be scaring eBay to try and find some pairs of version one and as always I bought this shoe 100% with my money to give you that completely honest impartial unbiased review right let's get stuck into all of the changes between the version one and version two the price of the Superglass 2 is a little bit more expensive here in the UK now costing £200 most markets around the world it's pretty much the same we have got an updated midsole this big chunk through the middle here which now uses the FF turbo the same as the updated metas speed sky and Edge asex is most premium responsive foam that they offer out there and then we've got a thin layer along the bottom of here of asx's FF blast plus which is what they use for a little bit more durability and also sort of stabilizing the shoe we've got an updated outsole much welcome updated outo this is new aex grip rubber on the bottom here a little bit more grippy here in the wet weather we'll come on to chat about that a little bit later on the review and also you can't get any stones and Pebbles and little hitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe here which I you get all the time on version one when you'd run on sort of more grally areas they filled in all of those holes in slightly different design and pattern on version two and then finally we've got a different updated upper to the shoe here which is now this one piece woven engineered mesh so it's a little bit more stretchy and just has a little bit more movement with the shoe versus version one right let's get stuck into the facts and figures this is is your long distance mileage monster for crushing those long runs out there and it's also one of the very best non-plated racing shoes perfect for like 10K half marathons marathons and also Ultra marathons if they're going to be on the road as well is very much a road shoe although you could do have a little bit of light trail with this great aex grip on the bottom here price-wise this sent me back £200 here in the UK around about €220 $200 around about $320 Australian dollars stack Heights we've got 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm drop overall and it's basically the same weight as the outgoing model for me this is coming at 288 G that's really really quite light for sure of this size this is in my particular size UK 11 A2 here the old version was 290 so basically exactly the same it is a neutral shoe the upper as I've just said is this lovely engineered mesh upper which Asic say is going to improve the air flow through the shoe midso we've got the FF Turbo plus through the middle here and then the FF blast plus Eco along the bottom of the shoe there there is famously no carbon plate in the shoe and the outsole Now features this aex grip which is these yellow sections here and aex also put this on some of their trail shoes as well so it's very tacky very sticky a lce sort of slow density rubber to try and improve on asx's usually quite poor wet weather performance there are no different wits available at launch but it's pretty good here on the witth side there's also this one Flagship color at launch which is asx's Paris colorway personally I absolutely love this let me know what your thoughts are down in the comments asex say that this is to do with Paris called the city of lights and we've got sunset and sunrise colors here and finally this wasn't true to size I actually ordered a size 12 my usual size and a size 11 and 1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version one and I've stuck with that in version two basically i' just say go half a size down from your regular size or go exactly the same size you had in version one if you had that shoe if you could like and share this video and let us know down in the comments your thoughts on the superl 2 that be great and please check out my website benp parks.com we've got training plans the best running hats in the world some technical gear and Casual gear to keep you going through your training right let's get stuck into the likes my first like here is they didn't mess it up come on I get so worried when you have your absolute favorite shoe out there and a manufacturer releases a new one and you're like please don't mess it up please don't make it really heavy bulky use different materials they have used different materials but all the updates in the shoe have worked really well the upper is just a little bit more breathable the key area such as the ankle lock down absolutely fantastic no slipping no blisses no hot spots nice gusseted tongue here just gives the perfect right amount of padding so your foot stays nicely locked down yes I was a bit worried my foot might move around a little bit at the front of the shoe with this woven mesh upper but it just stays perfectly in place so no problems there and also finally thank you to ax for not increasing the weight actually for me brought it down very very so slightly super lightweight shoe it is absolutely amazing how a shoe can be this light and it just feels so much fun to run in my second like with the shoe is this updated midsole foam it's just ever so slightly more Poppy and responsive but really very very similar if you're a fan of version one you're going to love this updated foam in version two It just strikes that perfect balance in a shoe that can just have that sudden turn with speed of course there's plenty of faster dedicated 5K and 10K shoes with plates and things like that there but that's not what this shoe is all about this shoe is perfect for crunching those long distance marathon training runs or marathon races as well if you don't want to be using a carbon plate and really if you don't want to have a carbon plate in your shoe there really is nothing faster out there than the aex super blast version 2 and then finally my third like with the shoe is this updated outsole the super blast was okay in the wet it really wasn't that great but the new aex grip they put on the bottom of the shoe here just means all of that worry has gone away when I have running it in the wet it's just gripped super fantastically and you really can feel the difference even walking around the house the you one it just feels different it's lot more tacky when aex had all their problems with their grip with their wet weather grip in like the Nova Blast 2 and three it really wasn't very good this you don't have to worry about it at all fantastic update aex well done finally got a shoe that you can trust in the wet weather and also you can just take this out on some light Trails as well and it will handle those absolutely fine some fire roads and things like that you'll be good to go here moving on to the dislikes this is really hard to be honest my first dislike isn't really even about the shoe it's just about all the supply issues that you have with the superlast and I don't know why aexs are like this the shoe sells out so quickly pretty much sold out on launch day all around the world maybe it's all just marketing I don't know there's nothing in this shoe that you can't get on all of the other ax shoes the materials are all available but they really seem to limit Supply I can only assume I don't know why that is but this shoe will be selling out very very quickly if you can get a pair you want to get a pair don't dilly dally just go and get that order in and also the shoe was meant to launch on Friday just gone on the aex website here in the UK they didn't even launch because I think they had supply issues themselves and they delayed their launch again I don't know that's just what I suspect even assets can't get it right I got my player from sport shoes got up at 5:30 in the morning to try and secure a pair which I managed to do so very very happy with that got the 11 and a half and 12 come in and now yeah need to send the 12's back cuz I just a bit worried about the sizing but we're all good the second sort of dislike I've got with a shoe yeah it is a little bit on the expensive side it's so hard to be talking about a 200 shoe and saying this is great it is a fantastic shoe but also what you're getting with that 200 L is a super durable shoe as well I'd always get at least 1,000 k out of my version one the updated outsol in the shoe should be even better so it should be getting a little bit more mileage out of this but it does last a long time I can't wait to bring a full whizbang pop review once I've done my thks in the shoe will slot it into a review somewhere down the line and speaking of cost maybe you're better off at going for something like the Nova blast 4 for example £65 less that's a big chunk of cash and really the Nova blast is a superb allaround shoe the super blast it is slightly quicker without a doubt it's just a little bit more responsive less bouncy foam you get here and it is better suited for your long runs just a bit firmer bit lighter and just a bit Smo smoother through the footstrike overall but I'd say stick with the Nova blast if you're just looking for something that you can do all of your runs pretty well and you're not doing too many long runs it's a shoe that's I'd say around about 90% as fast and really will suit the vast majority of people unless you're looking for the absolute Crema creme or if you're very fortunate to have the budget and you want to get both of them then you could use you all your sort of regular daily training in the Nova blast and then use this for your marathon training long runs and maybe even a marathon racing shoe at the weekend moving on the Neo Vista hit the scene a few weeks ago I gave it a rave review it was fantastic £50 cheaper and it really is a bit of a shoe at the moment has a nylon plate in it so slightly different feel very different ride going through the shoe it's bouncier and it's softer and it does soak up those easy Mars a little bit better the super blast picks up the pace a little bit better and it does have a firmer ride both these shoes supremely comfortable I could personally choose this type of upper rather than the booty upper just get a better lock down in this one and with the near Vista it's just a little less stable around the corners where this is absolutely Rock Solid and the super blast will probably last a little bit longer with this better out soole with the shoe there as well so I really think you're getting about the same sort of value yes the super blast is a little bit more expensive but it will last a lot longer I think in my opinion then finally something like the Nike Invincible version 3 around about 20 cheaper here the Invincible is a lot bouncier it's roomier it's heavier it's perfect for those easy recovery runs but again a shoe manufacturers using their Flagship foam without putting that carbon plate in the shoe the super blast is just much smoo through the stride a lot firmer much more Nimble and lightweight and just better at a more wider range of speeds where something like the Invincible it's really is just your sort of steady marathon pace really steady marathon pace and easing recovery run sort of shoe so let's bring this all together what do I think of the superlast well it's a fantastic shoe without a doubt it is definitely going into my rotation I'm going to finish my miles I've got about 300 miles left in my last pair of version one so I'm not going to use this straight away it's not a revolutionary update get subscribed and see if this shoe will be making into my top three shoes of the year which we normally launch around about December time if you are interested in other asset shoes we've got a complete assets comparison guide again completely unsponsored B all the asset shoes with I money check that out that is up here coming up next let me know if you've got any questions down in the comments about the super blast I'll catch up and answer all of those down there keep it working hard guys keep done I'm have to get some more marathon training done we see you very soon in the next one\n\nFrom video 'Asics Novablast 5 Review | Four runners test the latest version of the popular daily running shoe':\n\nhey Tommy from the r testers in this video we are going to be reviewing the aex Nova blast 5 let's take a [Music] look the aex Nova blast 5 cost £ 135 or $140 it weighs 256 G or 9 oz for men in a size 8 and the drop is 8 mm the as6 NOA blast 5 continues the popular daily shoe line with the new FF blast Max Midol foam designed to be softer and bouncier while still retaining the same weight as the Nova blast 4 the shoe features a new jacked mesh upper instead of the previous woven material used in the Nova blast 4 the aim being to improve the fit and ensure a good level of breathability there's a similar trampoline inspired outsole to previous versions to improve comfort and covering that is a healthy layer of rubber for grip and protection it comes the fit of the ASX nose blast 5 as I've had no problems at all with my normal running shoe size got a uk9 here which is a us10 that's the size I've used across asx's range for many years and I've used for every single version of the over blast and yeah no problems at all fits me very well enough room in the toe box good hold around the heeler midfoot nice comfortable heel design that doesn't irritate my achilles and holds the heal in place so yeah no problems at all with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size in testing I ran in my regular running shoe size which is a UK and a half in the ax no blast 5 and I found the fit nice and secure in the heel but very roomy with decent wiggle in the toe box this is an area fit I think in the no blast 4 but there is good hold across the midfoot i' largely a secure heel and unless you like your shoes very snug I'd recommend going true to size I personally like the room that you get up into this kind of for foot in the toe boox it opens up the potential to use this shoe for longer haul mileage Ultras that kind of thing so I really like a spacious toe box so fit for me has been spot on in the Nova blast 5 no issues report in my running time I would say there's very much hallmarked of the previous over blast shoes here I think particularly in the toebox where it's kind of you know roomy without feeling overly generous not too short similar level of padding in the hill collar the kind of you know similar tongue the lacing is all very kind of close to the previous Nova blast shoes I think the biggest takeaway for me is that the the way the upper feels around your feet I think on the NOA blast 5 it definitely is gear to feeling a little bit more snug and a little bit more comfortable and you know compared to the overlast 4 which I think you know sits a little bit closer particularly the middle section of that shoe and I think that's something that I've noticed has it kind of radically changed my experience of the shoe not necessarily but I do think if you are looking for a more comfortable feeling upper and fit and I think that's what the no blast 5 is going to get you my biggest takeaway though is that for me it does feel like a true to size shoe and it has felt like you know going the same size as previous shoes has worked well for me in the Nova blast 5 fit for me in the Nova blast 5 I'm a size8 in the UK this is a size eight uh found you you're very comfortable um it's plenty of width to it um didn't find it in any way restrictive um I've got fairly average width foot so I don't tend to have problems with the width of shoes but there definitely felt a little bit more on the forgiving side uh there's plenty of space in the forefoot um for me it's probably a little bit too much space I like it to be a little bit more restrictive in the forefoot um but for most people it's probably that sort of thumbs width that you want um before the big toe so I would stay to my size in these shoes there's also plenty of padding I like the upper it's quite comfortable quite forgiving there's a bit Flex to it all in all a very comfortable solid shoe that I would stay to my size in now I've run a good 50 km in the ASX Nova blast 5 in testing and I've used them for all kinds of runs from the slowest easiest of recovery miles up to faster pce efforts basically I've tested the full gamut from easy to close to top speed in the shoe I've also been using it a lot alongside the ax super blast two which has been a really interesting comparison to put these two side by side because it's an argument to say can this be a cheaper super blast now I've had a flip-flopping relationship with the ASX NOA blast over the generations as it's moved from soft to firmer I like the Nova blast 4 snappier ride that was slightly more dense underf foot than the softer cushioned NOA blast 3s which felt a bit sluggish to me at times now the changes to the four gave the Nova blast some faster Pace potential I think with the new flight foam blast Max phone you're getting in the Nova blast 5 I think we're back to being slightly softer again though with a touch more bounc and I think that depends really on when you're Landing with the shoe as well now I'm a bit torn with the Nova blast 5 because it offers a nice smooth ride that responds well on toe off and feels springy but controlled when you're feeling good running with good form and pushing the pace I think the no blast 5 feels energetic but it's also cushioned enough to accommodate slower Paces though sometimes on heavier legs I think it can feel a bit soggy I've had slow runs or at least runs where I felt tired where the softness certainly in a sort of slower Pace form makes it feel like the shoe is working against me somewhat and then I've had these runs where I'm full of energy running in good form you know I'm on it really working off the forefoot where the over blast 5 has felt more smooth and energetic and not a million miles off the performance of the super Blast 2 that's kind of cruising Pace particularly now I want to say that it works better when I'm moving at faster Pace but the reality is I think it kind of feeds back better underf foot when you're running well so not just fast but moving with kind of good form and good energy on runs where I've been heavy and sluggish it almost amplifies that kind of heavy and sluggish feel as well now those where I felt light and Lively it kind of gives that back on the foot I think you get a familiar overlast feel overall there's still a lot of shoe though it does run quite light for the heft that you're getting for that big stack that you've got here it's a bit roomier than NOA blast 4 up front but I like that the protection and cushioning is great there's a wide reliable platform to run off and loads of comfort and though I sometimes feel like I have to work harder I think is a very capable cushioned option I can happily long call easy paac and overlast 5 I also plan to Marathon test T it at some point to see if this would make a good reliable race day shoe for people who just want to get round a marathon with guaranteed comfort and just a little bit of energy so in terms of my running time with the NOA blast 5 I've done well over 50k in this shoe and it definitely has been a very easy shoe to take over the running mileage and that's really what the NOA blast is about it's a daily trainer you know a shoe for kind of really getting through that kind of weekly mileage and I definitely would say that this is a shoe that is capable still of doing that I think my biggest question mark definitely from my first run in this shoe is well my experience would be replicated throughout my running time in that first run it was a really bouncy Lively enjoyable shoe something that I saw in the Nova Blast 3 but wasn't really replicated throughout my running time in the no Blast 3 I think the no blast 4 was a very different proposition to the three I really like that shoe I thought it was a very versatile shoe particularly had a more uptempo Edge to it compared to previous Nova blast shoes now with the Nova blast 5 there definitely is a radical change here particularly with that midsole from the nol 4 the 5 it's just a lot and you get a little bit more resistance from the mids overlast 5 I think that really kind of Echoes what I've seen in my running time now after that first run I did a longer run in this shoe and I didn't have that same kind of bouncy Lively feeling from that midso was definitely soft definitely comfortable I definitely felt like I could roll through very nicely in this shoe it's been a shoe it's been a long time since I've had a shoe where I've had such an IND different experience from you know a run to run and that's definitely been what I've seen in the Nova blast 5 what I really wanted to see was how it would handle some kind of faster running TI actually took this to the track I used it with the Nova blast 4 I um had a kind of a longer session I kind of spit the session half was in the Nova blast 5 the second half was in the no blast 4 now these you know the biggest thing to takeway for me is that it could handle some kind of more uptempo time it definitely felt a lot softer under the foot compared to the Nova blast 5 which I kind of like that kind of slightly firmer feel to it where you know it's not overly firmed it does feel a little bit more responsive and that's kind of what I in that track session it felt a little bit more at home you know at that kind of slightly faster Pace would it be something that I use out for all out running absolutely not that's really not what the Nova blast is about but I do feel like maybe it's lost something from that kind of more temper ede that we got in the Nova blast 4 but has it got that same versatility about it compared to the previous you I'm not entirely sure it's maybe kind of moved slightly close to things like the GEL Nimbus I think from a kind of durability point of view I still think it's going to be a very doable shoe I think probably more so than previous shoes there's a lot of rubber here you know it might not be in in the center of the shoe but on the outside the shoe there's a lot of rubber and I'm not seeing a whole lot of wear I said over 50k in this shoe there's no real kind of signs of kind of wear and that's kind of what you'd expect to see from an over blast is it a better shoe than the no blast what I think it's a different shoe and that's kind of been my experience but it is a good shoe and I do think it's another kind of NOA blast that is going to sit well on that kind of daily trainer range is it the best one out there I'll get into that in my verdict so the Nova blast is a really interesting line of shoes it it changes quite a lot with each version of the shoe uh and sometimes I really like it sometimes I'm not a fan of it um I was a pretty big fan of the no blast 4 I think it's a really good versatile shoe I think it's really good for going to those faster sessions uh but also you can do easier stuff in it as well but really the midle in the no blast 4 I just thought was very good at being a little bit more responsive uh and it was a great all around shoe if you're looking to buy one shoe and you want to do training in it you can racing it if you wanted to if you weren't going for like a sub three marathon time or something like that it's a really good solid allr rounder shoe NOA blast 5 um when I first put it on I really like this shoe um I like soft shoes I like bouncy shoes if you know watch the channel you know that I talk about that quite a lot um and this midsole this this new um FF blast Max midsole that you get in it it's definitely softer than the Nova blast 4 when I put them on I really thought wow this is great this is reminded me of the Nova Blast One no blast mod is probably my favorite of the Nova blasts because it just got the right balance between softness and bounce um with this shoe definitely sof in the no blast 4 and the first run I did in it I thought I got a lot of bounce off of it I was really enjoying that run since then I've done another four runs in this shoe and that's varied between faster efforts um couple of easy runs and an interval session um in in it and it's been a bit hit and miss for me this shoe really um I think it really comes down to the fact that I'm it it by making it softer uh it does make it better for easy runs um if you're not really trying to pick up a pace or anything like that um but it's also lost a bit of that faster training as well so the Nova blast 4 really did a good job at that it wasn't the the fastest training shoe out there but it's really good sort of balance if you're looking for a one shoe that fits all sort of running shoe um but the no blast 5 sort of loses that a bit um what I found on some of the runs especially when I was trying to maintain a faster pace uh in it is that it felt a little bit sluggish for me on a couple of the runs not a bad shoe for those for for those sorts of sessions um but it definitely just didn't feel like a shoe that I wanted to pick the pace up in it felt like it was more designed for the easier sessions than picking up the pace um and as a result I've not really enjoyed it as much as I did the Nova blast 4 um just because I think it's not quite it's a difficult shoe to really really work out what the the benefits are um when you pick up the pace in the shoe you do get nice bit of softness in it but it seems to to dull the effect for me a little bit you're not really getting the the pickup that you're getting in the Nova blast 4 uh because that us is a little bit more responsive it's a bit firmer in the midsole but it's still got a big stack of midsole in so it's still relatively um you still got a good level of cushioning in it but with this CU that that move towards a softer foam um it does feel like you you lose a bit of energy um when when you're running in it easy sessions absolutely fine no issues at all you don't really get the Bounce from it but it's a very comfortable shoe so um it's not it's not giving you lots back but it is very comfortable to wear for those sessions faster sessions as I say it really saps your energy a little bit and you don't get loads back um when you really want it so I have enjoyed testing this shoe um I think uh it's a tricky shoe up when it's up against other trainers of a similar style because as an allrounder sort of daily trainer um it's now for me sits more into that cushion daily trainer realm where it's just a little bit more comfortable a little bit softer to tick off the miles in whereas the No 4 was a lot more versatile so you could do a lot more in it um I do think the Mido is um very comfortable uh definitely feels nice on certain types of runs um and overall I would say that it's a solid oround um daily shoe I just I just think that it's it's minimized its um selling points based on how good the four was running at faster pace so I've done around 55 60k in the aex no blast 5 using it for a nice mix of General daily training runs you know one slightly faster run but mostly pretty easy runs progression runs that kind of thing and it's done a really good job I've enjoyed running in it pretty much every time I have I do think it's a really strong option as a daily trainer for me the no blast 5 is kind of the equivalent for aex to shoes like the Nike Pegasus the scky ride the H of Clifton pum velocity Nitro shoes that are designed to appeal to a really broad range of Runners be pretty versatile shoes add a pretty good price and I think it does that job really well all of all those shoes I just mentioned I think the Nova blast 5 is probably the standout one I'd recommend to lots of people as a shoe that's unlikely to offend them in any way and actually probably a shoe that most people will enjoy quite a lot you got a lot of cushioning here you know as much as any real max cushion shoe and it does protect the legs really nicely but it doesn't really give you that big clunky feeling that you get with some very cushion shoes like it feels protective but it still feels quite Nimble lightweight like it's got enough width there to be quite stable I've really noticed how stable the shoe is actually CU it's a shoe I've been using whilst recovering from a twisted ankle a sprained ankle so I've been a bit worried about stability and it has felt you know nice and secure under the foot yeah protective level of foam there but it's got a really smooth ride I think with the redesign heel on the latest version I have noticed that as a heel Striker it just Smooths out the ride a little bit and just means you can tick over really nicely and get all that enjoyable cushioning underfoot without it feeling too big or stodgy on the foot I've mostly been using it for easy mileage like I say I do think that's where it excels like it is a reasonably versatile shoe I did like kind of a steady 10K in it and that kind of thing but I'd prefer personally to be like a lighter shoe or more purpose built fast shoe myself at any kind of fast runs but you know it has a little bit of Versatility there but I don't think you're getting a really responsive ride from this midell like the foam is you know quite well balanced it's not giving you a load of sinking and bounce or you really fiery poppy feeling off the foref foot there you know just feels like a more of a comfort Focus shoe which is how I would use it myself but the ride is certainly quite smooth and you can up the pace in it a little bit it's quite similar to the aex nose blast 4 in that regards and I think where the Pham isn't necessarily giving you a whole load of kind of response but you are getting a nice smooth ride and you know a platform you can push against and run a bit quicker if you like I think the ride is a bit smoother than on the over blast 4 myself just because of that redesign heel like that's probably the main change I've noticed between them I don't don't think it's a huge step up really overall in performance or anything like that but do think you get a slightly smoother feeling from the heel and it does I think disappear on the foot as a result of that so like I say it's got loads of cushioning here as much as Max cushion shoes but it doesn't feel like a big shoe or a block at the end of your foot there it just feels you know quite natural and it does tick over quite nicely what it doesn't do though I think and this is relates to versatility is compete with the you know really impressive kind of lightweight daily trainers that are on the market at the moment things like the New Balance Rebel V4 the Hoka Max 6 maybe this new Addis Adis ZL we haven't tested yet but yeah it's not really built for that those are probably purpose built to be a bit faster and they end up being very good daily Trainers for someone like myself who likes that more lightweight feeling that they have there still quite a lot of cushioning there I do think they're greaters the no blast is more at the very cushion daily trainer end of things I would say but it certainly has more versatility than a lot of the max cushion shoes out there while still providing a lot of protection on the foot as well so my v on the ASX NOA blast 5 is that this feels like another good installment for the Nova blast range it still is for me a very good kind of daily training shoe a shoe that you definitely can spend a lot of time in it's going to feel very comfortable very solid very consistent um is it going to be that you know the same shoes in no Blast for I don't think it is I think if you like the idea of a softer feeling more comfortable feeling Nova blast and that's what you're going to get here if you're looking for That Bouncy livelier kind of more excitable feeling of those early Nova blast shoes I think there's aspects of it but I don't quite feel like it for me it's delivered that um and I feel it's somewhere between the kind of Nova Blast 3 and the Nova blast 4 um and yeah I think it is a good daily training shoe a good shoe for kind of ticking off that mileage is it the my favorite Nova blast shoe I still think I would prefer getting the Nova Blast for if I wanted a shoe that could do a little bit more um so yeah I think you know the Nova blast 5 a different Nova blast I think maybe Nova blast that a lot more people are going to appreciate so I think about the other shoes that I probably put or sit in the same category as the asex Nova blast 5 I think you've got things like the Brooks Max the Haw Max 6 you got the new B reble V4 the cheaper pum ly Nitro 3 you could probably put the N convincible 3 in there as well I think compared to the Gin Max I really like the Mido on the Gin Max I you know I think it's a bouncier feeling to me I prefer the ride in general but is it as versatile as the NOA blast 5 possibly not I think the Max 6 is probably the shoe I probably Veer to which I think you know works at kind of easier more Tempo Paces can work really well for longer runs Maybe isn't as plush as the NOA blast 5 but I think that's a very solid shoe at a slightly similar price the new B Ro 4 definitely feels better at faster Paces is it a better longer run shoe than the Nova blast 5 possibly not the P velocity Nitro 3 is a very versatile shoe again not as plush as the Nova blast 5 but really feels good across a mixture of Paces has a really good outsole as well on that shoe and the night convincible 3 not a shoe that I've absolutely love but it has that kind of bouncy Lively ride made not as stable as the Nova blast 5 can be a good long run shoe and the the zumex midell fs you know very Lively probably a lot more lively than the one for me personally compared to the Nova blast 5 so I do think it sits well with those shoes they are definitely shoes that I've mentioned that I'd probably pick the Nova blast 5 over is it the kind of Stand Out option at that price point and for that similar kind of category of cushion daily trainer um possibly not but I do think it's you know in good company with those other shoes so my verdict I think you probably guessed from what I said in the run test uh I I like the no blast 5 I think it is a solid all round shoe that veers towards the easier sessions the midell fo is much more conducive to easier runs com comfortable daily runs that sort of thing than the faster efforts now uh I don't think it's a shoe that is really particularly well designed for faster sessions Tempo efforts interval sessions things like that it's more like the Nova Blast 3 for me it's a bit of a balance between the Nova Blast 3 and the Nova blast 4 I think it's it's trying to do the Comfort side it's trying to do the softer side but it's also trying to be versatile as well and I don't think it does the versatility that well I think it's it's more of a daily cushion shoe now um problem is that no blast 4 was a very versatile shoe and um you could buy it and do a lot of your training in it with this I think it's now going up against easy day shoes and there are lots of really good easy day shoes out there I think it is a very good easyday shoe but um I don't think it's one of the best out there for the price it's actually still pretty good if you compare it with some some of the other um easy day shoes out there things like the ax gel nimbers maxed stack shoes like the Brooks L Max things like that those are shoes that are firmly designed for comfort and cushioning and they do it very well they probably do it a bit better than this because they're not trying to be really versatile they're trying to do cushioning and comfort really well whereas this is trying to do a bit of both and I don't think it quite gets the um The Versatile faster side of the training but I do think it's a solid comfortable shoe I think most people will be happy with this as their sort of recovery easy run shoe daily shoe K ticking off the miles it's very comfortable to run in I've had no issues in it I just think that the Nova blast 4 just had a little bit more to it and that responsive mid cell phone just meant that you could use it a lot more um than this shoe cuz I'm I'm unlikely to take this shoe out a lot if I'm doing faster sessions intervals tempos things like that so I think the aex no blast 5 is a really good shoe and a standout in its category like I say of those generalist daily trainers that every brand has in their lineup I think this is the one that stands out the most for me it's good value it's comfortable it's got a little bit of versatility it ticks over nicely I think it will suit a lot of Runners really well and it's one that I imagine I'll be recommending to lots of Runners going forward and know if they're looking for just a new Runner looking for a shoe to do everything in or a runner who just wants to add a pretty cushioned but not too heavy shoe to their rotation I think the NOA blast 5 fits the bill really well and does it at a pretty good price I think terms of value you can certainly look at the aex no blast 4 like I slightly prefer the ride of the five myself because of that slightly more smooth feeling I get from the Hillel but even if you are a hill Striker the no blast 4 is a really good shoe one I enjoyed running in I think it's available in sales quite a lot at the moment with the five coming out so I think I'd probably look at that first I don't think the change in foam here has given you a huge new feeling under foot it's still a pretty similar shoe and a really good shoe but nobl 4 is also a really good shoe and does the same kind of job and then comparing it to some of the shoes I've mentioned already I think you've got a couple of higher drop options if you prefer that in a shoe things like the Puma velocity Nitro 3 in particular which is also a fair bit cheaper really good daily trainer it's got a narrower design and you know has that more traditional snap through ride with a higher drop you got a slightly more rocket feeling with the nose Blast for sure but the Nitro 3 is a really good shoe Pegasus 41 is similar I think of those I'd get the pum I think it's better than the Pegasus myself it's just lighter and has a bit more kind of response but the Pegasus is maybe a bit more stable I think no blast 5 would be my pick of those shoes myself because I like the slightly more rocked ride you have here which is probably a bit more similar to something like the sakon ride but I prefer the feeling of the aex no blast 5 to the sakon ride 17 you've got denser feeling foam with the rid a heavier shoe I don't find it as versatile as the no blast and I like the slightly lighter livelier feel I get from the no blast comparing it to that shoe if you want a lower drop shoe with a more of a rocker in this category the hoker Clifton 9 is a really good shoe it's again not the most exciting shoe in the world but it does a really nice job of rolling you through your stride and is reasonably versatile as a daily trainer as well it's quite similar I think to the New Balance 1080 v14 a shoe I did really enjoy testing this year I felt like they performed quite similarly for me and having quite fairly rocked and soft but not overly soft or rocked rid you know nice well balanced ride and both shoes disappeared on the foot quite well while still being really cushioned no blast 5 is a bit cheaper though so I go for that ahead of the New Balance myself I don't think there's I don't really think there's a compelling reason to pay the extra money to get the New Balance 1080 v14 myself and then the aexs lineup you've got a couple of shoes you can compare it to like there is the GEL Nimbus line the GEL Nimbus 26 which is pitched more as the premium cushion shoe but I would always get the nose blast over the Gel Nimbus it's lighter it feels just as cushioned and comfortable to me it's easier to run in at any Pace just it ticks over a bit more smoothly so yeah I prefer it to the gel nimas for sure you know that and the Kano have wider bases they're maybe a bit more stable and protective if you are a newer Runner or heavier Runner than me maybe but no blast 5 I think does a really good job for the same kind of runs it's cheaper lighter bit more fun to run in there is the atic super Blast 2 as well which is a big step up in price and you are getting a step up in performance if you look at the super Blast 2 which is certainly a more versatile shoe a better shoe when you're running fast much livelier ride but you're paying a lot more money for that shoe you know if you're getting one shoe to do everything in the super blast is probably worth paying the extra for but if you're looking to add like you know a fairly lightweight and verstile daily trainer to your lineup and already have maybe a more speed Focus shoe to use with it the no blast 5 is better Val and it's probably the one I'd get there but yeah super blast is a great shoe but maybe a slight different category for me to the NOA blast so overall did really enjoy running the NOA blast 5 I think it's a really solid shoe one that will work for lots of Runners it's not necessarily one that's going to blow you away when you're run in it it's probably not as exciting a ride even as the original Nova blast but it's one that now is very well balanced and will work for lots of Runners verdict then and for me there's still classic Nova blast DNA here though the new softer phone means that you've maybe lost a bit of that very top speed potential that made the over Blast for arguably a better all round that said I still think this is a very competent utility shoe that can eat a lot of training miles even with the extra softness as a versatility here that puts an overlast five into a group of excellent allr rounders that can cope with most of your daily training needs particularly when you're out there feeling strong I think now it's not a million miles off the super Blast 2 in those conditions and for some people it may well suffice as a more affordable alternative to Super Blast 2 what you getting now is a daily trainer that's super comfortable super plush Super controlled nice and roomy that has a mid PAC sweet spot with some potential for cruising a little bit faster but only when you're feeling at it it's not as good as the super last 2 it's not quite packing The Punchy ride but at $140 £ 135 I think it represents pretty good value this is another of those shoes I think you could buy to cover a lot of your marathon

you?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video we're going to be comparing the Nike Pegasus premium to the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus [Music] plus so the Pegasus line now contains three shoes it's part of a restructuring of Nike's training range where they have the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers like these the vomero line which is cushion shoes and the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus pre prium sits at the top of the Pegasus lineup ahead of the Pegasus plus with the Pegasus 41 being the standard entry level model I guess so they come at A Rang of prices like I said a pegasus 41 is the cheapest shoe it's £130 or $140 Pegasus plus is £165 or $180 and the Pegasus premium is £185 or $210 then it comes to the weights the Pegasus 41 is 291 G or 10.3 o Pegasus plus is the lightest shoe in the range at 257 G or 9 oz and heaviest shoe in the range is actually the Pegasus premium which is a beefy 328 G or 11.6 Oz all those weights are in my UK size 9 shoes which is a us10 they've all got a 10 mm drop the kind of classic Nike 10 mm drop across the board when it comes to stack IES the Pegasus premium is the highest stack shoe it's 45 mm at the heel 35 at the 4ot not sure on the exact specs on the other two shoes but they're lower than that I think the Pegasus plus is probably the lowest stack shoe but both it and the Pegasus 41 seem to be just under 40 mm at the heel when it comes to design with the Pegasus 41 you have a react x midsole with Air Zoom pods in there the midsoles very much the key differences between the three shoes they've all got a blend of kind of three materials but like I said with the Pegasus 41 it's react X foam Air Zoom pods engineered mesh upper lots of padding on it and then a waffle tread out soole then as you go up to the Pegasus plus you get an improved midsole foam it's all made from Nike's zoomx foam this is not the softest version of zoomx I've ever tested this is the bouncy foam you see in their best shoes in general but it is a more responsive and lightweight pH then the stuff in the Pegasus 41 then you have a fly it upper and then a rubber out soole again you got that kind of waffle tread pretty good coverage on the shoe as well then stepping up to the Pegasus premium there's a whole lot going on in the midell here you've got three different materials basically a blend of the materials used in the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus you got a top layer of zoomx foam with a layer of react X foam going from the heel to the midfit at the bottom and then in between those you've got a full Air Zoom unit which is a first and Nike shoes is a very responsive material obviously it's quite eye-catching design as well you got engineered mesh uper good amount of padding there and then again waffle outsole good coverage on the bottom of the shoe [Music] there comes to fit of the three shoes got all of them in a uk9 which is a US 10 that's the size I use across Nike range and have done for many years have done in many models of the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus turbo and they all fit me really well got a good hold around the he and midfoot enough room in the toes wouldn't say there's much of a difference in fit across the three shoes they've all got fairly padded uh heel collar on the back there and tongue and a good amount of room the toe so I'd stick to your normal running shoe size and the same size across these three [Music] shoes so Pegasus lineup these are all meant to be responsive daily trainers kind of catering for different price points different styles of running perhaps of different preferences and ride feeli they've all got kind of Fairly classic Nike silhouette with that 10 mm drop fairly narrow design not the most rocked shoes all around and it's really the mix of materials you have in the midsole here and the much higher stack height on the Pegasus premium that creates a slight difference in ride feeli so I've run about 50 to 100K in each of these shoes using them for a mix of daily training I've done some short runs where I've been wearing two of the shoes at the same time to kind of directly compare them and certainly I have thoughts and we'll go into those thoughts now we'll go for the shoes in turn let's start with the the Pegasus 41 which is the classic Nike Pegasus it's you a really good model of the Pegasus I think this is a really good mid-range daily trainer that will suit lots of Runners hasn't got the most exciting ride underfoot the Foams in the midsole are kind of comfortable but they're not very responsive especially under the forefoot there but it will work for lots of Runners it's the most stable of the three Pegasus shoes for sure the widest and the most stable it's not too heavy for such a cushion shoe it does offer pretty good blend of comfort and a bit of Versatility for daily training it's not a shoe that I've Loved going fast in particularly myself but you can do a bit of uptempo stuff and it's certainly going to be a durable shoe you know it's in line very much with lots of mid-range trainers from other brands things like the sakon ride 17 the ASX no blast 5 those kind of shoes it's not going to offend many Runners but it's also not going to give you you know a particularly exciting feeling under foot and you do get more of that if you upgrade to the Pegasus Plus plus simply because of the improved foam in the mid soole here so got quite a similar design all around 10 mm drop fairly similar looking shoe little bit narrower the Pegasus plus and with that better foam in the Mido just makes it a fair bit lighter all around and as a result you get a better shoe in terms of Versatility Pegasus plus is certainly the one of these three shoes I would view as the best for faster running I enjoy doing know a wider range of daily training in it I think it's got the pep for kind of tempo runs interval sessions that kind of thing it's still not a really far shoe it's not like a super trainer like something like Nike Zoom fly which is a plate and just you know a more sprightly design all around but you can pick up in the pace in it it's got a nice natural feel on the foot and certainly of these three shoes is the one I'd be looking at if I was looking for you know a really versatile all round shoe that has a bit of speed there it probably Compares best to lightweight plate free shoes from other brands like the Hoka Max 6 New Balance Rebel V4 that kind of thing to show you can do a lot of different running in because it is still cushioned and comfortable enough four easy runs long runs the kind of stuff you do in the Pegasus it's not quite as wide and as stable as the Pegasus it's not quite as cushy on the I'd say at the heel but it is still very comfortable and I enjoyed going long in the shoe uh without any problems and you've got quite a similar ride to the Pegasus 41 with that 10 mm drop kind of snaps through you know you get a little bit of 4ot discomfort sometimes over long distances because they are quite thin under the 4ot because of that 10 mm drop but still a comfortable shoe and one that I do think is the most verstile of these three the Pegasus 41 to the Pegasus plus is quite a natural progression you've got a similar style of shoe just with kind of better materials in the Pegasus plus which you pay a bit more for but then the Pegasus premium is something quite different to the others like it's got a lot more foam Under Foot you've got a bouncier design for sure this is the bounciest Pegasus for sure you've got a really much more responsive feeling under the for foot cuz you've got much higher stack there so you get more comfort with the Pegasus premium under the 4 foot and a lot more response as well like it does give you a really bouncy ride I was running with this shoe at the same time as the other two you do get you know a lot more lift off that 4 foot but the trade-off is that it's a lot heavier this shoe and that's noticeable as well like I have done some faster running in the Pegasus premium and it just feels more natural to do it in something like the Pegasus plus because it's just a lighter shoe it just feels easier to up the pace in this like when you get into a nice flat stretch of road or even a mile downhill you can really bounce along and cruise along very merrily in the Pegasus plus but the weight certainly holds it back and I don't think it's necessarily uh the most well-rounded daily trainer because it's also I think the least stable of these three shoes and it's not just because it's the highest stack height of them but it's also got the narrowest pinch Point around the midfoot which I think is quite a strange design uh Choice from Nike given that you've got this High stack of Foams does mean it's ever so slightly wobbly underfoot like I'm a neutral Runner and I still found you know I was pronating a little bit in this shoe compared to the others and I think if you are someone who needs a bit of stability I'll definitely avoid the Pegasus premium of these three shoes the Pegasus 41 is certainly the most stable so it's definitely the most interesting ride of the three and it's probably a little bit more modern and different to the other Nike shoes because even though it still has that 10 mm drop it does feel a bit more rocket and you transition a bit more smoothly in the Pegasus premium I'd say and having that thick chunk of foam under foot is very different to other the Nike shoes which like I say often because of the 10 mm drop can be a bit thin under the 4 foot compared to lots of more rocked or lower drop shoes on the market Pegasus premium you know has that extra cush there gives you a nice bouncy feeling there gives you a more protective feeling on long runs but yeah the trade-off is weight and also unfortunately stability I would say so this is a shoe that probably lines up more with Max cushion Cruisers from other brands like the Brooks Glycerin Max uh the hoker Skyward X or the puga Puma mag Max it's not really a super trainer per se like one that you'd use for a bit of everything that's the Nike Zoom fly for sure and in this range it feels like you know you've got natural step up from Pegasus 41 to Pegasus plus and something quite different on top of that which you know will probably really appeal to some Runners but I think we'll have less broad appeal than these two shoes the Pegasus 41 and the pegus plus are a pretty good reliable work or daily trainers pegus premium is something quite [Music] different so it comes to my verdict on the Pegasus range I think the Nike Pegasus plus is the best all around shoe in the Pegasus range these days it's the one I'd be picking up if I was looking to add a shoe to rotation or if I was looking for an all around a shoe to do a bit of everything in like it's it's pretty comfortable it's lightweight it's fast it's nippy it's got a nice you know Snappy ride to it you can do bit of everything in it and it like I said it's quite a natural step up on the Pegasus 41 you trade off a little bit of stability and width and comfort at the back of the shoe but you still have a comfortable shoe here it's still pretty stable and you get a lot more response out of the zoomx mile you get a lighter shoe and just a more accomplished all round shoe so that's the one that I think is the best shoe in this range think if you're a newer Runner or you're just looking for a comfortable and durable shoe for easy runs then the Nike Pegasus 41 is a really good choice as well it's a little bit cheaper than the pegas plus it's a shoe that always pops up in sales as well and it's quite a nice shoe as well in terms of looks so you can use it for walking around as well which is good and yeah it's a good shoe as well it's like it's not as responsive and fast for sure it's not a shoe that I view as particularly first time myself it's a very solid all round shoe and one that will work for lots of Runners so I would say these are both pretty good shoes that could find a spot in most people's rotation and the Pegasus premium is something quite different so I think it's not the shoe I'd recommend buying purely from a running perspective for sure if you love The Look of this shoe and you want a shoe that you can use for lifestyle use and the occasional run it will do the job of that just be a bit wary of that stability if you also just want the bounciest liveliest ride possible out of these three shoes then it is the Pegasus premium it's just the tradeoff there is very much the weight so if you're looking for the most fun shoe I guess to do easy runs that kind of thing then it is the Pegasus premium but if you're looking for a more of a Workhorse trainer to do those easy runs and other runs as well then yeah the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus plus I think you know certainly more Compass running shoes and a fair bit cheaper but this is you know it's a bit different especially for Nike with that extra foam under the under the for foot there you are going to get nice bouncy feeling there it is fun to running yeah just got those concerns about weight stability and indeed price so the other shoes I think are probably more natural fits for most Runners and like I say of the three my favorite is definitely the Pegasus [Music] plus that's our run through of the Nike Pegasus lineup for 2025 let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Early Review: How does it compare to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus?':\n\nhello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and this is our early review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so the Pegasus premium is an all new addition to the Nike range the Pegasus premium will sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus plus which is kind of a lightweight responsive allrounder shoe that has a zoomx midsole and then the Pegasus 41 is the entry level model the classic Pegasus which has a mix of react ex and Air Zoom pods in its midso now if you remember all those phones that's important because the Pegasus premium uses all of them in its Mido which has three layers it's a very high stack shoe it's the most expensive Pegasus shoe it's the heaviest Pegasus shoe and it's the shoe with the highest stack in the range and all around it's very very interesting on paper so excited to get out for a couple of runs in it so far it's set to launch next year at the end of January in the UK it's going to cost 18499 not sure on the US price as yet Nike gives the weight as 320 G which which is kind of an average across the line my UK size 9 which is US size 10 weighed in at 328 G or 11.6 o so you fair bit heavier than the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus because of this big stack heite which is 45 mm at the heel 35 mm at the 4ot so the kind of classic Pegasus 10 mm drop but a higher heel height than we've seen before in the line obviously the main interest in the shoe is definitely much in the midsole but looking at the other parts of the shoe the upper is an engineered mesh you've got a bit of padding around the tongue and heill actually it's quite an interesting almost duvet style tongue I found it's quite soft and and thick but it's quite lightweight as well and you've got fairly substantial heel counter and a lot of padding around the heel of the shoe and the outside you got pretty good rubber coverage aside from long section down the middle of the shoe which is a slight cutout that shows off the Air Zoom pod but at the heel and foref foot of the shoe you've got rubber in Nike's kind of typical waffle outsole pattern in the midsole there are three layers to this so the top layer is Nike zox foam this is the bouncy peber foam that introduced on shoes like the vaporfly and alphafly Racing shoes is now used in the Invincible and the Pegasus plus as it's kind of bouncy lightweight responsive foam then you have a fulllength Air Zoom pod running through the shoe which is the key Innovation I guess with the Pegasus premium Nike's been using this Air Zoom technology in pod form across lots of shoes for several years like you see in the alphafly the hidden within the Pegasus midsole as well the Pegasus 41 that is but now they've been able to form this continuous unit that runs the length of the shoe that gives you that responsive feeling all the way from heel to 4 foot also stabilizes what is quite a high stack of foam underneath that you have some react X foone which is the phone used in the Pegasus 41 and the Infiniti rn4 perhaps to try and stabilize the back of the shoe a bit more and also give a bit more durability it's quite hard wearing Pham react X so Pegasus premium was announced earlier this year very exciting looking sh was very interested to get out and tested it I have tested the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus as well done a couple of runs in the Pegasus premium so let's dive into how I found it first have a quick look at the fit and there's not much to say here it was all good in in my normal running shoe size got uk9 here us10 that's the size I've used across Nike's range ever since I've been testing Nike shoes the same size I have across the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus and yeah got a good amount of room in the forf foot it's quite tapered design but that fits me quite well I've got quite narrow foot I don't think it's an especially narrow shoe though good hold around the heel and midfoot on my run so far so yeah no concerns with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size with the Pegasus [Music] premium so far I've done two hourong runs in the Pegasus premium I've done both of them at fairly easy Paces the odd pickup here and there the first one I did I've got a fairly fresh leg so I was running a bit faster than the second one when it was a full recovery run on very heavy legs and yeah the shoe certainly has a very interesting ride like you do really feel the high stack and the combination of Foams in the mids sole in a way that is quite different to the Pegasus plus and the Pegasus 41 so feels very much like a shoe that is built for cruising and just bouncing you along like it doesn't feel like a super Speedy shoe to me and you can feel the weight if you try and pick up the pace or when I was running uphill even at an easy pace you start to feel the weight of the shoe a little bit but if you are on the flat or on a downhill you can get into a really nice Rhythm hitting that big stack of foam getting a nice amount of spring off and you know just really moving along quite nicely and it feels fairly effortless at times despite the fact you know it is quite a big shoe of the Foams in the Mido the one that I felt the most was definitely that Air Zoom unit which adds a bit of firmness for sure and you stabilizes the rer it doesn't feel like a for a high stack shoe like this doesn't feel like a very soft and Squishy shoe to me like you're hitting that Zoom X which does compress a fair bit then you hit the Air Zoom pod which you know gives you a lot of kind of bounce back and response as we've seen it in other shoes like the alphafly even when you hit the zoomx into the Pod you then get that bounce back and now that's running the full length of the shoe you don't get a really soft feeling at the heel but you do get moved quite smoothly onto the forefoot and get a fair bit of response from that Air Zoom unit you do get a little bit of the noise you kind of expect from Nike shoes a pods in and you know Nike shoes in general can be a bit Slappy it does have that slight feel to it the one thing I noticed with it compared to the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus was that these are all 10 mm shoes as a heel striker sometimes get a bit slap through when I'm running in a 10 mm shoe kind of slapping down on the foref foot you get a little bit less of that at the Pegasus premium because of the high stack of Foams that kind of compressed together it almost feels like a slightly lower drop shoe and you kind of get moved through a bit more smoothly onto that forefoot one thing I definitely noticed with the shoe is it feels quite narrow around the midfoot of the shoe so for a really high stack shoe like this with lot of Brands you'll get quite a wide base on the bottom to make sure that they're stable and hasn't happened with Nike it's got quite a tapered midfoot on both sides and your foot overhangs a little bit on the inside now the Air Zoom unit does do I think quite a lot to help stabilize the shoe but I definitely think if you are someone who uses a stability shoe or in general is a bit worried about it you should probably stay clear of the shoe because there's a lot of foam there and it does roll a little bit inwards like I'm a neutral Runner and didn't really notice it too much on the run but I feel like when I'm looking at the cutaways of me running in the shoe and that kind of thing it does feel like yeah that's quite a narrow midell for such a high stack shoe do think stability might be a little bit of a concern for people in the shoe again because of that high stack and narrow midfoot so of the two runs I did in the yearo like I say one was on quite fresh legs and one was on very heavy legs and I definitely prefer the Pegasus premium when I was a bit fresher it feels like you can engage all those Foams a bit more run a bit more with purpose get a bit more bounce back and when I was on very heavy legs tired legs after a lot of like hard workouts I was using it as a recovery run shoe it just felt you know a bit too much shoe I wasn't turning over so well and as someone has got a high Cadence I'm not the heaviest runner in the world I wasn't really engaging all of those phones that well and I was just kind of plodding along so that might be a bit different if you are someone who puts a bit more force in you're slightly heavier Runner or someone who bounds a bit more you might get a bit more engagement from all those phones at kind of any Pace but yeah that that on that run it a bit more just like a big shoe still fine you know seems to protect the legs pretty well but doesn't feel like a shoe that's built for Flatout recovery like you might expect from a big high stack shoe like this with this weight it feels more in the line of things like I guess the Puma magmax or even the Hocus SC X like big heavy High stack shoes that are built to be quite versatile though still like with lots of stuff in the mid I'll try and help you bounce along and if you're not getting all that bounce which I really wasn't on that kind of recovery run then then it doesn't feel so good but when I was on like I say when I was on kind of a more of a classic daily training run and just moving along a fairly relaxed pace it did feel like I was getting a bit more spring back from the [Music] shoe so very early verdict on the Pegasus premium mostly is that I'm not exactly sure where I stand on the shoe still like it is an interesting shoe it is got a bouncy ride it's got a very interesting combination of Foams but it's a heavy shoe has that slight stability issue I think around the midfoot with that narrow design but it was fun to run in but I'm still not convinced this a kind of shoe I would pick myself for any runs compared to the other Pegasus models which probably suit my running style a little bit better as more lightweight shoes with kind of slight more Snappy design to them but certainly an interesting shoe it definitely has a little bit of the ultra boost vibe to it in that it's a very good looking shoe an interesting looking shoe that you want to wear around a street wear but then you can also run in I'll probably do a comparison of those shoes in time but the ultra boost for a long time was very similarly heavy has now come down a bit in weight but doesn't really have I think the same level of kind of Bounce in it because it doesn't have you know such impressive phones in the midy as you get on the Pegasus premium but again two kind of similar shoes cool shoes can run in them as well so will be of interest to sneaker heads as well as Runners but when this shoe was initi announced there was a little bit oh is this going to be Nikes you know super training you've got that Big Air Zoom pod you've got some zoomx foam in there is this going to you know fill a gap in their lineup but that's not really what I'm getting from the shoe myself like the zoomfly 6 which just recently came out fills that Gap that's an excellent super trainer I put in a lot of miles in that shoe over the last week and a half and I'm really enjoying running it the Pegasus premium doesn't feel like a fast versatile super trainer like that shoe which compares to things like the Hoka ma X2 or the Endorphin speed 4 doesn't really feel like the ax super blast either which is a plateless super trainer with the mega stack as well the Pegasus premium to me definitely feels more in line with shoes like the Puma mag Max the hookus Skyward X maybe even like the Brooks Glycerin Max that are you know big Mega stack shoes designed to play more of a daily training role for people who maybe don't get on with those lower attack shoes and have a lot of Bounce have a lot of protection you know do a good job for that and actually are quite versatile because all the stuff in the mids soole but I think one thing that might count against it there is what I've been talking about that midfoot stability whereas you look at something like the glycerin Max it's very wide pum mag Max is very wide so is the Skyward X because with a high stack they want to give stability as well as well as all that cushioning underfoot and that's not something Nike's gone for so much with the Pegasus premium which is more of the classic kind of Pegasus silhouette certainly interesting shoe one I like I liked running in those first two times I've been looking forward to getting out and again but be interesting to see how it ends up being received elsewhere and how it ends up comparing to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus which feel much more classic daily trainers that will work for lots more Runners the Pegasus premium probably will have slightly more Niche appeal I think in terms of the runners who enjoy it the most and also then there's people who might look at it as a nice crossover lifestyle running shoe [Music] that's our first look at the Nike Pegasus premium let us know what you think in the comments below please like subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Review: Is Nike’s max-stack super-trainer a hit or a miss?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so Pegasus premium is an all new shoe for Nike that's going to sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus this is part of Nike's restructuring of its range of shoes into kind of three main silos which is the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers the Vero line which is a more cushioned comfortable shoes it's going to include the next generation of the Invincible and then the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus premium is coming in to sit at the top of the Pegasus line like I say it's coming out at the end of January next year and it's the most expensive shoe in the Pegasus range at £185 or $210 it's also the highest stack shoe I think I've ever seen from Nike standing 45 mm tall at the hill and 35 at the 4T for a 10 mm drop it's pretty hefty it's 328 G or 11.6 oz in my UK size 9 which is a US size 10 so you've got engineered mesh upper Fair bit of padding around the back of the shoe there and a pretty significant internal heel counter to add some support around there quite a fluffy tongue as well almost like a kind of duvet style material here Nike certainly not made a big effort to reduce weight on the upper it's fair to say then you've got a three layer mid soole which is you know the really interesting part of this shoe you've got top layer that is zoomx foam that's the bouncy peber based foam you see in shoes like the Zoom 6 and the Nike Racing shoes and indeed the Invincible then you have an Air Zoom unit running the length of the shoe now we've seen Air Zoom pods in quite a few Nike shoes like you can see them in the alphafly also been embedded into the midsole of shoes like the Pegasus but never seen a full length unit like this in a running shoe to provide a kind of responsive ride along the length of the shoe and then at the back of the shoe that kind of running to the midfoot you have a bottom layer of react ex foam which is a pretty balanced foam it's fairly durable fairly soft it's nothing special it's not as you know exciting as the foam's above it but is there probably to add a bit more stability and durability to the Pegasus premium then you got a waffle tread outsole which is mostly covered actually is good rubber coverage on the four and heel there you can see the bottom of the Air Zoom pod a little bit of exposed react X foam there but nothing too much and the sho's actually been pretty good for me on grip and durability so [Music] far so it comes to the fit of the Nike Pegasus premium I've got my normal size here which is a uk9 US 10 that's a size I've been using in Nike shoes for many years and all the other Pegasus shoes I've tested and it fits me very well in that size I've got enough room in the toe box good hold around the heel and midfoot it's pretty comfortable shoe with the amount of padding you have at the midfoot and back of the shoe there so yeah no concerns at all about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size and if you've ever used a pegasus shoe I would use that size in the Pegasus [Music] premium onto the run test then and I've run about 50k in the Nike Pegasus premium using it for a mix of daily training mostly pretty relaxed runs fairly long runs and then a easy to steady progression run as well to test it out with some faster Paces it's a pretty interesting shoe it's fair to say like I've tested all of the Pegasus shoes released this year and where the Pegasus plus feels like a pretty natural step up from the standard Pegasus 41 with a pretty similar design all around just with a better foam this feels like something completely different it's very much a shoe that I think is Nike's first attempt to really compete in the max stack daily trainer category you know got things like the Brooks Glycerin Max came out this year the Puma mag Max the hoker skywood X came out I think at the start of this year maybe even the back end of last year these are really big shoes lots of foam underfoot but they're not really designed to be very fast shoes or anything like that they're designed to give you a lot of comfort and a fun bouncy ride for your daily training and the rid is bouncy it's the bouncy as Pegasus I can say that for sure you do get a lot of energy return from the combination of Foams in this midsole I think the Air Zoom unit is the dominant thing that I feel on the run it gives a slightly firmer Edge to it than you get from something just like zoomx foam alone it does give you a lot of response especially under the foref foot that's really notable for me compared to the other Pegasus shoes and I've kind of running them at the same time and that kind of thing you do get a lot more lift and bounce off this forfeit in the Pegasus premium because there is such a high stack there for a Nike shoe you know in general Nike often does these kind 10 mm drop shoes and that means the for foot often sits a bit lower to the ground compared to other brands just because of the way you know a 10 mm drop would work unless you have a very high heel stack which you do have on the Pegasus premium which means you still have a lot of foam under the forefoot of the shoe that does give you a really bouncy feeling you know a very energetic feeling there however all those Foams in the midsole does make this a heavy shoe and you do feel the weight on the run like if you're going to try and run at any kind of speed you're going try and charge up a hill or anything like that it does drag a bit because it is a big shoe and it is a heavy shoe as a result the pxas premium doesn't really feel like a very versatile shoot for me it's one that just makes cruising along at easy Paces you know feel quite fun because it is bouncy and everything like that and you do get an enjoyable ride but it's not one that you then really want to lift the pace in I was doing that easy to steady progression run in today like you can run in it at speed you are getting a lot of bounce back but the tradeoff you know bounce to weight just isn't quite tuned to my preferences anyway like Nike's done this quite a lot in the past actually it often feels to me that they put everything into creating a bounce issue some like the alphafly 2 for example like it was a pretty heavy Super Shoe but put a lot of Bounce in there and the trade-off I think was almost balanced there I think I did enjoy the outfly 2 as a racing shoe but here it just feels like there's a bit too much weight for even all these bouncing materials in the mids cell to make up for so it does work as a cruiser for kind of relaxed daily runs but there's a lot of tech and Foams and stuff going into that to create a shoes through that when there's a lot of those around really and then beyond that I think the bigger problem in the way is probably the instability in the shoe so you've got a really narrow pinch point at the mid foot of the shoe and when you look at these Max stack shoes that are built for daily training things like the Hocus skyex you know the glycerin Max they have really wide bases even something like the super Blast 2 has a much wider base than the Nike Pegasus premium and that's done to create a more stable ride when you've got a really big High stack of foam here so I do feel that this is an unstable shoe you can feel yourself rolling inwards a bit I'm a neutral Runner and you know it's fine for me I didn't have any real problems with it on the run but if you do pronate at all I would be certainly ster clear of this shoe and I was coming back from a twisted ankle during my testing of the shoe and it was one that I just basically didn't want to get back into for a while because lot of cambered Pavements around me like you know lot of broken Pavements and it's the kind of isoe where you can land on the wrong spot and it's going to turn you a bit more than other shoes because it does have that narrow pinch point and it just feels like an odd design choice to me obviously they did did make it a lot wider it would be even heavier and you that's going to be even more of a problem so it's a hard one to do but we got all these Foams in the midsole the weights added up you haven't got that wide base for extra support and even if you are a neutral Runner like if I'm going to go and cruise around in a Max stack shoe for my easy training as a neutral Runner I probably still want the width there the extra base that extra support because you know I don't want to have any kind of instability or twist an ankle or anything like that it just feels like a bit of a worry here especially if you are like me someone who often runs on you just normal Pavements which often aren't pristine and flat you often have to dodge around people and there are like little cers and stuff like that so at the same time I was testing the shoe I was testing the ASX over blast 5 for example which is also a pretty high stack shoe comes in a lot lighter though and it has a wider base and it was a shoe I was able to run in very comfortably as I was coming back from twisted ankle without really worrying about that at all so overall it kind of just ends up falling into a roll I don't quite understand the Pegasus premium it's fair to say like it has got a bouncy ride now at a very simple level it's a pretty fun shoe to run in but then the more you run in it the more kind of these little concerns arise and just means to shoe that I'm not really sure exactly what it would do for me because I don't really want to go and bounce around loads of easy runs in it because it isn't the most stable shoe and it is fairly heavy even for long runs at easy Paces I don't really want to use it for those faster runs because like I said pretty heavy shoe not the most versatile so yeah it was pretty fun to run in but not sure I quite get [Music] it so my verdict on Nike Pegasus premium it's an interesting shoe it was a fun shoe to run in nik's had a lot of fun putting all this Tech into a shoe and it' be interesting to see where this Tech ends up in other shoes in the future but unlike the other two Pegasus shoes in the range which I think are really good Workhorse daily Trainers for those who like traditional ride with that 10 mm drop they do a really good job this feels like a shoe I don't really get like I said in the run test I'm not exactly sure we pick it up like if you have a lot of money you want to buy a pretty interesting shoe a shoe that's quite fun for certain types of runs you can do that job but when you're looking at building an effective running shoe rotation it's not one that I'd really better slip in myself some might find the ride just much more enjoyable me of course like you know it's a fun ride I enjoyed it but some might find it really fun and in which case it's worth spending the money just to have that really energetic feeling under foot and you know bounce through some daily training in a really fun way and you get a pretty cool looking shoe as well this will certainly have some appeal as a crossover shoe bit like the ultra Boost from mes which is shoe you can wear around town enjoy wearing It's a good-looking shoe and then do some running in because you know it is a good running shoe like I enjoyed running in it it's not just one of those shoes it's a lifestyle shoe I we get comments like that all the time but no this is a running shoe and it's a shoe I enjoyed running in but I think it's a shoe that probably needs to add value in some other way to really make it worth picking up and if for you that is you love the look you love using it as a casual shoe as well great you've also got a pretty good running shoe here as well you look at the price of the Pegasus premium though it isn't hard to think of running shoes that I'd recommend getting ahead of it within Nike's range I mean immediately the other two Pegasus shoes like I said I have done some runs wearing the Pegasus premium on one foot and then the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus Plus on the other and they just they feel like you know better running shoes like the Pegasus Plus in particular is lighter got that zumex midso gives you a nice bit of a poppy ride and while those shoes are certainly thinner under the forefoot and feel a bit flat under the forefoot compared to the bounce you get from the Pegasus premium all around they're a bit more enjoyable to run in I think and Pegasus 41 being a good Workhorse Cruiser cushion shoe and the Pegasus plus being you know more versatile shoe all round both a bit more stable as well then Nike also has the zoom fly 6 in its range which is cheaper and one of my favorite shoes of the year you've got a really good combo of materials in there with the zoom X foam there carbon plate in there as well really fun versatile shoe great for Speed workor great for easy runs more stable than the Pegasus premium just a lot more fun to run in and a bit cheaper so that would be a really good alternative if you are looking for you know a proper super trainer and you don't mind training with the plate and then if you are looking around these other Max cushion shoes I think the hoker skyw X and the Brooks Glycerin Max are both kind of better shoes in this category of maxed out shoes with loads of stuff going on in the midell that are just a bit more fun to run in for your daily training like they're both a little bit lighter I think the Hocus SC X is a bit more bouncy bit more fun they're both more stable they both just seem a bit better suited to the type of runs you'd be using them for whereas like I said the Pegasus premium has that instability problem for a shoe with a high stack that like if you're going to have that quite narrow design at the bottom there you want it to be in a shoe that you're going to use for Speed work because you're less concerned about stability I think if you're going going to go and pick up a shoe you're going to use for some fast running and I really wouldn't use the Pegasus premium for that myself just cuz it's weight and overall design doesn't really lend itself to fast running for me some other shoes you can look at as well it's obviously the Astic super Blast 2 which is cheaper than this shoe in the US which is you know wild to me that's a much lighter much more responsive much more versatile shoe all around definitely what I'd pick up ahead of the Pegasus premium as a shoe you'd be using for any kind of run really the Puma mag Max Nitro I'm not a huge fan of myself I didn't really get on with I actually prefer running in the Nike Pegasus premium but you know again that does have a wider design that I think lends itself better to regular training then there's also the Muno NE Vista if you just looking for a really fun and bouncy ride that's got a plate in it it's a lot cheaper though but it's again a lot lighter a lot more fun to run in in general also you know very high stack height similar to the Nike new balance ballos as well now that's a really fun shoe like with a big rocker soft foam loads of Bounce you know it's quite expensive but this is also very expensive and I think that's a more fun shoe to do General daily training runs in as well so I did enjoy some runs in the Pegasus premium I did find it pretty fun and bouncy shoe and a pretty interesting shoe I think there are a few problems here that make it a hard shoe to recommend like I think it is too heavy it's not that versatile and I think that has that narrow pinch point that makes it less well suited for kind of General cruising especially you have any kind of stability concerns I really wouldn't be looking at the shoe but even if don't I'd rather been a shoe with a slightly more stable base myself it's not hard to find those shoes that are also a lot lighter cheaper you know equally energetic and all that kind of things there's just too many good shoes on the market for me to really say this is a standout if you love The look you're going to get a pretty decent running shoe as well if you're going to use it for casual use but overall I'd say the other Pegasus shoes are better buys or indeed the zoomfly 6 though I will be interested to see what happens with all this Tech in the future of Nike

you?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video we're going to be comparing the Nike Pegasus premium to the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus [Music] plus so the Pegasus line now contains three shoes it's part of a restructuring of Nike's training range where they have the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers like these the vomero line which is cushion shoes and the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus pre prium sits at the top of the Pegasus lineup ahead of the Pegasus plus with the Pegasus 41 being the standard entry level model I guess so they come at A Rang of prices like I said a pegasus 41 is the cheapest shoe it's £130 or $140 Pegasus plus is £165 or $180 and the Pegasus premium is £185 or $210 then it comes to the weights the Pegasus 41 is 291 G or 10.3 o Pegasus plus is the lightest shoe in the range at 257 G or 9 oz and heaviest shoe in the range is actually the Pegasus premium which is a beefy 328 G or 11.6 Oz all those weights are in my UK size 9 shoes which is a us10 they've all got a 10 mm drop the kind of classic Nike 10 mm drop across the board when it comes to stack IES the Pegasus premium is the highest stack shoe it's 45 mm at the heel 35 at the 4ot not sure on the exact specs on the other two shoes but they're lower than that I think the Pegasus plus is probably the lowest stack shoe but both it and the Pegasus 41 seem to be just under 40 mm at the heel when it comes to design with the Pegasus 41 you have a react x midsole with Air Zoom pods in there the midsoles very much the key differences between the three shoes they've all got a blend of kind of three materials but like I said with the Pegasus 41 it's react X foam Air Zoom pods engineered mesh upper lots of padding on it and then a waffle tread out soole then as you go up to the Pegasus plus you get an improved midsole foam it's all made from Nike's zoomx foam this is not the softest version of zoomx I've ever tested this is the bouncy foam you see in their best shoes in general but it is a more responsive and lightweight pH then the stuff in the Pegasus 41 then you have a fly it upper and then a rubber out soole again you got that kind of waffle tread pretty good coverage on the shoe as well then stepping up to the Pegasus premium there's a whole lot going on in the midell here you've got three different materials basically a blend of the materials used in the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus you got a top layer of zoomx foam with a layer of react X foam going from the heel to the midfit at the bottom and then in between those you've got a full Air Zoom unit which is a first and Nike shoes is a very responsive material obviously it's quite eye-catching design as well you got engineered mesh uper good amount of padding there and then again waffle outsole good coverage on the bottom of the shoe [Music] there comes to fit of the three shoes got all of them in a uk9 which is a US 10 that's the size I use across Nike range and have done for many years have done in many models of the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus turbo and they all fit me really well got a good hold around the he and midfoot enough room in the toes wouldn't say there's much of a difference in fit across the three shoes they've all got fairly padded uh heel collar on the back there and tongue and a good amount of room the toe so I'd stick to your normal running shoe size and the same size across these three [Music] shoes so Pegasus lineup these are all meant to be responsive daily trainers kind of catering for different price points different styles of running perhaps of different preferences and ride feeli they've all got kind of Fairly classic Nike silhouette with that 10 mm drop fairly narrow design not the most rocked shoes all around and it's really the mix of materials you have in the midsole here and the much higher stack height on the Pegasus premium that creates a slight difference in ride feeli so I've run about 50 to 100K in each of these shoes using them for a mix of daily training I've done some short runs where I've been wearing two of the shoes at the same time to kind of directly compare them and certainly I have thoughts and we'll go into those thoughts now we'll go for the shoes in turn let's start with the the Pegasus 41 which is the classic Nike Pegasus it's you a really good model of the Pegasus I think this is a really good mid-range daily trainer that will suit lots of Runners hasn't got the most exciting ride underfoot the Foams in the midsole are kind of comfortable but they're not very responsive especially under the forefoot there but it will work for lots of Runners it's the most stable of the three Pegasus shoes for sure the widest and the most stable it's not too heavy for such a cushion shoe it does offer pretty good blend of comfort and a bit of Versatility for daily training it's not a shoe that I've Loved going fast in particularly myself but you can do a bit of uptempo stuff and it's certainly going to be a durable shoe you know it's in line very much with lots of mid-range trainers from other brands things like the sakon ride 17 the ASX no blast 5 those kind of shoes it's not going to offend many Runners but it's also not going to give you you know a particularly exciting feeling under foot and you do get more of that if you upgrade to the Pegasus Plus plus simply because of the improved foam in the mid soole here so got quite a similar design all around 10 mm drop fairly similar looking shoe little bit narrower the Pegasus plus and with that better foam in the Mido just makes it a fair bit lighter all around and as a result you get a better shoe in terms of Versatility Pegasus plus is certainly the one of these three shoes I would view as the best for faster running I enjoy doing know a wider range of daily training in it I think it's got the pep for kind of tempo runs interval sessions that kind of thing it's still not a really far shoe it's not like a super trainer like something like Nike Zoom fly which is a plate and just you know a more sprightly design all around but you can pick up in the pace in it it's got a nice natural feel on the foot and certainly of these three shoes is the one I'd be looking at if I was looking for you know a really versatile all round shoe that has a bit of speed there it probably Compares best to lightweight plate free shoes from other brands like the Hoka Max 6 New Balance Rebel V4 that kind of thing to show you can do a lot of different running in because it is still cushioned and comfortable enough four easy runs long runs the kind of stuff you do in the Pegasus it's not quite as wide and as stable as the Pegasus it's not quite as cushy on the I'd say at the heel but it is still very comfortable and I enjoyed going long in the shoe uh without any problems and you've got quite a similar ride to the Pegasus 41 with that 10 mm drop kind of snaps through you know you get a little bit of 4ot discomfort sometimes over long distances because they are quite thin under the 4ot because of that 10 mm drop but still a comfortable shoe and one that I do think is the most verstile of these three the Pegasus 41 to the Pegasus plus is quite a natural progression you've got a similar style of shoe just with kind of better materials in the Pegasus plus which you pay a bit more for but then the Pegasus premium is something quite different to the others like it's got a lot more foam Under Foot you've got a bouncier design for sure this is the bounciest Pegasus for sure you've got a really much more responsive feeling under the for foot cuz you've got much higher stack there so you get more comfort with the Pegasus premium under the 4 foot and a lot more response as well like it does give you a really bouncy ride I was running with this shoe at the same time as the other two you do get you know a lot more lift off that 4 foot but the trade-off is that it's a lot heavier this shoe and that's noticeable as well like I have done some faster running in the Pegasus premium and it just feels more natural to do it in something like the Pegasus plus because it's just a lighter shoe it just feels easier to up the pace in this like when you get into a nice flat stretch of road or even a mile downhill you can really bounce along and cruise along very merrily in the Pegasus plus but the weight certainly holds it back and I don't think it's necessarily uh the most well-rounded daily trainer because it's also I think the least stable of these three shoes and it's not just because it's the highest stack height of them but it's also got the narrowest pinch Point around the midfoot which I think is quite a strange design uh Choice from Nike given that you've got this High stack of Foams does mean it's ever so slightly wobbly underfoot like I'm a neutral Runner and I still found you know I was pronating a little bit in this shoe compared to the others and I think if you are someone who needs a bit of stability I'll definitely avoid the Pegasus premium of these three shoes the Pegasus 41 is certainly the most stable so it's definitely the most interesting ride of the three and it's probably a little bit more modern and different to the other Nike shoes because even though it still has that 10 mm drop it does feel a bit more rocket and you transition a bit more smoothly in the Pegasus premium I'd say and having that thick chunk of foam under foot is very different to other the Nike shoes which like I say often because of the 10 mm drop can be a bit thin under the 4 foot compared to lots of more rocked or lower drop shoes on the market Pegasus premium you know has that extra cush there gives you a nice bouncy feeling there gives you a more protective feeling on long runs but yeah the trade-off is weight and also unfortunately stability I would say so this is a shoe that probably lines up more with Max cushion Cruisers from other brands like the Brooks Glycerin Max uh the hoker Skyward X or the puga Puma mag Max it's not really a super trainer per se like one that you'd use for a bit of everything that's the Nike Zoom fly for sure and in this range it feels like you know you've got natural step up from Pegasus 41 to Pegasus plus and something quite different on top of that which you know will probably really appeal to some Runners but I think we'll have less broad appeal than these two shoes the Pegasus 41 and the pegus plus are a pretty good reliable work or daily trainers pegus premium is something quite [Music] different so it comes to my verdict on the Pegasus range I think the Nike Pegasus plus is the best all around shoe in the Pegasus range these days it's the one I'd be picking up if I was looking to add a shoe to rotation or if I was looking for an all around a shoe to do a bit of everything in like it's it's pretty comfortable it's lightweight it's fast it's nippy it's got a nice you know Snappy ride to it you can do bit of everything in it and it like I said it's quite a natural step up on the Pegasus 41 you trade off a little bit of stability and width and comfort at the back of the shoe but you still have a comfortable shoe here it's still pretty stable and you get a lot more response out of the zoomx mile you get a lighter shoe and just a more accomplished all round shoe so that's the one that I think is the best shoe in this range think if you're a newer Runner or you're just looking for a comfortable and durable shoe for easy runs then the Nike Pegasus 41 is a really good choice as well it's a little bit cheaper than the pegas plus it's a shoe that always pops up in sales as well and it's quite a nice shoe as well in terms of looks so you can use it for walking around as well which is good and yeah it's a good shoe as well it's like it's not as responsive and fast for sure it's not a shoe that I view as particularly first time myself it's a very solid all round shoe and one that will work for lots of Runners so I would say these are both pretty good shoes that could find a spot in most people's rotation and the Pegasus premium is something quite different so I think it's not the shoe I'd recommend buying purely from a running perspective for sure if you love The Look of this shoe and you want a shoe that you can use for lifestyle use and the occasional run it will do the job of that just be a bit wary of that stability if you also just want the bounciest liveliest ride possible out of these three shoes then it is the Pegasus premium it's just the tradeoff there is very much the weight so if you're looking for the most fun shoe I guess to do easy runs that kind of thing then it is the Pegasus premium but if you're looking for a more of a Workhorse trainer to do those easy runs and other runs as well then yeah the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus plus I think you know certainly more Compass running shoes and a fair bit cheaper but this is you know it's a bit different especially for Nike with that extra foam under the under the for foot there you are going to get nice bouncy feeling there it is fun to running yeah just got those concerns about weight stability and indeed price so the other shoes I think are probably more natural fits for most Runners and like I say of the three my favorite is definitely the Pegasus [Music] plus that's our run through of the Nike Pegasus lineup for 2025 let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Early Review: How does it compare to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus?':\n\nhello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and this is our early review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so the Pegasus premium is an all new addition to the Nike range the Pegasus premium will sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus plus which is kind of a lightweight responsive allrounder shoe that has a zoomx midsole and then the Pegasus 41 is the entry level model the classic Pegasus which has a mix of react ex and Air Zoom pods in its midso now if you remember all those phones that's important because the Pegasus premium uses all of them in its Mido which has three layers it's a very high stack shoe it's the most expensive Pegasus shoe it's the heaviest Pegasus shoe and it's the shoe with the highest stack in the range and all around it's very very interesting on paper so excited to get out for a couple of runs in it so far it's set to launch next year at the end of January in the UK it's going to cost 18499 not sure on the US price as yet Nike gives the weight as 320 G which which is kind of an average across the line my UK size 9 which is US size 10 weighed in at 328 G or 11.6 o so you fair bit heavier than the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus because of this big stack heite which is 45 mm at the heel 35 mm at the 4ot so the kind of classic Pegasus 10 mm drop but a higher heel height than we've seen before in the line obviously the main interest in the shoe is definitely much in the midsole but looking at the other parts of the shoe the upper is an engineered mesh you've got a bit of padding around the tongue and heill actually it's quite an interesting almost duvet style tongue I found it's quite soft and and thick but it's quite lightweight as well and you've got fairly substantial heel counter and a lot of padding around the heel of the shoe and the outside you got pretty good rubber coverage aside from long section down the middle of the shoe which is a slight cutout that shows off the Air Zoom pod but at the heel and foref foot of the shoe you've got rubber in Nike's kind of typical waffle outsole pattern in the midsole there are three layers to this so the top layer is Nike zox foam this is the bouncy peber foam that introduced on shoes like the vaporfly and alphafly Racing shoes is now used in the Invincible and the Pegasus plus as it's kind of bouncy lightweight responsive foam then you have a fulllength Air Zoom pod running through the shoe which is the key Innovation I guess with the Pegasus premium Nike's been using this Air Zoom technology in pod form across lots of shoes for several years like you see in the alphafly the hidden within the Pegasus midsole as well the Pegasus 41 that is but now they've been able to form this continuous unit that runs the length of the shoe that gives you that responsive feeling all the way from heel to 4 foot also stabilizes what is quite a high stack of foam underneath that you have some react X foone which is the phone used in the Pegasus 41 and the Infiniti rn4 perhaps to try and stabilize the back of the shoe a bit more and also give a bit more durability it's quite hard wearing Pham react X so Pegasus premium was announced earlier this year very exciting looking sh was very interested to get out and tested it I have tested the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus as well done a couple of runs in the Pegasus premium so let's dive into how I found it first have a quick look at the fit and there's not much to say here it was all good in in my normal running shoe size got uk9 here us10 that's the size I've used across Nike's range ever since I've been testing Nike shoes the same size I have across the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus and yeah got a good amount of room in the forf foot it's quite tapered design but that fits me quite well I've got quite narrow foot I don't think it's an especially narrow shoe though good hold around the heel and midfoot on my run so far so yeah no concerns with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size with the Pegasus [Music] premium so far I've done two hourong runs in the Pegasus premium I've done both of them at fairly easy Paces the odd pickup here and there the first one I did I've got a fairly fresh leg so I was running a bit faster than the second one when it was a full recovery run on very heavy legs and yeah the shoe certainly has a very interesting ride like you do really feel the high stack and the combination of Foams in the mids sole in a way that is quite different to the Pegasus plus and the Pegasus 41 so feels very much like a shoe that is built for cruising and just bouncing you along like it doesn't feel like a super Speedy shoe to me and you can feel the weight if you try and pick up the pace or when I was running uphill even at an easy pace you start to feel the weight of the shoe a little bit but if you are on the flat or on a downhill you can get into a really nice Rhythm hitting that big stack of foam getting a nice amount of spring off and you know just really moving along quite nicely and it feels fairly effortless at times despite the fact you know it is quite a big shoe of the Foams in the Mido the one that I felt the most was definitely that Air Zoom unit which adds a bit of firmness for sure and you stabilizes the rer it doesn't feel like a for a high stack shoe like this doesn't feel like a very soft and Squishy shoe to me like you're hitting that Zoom X which does compress a fair bit then you hit the Air Zoom pod which you know gives you a lot of kind of bounce back and response as we've seen it in other shoes like the alphafly even when you hit the zoomx into the Pod you then get that bounce back and now that's running the full length of the shoe you don't get a really soft feeling at the heel but you do get moved quite smoothly onto the forefoot and get a fair bit of response from that Air Zoom unit you do get a little bit of the noise you kind of expect from Nike shoes a pods in and you know Nike shoes in general can be a bit Slappy it does have that slight feel to it the one thing I noticed with it compared to the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus was that these are all 10 mm shoes as a heel striker sometimes get a bit slap through when I'm running in a 10 mm shoe kind of slapping down on the foref foot you get a little bit less of that at the Pegasus premium because of the high stack of Foams that kind of compressed together it almost feels like a slightly lower drop shoe and you kind of get moved through a bit more smoothly onto that forefoot one thing I definitely noticed with the shoe is it feels quite narrow around the midfoot of the shoe so for a really high stack shoe like this with lot of Brands you'll get quite a wide base on the bottom to make sure that they're stable and hasn't happened with Nike it's got quite a tapered midfoot on both sides and your foot overhangs a little bit on the inside now the Air Zoom unit does do I think quite a lot to help stabilize the shoe but I definitely think if you are someone who uses a stability shoe or in general is a bit worried about it you should probably stay clear of the shoe because there's a lot of foam there and it does roll a little bit inwards like I'm a neutral Runner and didn't really notice it too much on the run but I feel like when I'm looking at the cutaways of me running in the shoe and that kind of thing it does feel like yeah that's quite a narrow midell for such a high stack shoe do think stability might be a little bit of a concern for people in the shoe again because of that high stack and narrow midfoot so of the two runs I did in the yearo like I say one was on quite fresh legs and one was on very heavy legs and I definitely prefer the Pegasus premium when I was a bit fresher it feels like you can engage all those Foams a bit more run a bit more with purpose get a bit more bounce back and when I was on very heavy legs tired legs after a lot of like hard workouts I was using it as a recovery run shoe it just felt you know a bit too much shoe I wasn't turning over so well and as someone has got a high Cadence I'm not the heaviest runner in the world I wasn't really engaging all of those phones that well and I was just kind of plodding along so that might be a bit different if you are someone who puts a bit more force in you're slightly heavier Runner or someone who bounds a bit more you might get a bit more engagement from all those phones at kind of any Pace but yeah that that on that run it a bit more just like a big shoe still fine you know seems to protect the legs pretty well but doesn't feel like a shoe that's built for Flatout recovery like you might expect from a big high stack shoe like this with this weight it feels more in the line of things like I guess the Puma magmax or even the Hocus SC X like big heavy High stack shoes that are built to be quite versatile though still like with lots of stuff in the mid I'll try and help you bounce along and if you're not getting all that bounce which I really wasn't on that kind of recovery run then then it doesn't feel so good but when I was on like I say when I was on kind of a more of a classic daily training run and just moving along a fairly relaxed pace it did feel like I was getting a bit more spring back from the [Music] shoe so very early verdict on the Pegasus premium mostly is that I'm not exactly sure where I stand on the shoe still like it is an interesting shoe it is got a bouncy ride it's got a very interesting combination of Foams but it's a heavy shoe has that slight stability issue I think around the midfoot with that narrow design but it was fun to run in but I'm still not convinced this a kind of shoe I would pick myself for any runs compared to the other Pegasus models which probably suit my running style a little bit better as more lightweight shoes with kind of slight more Snappy design to them but certainly an interesting shoe it definitely has a little bit of the ultra boost vibe to it in that it's a very good looking shoe an interesting looking shoe that you want to wear around a street wear but then you can also run in I'll probably do a comparison of those shoes in time but the ultra boost for a long time was very similarly heavy has now come down a bit in weight but doesn't really have I think the same level of kind of Bounce in it because it doesn't have you know such impressive phones in the midy as you get on the Pegasus premium but again two kind of similar shoes cool shoes can run in them as well so will be of interest to sneaker heads as well as Runners but when this shoe was initi announced there was a little bit oh is this going to be Nikes you know super training you've got that Big Air Zoom pod you've got some zoomx foam in there is this going to you know fill a gap in their lineup but that's not really what I'm getting from the shoe myself like the zoomfly 6 which just recently came out fills that Gap that's an excellent super trainer I put in a lot of miles in that shoe over the last week and a half and I'm really enjoying running it the Pegasus premium doesn't feel like a fast versatile super trainer like that shoe which compares to things like the Hoka ma X2 or the Endorphin speed 4 doesn't really feel like the ax super blast either which is a plateless super trainer with the mega stack as well the Pegasus premium to me definitely feels more in line with shoes like the Puma mag Max the hookus Skyward X maybe even like the Brooks Glycerin Max that are you know big Mega stack shoes designed to play more of a daily training role for people who maybe don't get on with those lower attack shoes and have a lot of Bounce have a lot of protection you know do a good job for that and actually are quite versatile because all the stuff in the mids soole but I think one thing that might count against it there is what I've been talking about that midfoot stability whereas you look at something like the glycerin Max it's very wide pum mag Max is very wide so is the Skyward X because with a high stack they want to give stability as well as well as all that cushioning underfoot and that's not something Nike's gone for so much with the Pegasus premium which is more of the classic kind of Pegasus silhouette certainly interesting shoe one I like I liked running in those first two times I've been looking forward to getting out and again but be interesting to see how it ends up being received elsewhere and how it ends up comparing to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus which feel much more classic daily trainers that will work for lots more Runners the Pegasus premium probably will have slightly more Niche appeal I think in terms of the runners who enjoy it the most and also then there's people who might look at it as a nice crossover lifestyle running shoe [Music] that's our first look at the Nike Pegasus premium let us know what you think in the comments below please like subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Review: Is Nike’s max-stack super-trainer a hit or a miss?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so Pegasus premium is an all new shoe for Nike that's going to sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus this is part of Nike's restructuring of its range of shoes into kind of three main silos which is the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers the Vero line which is a more cushioned comfortable shoes it's going to include the next generation of the Invincible and then the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus premium is coming in to sit at the top of the Pegasus line like I say it's coming out at the end of January next year and it's the most expensive shoe in the Pegasus range at £185 or $210 it's also the highest stack shoe I think I've ever seen from Nike standing 45 mm tall at the hill and 35 at the 4T for a 10 mm drop it's pretty hefty it's 328 G or 11.6 oz in my UK size 9 which is a US size 10 so you've got engineered mesh upper Fair bit of padding around the back of the shoe there and a pretty significant internal heel counter to add some support around there quite a fluffy tongue as well almost like a kind of duvet style material here Nike certainly not made a big effort to reduce weight on the upper it's fair to say then you've got a three layer mid soole which is you know the really interesting part of this shoe you've got top layer that is zoomx foam that's the bouncy peber based foam you see in shoes like the Zoom 6 and the Nike Racing shoes and indeed the Invincible then you have an Air Zoom unit running the length of the shoe now we've seen Air Zoom pods in quite a few Nike shoes like you can see them in the alphafly also been embedded into the midsole of shoes like the Pegasus but never seen a full length unit like this in a running shoe to provide a kind of responsive ride along the length of the shoe and then at the back of the shoe that kind of running to the midfoot you have a bottom layer of react ex foam which is a pretty balanced foam it's fairly durable fairly soft it's nothing special it's not as you know exciting as the foam's above it but is there probably to add a bit more stability and durability to the Pegasus premium then you got a waffle tread outsole which is mostly covered actually is good rubber coverage on the four and heel there you can see the bottom of the Air Zoom pod a little bit of exposed react X foam there but nothing too much and the sho's actually been pretty good for me on grip and durability so [Music] far so it comes to the fit of the Nike Pegasus premium I've got my normal size here which is a uk9 US 10 that's a size I've been using in Nike shoes for many years and all the other Pegasus shoes I've tested and it fits me very well in that size I've got enough room in the toe box good hold around the heel and midfoot it's pretty comfortable shoe with the amount of padding you have at the midfoot and back of the shoe there so yeah no concerns at all about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size and if you've ever used a pegasus shoe I would use that size in the Pegasus [Music] premium onto the run test then and I've run about 50k in the Nike Pegasus premium using it for a mix of daily training mostly pretty relaxed runs fairly long runs and then a easy to steady progression run as well to test it out with some faster Paces it's a pretty interesting shoe it's fair to say like I've tested all of the Pegasus shoes released this year and where the Pegasus plus feels like a pretty natural step up from the standard Pegasus 41 with a pretty similar design all around just with a better foam this feels like something completely different it's very much a shoe that I think is Nike's first attempt to really compete in the max stack daily trainer category you know got things like the Brooks Glycerin Max came out this year the Puma mag Max the hoker skywood X came out I think at the start of this year maybe even the back end of last year these are really big shoes lots of foam underfoot but they're not really designed to be very fast shoes or anything like that they're designed to give you a lot of comfort and a fun bouncy ride for your daily training and the rid is bouncy it's the bouncy as Pegasus I can say that for sure you do get a lot of energy return from the combination of Foams in this midsole I think the Air Zoom unit is the dominant thing that I feel on the run it gives a slightly firmer Edge to it than you get from something just like zoomx foam alone it does give you a lot of response especially under the foref foot that's really notable for me compared to the other Pegasus shoes and I've kind of running them at the same time and that kind of thing you do get a lot more lift and bounce off this forfeit in the Pegasus premium because there is such a high stack there for a Nike shoe you know in general Nike often does these kind 10 mm drop shoes and that means the for foot often sits a bit lower to the ground compared to other brands just because of the way you know a 10 mm drop would work unless you have a very high heel stack which you do have on the Pegasus premium which means you still have a lot of foam under the forefoot of the shoe that does give you a really bouncy feeling you know a very energetic feeling there however all those Foams in the midsole does make this a heavy shoe and you do feel the weight on the run like if you're going to try and run at any kind of speed you're going try and charge up a hill or anything like that it does drag a bit because it is a big shoe and it is a heavy shoe as a result the pxas premium doesn't really feel like a very versatile shoot for me it's one that just makes cruising along at easy Paces you know feel quite fun because it is bouncy and everything like that and you do get an enjoyable ride but it's not one that you then really want to lift the pace in I was doing that easy to steady progression run in today like you can run in it at speed you are getting a lot of bounce back but the tradeoff you know bounce to weight just isn't quite tuned to my preferences anyway like Nike's done this quite a lot in the past actually it often feels to me that they put everything into creating a bounce issue some like the alphafly 2 for example like it was a pretty heavy Super Shoe but put a lot of Bounce in there and the trade-off I think was almost balanced there I think I did enjoy the outfly 2 as a racing shoe but here it just feels like there's a bit too much weight for even all these bouncing materials in the mids cell to make up for so it does work as a cruiser for kind of relaxed daily runs but there's a lot of tech and Foams and stuff going into that to create a shoes through that when there's a lot of those around really and then beyond that I think the bigger problem in the way is probably the instability in the shoe so you've got a really narrow pinch point at the mid foot of the shoe and when you look at these Max stack shoes that are built for daily training things like the Hocus skyex you know the glycerin Max they have really wide bases even something like the super Blast 2 has a much wider base than the Nike Pegasus premium and that's done to create a more stable ride when you've got a really big High stack of foam here so I do feel that this is an unstable shoe you can feel yourself rolling inwards a bit I'm a neutral Runner and you know it's fine for me I didn't have any real problems with it on the run but if you do pronate at all I would be certainly ster clear of this shoe and I was coming back from a twisted ankle during my testing of the shoe and it was one that I just basically didn't want to get back into for a while because lot of cambered Pavements around me like you know lot of broken Pavements and it's the kind of isoe where you can land on the wrong spot and it's going to turn you a bit more than other shoes because it does have that narrow pinch point and it just feels like an odd design choice to me obviously they did did make it a lot wider it would be even heavier and you that's going to be even more of a problem so it's a hard one to do but we got all these Foams in the midsole the weights added up you haven't got that wide base for extra support and even if you are a neutral Runner like if I'm going to go and cruise around in a Max stack shoe for my easy training as a neutral Runner I probably still want the width there the extra base that extra support because you know I don't want to have any kind of instability or twist an ankle or anything like that it just feels like a bit of a worry here especially if you are like me someone who often runs on you just normal Pavements which often aren't pristine and flat you often have to dodge around people and there are like little cers and stuff like that so at the same time I was testing the shoe I was testing the ASX over blast 5 for example which is also a pretty high stack shoe comes in a lot lighter though and it has a wider base and it was a shoe I was able to run in very comfortably as I was coming back from twisted ankle without really worrying about that at all so overall it kind of just ends up falling into a roll I don't quite understand the Pegasus premium it's fair to say like it has got a bouncy ride now at a very simple level it's a pretty fun shoe to run in but then the more you run in it the more kind of these little concerns arise and just means to shoe that I'm not really sure exactly what it would do for me because I don't really want to go and bounce around loads of easy runs in it because it isn't the most stable shoe and it is fairly heavy even for long runs at easy Paces I don't really want to use it for those faster runs because like I said pretty heavy shoe not the most versatile so yeah it was pretty fun to run in but not sure I quite get [Music] it so my verdict on Nike Pegasus premium it's an interesting shoe it was a fun shoe to run in nik's had a lot of fun putting all this Tech into a shoe and it' be interesting to see where this Tech ends up in other shoes in the future but unlike the other two Pegasus shoes in the range which I think are really good Workhorse daily Trainers for those who like traditional ride with that 10 mm drop they do a really good job this feels like a shoe I don't really get like I said in the run test I'm not exactly sure we pick it up like if you have a lot of money you want to buy a pretty interesting shoe a shoe that's quite fun for certain types of runs you can do that job but when you're looking at building an effective running shoe rotation it's not one that I'd really better slip in myself some might find the ride just much more enjoyable me of course like you know it's a fun ride I enjoyed it but some might find it really fun and in which case it's worth spending the money just to have that really energetic feeling under foot and you know bounce through some daily training in a really fun way and you get a pretty cool looking shoe as well this will certainly have some appeal as a crossover shoe bit like the ultra Boost from mes which is shoe you can wear around town enjoy wearing It's a good-looking shoe and then do some running in because you know it is a good running shoe like I enjoyed running in it it's not just one of those shoes it's a lifestyle shoe I we get comments like that all the time but no this is a running shoe and it's a shoe I enjoyed running in but I think it's a shoe that probably needs to add value in some other way to really make it worth picking up and if for you that is you love the look you love using it as a casual shoe as well great you've also got a pretty good running shoe here as well you look at the price of the Pegasus premium though it isn't hard to think of running shoes that I'd recommend getting ahead of it within Nike's range I mean immediately the other two Pegasus shoes like I said I have done some runs wearing the Pegasus premium on one foot and then the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus Plus on the other and they just they feel like you know better running shoes like the Pegasus Plus in particular is lighter got that zumex midso gives you a nice bit of a poppy ride and while those shoes are certainly thinner under the forefoot and feel a bit flat under the forefoot compared to the bounce you get from the Pegasus premium all around they're a bit more enjoyable to run in I think and Pegasus 41 being a good Workhorse Cruiser cushion shoe and the Pegasus plus being you know more versatile shoe all round both a bit more stable as well then Nike also has the zoom fly 6 in its range which is cheaper and one of my favorite shoes of the year you've got a really good combo of materials in there with the zoom X foam there carbon plate in there as well really fun versatile shoe great for Speed workor great for easy runs more stable than the Pegasus premium just a lot more fun to run in and a bit cheaper so that would be a really good alternative if you are looking for you know a proper super trainer and you don't mind training with the plate and then if you are looking around these other Max cushion shoes I think the hoker skyw X and the Brooks Glycerin Max are both kind of better shoes in this category of maxed out shoes with loads of stuff going on in the midell that are just a bit more fun to run in for your daily training like they're both a little bit lighter I think the Hocus SC X is a bit more bouncy bit more fun they're both more stable they both just seem a bit better suited to the type of runs you'd be using them for whereas like I said the Pegasus premium has that instability problem for a shoe with a high stack that like if you're going to have that quite narrow design at the bottom there you want it to be in a shoe that you're going to use for Speed work because you're less concerned about stability I think if you're going going to go and pick up a shoe you're going to use for some fast running and I really wouldn't use the Pegasus premium for that myself just cuz it's weight and overall design doesn't really lend itself to fast running for me some other shoes you can look at as well it's obviously the Astic super Blast 2 which is cheaper than this shoe in the US which is you know wild to me that's a much lighter much more responsive much more versatile shoe all around definitely what I'd pick up ahead of the Pegasus premium as a shoe you'd be using for any kind of run really the Puma mag Max Nitro I'm not a huge fan of myself I didn't really get on with I actually prefer running in the Nike Pegasus premium but you know again that does have a wider design that I think lends itself better to regular training then there's also the Muno NE Vista if you just looking for a really fun and bouncy ride that's got a plate in it it's a lot cheaper though but it's again a lot lighter a lot more fun to run in in general also you know very high stack height similar to the Nike new balance ballos as well now that's a really fun shoe like with a big rocker soft foam loads of Bounce you know it's quite expensive but this is also very expensive and I think that's a more fun shoe to do General daily training runs in as well so I did enjoy some runs in the Pegasus premium I did find it pretty fun and bouncy shoe and a pretty interesting shoe I think there are a few problems here that make it a hard shoe to recommend like I think it is too heavy it's not that versatile and I think that has that narrow pinch point that makes it less well suited for kind of General cruising especially you have any kind of stability concerns I really wouldn't be looking at the shoe but even if don't I'd rather been a shoe with a slightly more stable base myself it's not hard to find those shoes that are also a lot lighter cheaper you know equally energetic and all that kind of things there's just too many good shoes on the market for me to really say this is a standout if you love The look you're going to get a pretty decent running shoe as well if you're going to use it for casual use but overall I'd say the other Pegasus shoes are better buys or indeed the zoomfly 6 though I will be interested to see what happens with all this Tech in the future of Nike

Pegasus Plus: Which Pegasus is best for you?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video we're going to be comparing the Nike Pegasus premium to the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus [Music] plus so the Pegasus line now contains three shoes it's part of a restructuring of Nike's training range where they have the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers like these the vomero line which is cushion shoes and the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus pre prium sits at the top of the Pegasus lineup ahead of the Pegasus plus with the Pegasus 41 being the standard entry level model I guess so they come at A Rang of prices like I said a pegasus 41 is the cheapest shoe it's £130 or $140 Pegasus plus is £165 or $180 and the Pegasus premium is £185 or $210 then it comes to the weights the Pegasus 41 is 291 G or 10.3 o Pegasus plus is the lightest shoe in the range at 257 G or 9 oz and heaviest shoe in the range is actually the Pegasus premium which is a beefy 328 G or 11.6 Oz all those weights are in my UK size 9 shoes which is a us10 they've all got a 10 mm drop the kind of classic Nike 10 mm drop across the board when it comes to stack IES the Pegasus premium is the highest stack shoe it's 45 mm at the heel 35 at the 4ot not sure on the exact specs on the other two shoes but they're lower than that I think the Pegasus plus is probably the lowest stack shoe but both it and the Pegasus 41 seem to be just under 40 mm at the heel when it comes to design with the Pegasus 41 you have a react x midsole with Air Zoom pods in there the midsoles very much the key differences between the three shoes they've all got a blend of kind of three materials but like I said with the Pegasus 41 it's react X foam Air Zoom pods engineered mesh upper lots of padding on it and then a waffle tread out soole then as you go up to the Pegasus plus you get an improved midsole foam it's all made from Nike's zoomx foam this is not the softest version of zoomx I've ever tested this is the bouncy foam you see in their best shoes in general but it is a more responsive and lightweight pH then the stuff in the Pegasus 41 then you have a fly it upper and then a rubber out soole again you got that kind of waffle tread pretty good coverage on the shoe as well then stepping up to the Pegasus premium there's a whole lot going on in the midell here you've got three different materials basically a blend of the materials used in the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus you got a top layer of zoomx foam with a layer of react X foam going from the heel to the midfit at the bottom and then in between those you've got a full Air Zoom unit which is a first and Nike shoes is a very responsive material obviously it's quite eye-catching design as well you got engineered mesh uper good amount of padding there and then again waffle outsole good coverage on the bottom of the shoe [Music] there comes to fit of the three shoes got all of them in a uk9 which is a US 10 that's the size I use across Nike range and have done for many years have done in many models of the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus turbo and they all fit me really well got a good hold around the he and midfoot enough room in the toes wouldn't say there's much of a difference in fit across the three shoes they've all got fairly padded uh heel collar on the back there and tongue and a good amount of room the toe so I'd stick to your normal running shoe size and the same size across these three [Music] shoes so Pegasus lineup these are all meant to be responsive daily trainers kind of catering for different price points different styles of running perhaps of different preferences and ride feeli they've all got kind of Fairly classic Nike silhouette with that 10 mm drop fairly narrow design not the most rocked shoes all around and it's really the mix of materials you have in the midsole here and the much higher stack height on the Pegasus premium that creates a slight difference in ride feeli so I've run about 50 to 100K in each of these shoes using them for a mix of daily training I've done some short runs where I've been wearing two of the shoes at the same time to kind of directly compare them and certainly I have thoughts and we'll go into those thoughts now we'll go for the shoes in turn let's start with the the Pegasus 41 which is the classic Nike Pegasus it's you a really good model of the Pegasus I think this is a really good mid-range daily trainer that will suit lots of Runners hasn't got the most exciting ride underfoot the Foams in the midsole are kind of comfortable but they're not very responsive especially under the forefoot there but it will work for lots of Runners it's the most stable of the three Pegasus shoes for sure the widest and the most stable it's not too heavy for such a cushion shoe it does offer pretty good blend of comfort and a bit of Versatility for daily training it's not a shoe that I've Loved going fast in particularly myself but you can do a bit of uptempo stuff and it's certainly going to be a durable shoe you know it's in line very much with lots of mid-range trainers from other brands things like the sakon ride 17 the ASX no blast 5 those kind of shoes it's not going to offend many Runners but it's also not going to give you you know a particularly exciting feeling under foot and you do get more of that if you upgrade to the Pegasus Plus plus simply because of the improved foam in the mid soole here so got quite a similar design all around 10 mm drop fairly similar looking shoe little bit narrower the Pegasus plus and with that better foam in the Mido just makes it a fair bit lighter all around and as a result you get a better shoe in terms of Versatility Pegasus plus is certainly the one of these three shoes I would view as the best for faster running I enjoy doing know a wider range of daily training in it I think it's got the pep for kind of tempo runs interval sessions that kind of thing it's still not a really far shoe it's not like a super trainer like something like Nike Zoom fly which is a plate and just you know a more sprightly design all around but you can pick up in the pace in it it's got a nice natural feel on the foot and certainly of these three shoes is the one I'd be looking at if I was looking for you know a really versatile all round shoe that has a bit of speed there it probably Compares best to lightweight plate free shoes from other brands like the Hoka Max 6 New Balance Rebel V4 that kind of thing to show you can do a lot of different running in because it is still cushioned and comfortable enough four easy runs long runs the kind of stuff you do in the Pegasus it's not quite as wide and as stable as the Pegasus it's not quite as cushy on the I'd say at the heel but it is still very comfortable and I enjoyed going long in the shoe uh without any problems and you've got quite a similar ride to the Pegasus 41 with that 10 mm drop kind of snaps through you know you get a little bit of 4ot discomfort sometimes over long distances because they are quite thin under the 4ot because of that 10 mm drop but still a comfortable shoe and one that I do think is the most verstile of these three the Pegasus 41 to the Pegasus plus is quite a natural progression you've got a similar style of shoe just with kind of better materials in the Pegasus plus which you pay a bit more for but then the Pegasus premium is something quite different to the others like it's got a lot more foam Under Foot you've got a bouncier design for sure this is the bounciest Pegasus for sure you've got a really much more responsive feeling under the for foot cuz you've got much higher stack there so you get more comfort with the Pegasus premium under the 4 foot and a lot more response as well like it does give you a really bouncy ride I was running with this shoe at the same time as the other two you do get you know a lot more lift off that 4 foot but the trade-off is that it's a lot heavier this shoe and that's noticeable as well like I have done some faster running in the Pegasus premium and it just feels more natural to do it in something like the Pegasus plus because it's just a lighter shoe it just feels easier to up the pace in this like when you get into a nice flat stretch of road or even a mile downhill you can really bounce along and cruise along very merrily in the Pegasus plus but the weight certainly holds it back and I don't think it's necessarily uh the most well-rounded daily trainer because it's also I think the least stable of these three shoes and it's not just because it's the highest stack height of them but it's also got the narrowest pinch Point around the midfoot which I think is quite a strange design uh Choice from Nike given that you've got this High stack of Foams does mean it's ever so slightly wobbly underfoot like I'm a neutral Runner and I still found you know I was pronating a little bit in this shoe compared to the others and I think if you are someone who needs a bit of stability I'll definitely avoid the Pegasus premium of these three shoes the Pegasus 41 is certainly the most stable so it's definitely the most interesting ride of the three and it's probably a little bit more modern and different to the other Nike shoes because even though it still has that 10 mm drop it does feel a bit more rocket and you transition a bit more smoothly in the Pegasus premium I'd say and having that thick chunk of foam under foot is very different to other the Nike shoes which like I say often because of the 10 mm drop can be a bit thin under the 4 foot compared to lots of more rocked or lower drop shoes on the market Pegasus premium you know has that extra cush there gives you a nice bouncy feeling there gives you a more protective feeling on long runs but yeah the trade-off is weight and also unfortunately stability I would say so this is a shoe that probably lines up more with Max cushion Cruisers from other brands like the Brooks Glycerin Max uh the hoker Skyward X or the puga Puma mag Max it's not really a super trainer per se like one that you'd use for a bit of everything that's the Nike Zoom fly for sure and in this range it feels like you know you've got natural step up from Pegasus 41 to Pegasus plus and something quite different on top of that which you know will probably really appeal to some Runners but I think we'll have less broad appeal than these two shoes the Pegasus 41 and the pegus plus are a pretty good reliable work or daily trainers pegus premium is something quite [Music] different so it comes to my verdict on the Pegasus range I think the Nike Pegasus plus is the best all around shoe in the Pegasus range these days it's the one I'd be picking up if I was looking to add a shoe to rotation or if I was looking for an all around a shoe to do a bit of everything in like it's it's pretty comfortable it's lightweight it's fast it's nippy it's got a nice you know Snappy ride to it you can do bit of everything in it and it like I said it's quite a natural step up on the Pegasus 41 you trade off a little bit of stability and width and comfort at the back of the shoe but you still have a comfortable shoe here it's still pretty stable and you get a lot more response out of the zoomx mile you get a lighter shoe and just a more accomplished all round shoe so that's the one that I think is the best shoe in this range think if you're a newer Runner or you're just looking for a comfortable and durable shoe for easy runs then the Nike Pegasus 41 is a really good choice as well it's a little bit cheaper than the pegas plus it's a shoe that always pops up in sales as well and it's quite a nice shoe as well in terms of looks so you can use it for walking around as well which is good and yeah it's a good shoe as well it's like it's not as responsive and fast for sure it's not a shoe that I view as particularly first time myself it's a very solid all round shoe and one that will work for lots of Runners so I would say these are both pretty good shoes that could find a spot in most people's rotation and the Pegasus premium is something quite different so I think it's not the shoe I'd recommend buying purely from a running perspective for sure if you love The Look of this shoe and you want a shoe that you can use for lifestyle use and the occasional run it will do the job of that just be a bit wary of that stability if you also just want the bounciest liveliest ride possible out of these three shoes then it is the Pegasus premium it's just the tradeoff there is very much the weight so if you're looking for the most fun shoe I guess to do easy runs that kind of thing then it is the Pegasus premium but if you're looking for a more of a Workhorse trainer to do those easy runs and other runs as well then yeah the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus plus I think you know certainly more Compass running shoes and a fair bit cheaper but this is you know it's a bit different especially for Nike with that extra foam under the under the for foot there you are going to get nice bouncy feeling there it is fun to running yeah just got those concerns about weight stability and indeed price so the other shoes I think are probably more natural fits for most Runners and like I say of the three my favorite is definitely the Pegasus [Music] plus that's our run through of the Nike Pegasus lineup for 2025 let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Early Review: How does it compare to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus?':\n\nhello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and this is our early review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so the Pegasus premium is an all new addition to the Nike range the Pegasus premium will sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus plus which is kind of a lightweight responsive allrounder shoe that has a zoomx midsole and then the Pegasus 41 is the entry level model the classic Pegasus which has a mix of react ex and Air Zoom pods in its midso now if you remember all those phones that's important because the Pegasus premium uses all of them in its Mido which has three layers it's a very high stack shoe it's the most expensive Pegasus shoe it's the heaviest Pegasus shoe and it's the shoe with the highest stack in the range and all around it's very very interesting on paper so excited to get out for a couple of runs in it so far it's set to launch next year at the end of January in the UK it's going to cost 18499 not sure on the US price as yet Nike gives the weight as 320 G which which is kind of an average across the line my UK size 9 which is US size 10 weighed in at 328 G or 11.6 o so you fair bit heavier than the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus because of this big stack heite which is 45 mm at the heel 35 mm at the 4ot so the kind of classic Pegasus 10 mm drop but a higher heel height than we've seen before in the line obviously the main interest in the shoe is definitely much in the midsole but looking at the other parts of the shoe the upper is an engineered mesh you've got a bit of padding around the tongue and heill actually it's quite an interesting almost duvet style tongue I found it's quite soft and and thick but it's quite lightweight as well and you've got fairly substantial heel counter and a lot of padding around the heel of the shoe and the outside you got pretty good rubber coverage aside from long section down the middle of the shoe which is a slight cutout that shows off the Air Zoom pod but at the heel and foref foot of the shoe you've got rubber in Nike's kind of typical waffle outsole pattern in the midsole there are three layers to this so the top layer is Nike zox foam this is the bouncy peber foam that introduced on shoes like the vaporfly and alphafly Racing shoes is now used in the Invincible and the Pegasus plus as it's kind of bouncy lightweight responsive foam then you have a fulllength Air Zoom pod running through the shoe which is the key Innovation I guess with the Pegasus premium Nike's been using this Air Zoom technology in pod form across lots of shoes for several years like you see in the alphafly the hidden within the Pegasus midsole as well the Pegasus 41 that is but now they've been able to form this continuous unit that runs the length of the shoe that gives you that responsive feeling all the way from heel to 4 foot also stabilizes what is quite a high stack of foam underneath that you have some react X foone which is the phone used in the Pegasus 41 and the Infiniti rn4 perhaps to try and stabilize the back of the shoe a bit more and also give a bit more durability it's quite hard wearing Pham react X so Pegasus premium was announced earlier this year very exciting looking sh was very interested to get out and tested it I have tested the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus as well done a couple of runs in the Pegasus premium so let's dive into how I found it first have a quick look at the fit and there's not much to say here it was all good in in my normal running shoe size got uk9 here us10 that's the size I've used across Nike's range ever since I've been testing Nike shoes the same size I have across the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus and yeah got a good amount of room in the forf foot it's quite tapered design but that fits me quite well I've got quite narrow foot I don't think it's an especially narrow shoe though good hold around the heel and midfoot on my run so far so yeah no concerns with the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size with the Pegasus [Music] premium so far I've done two hourong runs in the Pegasus premium I've done both of them at fairly easy Paces the odd pickup here and there the first one I did I've got a fairly fresh leg so I was running a bit faster than the second one when it was a full recovery run on very heavy legs and yeah the shoe certainly has a very interesting ride like you do really feel the high stack and the combination of Foams in the mids sole in a way that is quite different to the Pegasus plus and the Pegasus 41 so feels very much like a shoe that is built for cruising and just bouncing you along like it doesn't feel like a super Speedy shoe to me and you can feel the weight if you try and pick up the pace or when I was running uphill even at an easy pace you start to feel the weight of the shoe a little bit but if you are on the flat or on a downhill you can get into a really nice Rhythm hitting that big stack of foam getting a nice amount of spring off and you know just really moving along quite nicely and it feels fairly effortless at times despite the fact you know it is quite a big shoe of the Foams in the Mido the one that I felt the most was definitely that Air Zoom unit which adds a bit of firmness for sure and you stabilizes the rer it doesn't feel like a for a high stack shoe like this doesn't feel like a very soft and Squishy shoe to me like you're hitting that Zoom X which does compress a fair bit then you hit the Air Zoom pod which you know gives you a lot of kind of bounce back and response as we've seen it in other shoes like the alphafly even when you hit the zoomx into the Pod you then get that bounce back and now that's running the full length of the shoe you don't get a really soft feeling at the heel but you do get moved quite smoothly onto the forefoot and get a fair bit of response from that Air Zoom unit you do get a little bit of the noise you kind of expect from Nike shoes a pods in and you know Nike shoes in general can be a bit Slappy it does have that slight feel to it the one thing I noticed with it compared to the Pegasus and the Pegasus plus was that these are all 10 mm shoes as a heel striker sometimes get a bit slap through when I'm running in a 10 mm shoe kind of slapping down on the foref foot you get a little bit less of that at the Pegasus premium because of the high stack of Foams that kind of compressed together it almost feels like a slightly lower drop shoe and you kind of get moved through a bit more smoothly onto that forefoot one thing I definitely noticed with the shoe is it feels quite narrow around the midfoot of the shoe so for a really high stack shoe like this with lot of Brands you'll get quite a wide base on the bottom to make sure that they're stable and hasn't happened with Nike it's got quite a tapered midfoot on both sides and your foot overhangs a little bit on the inside now the Air Zoom unit does do I think quite a lot to help stabilize the shoe but I definitely think if you are someone who uses a stability shoe or in general is a bit worried about it you should probably stay clear of the shoe because there's a lot of foam there and it does roll a little bit inwards like I'm a neutral Runner and didn't really notice it too much on the run but I feel like when I'm looking at the cutaways of me running in the shoe and that kind of thing it does feel like yeah that's quite a narrow midell for such a high stack shoe do think stability might be a little bit of a concern for people in the shoe again because of that high stack and narrow midfoot so of the two runs I did in the yearo like I say one was on quite fresh legs and one was on very heavy legs and I definitely prefer the Pegasus premium when I was a bit fresher it feels like you can engage all those Foams a bit more run a bit more with purpose get a bit more bounce back and when I was on very heavy legs tired legs after a lot of like hard workouts I was using it as a recovery run shoe it just felt you know a bit too much shoe I wasn't turning over so well and as someone has got a high Cadence I'm not the heaviest runner in the world I wasn't really engaging all of those phones that well and I was just kind of plodding along so that might be a bit different if you are someone who puts a bit more force in you're slightly heavier Runner or someone who bounds a bit more you might get a bit more engagement from all those phones at kind of any Pace but yeah that that on that run it a bit more just like a big shoe still fine you know seems to protect the legs pretty well but doesn't feel like a shoe that's built for Flatout recovery like you might expect from a big high stack shoe like this with this weight it feels more in the line of things like I guess the Puma magmax or even the Hocus SC X like big heavy High stack shoes that are built to be quite versatile though still like with lots of stuff in the mid I'll try and help you bounce along and if you're not getting all that bounce which I really wasn't on that kind of recovery run then then it doesn't feel so good but when I was on like I say when I was on kind of a more of a classic daily training run and just moving along a fairly relaxed pace it did feel like I was getting a bit more spring back from the [Music] shoe so very early verdict on the Pegasus premium mostly is that I'm not exactly sure where I stand on the shoe still like it is an interesting shoe it is got a bouncy ride it's got a very interesting combination of Foams but it's a heavy shoe has that slight stability issue I think around the midfoot with that narrow design but it was fun to run in but I'm still not convinced this a kind of shoe I would pick myself for any runs compared to the other Pegasus models which probably suit my running style a little bit better as more lightweight shoes with kind of slight more Snappy design to them but certainly an interesting shoe it definitely has a little bit of the ultra boost vibe to it in that it's a very good looking shoe an interesting looking shoe that you want to wear around a street wear but then you can also run in I'll probably do a comparison of those shoes in time but the ultra boost for a long time was very similarly heavy has now come down a bit in weight but doesn't really have I think the same level of kind of Bounce in it because it doesn't have you know such impressive phones in the midy as you get on the Pegasus premium but again two kind of similar shoes cool shoes can run in them as well so will be of interest to sneaker heads as well as Runners but when this shoe was initi announced there was a little bit oh is this going to be Nikes you know super training you've got that Big Air Zoom pod you've got some zoomx foam in there is this going to you know fill a gap in their lineup but that's not really what I'm getting from the shoe myself like the zoomfly 6 which just recently came out fills that Gap that's an excellent super trainer I put in a lot of miles in that shoe over the last week and a half and I'm really enjoying running it the Pegasus premium doesn't feel like a fast versatile super trainer like that shoe which compares to things like the Hoka ma X2 or the Endorphin speed 4 doesn't really feel like the ax super blast either which is a plateless super trainer with the mega stack as well the Pegasus premium to me definitely feels more in line with shoes like the Puma mag Max the hookus Skyward X maybe even like the Brooks Glycerin Max that are you know big Mega stack shoes designed to play more of a daily training role for people who maybe don't get on with those lower attack shoes and have a lot of Bounce have a lot of protection you know do a good job for that and actually are quite versatile because all the stuff in the mids soole but I think one thing that might count against it there is what I've been talking about that midfoot stability whereas you look at something like the glycerin Max it's very wide pum mag Max is very wide so is the Skyward X because with a high stack they want to give stability as well as well as all that cushioning underfoot and that's not something Nike's gone for so much with the Pegasus premium which is more of the classic kind of Pegasus silhouette certainly interesting shoe one I like I liked running in those first two times I've been looking forward to getting out and again but be interesting to see how it ends up being received elsewhere and how it ends up comparing to the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus plus which feel much more classic daily trainers that will work for lots more Runners the Pegasus premium probably will have slightly more Niche appeal I think in terms of the runners who enjoy it the most and also then there's people who might look at it as a nice crossover lifestyle running shoe [Music] that's our first look at the Nike Pegasus premium let us know what you think in the comments below please like subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus Premium Review: Is Nike’s max-stack super-trainer a hit or a miss?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick and this is our full review of the Nike Pegasus [Music] premium so Pegasus premium is an all new shoe for Nike that's going to sit at the top of the Pegasus line above the Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus this is part of Nike's restructuring of its range of shoes into kind of three main silos which is the Pegasus line which is responsive daily trainers the Vero line which is a more cushioned comfortable shoes it's going to include the next generation of the Invincible and then the structure line which is stability shoes the Pegasus premium is coming in to sit at the top of the Pegasus line like I say it's coming out at the end of January next year and it's the most expensive shoe in the Pegasus range at £185 or $210 it's also the highest stack shoe I think I've ever seen from Nike standing 45 mm tall at the hill and 35 at the 4T for a 10 mm drop it's pretty hefty it's 328 G or 11.6 oz in my UK size 9 which is a US size 10 so you've got engineered mesh upper Fair bit of padding around the back of the shoe there and a pretty significant internal heel counter to add some support around there quite a fluffy tongue as well almost like a kind of duvet style material here Nike certainly not made a big effort to reduce weight on the upper it's fair to say then you've got a three layer mid soole which is you know the really interesting part of this shoe you've got top layer that is zoomx foam that's the bouncy peber based foam you see in shoes like the Zoom 6 and the Nike Racing shoes and indeed the Invincible then you have an Air Zoom unit running the length of the shoe now we've seen Air Zoom pods in quite a few Nike shoes like you can see them in the alphafly also been embedded into the midsole of shoes like the Pegasus but never seen a full length unit like this in a running shoe to provide a kind of responsive ride along the length of the shoe and then at the back of the shoe that kind of running to the midfoot you have a bottom layer of react ex foam which is a pretty balanced foam it's fairly durable fairly soft it's nothing special it's not as you know exciting as the foam's above it but is there probably to add a bit more stability and durability to the Pegasus premium then you got a waffle tread outsole which is mostly covered actually is good rubber coverage on the four and heel there you can see the bottom of the Air Zoom pod a little bit of exposed react X foam there but nothing too much and the sho's actually been pretty good for me on grip and durability so [Music] far so it comes to the fit of the Nike Pegasus premium I've got my normal size here which is a uk9 US 10 that's a size I've been using in Nike shoes for many years and all the other Pegasus shoes I've tested and it fits me very well in that size I've got enough room in the toe box good hold around the heel and midfoot it's pretty comfortable shoe with the amount of padding you have at the midfoot and back of the shoe there so yeah no concerns at all about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size and if you've ever used a pegasus shoe I would use that size in the Pegasus [Music] premium onto the run test then and I've run about 50k in the Nike Pegasus premium using it for a mix of daily training mostly pretty relaxed runs fairly long runs and then a easy to steady progression run as well to test it out with some faster Paces it's a pretty interesting shoe it's fair to say like I've tested all of the Pegasus shoes released this year and where the Pegasus plus feels like a pretty natural step up from the standard Pegasus 41 with a pretty similar design all around just with a better foam this feels like something completely different it's very much a shoe that I think is Nike's first attempt to really compete in the max stack daily trainer category you know got things like the Brooks Glycerin Max came out this year the Puma mag Max the hoker skywood X came out I think at the start of this year maybe even the back end of last year these are really big shoes lots of foam underfoot but they're not really designed to be very fast shoes or anything like that they're designed to give you a lot of comfort and a fun bouncy ride for your daily training and the rid is bouncy it's the bouncy as Pegasus I can say that for sure you do get a lot of energy return from the combination of Foams in this midsole I think the Air Zoom unit is the dominant thing that I feel on the run it gives a slightly firmer Edge to it than you get from something just like zoomx foam alone it does give you a lot of response especially under the foref foot that's really notable for me compared to the other Pegasus shoes and I've kind of running them at the same time and that kind of thing you do get a lot more lift and bounce off this forfeit in the Pegasus premium because there is such a high stack there for a Nike shoe you know in general Nike often does these kind 10 mm drop shoes and that means the for foot often sits a bit lower to the ground compared to other brands just because of the way you know a 10 mm drop would work unless you have a very high heel stack which you do have on the Pegasus premium which means you still have a lot of foam under the forefoot of the shoe that does give you a really bouncy feeling you know a very energetic feeling there however all those Foams in the midsole does make this a heavy shoe and you do feel the weight on the run like if you're going to try and run at any kind of speed you're going try and charge up a hill or anything like that it does drag a bit because it is a big shoe and it is a heavy shoe as a result the pxas premium doesn't really feel like a very versatile shoot for me it's one that just makes cruising along at easy Paces you know feel quite fun because it is bouncy and everything like that and you do get an enjoyable ride but it's not one that you then really want to lift the pace in I was doing that easy to steady progression run in today like you can run in it at speed you are getting a lot of bounce back but the tradeoff you know bounce to weight just isn't quite tuned to my preferences anyway like Nike's done this quite a lot in the past actually it often feels to me that they put everything into creating a bounce issue some like the alphafly 2 for example like it was a pretty heavy Super Shoe but put a lot of Bounce in there and the trade-off I think was almost balanced there I think I did enjoy the outfly 2 as a racing shoe but here it just feels like there's a bit too much weight for even all these bouncing materials in the mids cell to make up for so it does work as a cruiser for kind of relaxed daily runs but there's a lot of tech and Foams and stuff going into that to create a shoes through that when there's a lot of those around really and then beyond that I think the bigger problem in the way is probably the instability in the shoe so you've got a really narrow pinch point at the mid foot of the shoe and when you look at these Max stack shoes that are built for daily training things like the Hocus skyex you know the glycerin Max they have really wide bases even something like the super Blast 2 has a much wider base than the Nike Pegasus premium and that's done to create a more stable ride when you've got a really big High stack of foam here so I do feel that this is an unstable shoe you can feel yourself rolling inwards a bit I'm a neutral Runner and you know it's fine for me I didn't have any real problems with it on the run but if you do pronate at all I would be certainly ster clear of this shoe and I was coming back from a twisted ankle during my testing of the shoe and it was one that I just basically didn't want to get back into for a while because lot of cambered Pavements around me like you know lot of broken Pavements and it's the kind of isoe where you can land on the wrong spot and it's going to turn you a bit more than other shoes because it does have that narrow pinch point and it just feels like an odd design choice to me obviously they did did make it a lot wider it would be even heavier and you that's going to be even more of a problem so it's a hard one to do but we got all these Foams in the midsole the weights added up you haven't got that wide base for extra support and even if you are a neutral Runner like if I'm going to go and cruise around in a Max stack shoe for my easy training as a neutral Runner I probably still want the width there the extra base that extra support because you know I don't want to have any kind of instability or twist an ankle or anything like that it just feels like a bit of a worry here especially if you are like me someone who often runs on you just normal Pavements which often aren't pristine and flat you often have to dodge around people and there are like little cers and stuff like that so at the same time I was testing the shoe I was testing the ASX over blast 5 for example which is also a pretty high stack shoe comes in a lot lighter though and it has a wider base and it was a shoe I was able to run in very comfortably as I was coming back from twisted ankle without really worrying about that at all so overall it kind of just ends up falling into a roll I don't quite understand the Pegasus premium it's fair to say like it has got a bouncy ride now at a very simple level it's a pretty fun shoe to run in but then the more you run in it the more kind of these little concerns arise and just means to shoe that I'm not really sure exactly what it would do for me because I don't really want to go and bounce around loads of easy runs in it because it isn't the most stable shoe and it is fairly heavy even for long runs at easy Paces I don't really want to use it for those faster runs because like I said pretty heavy shoe not the most versatile so yeah it was pretty fun to run in but not sure I quite get [Music] it so my verdict on Nike Pegasus premium it's an interesting shoe it was a fun shoe to run in nik's had a lot of fun putting all this Tech into a shoe and it' be interesting to see where this Tech ends up in other shoes in the future but unlike the other two Pegasus shoes in the range which I think are really good Workhorse daily Trainers for those who like traditional ride with that 10 mm drop they do a really good job this feels like a shoe I don't really get like I said in the run test I'm not exactly sure we pick it up like if you have a lot of money you want to buy a pretty interesting shoe a shoe that's quite fun for certain types of runs you can do that job but when you're looking at building an effective running shoe rotation it's not one that I'd really better slip in myself some might find the ride just much more enjoyable me of course like you know it's a fun ride I enjoyed it but some might find it really fun and in which case it's worth spending the money just to have that really energetic feeling under foot and you know bounce through some daily training in a really fun way and you get a pretty cool looking shoe as well this will certainly have some appeal as a crossover shoe bit like the ultra Boost from mes which is shoe you can wear around town enjoy wearing It's a good-looking shoe and then do some running in because you know it is a good running shoe like I enjoyed running in it it's not just one of those shoes it's a lifestyle shoe I we get comments like that all the time but no this is a running shoe and it's a shoe I enjoyed running in but I think it's a shoe that probably needs to add value in some other way to really make it worth picking up and if for you that is you love the look you love using it as a casual shoe as well great you've also got a pretty good running shoe here as well you look at the price of the Pegasus premium though it isn't hard to think of running shoes that I'd recommend getting ahead of it within Nike's range I mean immediately the other two Pegasus shoes like I said I have done some runs wearing the Pegasus premium on one foot and then the Pegasus 41 or Pegasus Plus on the other and they just they feel like you know better running shoes like the Pegasus Plus in particular is lighter got that zumex midso gives you a nice bit of a poppy ride and while those shoes are certainly thinner under the forefoot and feel a bit flat under the forefoot compared to the bounce you get from the Pegasus premium all around they're a bit more enjoyable to run in I think and Pegasus 41 being a good Workhorse Cruiser cushion shoe and the Pegasus plus being you know more versatile shoe all round both a bit more stable as well then Nike also has the zoom fly 6 in its range which is cheaper and one of my favorite shoes of the year you've got a really good combo of materials in there with the zoom X foam there carbon plate in there as well really fun versatile shoe great for Speed workor great for easy runs more stable than the Pegasus premium just a lot more fun to run in and a bit cheaper so that would be a really good alternative if you are looking for you know a proper super trainer and you don't mind training with the plate and then if you are looking around these other Max cushion shoes I think the hoker skyw X and the Brooks Glycerin Max are both kind of better shoes in this category of maxed out shoes with loads of stuff going on in the midell that are just a bit more fun to run in for your daily training like they're both a little bit lighter I think the Hocus SC X is a bit more bouncy bit more fun they're both more stable they both just seem a bit better suited to the type of runs you'd be using them for whereas like I said the Pegasus premium has that instability problem for a shoe with a high stack that like if you're going to have that quite narrow design at the bottom there you want it to be in a shoe that you're going to use for Speed work because you're less concerned about stability I think if you're going going to go and pick up a shoe you're going to use for some fast running and I really wouldn't use the Pegasus premium for that myself just cuz it's weight and overall design doesn't really lend itself to fast running for me some other shoes you can look at as well it's obviously the Astic super Blast 2 which is cheaper than this shoe in the US which is you know wild to me that's a much lighter much more responsive much more versatile shoe all around definitely what I'd pick up ahead of the Pegasus premium as a shoe you'd be using for any kind of run really the Puma mag Max Nitro I'm not a huge fan of myself I didn't really get on with I actually prefer running in the Nike Pegasus premium but you know again that does have a wider design that I think lends itself better to regular training then there's also the Muno NE Vista if you just looking for a really fun and bouncy ride that's got a plate in it it's a lot cheaper though but it's again a lot lighter a lot more fun to run in in general also you know very high stack height similar to the Nike new balance ballos as well now that's a really fun shoe like with a big rocker soft foam loads of Bounce you know it's quite expensive but this is also very expensive and I think that's a more fun shoe to do General daily training runs in as well so I did enjoy some runs in the Pegasus premium I did find it pretty fun and bouncy shoe and a pretty interesting shoe I think there are a few problems here that make it a hard shoe to recommend like I think it is too heavy it's not that versatile and I think that has that narrow pinch point that makes it less well suited for kind of General cruising especially you have any kind of stability concerns I really wouldn't be looking at the shoe but even if don't I'd rather been a shoe with a slightly more stable base myself it's not hard to find those shoes that are also a lot lighter cheaper you know equally energetic and all that kind of things there's just too many good shoes on the market for me to really say this is a standout if you love The look you're going to get a pretty decent running shoe as well if you're going to use it for casual use but overall I'd say the other Pegasus shoes are better buys or indeed the zoomfly 6 though I will be interested to see what happens with all this Tech in the future of Nike [Music] shoes have review of the Nike Pegasus premium let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll

Review':\n\nI purchased the alphafly 3 back at the start of the year and I've put many hundreds of training miles and also a couple of races through the shoe as well so I thought it was time to sit down and give you my completely unbiased thoughts on the shoe and to see how well they are holding up after all of those Mars I've done 200 training and racing Mars in this prototype colorway here and I've also done one marathon in Berlin in this shoe here we're going to be answering those all important questions today how long are these shoes holding up what the phone feeling like after 200 miles and can the Everyday Athlete really benefit from a shoe like this or is it just for those Elites because as you'll have seen the world records for the women's and the men's Marathon are now being broken in Chicago with the alphafly version 3 right let's get stuck in the review first thing we're going to chat about the differences between the alphafly 3 and the alphafly version 2 so when Nike launched alphafly version 3 it came with a completely new redesign there was a big weight decrease as well for me it was 30 G lighter in my UK size 12 the arch on the inside is a lot less pronounced version two people are getting some big hot spot issues in here and some soreness on that inside of the arch that is a lot lot better now and now you've got this lovely continuous midsole which just makes it so much smoother through the foot strike and you've got a little bit of a wider carbon plate for some extra stability in there as well well let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like the alphafly version 3 this is a road racing Super Shoe that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines price-wise this shoe sent me back a staggering £285 we'll put it up with the other currencies up on the screen now stack cut at the back 40 mm right at that legal limit we've got 8 mm drop over all this is coming in for me at 269 G for me in my UK size 12 so nice and light that's what we like to see this is a neutral shoe and it has this lovely atomknit upper super breathable get some fantastic air flow in that as you start to pick up the pace midso we're talking Nike's Flagship zoomx midso with two Air Zoom Pods at the bottom of the shoe here to give you that extra propulsion we've got a ful length carbon plate running throughout the shoe with the outsole of the shoe we've got a lot of rubber up at the front here to give you some really good grip mainly for your Forefront and midfoot Strikers rear foot Strikers going to be a little less grip there's nothing there at the back of the shoe just some very small rubber units here there are no different widths available there are men's and women's different fits and this shoe was true to size for me right let's get stuck into my likes my first like with the Ally is the super smooth ride with this updated midsole you're getting a lovely buttery smooth transition through the foot strike there it's a lot less Slappy than version one and two because cuz it had that sort of bit missing in the center of the shoe there the lightweightness of this shoe you really notice that as well when you're going from version two to version three if you're a heel Striker this is going to be a lot smoother through that whole foot strike compared to version one and version two my second like with the shoe is just so comfortable at all Paces previous version of the alphafly they were just so clumpy at those slower Paces when you're warming up and easy pace and now this is comfortable at all Paces this new breathable upper is fantastic that sock like feel really good lockdown in the shoe as well I've had no issues with any blisters hot spots anything uncomfortable even at the back end of the marathons when I've been racing the shoe absolutely comfortable from right from the start the middle and all the way to the end previously I've always reverted back to vaporfly version 3 cuz it was just way more comfortable but with this update here this is now a little bit faster than vaporfly for me and with that Comfort aspect of as well it's the one I've been reaching for for my races my third like with this shoe is the surprising that what I've called this video is the surprising truth the durability has been really good this shoe has now done 200 miles in it a lot of training miles getting ready for Berlin and then I raised Melbourne in the shoe I did actually get a new pair for Berlin cuz I was like oh they say it wasn't going to last very long I better get a new pair but I actually went faster in Melbourne with my old slightly more bashed up pair that a lot of Manufacturers would say has passed its better days but for me I had a fantastic run in Melbourne it really has held up really really well I like a lot of people get frustrated by manufacturers saying these Super Shoes are only going to last 100 miles of perfect running and then after that you need to Trop and change them in reality I really don't think that's true if you're an elite athlete you've got unlimited amount of shoes to choose from Yes it probably is going to make that like .05 little bit of difference right guys out here on the ten path got a speed session to 7 by 3 minutes getting ready for Valencia on my left foot I've got my 200 mile pair of Al 3es on my right the Nearly New Pair just done at 26 miles of Berlin marathon and that just want to see how they feel how they compare how that Popp that springiness that bounce and see what it's like between the two shoes have they lost it are they now dead do they need to be retired I don't think so I think they still feel fantastic but going to go through these three minute reps here and see how they feel going to be doing these around 10K to half marathon pace [Music] it's really hard to tell the difference there is a slight difference the good the newer pair feel a little bit more stable the airpods just have a little bit more life left in them they haven't been compressed and crunch quite as much as's the pair on the left but really very very marginal I think most people could easy Run 3 to 400 training and racing mares in their shoe absolutely fine wear wise on the bottom of the shoe I've just got a little bit of wear on the outso here where I land and then I sort of roll inwards through the foot strike there it's a little bit worn down at the front here but what's important with these shoes is how the foam feels how that's holding up and I really feel there's so much life left in this shoe and we carry on getting ready for Valencia by doing a lot of training Mars in their shoe it's far from done and then my fourth like with this shoe is just how stable this shoe is for a maximum stack height shoe that super wide carbon fiber plate you've got in their shoe just feel really confident when I'm cornering and things like that when I was in a couple of these races we had to do some 180 turn backs I just felt super confident going to that didn't really enter my mind that I might roll an ankle or something like that which you can sometimes get with these Max stack height shoes the grip is much improved on this shoe I haven't run in the rain in this shoe yet been very lucky mainly training in the summer but when you go through some Aid stations and things like that where there's water bottles and stuff all over the road when I was going through that the grip felt super good when the roads did get a little bit wet but as always on the channel here I want to give you that completely honest review so there are a few dis likes and let's get stuck into those now the first dislike with the shoe is it still just a little bit noisy nowhere near as Slappy as the older shoes I'll put up a little bit of footage now this is Midway through the Melborne marathon in a really quiet section and you can just hear how loud this shoe is when you run along for some people they don't like the amount of noise that these shoes can make not as bad as the old one but it's still a bit noisy my second dislike is it's still a little bit on the narrow side through the midf foot it's been absolutely fine for me I did have a few issues with the earlier shoes and it's much improved through the midot Section here but it's still just a little bit on the narrow side and you do notice that and then obviously price has to come into it in the UK this is nearly £300 but with how well the shoe is holding up as I say you're getting some good value here and I think if you spent some time on some lights like Vinted or Ebay you could probably pick up a used pair for not a lot of money and have many happy training miles in this if a pair's only done 100 miles or something you can pick that up and it's going to feel absolutely fantastic so what about a rotation what can I pair this up with well if you want to stick with an Nike range something like the Vero 17 or the Pegasus Plus for your everyday runs and then use this shoe here for your key workouts and races if you got a bit more cash to spend you want a three shoe rotation it's a bit of a debate whether to get something like the vaporfly 3 which is a little bit lighter a little bit snappier and it could be a good option for some faster speed work at those 5K and 10K page that's when I'd probably like to whip out the vapor 53 if I was doing a 5k or 10k race it's just a little bit as I say a little bit lighter and snappier type of shoe there be still really good in this but this is really that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines or potentially you could dial up your recovery runs with something like the Invincible version 4 is launching very soon I'm kind of checking the Nike website every day for when it's dropping so get subscribed to that we'll get it in and we'll give you that review right conclusions and Final thoughts obviously I've really enjoyed running this shoe it's been fantastic but who is this shoe for and I think because this shoe is so smooth so comfortable but not overly aggressive it really does mean a more intermediate Runner can benefit from a shoe like this so many carbon shoes out there are so stiff and so firm you have to have that like Elite level leg strength to get the most out of the shoe but for me that hasn't being the case here I feel a lot of people can benefit from a shoe like this there's no Bild big Breakin period and it's really going to be popular with a lot of marathon runners regardless of their ability so is it recommended definitely I recommend you check out my full Nike lineup video we link to that video which is going to be up here next if you want to check out my whole Melborne Marathon video that video is down here where I use this very shoe to run in so that's it guys I'm off to get some more training miles done let me know your thoughts on the alphafly version 3 keep on working hard keep done we'll see you very soon in the next one\n\nFrom video 'Nike Pegasus 41 - MY 100% HONEST REVIEW':\n\nthe Nike Pegasus has always been a firm favorite of long Runners for such a long time but over the last four years as running shoe technology has advanced so quickly that Pegasus has really started to lag behind its competitors big fans of the historic Nike Pegasus have been crying out for updates especially to the outdated midsole and Nike have finally given us that in the shoe but not without a considerable hike in price so Nike now finally caught up and produced a 10 out of 10 daily trainer and if so is it going to be worth that extra hike in price so I'm three runs in to the Pegasus 41 now thought what better time to put my thoughts down on paper and bring you this video right let's start out chatting about all of the differences between this version 41 and the outgoing version 40 but before we do of course as I do with all the reviews on the channel I bought this shoe 100% with my own money to give you that completely impartial 100% honest review as I would always do so thank you to everybody liking commenting and sharing this video it really helps support the channel and allows us to keep on doing that all right let's talk about the changes the first one is this updated mesh upper it's now a slightly lighter weight and a little bit more breathable as well little bit more cushioning around the ankle and through the tongue as well a really nice update the second one the all important one with this update Nike's new react X foam which now runs the whole length of the shoe we were stuck with Nike's very outdated react foam in versions 37 to 40 so a fantastic update there we've got an extra 4 mm stack height in the shoe and it's now £15 more expensive here in the UK right let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so purpose of the shoe like this this is your daily trainer suitable for all different types of runs I'd say up to around about the Half Marathon distance in terms of price I showed out 130 of my hard-earned British pounds 10 mm drop here with a 37 mil stack at the back of the shoe giving a 27 mil stack at the front of the shoe in terms of Weight Wise I measured this exactly the same as my outgo model 347 G for me in my UK size 12 it's a neutral shoe and it has this lovely engineered mesh upper as I say really nice and breathable getting good air flow through there as well the midsole as we've just discussed now ful length react X foam here and Nike have kept their two Air Zoom units just g a little bit of extra bounciness in the shoe one at the front of the shoe and one at the back of the shoe there's no carbon plate in this shoe and it has this lovely waffle outs soole rubber in this shoe lovely and grippy and super super durable as well there's no different width options available certainly not at launch anyway maybe that will come in time terms of colorways we've got two at launch in the UK USA you're very lucky you got six to choose from and as a side note you can get this in the Nikes by you choose your own colorway options and that is now 155 here in the UK and this was true to size for me right let's get stck into the likes right we've got three likes to get through my first one is this updated react X phone it is so much more improved from the outgoing version Nike say it's 13% more responsive and it's also helped to reduce Nike's carbon Foo Pit by 43% when producing the mid Sal of this shoe yes it's just a lot more springy lot more responsive with those Air Zoom pods in there as well and finally a Nike P shoe has got a bit more life about it it's a little bit more fun to run in it's a little bit more engaging to run in and you don't feel like you're running around with two big blocks of lead on your feet my second like with the shoe is the allaround Comfort fantastic amount of padding in the tongue and the ankle getting a really good lock down fit in the shoe and a nice even amount of pressure all over the front of the foot here really like what they've done with this lacing lock down system here it works really well if you're someone that likes to heal lace lock I didn't get any sort of ankle stip in this shoe but if you do the laces are long enough for that if you are someone that runs in some hotter climates I would worry a little bit about some potential overheating this shoe but for me in the UK even in the summer here it's been absolutely fine and my third like with the shoe is this wider toe box combined with this waffle outsole provides a really solid nice platform your feet have got a lot of space in the front of the shoe here really good footplay and really good support as you run along now of course I'd love to see Nike offer this shoe in a wider option but for me I do have quite narrow feet but they had plenty of space up the front here and I know this shoe will last a long time Pegasus is always due this hasn't changed this will be good for 5 600 miles and I've also spent quite a lot of time in the gym with this shoe as well and he's got really good stability that wider platform with that outsole really good stability for doing weights and I've really enjoyed it using the shoe for that stability and you can really feel that in cornering but let's move on to chat about the dislikes my first one here is this really is not a far shoe if you're looking for something to do some speed workor some races this really is not the one to be going for this shoe really is built for all around comfort and all all around durability as well there really are a lot better options out there if you're looking for that allout speed shoe we'll come on to that later and the second disc like with the shoe is it's had a pretty significant price hike and it now takes it from that sort of lower range more Budgy shoe I hate to say1 shoe was a budget is shoe but in today's modern world that kind of is takes it from that up until that mid tier shoes and it's now really competing with the Max 6 is with the Nova blast of this world and it's just a lot better com competition around at this price point Nike always had that thing with the Pegasus it always really undercut everybody and it's now really slap bang in the middle of a super competitive daily shoe market right so let's bring this all together my conclusion who is this shoe for do I recommend it is it going into my rotation well if you're the type of Runner that runs maybe two to three times a week wears the same shoe at the gym maybe play some other sports in your shoes as well travel in it go shopping in it then this is a really good solid 7 out of 10 for all of those different options if you like the previous versions you're going to like this one as well it's a perfectly fine okay shoe to get your basic runs done in is it worth going to buy the discounted outgoing version 40 or this one I'd really say try and find this one if you want to buy the Pegasus this one is a massive step up on that outgoing version 40 the new foam is so much more fun and engaging to run in and it really is just that classic Pegasus do- it- all type shoe it's a perfectly fine okay acceptable shoe to run in but if you're looking for a more of a dead ated running shoe you're a bit more serious Runner out there the Nike Zone Vero 17 is a lot livelier it's a lot faster and it's a lot more engaging ride with that shoe because it's got Nike's zoomx in there built into the midsole which is just a lot more fun and reactive to run in and it has all the durability of the Pegasus line as well and then look at some other brands Hoka Max 6 ax Nova blast now these are at the same sort of price point as the shoes we've got to talk about them in this debate they've got far superior Foams in there compared to the react X much lighter much more responsive and a lot more cushioning in the shoe as well and personally that's where I'd be choosing to spend my money if I just had around that 13540 to spend on a shoe I really do feel Nike can't win with the Pegasus line it's got millions of big fans all over the world that will not want this recipe to change they've tweaked the phone for the better no doubt but it's still the same fundamental shoe perfect for that beginner novice or casual Runner or the more advanced Runner that's looking to get away from all the Mac stack height shoes out there and just wants a little bit more feel at 27 mil that's now quite a minimal shoe out there as crazy that is and it's really quite nice be able to feel that ground a little bit more of an old school ride yes I'll be keeping the shoe without a doubt I've really enjoyed using at the gym just casually out and about as well but for me I'm super excited about the supposed upcoming I'm sure it is coming Nike Pegasus turbo when we're going to get a lot more zoom X foam in here f cross that is coming soon and when Nike will hopefully finally deliver a fantastic allaround daily shoe which is so badly missing from their lineup at the moment to rival or potentially better the likes of the as6 NOA blast and the hoker Clifton and the hoker Max 6 as well and of course I'll be getting that shoe as soon as it drops I'm so excited for it the most exciting shoe I've got this year or maybe the super Blast 2 I don't know so that's it guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments are you going to be getting the version 41 what do you think about it what do you think about this crazy colorway I love this I've love wearing it casually I've love running it videos coming up next you can check out the hoko Max 6 review up here or down here you can check out my aex Nova blast 4 review keep on working hard guys keep my done let me know your thoughts down below and we'll see you very soon in the next one\n\nFrom video 'The North Face 2025 Trail Preview | Vectiv Pro 3, Vectiv Enduris 4, Vectiv Sky 2, Vectiv Infinite 3':\n\nhey this is Taylor with believe in the run and I'm here with Brett Rivers senior product manager of the North Face and they have a ton of updates for this this next year right away in the spring right um and like couldn't be more excited these shoes um many of these shoes have made our year- end Awards uh and they're just getting better like the North Face is really you it feels like you're becoming a marble in a Groove and you are going like we are building we're not starting from zero each time you know going from Z to one is hard but now we're going from 1 to two to three you're chisel chiseling away that rock and becoming exactly you're ready to go so what what do we have the new Summit vective Pro 3 so this is that Pinnacle you know athlete tested race proven Summit Series style within the line This the concept here is is really Revolution versus Evolution it really starts you know from the bottom up on this style does this ask if I want the highest performing and I need the highest performing Trail shoe on the market that largest competitive advantage and so uh The Innovation team at all triangles and an ay really got to work for that spring 25 season of how do we develop a system that enhances both that that performance rebound that propulsion as well as that stability and so we designed a completely uh new and really Innovative um platform in the summ effective Pro 3 we increased the total stack height four millimeters overall from the pro two you still have that amazing um proprietary peba Eva super foam um midsole here yep with then and that's the dream foam same you're going to find in Alesa the vecta Pro 2 um it it really is dreamy I mean we've loved it so far great for trail application what what makes it so dreamy like what about it that's the secret sauce yeah come I mean I really it's how effctive is a system so we think of it just plates but it's geometry plates and how that entire system works so here we now put a carbon fiber propulsion plate down in that midsole and then a 10 mm dream foam drop in above that and what that's going to do really build in that long ultra distance Comfort um and really still continue to enhance that propulsion that you have below the foot and for for those in the past that have had some of that rubbing of the plate some athletes do some athletes don't this is completely embedded it's all hid under there and so correct it's peeking out of the window some cutouts in the midfoot but it's down in there and then as you go up in stack height and you do these these newer softer Foams you still really need to stabilize that foam for trail application and again this is about Ultra racing um you know winning the big ones as we say exactly so what we've done is we've taken this recycled carbon fiber injected stability plate and the idea here is really carving that out shaping it you glue that in it's giving you a lot of that lateral stability building in more of that almost independent suspension um around the foot you know so really embedding that down as well what this does is really accentuate and improve that midot to 4ft stability transition which you know again if you're running for 20 hours 25 hours um you know really gives you an advantage stability wise saving your legs with this entire system so that's all what goes into to you know that Pro yeah and so like you're taking the the stability mechanism we know we need that and you're taking the propulsive mechanisms and and spreading them out through and separating them and I mean we can't necessarily see this in something like a road shoe where there's this layered this isn't necessarily a plate but in the trail there's some serious application to absolutely yeah this is Performance Tuned for the trail it's not just taking Pinnacle Elite marathoning shoe and putting more traction on the out so yep it's and I like I like that idea of like a full system it really is this layered system yeah so what about up top cuz I know that that upper is pretty special too yeah so uh an improved version of that that TPU reinforced um uh TPU yarn upper hydrophobic uh very breathable drains incredibly well an improved race lace um uh with that as well um and you know here it's like we still really needed to stay under 300 G this is racing product we come in at 294 G on a men's nine um so as we go up in stack height and really you know do this dual plate stack Plate System you know you're really not paying a weight uh having any significant weight tradeoff with all of that as well yeah and and for Elite Performance we know that's one of the things that Runners look for lighter weight but they want all these other benefits what what is the total stack for this so it's 37 mm in the heel uh plate midsole and outs sole um and everything we do in the trail run side is a 6 mm offset so it's a 3731 stack height awesome and and weight do you know that weight after the top of your head 294 g94 and price uh $250 of maintaining price which is huge yeah go so in lot like what you'll really see is us really striving to maintain price as much as possible you know this this Elite uh segment of Footwear is growing but we still want to be hyper competitive in that while at the same time really delivering something that's unique to the market yeah and I and I don't want to put too many spoilers out there but I've been in this and it it's special it's a special shoe um let's go to like it's training companion right was that what you would absolutely so the vective endurus is really going to be I would say that that more consumer uh relevant style from an everyday perspective in this we want to really uh bridge the gap from that everyday you know training shoe to race day you know for the person who has a one shoe quiver this is the perfect you know single shoe for them if they're wanting want you to do everything at the same time you can directly see a lot of the Innovation that started in the prob that's really cascading down into the endurus um and what's neat here is we're coming in at $160 with a lot of improvements that are going on in this style overall and in the endurus the past couple models have really almost have created a cult following a little bit people love the endurus so what are what are they going to see that familiar in that line and what's going to be different again it's problem solving based off of athlete and consumer feedback so what we want to do overall is really continue to accelerate that underfoot performance so now you have a ful length nitrogen TPU dream Foam midsole High rebound lightweight that rebound really stays throughout the life of the shoe um we've increased the lug depth to 4 mm and completely redesigned that outsole again to really enhance the action uh underfoot uh and then a lot of just smaller improvements really focusing on that InStep fit a bit more where in the endurus 3 if you had a narrower lower volume fit or lower inep could be yeah there's more room so this new dual warp upper that you're seeing um in several of the new shoes um really uh wraps the foot incredibly well so some pattern improvements that we did there um but at the same time a materialization that you're not going to have very much mechanical stretch at all really secures and holds the foot still breathable still very drainable um so yeah overall a package that we're super excited about and and it seems that it's pretty similar in terms like if you just looked at this on paper compared to the Ula Mesa uh which has been so popular like what is something that what consumer would look toward this as opposed to the ultim itself if you want to if you want that enhanced stability that VCA provides you still have that that full length TPU plate it's forked and we're doing some carve outs with it to get your foot a little closer to the foam certain areas but that vective system really provides that enhanced stability again for the demands of trail running um yeah and uh uh you're coming in uh at a 32 mil stack height in the heel so 2 mm more than the prior version we're really aligning that to the stack height of the the pro one and the pro two yeah so really having this tiered system of not only performance but also you're filling a lot of holes of Stack as well exactly and uh next which one do you want talk about next let's talk about the sky next CU then that brings you into the infinite as well so uh we talked about the pro that would be that high stack ultra distance long distance maximum cushion maximum propulsion Trail shoe the counterpart of that is the athletes are still saying hey I still need that lighter weight shoe I'm on technical terrain uh I need that that agile closer to the ground um shoe even if it's not my ultra distance ra Sho you know per se um so that position for us is the summit VC of sky this is now the summit effective Sky 2 and the athlete need here was I just need the shoe to be lighter and more traction um and I was like all right we we uh there's a way to do that exactly we have we have the goal uh we cut uh over 34 G out of this shoe compared to the first version exactly yeah so now we come in at uh 238 G um light uh it has a ful length nitrogen TPU dream midsole um so enhanced underfoot experience even though we cut so much weight out of it we also increased lug depth to 5 mm and you have much more rubber coverage in the areas that you need ITT um so again wanting this shoe to really excel in technical train uphill train or you know areas where you're going to be much more in a a vertical application of this style is this the same surface control rubber that we would have seen in the past correct yep exactly yeah and we're continuing to to to work on um some more innovation in that space that we'll be talking about uh in future season right not yeah but uh yeah overall here is really improved traction lighter weight and an enhanced underfoot experience a new dual warp upper again really breathable really drainable similar we have going on uh in the uras but in an even lighter weight application awesome awesome so with that it then brings us into the infinite and how we want to have that that race day shoe um but really still bring in that consumer relevant shoe with the infinite 3 right so we actually able to lower the price on this to 160 wow so the infinite and the endurus are both coming in at 160 now um the main difference is a 3 mm difference in stack height between the endurus and the infinite um but also this has a 5mm lug out soole ripping off of the design of what's going on with the sky even those Silhouettes I know there's more foam here but the Silhouettes these are likely to be a pair if you're enjoying one of those and the other two are likely to be say hey like I'm a a runner who gravitates towards higher stack shoes or hey I'm a runner who gravitates more towards low to mid stack shoes and we have two different kind of sublines within vective that are really going to appeal to those different consumer which is unique within the market for sure I I mean maybe you're not comfortable saying this but this might be the true dream team right this is this is the Dream Team I love your pun absolutely um so seem like it there's something for everybody but yeah keep absolutely yeah um ful length uh uh injected TPU plate where you have that carbon fiber on the sky little softer and a little more stability focused on the infinite um and again a complete upper overhaul too really wanted to improve uh some of the fit especially on the infinite when we talk about the infinite 2 versus the infinite 3 so again yeah enhancing the underfoot experience on all of these shoes it's really exciting I mean and I've been in most of these shoes and the goal every year is to innovate and enhance The Experience like you said and I'm already feeling like these are truly doing that like you guys are the team to beat right now in terms of like best lineup for next year and something for everybody I think that's what North Face's goal is there's something for everybody every terrain yeah and here we have that Ultima line for kind of everyday training and an even broader Runner that off Trail line for the most kind of rugged applications and then the vective line is really more of that that race point of view but how we continue to expand that again based off of the athlete need of building a true quiver of Footwear uh for what they need yeah awesome thank you Brett all right thank you\n\nUser Question: nike

Review':\n\nI purchased the alphafly 3 back at the start of the year and I've put many hundreds of training miles and also a couple of races through the shoe as well so I thought it was time to sit down and give you my completely unbiased thoughts on the shoe and to see how well they are holding up after all of those Mars I've done 200 training and racing Mars in this prototype colorway here and I've also done one marathon in Berlin in this shoe here we're going to be answering those all important questions today how long are these shoes holding up what the phone feeling like after 200 miles and can the Everyday Athlete really benefit from a shoe like this or is it just for those Elites because as you'll have seen the world records for the women's and the men's Marathon are now being broken in Chicago with the alphafly version 3 right let's get stuck in the review first thing we're going to chat about the differences between the alphafly 3 and the alphafly version 2 so when Nike launched alphafly version 3 it came with a completely new redesign there was a big weight decrease as well for me it was 30 G lighter in my UK size 12 the arch on the inside is a lot less pronounced version two people are getting some big hot spot issues in here and some soreness on that inside of the arch that is a lot lot better now and now you've got this lovely continuous midsole which just makes it so much smoother through the foot strike and you've got a little bit of a wider carbon plate for some extra stability in there as well well let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like the alphafly version 3 this is a road racing Super Shoe that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines price-wise this shoe sent me back a staggering £285 we'll put it up with the other currencies up on the screen now stack cut at the back 40 mm right at that legal limit we've got 8 mm drop over all this is coming in for me at 269 G for me in my UK size 12 so nice and light that's what we like to see this is a neutral shoe and it has this lovely atomknit upper super breathable get some fantastic air flow in that as you start to pick up the pace midso we're talking Nike's Flagship zoomx midso with two Air Zoom Pods at the bottom of the shoe here to give you that extra propulsion we've got a ful length carbon plate running throughout the shoe with the outsole of the shoe we've got a lot of rubber up at the front here to give you some really good grip mainly for your Forefront and midfoot Strikers rear foot Strikers going to be a little less grip there's nothing there at the back of the shoe just some very small rubber units here there are no different widths available there are men's and women's different fits and this shoe was true to size for me right let's get stuck into my likes my first like with the Ally is the super smooth ride with this updated midsole you're getting a lovely buttery smooth transition through the foot strike there it's a lot less Slappy than version one and two because cuz it had that sort of bit missing in the center of the shoe there the lightweightness of this shoe you really notice that as well when you're going from version two to version three if you're a heel Striker this is going to be a lot smoother through that whole foot strike compared to version one and version two my second like with the shoe is just so comfortable at all Paces previous version of the alphafly they were just so clumpy at those slower Paces when you're warming up and easy pace and now this is comfortable at all Paces this new breathable upper is fantastic that sock like feel really good lockdown in the shoe as well I've had no issues with any blisters hot spots anything uncomfortable even at the back end of the marathons when I've been racing the shoe absolutely comfortable from right from the start the middle and all the way to the end previously I've always reverted back to vaporfly version 3 cuz it was just way more comfortable but with this update here this is now a little bit faster than vaporfly for me and with that Comfort aspect of as well it's the one I've been reaching for for my races my third like with this shoe is the surprising that what I've called this video is the surprising truth the durability has been really good this shoe has now done 200 miles in it a lot of training miles getting ready for Berlin and then I raised Melbourne in the shoe I did actually get a new pair for Berlin cuz I was like oh they say it wasn't going to last very long I better get a new pair but I actually went faster in Melbourne with my old slightly more bashed up pair that a lot of Manufacturers would say has passed its better days but for me I had a fantastic run in Melbourne it really has held up really really well I like a lot of people get frustrated by manufacturers saying these Super Shoes are only going to last 100 miles of perfect running and then after that you need to Trop and change them in reality I really don't think that's true if you're an elite athlete you've got unlimited amount of shoes to choose from Yes it probably is going to make that like .05 little bit of difference right guys out here on the ten path got a speed session to 7 by 3 minutes getting ready for Valencia on my left foot I've got my 200 mile pair of Al 3es on my right the Nearly New Pair just done at 26 miles of Berlin marathon and that just want to see how they feel how they compare how that Popp that springiness that bounce and see what it's like between the two shoes have they lost it are they now dead do they need to be retired I don't think so I think they still feel fantastic but going to go through these three minute reps here and see how they feel going to be doing these around 10K to half marathon pace [Music] it's really hard to tell the difference there is a slight difference the good the newer pair feel a little bit more stable the airpods just have a little bit more life left in them they haven't been compressed and crunch quite as much as's the pair on the left but really very very marginal I think most people could easy Run 3 to 400 training and racing mares in their shoe absolutely fine wear wise on the bottom of the shoe I've just got a little bit of wear on the outso here where I land and then I sort of roll inwards through the foot strike there it's a little bit worn down at the front here but what's important with these shoes is how the foam feels how that's holding up and I really feel there's so much life left in this shoe and we carry on getting ready for Valencia by doing a lot of training Mars in their shoe it's far from done and then my fourth like with this shoe is just how stable this shoe is for a maximum stack height shoe that super wide carbon fiber plate you've got in their shoe just feel really confident when I'm cornering and things like that when I was in a couple of these races we had to do some 180 turn backs I just felt super confident going to that didn't really enter my mind that I might roll an ankle or something like that which you can sometimes get with these Max stack height shoes the grip is much improved on this shoe I haven't run in the rain in this shoe yet been very lucky mainly training in the summer but when you go through some Aid stations and things like that where there's water bottles and stuff all over the road when I was going through that the grip felt super good when the roads did get a little bit wet but as always on the channel here I want to give you that completely honest review so there are a few dis likes and let's get stuck into those now the first dislike with the shoe is it still just a little bit noisy nowhere near as Slappy as the older shoes I'll put up a little bit of footage now this is Midway through the Melborne marathon in a really quiet section and you can just hear how loud this shoe is when you run along for some people they don't like the amount of noise that these shoes can make not as bad as the old one but it's still a bit noisy my second dislike is it's still a little bit on the narrow side through the midf foot it's been absolutely fine for me I did have a few issues with the earlier shoes and it's much improved through the midot Section here but it's still just a little bit on the narrow side and you do notice that and then obviously price has to come into it in the UK this is nearly £300 but with how well the shoe is holding up as I say you're getting some good value here and I think if you spent some time on some lights like Vinted or Ebay you could probably pick up a used pair for not a lot of money and have many happy training miles in this if a pair's only done 100 miles or something you can pick that up and it's going to feel absolutely fantastic so what about a rotation what can I pair this up with well if you want to stick with an Nike range something like the Vero 17 or the Pegasus Plus for your everyday runs and then use this shoe here for your key workouts and races if you got a bit more cash to spend you want a three shoe rotation it's a bit of a debate whether to get something like the vaporfly 3 which is a little bit lighter a little bit snappier and it could be a good option for some faster speed work at those 5K and 10K page that's when I'd probably like to whip out the vapor 53 if I was doing a 5k or 10k race it's just a little bit as I say a little bit lighter and snappier type of shoe there be still really good in this but this is really that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines or potentially you could dial up your recovery runs with something like the Invincible version 4 is launching very soon I'm kind of checking the Nike website every day for when it's dropping so get subscribed to that we'll get it in and we'll give you that review right conclusions and Final thoughts obviously I've really enjoyed running this shoe it's been fantastic but who is this shoe for and I think because this shoe is so smooth so comfortable but not overly aggressive it really does mean a more intermediate Runner can benefit from a shoe like this so many carbon shoes out there are so stiff and so firm you have to have that like Elite level leg strength to get the most out of the shoe but for me that hasn't being the case here I feel a lot of people can benefit from a shoe like this there's no Bild big Breakin period and it's really going to be popular with a lot of marathon runners regardless of their ability so is it recommended definitely I recommend you check out my full Nike lineup video we link to that video which is going to be up here next if you want to check out my whole Melborne Marathon video that video is down here where I use this very shoe to run in so that's it guys I'm off to get some more training miles done let me know your thoughts on the alphafly version 3 keep on working hard keep done we'll see you very soon in the next one\n\nFrom video 'On Cloudboom Strike LS vs Nike Alphafly 3: Which carbon plate racer comes out on top?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike alphafly 3 and the on cloud boom strike [Music] LS so the alphafly 3 and the cloud boom strike LS version I think are two of the best common plate racing shoes available at the moment they're certainly two of the most expensive Caron PL Racing shoes at the moment the alpha flight is £285 or $285 the cloud boom strike LS is £330 or $330 the on is the lighter shoe it's 1992 G or 6.8 o whereas the Ally 3 is220 G or 7.7 o got an 8 mm drop with the alphafly and then a 4mm drop with the on so when it comes to the design of the cloud boom strike LS that light spray upper is certainly the most kind of eye-catching part of it you've got this one piece sock upper that's attached by a machine to the midsole unit on the shoe this light spray upper is the reason it's such a lightwe shoe compared even to the normal Cloud boom strike and I found it a really good fit as well which we'll come on to later in the video you've got a Helen HF midsole which is a PE based foam it's On's you know best foam they're super foam and in between two layers of that is a carbon speedboard or carbon plate then you've got a rubber out sole with good coverage on the forefoot and the heel there there's no big midsole cutout on the arm which is a bit surprising because it is such a lightweight shoe that big cutout is kind of becoming a PA of the course with carbon shoes to try and reduce the weight certainly got a big one on the Ally 3 there which shows off the carbon plate in the middle of the shoe that carbon plate is sandwiched by two layers of Zoom XOne as you'd expect with any Nike racing shoe it's That Bouncy peber based foam and you've got an airom pod in the forefoot of the shoe as well to add a slightly more responsive feel in that part of the midsole top of that mids soole we've got an atom knit 3.0 upper with a little bit of padding around the heel it's a pretty lightweight upper around itself but certainly nothing like the one on the on you've got more padding at the back of the Nike in particular you got a far shot rubber out sole good for foot coverage bit of rubber at the heel as well it's been pretty durable for me and the grip has been okay like I say you've got that big manell cut out there to bring the weight down a little bit [Music] so when it comes to the fit of the two shoes I've got a uk9 in both of them which is a US 10 in the Nike a US 9.5 in the on that's the size I generally use with both of these Brands I've used across all of Nike's Racing shoes and the Ally 3 fits me really well got no concerns of it at all you've got a nice snug hold from that atom knit upper that you creates a comfortable feel but also one that keeps the foot locked down on Fast runs and there's a nice heel design on the AL fly 3 as well sometimes Nike puts a little thin strip of padding around the back of the shoe like on the vapor fly 3 and that does tend to irritate my kiles sometimes so haven't had any of those problems with the alpha fly 3E just a good secure hold obviously the fit of the on cloud strike L is pretty interesting I've had no concerns with it at all actually it's worked really well for me my foot is held in place well I've got enough room without having any kind of feeling of looseness or worry about it hasn't stretched at all after 150k this upper either and general it just creates a really nice Barely There feel on the foot that you know it's great for racing because you have got enough security enough lock down there I have anyway and I've got quite a narrow foot and I haven't found that I've got too much room in this upper at all so it is a riskier fit with the on because you know if it doesn't work for you you can't adjust it with the laces or anything like that as you can with the Nike but it does fit really well for me and I've had no problems with it so far so do like the fit of the cloud Striker less the upper has really worked for me but it's probably one that'll divide opinion a bit more than the more standard atom knit upper on the [Music] Nike onto the run test then and as I said at the start these are two of my favorite carbon plate racing shoes available at the moment I've done over 150k of running in both of these shoes and raced in both of them two or three times and I think they're the best carbon plate racing shoes their brands have ever made now I don't think I'll get much disagreement about that when it comes to the on Tu because you on hasn't had a great record in making carbon shoes and I think the cloud boom strike or less is a big step forward than what they've had before along with the standard Cloud boom strike which is just a little bit heavier obiously with Nike I think you get a lot more disagreement a lot of people really like the outfly 1 and probably still prefer it to this shoe and the vfly 2 and the original vfly next perent also very popular shoes but I like the outfly 3 more than all of those shoes I really like the new continuous midsole design you get on the shoe which just creates a smoother and faster transition to me as a heel Striker find that I get that nice level of propulsion from the big stack of zumax foam in the shoe but I get pushed onto the pods more directly and more effectively with the alply 3 and get you a really nice responsive toe off as a result Ally has always been positioned more as a marathon shoe and you've got the extra cushioning here compared to the VAP fly even though they have quite similar stack ites does feel like a more cushion shoe a more springy shoe and a lot more like zoomx foam under fot with giving you that kind of squishy ride feel that you expect from a Nike racing shoe but now I think it just turns over that a little bit more quickly and has a almost vaporfly Edge to it while still retaining those kind of alpha fly properties so last year I raced a couple of 10ks 5K in it I did like a few long runs during marathon training in it as well I did my 10K PB actually last year in the Ally 3 and although that was on a friendly course with a big downhill segment in the middle I think it does show that it is now very much an all distance racing shoe I think in the past was positioned more as a marathon shoe obviously definitely has the chops of the marathon given the world records that have being set in this shoe and I think it's excels in particular over those longer distances because of the extra kind of comfort you have here but it's lighter than past Alpha flies you've got that snappier transition and I think it's just you know a great racing Sho for any distance I think that's all true of the on cloud Striker less as well they probably have a few more reservations about it as a marathon racer I do think it'll be an excellent Marathon shoe but maybe some would want a slightly higher level of protection but it was a big surprise to me this shoe like obviously the upper attracts a lot of attention which has worked very well for me as I mentioned in the fit section but really it's the upgrad and midsole you get here compared to past on shoes that make this you know a special and impressive racing shoe it's not as soft as the out don't get as much sinking and squish for sure but you've got a really Lightning Fast turnover and really respons it feel off the toes and I do think there is enough cushioning and comfort there as well you know you got big stack of foam here it isn't as soft as the Nike but it is still you know nice and comfortable Under Foot I have raced a half marathon in the oncloud beam Striker L which would probably be my best half marathon ever if they didn't get the course slightly wrong near the end so it ended up being you know not a correct distance but I really liked how it felt in that race just it just it was very easy to keep turning my feet over in the second half and maintaining a fast pace you got a really fluid ride with a nice bit of punch off the toes and although you're not getting that big sinking and dramatic bounce that you get from the alply you are getting a lot of response from that phone for sure however I do think you get more comfort from the alide which I've done you know 20 M run in the on by the end of the half marathon thought this is great it's done very well for me here would I take it to full Marathon I think I probably would but I wouldn't necessarily be as confident in doing so as I would with the Ally 3 obviously the on cloud and strike lessers has some very impressive results in the marathon with unsponsored athletes but I think maybe for the the general Runner crowd not the elites the extra cush you get from the AL line might come into play a little bit as you hit that longer distance so I did do a short run in both shoes at the same time just to kind of gauge those differences directly and you definitely get a lot more Squish and bounce from the alphafly you know it's got that very noticeable ride all around you know partly because it's a much louder shoe you got that classic alphafly Slappy sound with the Nike Ally 3 which you don't get with the on but you do you know if you are thinking about Super Shoes and you think that you expect that really big dramatic sink in and punch from the plate and the foam coming out again do get that with the alply more so than the on which you really feel the fast turnover in though like it really feels like a very effective and fast shoe you're just kind of skipping along the ground you know getting that pace back from the midell foam and the plate in there but you don't get such a noce feeling as you do with the alpha fly which has that squishier feeling especially landing at the hill then pushing forward onto that firmer forefoot which then really you know punches you along so yeah this a different ride feel for sure but a very fast one in both and the on just feel that little bit more Nimble and lightweight you know because it is that little bit more Nimble and [Music] lightweight it comes to the verdict I do think this is pretty tight and that's very much something I wouldn't have said in the past about when I was comparing an on carbon shoe and a Nike racing shoe and it's not because Nike's Racing shoes have got worse it's because I have really Come Out Swinging with the cloud beam strike and really you know released a top tier carbon racer in my opinion the on is that a little bit lighter and it does remind me of the metas speed Sky Paris from aex which is my favorite overall rating shoe at the moment but I think it's a touch firmer than that shoe and I'm not sure it's quite as explosive and there are certainly some big advantages to the Nike you know when you're looking at comparing these two shoes one is the price which is obviously very surprising it's very rare that you can say the alply is a cheaper shoe in any comparison but it is a fair bit cheaper the fit is just going to work for more people probably I think just off the peg because you've got this adjustable upper with laces which just makes it a bit of a safer Choice compared to the on I really like the upper on the oncloud and Striker less but it is a slightly riskier fit and I think the extra cushioning you get from the alphafly I think if you're looking at marathons in particular this is the shoe I'd get I think it's the more risk-free Marathon option I think it's going to perform incredibly well in a race of that distance Theon I think will do as well for lots of people but you got that slightly more cushion feel with the alply more protective feel whilst not really losing any Pace at all because of the way the foam rebounds and really gives you all that energy back and then given the fact that I do think the ALF is a fantastic short distance racer as well I think overall I would give it the win in this versus especially I pick out of these two but like I said they're both fantastic shoes and if you prefer a slightly more direct and lightweight feel in your racing shoe then the cloud beam Striker Al L definitely provides that whereas with the Nike Al 3 you get more of that classic Super Shoe feel of the big bouncy midsole and loads of kind of protection was also having bags of pace and what is actually still you know a very lightweight package [Music] itself as a comparison of the AL 3 and the on cloud boom Striker less let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'Nike Zoom Fly 6 vs Hoka Mach X2: Which super-trainer comes out on top?':\n\nhello and welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and in this video I'm going to be comparing the Hoka Mac X2 and the Nike zoomfly [Music] 6 so the Mac X2 and zoomfly 6 are both plated training shoes that are designed to be used either in partnership with a carbon plate racing shoe or as racing SLT trining shoes themselves both these models are significant improvements on the previous versions of the shoe in my opinion and both are very much among my favorite shoes of the year but then both in my top five running shoes of 2024 because I've really enjoyed spending a lot of time in both of these shoes but there are certainly differences between them that might make them suitable to different Runners the zoomfly cost £155 in the UK $17 in the US the Mac X2 is a little bit more expensive it's £170 in the UK and then $190 in the US Mac X2 is a slightly lighter shoe at 255 G or 9 oz in uk9 whereas a zoom fly is 266 G or 9.\n\nUser Question: nike alphafly 3\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context above."}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.7}}

welcome to the Run testers my name is Nick and in this video I'm going to be comparing the Hoka Mac X2 and the Nike zoomfly [Music] 6 so the Mac X2 and zoomfly 6 are both plated training shoes that are designed to be used either in partnership with a carbon plate racing shoe or as racing SLT trining shoes themselves both these models are significant improvements on the previous versions of the shoe in my opinion and both are very much among my favorite shoes of the year but then both in my top five running shoes of 2024 because I've really enjoyed spending a lot of time in both of these shoes but there are certainly differences between them that might make them suitable to different Runners the zoomfly cost £155 in the UK $17 in the US the Mac X2 is a little bit more expensive it's £170 in the UK and then $190 in the US Mac X2 is a slightly lighter shoe at 255 G or 9 oz in uk9 whereas a zoom fly is 266 G or 9.\n\nFrom video 'On Cloudboom Strike LS vs Nike Alphafly 3: Which carbon plate racer comes out on top?':\n\nhello welcome to run testers my name is Nick in this video I'm going to be comparing the Nike alphafly 3 and the on cloud boom strike [Music] LS so the alphafly 3 and the cloud boom strike LS version I think are two of the best common plate racing shoes available at the moment they're certainly two of the most expensive Caron PL Racing shoes at the moment the alpha flight is £285 or $285 the cloud boom strike LS is £330 or $330 the on is the lighter shoe it's 1992 G or 6.8 o whereas the Ally 3 is220 G or 7.7 o got an 8 mm drop with the alphafly and then a 4mm drop with the on so when it comes to the design of the cloud boom strike LS that light spray upper is certainly the most kind of eye-catching part of it you've got this one piece sock upper that's attached by a machine to the midsole unit on the shoe this light spray upper is the reason it's such a lightwe shoe compared even to the normal Cloud boom strike and I found it a really good fit as well which we'll come on to later in the video you've got a Helen HF midsole which is a PE based foam it's On's you know best foam they're super foam and in between two layers of that is a carbon speedboard or carbon plate then you've got a rubber out sole with good coverage on the forefoot and the heel there there's no big midsole cutout on the arm which is a bit surprising because it is such a lightweight shoe that big cutout is kind of becoming a PA of the course with carbon shoes to try and reduce the weight certainly got a big one on the Ally 3 there which shows off the carbon plate in the middle of the shoe that carbon plate is sandwiched by two layers of Zoom XOne as you'd expect with any Nike racing shoe it's That Bouncy peber based foam and you've got an airom pod in the forefoot of the shoe as well to add a slightly more responsive feel in that part of the midsole top of that mids soole we've got an atom knit 3.0 upper with a little bit of padding around the heel it's a pretty lightweight upper around itself but certainly nothing like the one on the on you've got more padding at the back of the Nike in particular you got a far shot rubber out sole good for foot coverage bit of rubber at the heel as well it's been pretty durable for me and the grip has been okay like I say you've got that big manell cut out there to bring the weight down a little bit [Music] so when it comes to the fit of the two shoes I've got a uk9 in both of them which is a US 10 in the Nike a US 9.5 in the on that's the size I generally use with both of these Brands I've used across all of Nike's Racing shoes and the Ally 3 fits me really well got no concerns of it at all you've got a nice snug hold from that atom knit upper that you creates a comfortable feel but also one that keeps the foot locked down on Fast runs and there's a nice heel design on the AL fly 3 as well sometimes Nike puts a little thin strip of padding around the back of the shoe like on the vapor fly 3 and that does tend to irritate my kiles sometimes so haven't had any of those problems with the alpha fly 3E just a good secure hold obviously the fit of the on cloud strike L is pretty interesting I've had no concerns with it at all actually it's worked really well for me my foot is held in place well I've got enough room without having any kind of feeling of looseness or worry about it hasn't stretched at all after 150k this upper either and general it just creates a really nice Barely There feel on the foot that you know it's great for racing because you have got enough security enough lock down there I have anyway and I've got quite a narrow foot and I haven't found that I've got too much room in this upper at all so it is a riskier fit with the on because you know if it doesn't work for you you can't adjust it with the laces or anything like that as you can with the Nike but it does fit really well for me and I've had no problems with it so far so do like the fit of the cloud Striker less the upper has really worked for me but it's probably one that'll divide opinion a bit more than the more standard atom knit upper on the [Music] Nike onto the run test then and as I said at the start these are two of my favorite carbon plate racing shoes available at the moment I've done over 150k of running in both of these shoes and raced in both of them two or three times and I think they're the best carbon plate racing shoes their brands have ever made now I don't think I'll get much disagreement about that when it comes to the on Tu because you on hasn't had a great record in making carbon shoes and I think the cloud boom strike or less is a big step forward than what they've had before along with the standard Cloud boom strike which is just a little bit heavier obiously with Nike I think you get a lot more disagreement a lot of people really like the outfly 1 and probably still prefer it to this shoe and the vfly 2 and the original vfly next perent also very popular shoes but I like the outfly 3 more than all of those shoes I really like the new continuous midsole design you get on the shoe which just creates a smoother and faster transition to me as a heel Striker find that I get that nice level of propulsion from the big stack of zumax foam in the shoe but I get pushed onto the pods more directly and more effectively with the alply 3 and get you a really nice responsive toe off as a result Ally has always been positioned more as a marathon shoe and you've got the extra cushioning here compared to the VAP fly even though they have quite similar stack ites does feel like a more cushion shoe a more springy shoe and a lot more like zoomx foam under fot with giving you that kind of squishy ride feel that you expect from a Nike racing shoe but now I think it just turns over that a little bit more quickly and has a almost vaporfly Edge to it while still retaining those kind of alpha fly properties so last year I raced a couple of 10ks 5K in it I did like a few long runs during marathon training in it as well I did my 10K PB actually last year in the Ally 3 and although that was on a friendly course with a big downhill segment in the middle I think it does show that it is now very much an all distance racing shoe I think in the past was positioned more as a marathon shoe obviously definitely has the chops of the marathon given the world records that have being set in this shoe and I think it's excels in particular over those longer distances because of the extra kind of comfort you have here but it's lighter than past Alpha flies you've got that snappier transition and I think it's just you know a great racing Sho for any distance I think that's all true of the on cloud Striker less as well they probably have a few more reservations about it as a marathon racer I do think it'll be an excellent Marathon shoe but maybe some would want a slightly higher level of protection but it was a big surprise to me this shoe like obviously the upper attracts a lot of attention which has worked very well for me as I mentioned in the fit section but really it's the upgrad and midsole you get here compared to past on shoes that make this you know a special and impressive racing shoe it's not as soft as the out don't get as much sinking and squish for sure but you've got a really Lightning Fast turnover and really respons it feel off the toes and I do think there is enough cushioning and comfort there as well you know you got big stack of foam here it isn't as soft as the Nike but it is still you know nice and comfortable Under Foot I have raced a half marathon in the oncloud beam Striker L which would probably be my best half marathon ever if they didn't get the course slightly wrong near the end so it ended up being you know not a correct distance but I really liked how it felt in that race just it just it was very easy to keep turning my feet over in the second half and maintaining a fast pace you got a really fluid ride with a nice bit of punch off the toes and although you're not getting that big sinking and dramatic bounce that you get from the alply you are getting a lot of response from that phone for sure however I do think you get more comfort from the alide which I've done you know 20 M run in the on by the end of the half marathon thought this is great it's done very well for me here would I take it to full Marathon I think I probably would but I wouldn't necessarily be as confident in doing so as I would with the Ally 3 obviously the on cloud and strike lessers has some very impressive results in the marathon with unsponsored athletes but I think maybe for the the general Runner crowd not the elites the extra cush you get from the AL line might come into play a little bit as you hit that longer distance so I did do a short run in both shoes at the same time just to kind of gauge those differences directly and you definitely get a lot more Squish and bounce from the alphafly you know it's got that very noticeable ride all around you know partly because it's a much louder shoe you got that classic alphafly Slappy sound with the Nike Ally 3 which you don't get with the on but you do you know if you are thinking about Super Shoes and you think that you expect that really big dramatic sink in and punch from the plate and the foam coming out again do get that with the alply more so than the on which you really feel the fast turnover in though like it really feels like a very effective and fast shoe you're just kind of skipping along the ground you know getting that pace back from the midell foam and the plate in there but you don't get such a noce feeling as you do with the alpha fly which has that squishier feeling especially landing at the hill then pushing forward onto that firmer forefoot which then really you know punches you along so yeah this a different ride feel for sure but a very fast one in both and the on just feel that little bit more Nimble and lightweight you know because it is that little bit more Nimble and [Music] lightweight it comes to the verdict I do think this is pretty tight and that's very much something I wouldn't have said in the past about when I was comparing an on carbon shoe and a Nike racing shoe and it's not because Nike's Racing shoes have got worse it's because I have really Come Out Swinging with the cloud beam strike and really you know released a top tier carbon racer in my opinion the on is that a little bit lighter and it does remind me of the metas speed Sky Paris from aex which is my favorite overall rating shoe at the moment but I think it's a touch firmer than that shoe and I'm not sure it's quite as explosive and there are certainly some big advantages to the Nike you know when you're looking at comparing these two shoes one is the price which is obviously very surprising it's very rare that you can say the alply is a cheaper shoe in any comparison but it is a fair bit cheaper the fit is just going to work for more people probably I think just off the peg because you've got this adjustable upper with laces which just makes it a bit of a safer Choice compared to the on I really like the upper on the oncloud and Striker less but it is a slightly riskier fit and I think the extra cushioning you get from the alphafly I think if you're looking at marathons in particular this is the shoe I'd get I think it's the more risk-free Marathon option I think it's going to perform incredibly well in a race of that distance Theon I think will do as well for lots of people but you got that slightly more cushion feel with the alply more protective feel whilst not really losing any Pace at all because of the way the foam rebounds and really gives you all that energy back and then given the fact that I do think the ALF is a fantastic short distance racer as well I think overall I would give it the win in this versus especially I pick out of these two but like I said they're both fantastic shoes and if you prefer a slightly more direct and lightweight feel in your racing shoe then the cloud beam Striker Al L definitely provides that whereas with the Nike Al 3 you get more of that classic Super Shoe feel of the big bouncy midsole and loads of kind of protection was also having bags of pace and what is actually still you know a very lightweight package [Music] itself as a comparison of the AL 3 and the on cloud boom Striker less let us know what you think in the comments below please do like and subscribe ring the little bell and we'll see you next time\n\nFrom video 'THE SURPRISING TRUTH - Nike Alphafly 3 After 200 Miles Review':\n\nI purchased the alphafly 3 back at the start of the year and I've put many hundreds of training miles and also a couple of races through the shoe as well so I thought it was time to sit down and give you my completely unbiased thoughts on the shoe and to see how well they are holding up after all of those Mars I've done 200 training and racing Mars in this prototype colorway here and I've also done one marathon in Berlin in this shoe here we're going to be answering those all important questions today how long are these shoes holding up what the phone feeling like after 200 miles and can the Everyday Athlete really benefit from a shoe like this or is it just for those Elites because as you'll have seen the world records for the women's and the men's Marathon are now being broken in Chicago with the alphafly version 3 right let's get stuck in the review first thing we're going to chat about the differences between the alphafly 3 and the alphafly version 2 so when Nike launched alphafly version 3 it came with a completely new redesign there was a big weight decrease as well for me it was 30 G lighter in my UK size 12 the arch on the inside is a lot less pronounced version two people are getting some big hot spot issues in here and some soreness on that inside of the arch that is a lot lot better now and now you've got this lovely continuous midsole which just makes it so much smoother through the foot strike and you've got a little bit of a wider carbon plate for some extra stability in there as well well let's get stuck into all of the facts and figures so the purpose of a shoe like the alphafly version 3 this is a road racing Super Shoe that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines price-wise this shoe sent me back a staggering £285 we'll put it up with the other currencies up on the screen now stack cut at the back 40 mm right at that legal limit we've got 8 mm drop over all this is coming in for me at 269 G for me in my UK size 12 so nice and light that's what we like to see this is a neutral shoe and it has this lovely atomknit upper super breathable get some fantastic air flow in that as you start to pick up the pace midso we're talking Nike's Flagship zoomx midso with two Air Zoom Pods at the bottom of the shoe here to give you that extra propulsion we've got a ful length carbon plate running throughout the shoe with the outsole of the shoe we've got a lot of rubber up at the front here to give you some really good grip mainly for your Forefront and midfoot Strikers rear foot Strikers going to be a little less grip there's nothing there at the back of the shoe just some very small rubber units here there are no different widths available there are men's and women's different fits and this shoe was true to size for me right let's get stuck into my likes my first like with the Ally is the super smooth ride with this updated midsole you're getting a lovely buttery smooth transition through the foot strike there it's a lot less Slappy than version one and two because cuz it had that sort of bit missing in the center of the shoe there the lightweightness of this shoe you really notice that as well when you're going from version two to version three if you're a heel Striker this is going to be a lot smoother through that whole foot strike compared to version one and version two my second like with the shoe is just so comfortable at all Paces previous version of the alphafly they were just so clumpy at those slower Paces when you're warming up and easy pace and now this is comfortable at all Paces this new breathable upper is fantastic that sock like feel really good lockdown in the shoe as well I've had no issues with any blisters hot spots anything uncomfortable even at the back end of the marathons when I've been racing the shoe absolutely comfortable from right from the start the middle and all the way to the end previously I've always reverted back to vaporfly version 3 cuz it was just way more comfortable but with this update here this is now a little bit faster than vaporfly for me and with that Comfort aspect of as well it's the one I've been reaching for for my races my third like with this shoe is the surprising that what I've called this video is the surprising truth the durability has been really good this shoe has now done 200 miles in it a lot of training miles getting ready for Berlin and then I raised Melbourne in the shoe I did actually get a new pair for Berlin cuz I was like oh they say it wasn't going to last very long I better get a new pair but I actually went faster in Melbourne with my old slightly more bashed up pair that a lot of Manufacturers would say has passed its better days but for me I had a fantastic run in Melbourne it really has held up really really well I like a lot of people get frustrated by manufacturers saying these Super Shoes are only going to last 100 miles of perfect running and then after that you need to Trop and change them in reality I really don't think that's true if you're an elite athlete you've got unlimited amount of shoes to choose from Yes it probably is going to make that like .05 little bit of difference right guys out here on the ten path got a speed session to 7 by 3 minutes getting ready for Valencia on my left foot I've got my 200 mile pair of Al 3es on my right the Nearly New Pair just done at 26 miles of Berlin marathon and that just want to see how they feel how they compare how that Popp that springiness that bounce and see what it's like between the two shoes have they lost it are they now dead do they need to be retired I don't think so I think they still feel fantastic but going to go through these three minute reps here and see how they feel going to be doing these around 10K to half marathon pace [Music] it's really hard to tell the difference there is a slight difference the good the newer pair feel a little bit more stable the airpods just have a little bit more life left in them they haven't been compressed and crunch quite as much as's the pair on the left but really very very marginal I think most people could easy Run 3 to 400 training and racing mares in their shoe absolutely fine wear wise on the bottom of the shoe I've just got a little bit of wear on the outso here where I land and then I sort of roll inwards through the foot strike there it's a little bit worn down at the front here but what's important with these shoes is how the foam feels how that's holding up and I really feel there's so much life left in this shoe and we carry on getting ready for Valencia by doing a lot of training Mars in their shoe it's far from done and then my fourth like with this shoe is just how stable this shoe is for a maximum stack height shoe that super wide carbon fiber plate you've got in their shoe just feel really confident when I'm cornering and things like that when I was in a couple of these races we had to do some 180 turn backs I just felt super confident going to that didn't really enter my mind that I might roll an ankle or something like that which you can sometimes get with these Max stack height shoes the grip is much improved on this shoe I haven't run in the rain in this shoe yet been very lucky mainly training in the summer but when you go through some Aid stations and things like that where there's water bottles and stuff all over the road when I was going through that the grip felt super good when the roads did get a little bit wet but as always on the channel here I want to give you that completely honest review so there are a few dis likes and let's get stuck into those now the first dislike with the shoe is it still just a little bit noisy nowhere near as Slappy as the older shoes I'll put up a little bit of footage now this is Midway through the Melborne marathon in a really quiet section and you can just hear how loud this shoe is when you run along for some people they don't like the amount of noise that these shoes can make not as bad as the old one but it's still a bit noisy my second dislike is it's still a little bit on the narrow side through the midf foot it's been absolutely fine for me I did have a few issues with the earlier shoes and it's much improved through the midot Section here but it's still just a little bit on the narrow side and you do notice that and then obviously price has to come into it in the UK this is nearly £300 but with how well the shoe is holding up as I say you're getting some good value here and I think if you spent some time on some lights like Vinted or Ebay you could probably pick up a used pair for not a lot of money and have many happy training miles in this if a pair's only done 100 miles or something you can pick that up and it's going to feel absolutely fantastic so what about a rotation what can I pair this up with well if you want to stick with an Nike range something like the Vero 17 or the Pegasus Plus for your everyday runs and then use this shoe here for your key workouts and races if you got a bit more cash to spend you want a three shoe rotation it's a bit of a debate whether to get something like the vaporfly 3 which is a little bit lighter a little bit snappier and it could be a good option for some faster speed work at those 5K and 10K page that's when I'd probably like to whip out the vapor 53 if I was doing a 5k or 10k race it's just a little bit as I say a little bit lighter and snappier type of shoe there be still really good in this but this is really that marathon and half marathon Cruiser is where this shoe absolutely shines or potentially you could dial up your recovery runs with something like the Invincible version 4 is launching very soon I'm kind of checking the Nike website every day for when it's dropping so get subscribed to that we'll get it in and we'll give you that review right conclusions and Final thoughts obviously I've really enjoyed running this shoe it's been fantastic but who is this shoe for and I think because this shoe is so smooth so comfortable but not overly aggressive it really does mean a more intermediate Runner can benefit from a shoe like this so many carbon shoes out there are so stiff and so firm you have to have that like Elite level leg strength to get the most out of the shoe but for me that hasn't being the case here I feel a lot of people can benefit from a shoe like this there's no Bild big Breakin period and it's really going to be popular with a lot of marathon runners regardless of their ability so is it recommended definitely I recommend you check out my full Nike lineup video we link to that video which is going to be up here next if you want to check out my whole Melborne Marathon video that video is down here where I use this very shoe to run in so that's it guys I'm off to get some more training miles done let me know your thoughts on the alphafly version 3 keep on working hard keep done we'll see you very soon in the next one\n\nUser Question: nike alphafly\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the

X2 tested':\n\ngood morning from Paris I am here to race the hoker city center Paris 10K heading down to start line shortly we've got the whole race is right in the Heart of the City really winding around some of the most Central parts of Paris which be very interesting it's quite a twisty course so it might not necessarily be the fastest but it should be very fun and it should be you know a really good chance to see a bit of Paris while it's running hard I had a pretty big week of marathon training with Valencia two weeks away so going to go out run as fast as I can no real expectations on time but hoping to put in a for half decent performance have a bit of fun I am testing a few bits out as always so I've got on my feet the hoker rocket X2 been a long time since I racing these shoes I've used them for some hard training runs recently and obiously they came out last year now so thought it' be the fun to put those on again as the races with hoker and try out you know what is still probably the carbon shoe I'd recommend most from their range just cuz cell X1 as much as I love it is quite a big heavy shoe and this is a bit more lightweight and racy and then on the watch front I've got the new coros Pace Pro which I am putting up against the Garment 4 a 265 the big new mid-range battle we have of AMOLED watches so going to be testing those both on what will be a very tricky course for GPS twisting around right in the Heart of the City Center and I will have the 4 a 965 in a pocket linked to a polar VAR sensor heart rate monitor so I can look at the heart rate readings on the watches as well so yeah a few to test looking forward to the race should be good fun good hit out two weeks will Valencia see where the legs are at they're quite tired is my guess but I'm hoping to have a good run and it should be really fun so all done I that went really well in the end I think I ran something like 3225 30 30 something like that like faster than I expected just first half was great controlled running on field trying not to slip over it was very wet today and um and I went through I think in around 1615 and then I thought oh I can I can give it a go here I felt quite good and I think I ran second half in not too far over 16 so I'm not sure the exact time will be but is probably my second fastest 10k so I'm very pleased cuz obviously pretty tired legs marathon training it's a pretty twisty course it was wet so it rained on the way to the course there a lot of cobbles in the first half and I'll say the poker rocket X2 as fast and great as they were today they are not the best at gripping on that kind of surface so I have to be quite careful I don't tend to slip very much because I have such a short stride but yeah it looks a bit dodgy at times so that was a bit risky and the course was really cool though it was like you're right in the center of Paris you're just winding around you're seeing lots of cool stuff quite a lot of good Runners out today so I was able to run with people the whole way pretty much and really long home straight which is kind of good and bad it's um it's just demoralizing in the first kind of like 45 seconds of a straight like that you don't look like you're getting any closer but then start to pick it up felt nice and good and um yeah delighted with that time if it is around there I'll be really pleased with that it's probably my like I say second fastest 10k fastest was recently in the river Nest 10K which has a nice downhill stretch in it which you don't get here so yeah good run around watches it's a hard course to watches so I think even probably from about second or third okay they were you know I was a few probably 50 m ahead on GPS that kind of things they were beeping early before the lap markers but not too bad overall results so I'll have a look at them in a minute and then go back and look at the GPS Trace later wasn't really using the watch as much today cuz it was it was meant to be just you know like a nice relaxing hit out kind of thing nice and controlled rocket X2 like yeah it's a shoe I've come back to a few times recently underrated a little bit probably CU it is light it's fast it's doesn't have the bouncy feeling of some of the shoes I like and I think the problem I have with it generally is that like it feels it does a similar job for me in being a lightweight pretty firm but you know responsive shoe similar to the aex Mets P like Sky Paris which I always bang on about my favorite shoe and that's just a fair bit lighter so but yeah I ran really well today and really enjoyed the shoe everything felt in good working order for Valencia put it that way but I'll go back and check heart rate and GPS on the watches I think they're both I think the choros was actually closer to the lap markers for sure than the Garmin so throughout the race that was probably the one that was definitely close then gin ended up probably 100 me further over 10K than the chorus but on try course it's hard to exactly know but all around really enjoy myself it's quite cold now I'm going to go warm up and we go from [Music] there so just back at the hotel now couple of hours after the race uh still very pleased really delighted of how that went all around like just didn't have too many expectations heading into today was careful and trying to be nice and conservative and actually was just running fast and I thought I'd be the whole way and you know picked up pretty well in the second half there I think I ran a negative split uh something like I think I think I was about 1615 1616 at the halfway mark and then did around 16 you know1 or so in the second half so yeah really pleased with that all around massive confidence boost head of Valencia in a couple of weeks to be running that kind of pace on a pretty big week all good on that front and really yeah did enjoy the race like it is a twisty course but it was probably a bit quicker than I expected there were only a couple of real dead turnarounds and the rest of the time there were some decent long straights there were lots of fast Runners there today so was able to run in pretty good groups and all that I think I was finished 11th in the end uh again very pleased with that as well picking up people in the second half I think I did quite well in moving through the field there it was probably less the course and more the slippery conditions that made it a little bit slower I think in the first half there where it was lots of Cobble stuff like I say which is just not great in Super Shoes if you're on um slippery cobal they just none of them grip that well I'd say some do better than this hoker though which is not got that like I say the best grip but performance of the shoe yeah can't really argue with it like the rocket X2 read has put H you in line with most Super Shoes out there now I think after a few years it was only kind of one or two big players now most brands have very good Super Shoes and you're kind of picking between them more on personal preference rather than anything rocket X2 is certainly really strong option I do think it is the faster shoe from hoker if you're looking between the cell and the rocket X2 like I love the cell I've done more miles in the cell than any other shoe this year I think and just using it for lots of Long training runs I have racing it as well but it's big it's bouncy but you just got a little bit more kind of rev from the rocket X2 it's lighter it feels racer and especially someone like myself I'm like a high Cadence Runner I probably don't put get as much Bounce from the Yow as some people so I prefer the lighter feel of the rocket X2 which just gives you that faster turnover and that get slightly more you fast feel especially over something like a 10K uh so yeah enjoyed that just been checking out the GPS tracks from the watches and the heart rate I do the heart rate first both do kind of okay both were kind of out by a similar amount in different directions the 4265 was quite low for lots of the race it looks like on the heart rate and then the choros pce pro a good stretch where it was in line with the heart rate monitor but then did jump quite high at the end had a little jump at the beginning really cold conditions It's just tough for optical heart rate monitoring like I would always prefer to use an armband or a chest sensor myself you see the nice steady progression in heart rate you get from that the polar sense which just a little bit more accurate but both watches were kind of okay they were you ballpark okay some dives off the Garmin and yeah like I said the big jump on the corus at the start and at the end but overall they were kind of fine I think the averages isn't that far out from overall average and they probably performed fairly similar to each other I think probably the page Pro slightly more accurate in the middle there but overall yeah similar performance on those front and then on the GPS like it's interesting that they are quite different so the choros was closer to distance of 10K you know that's good I think that you know wins out on that front for sure because I wasn't running very tight lines I was running a bit further than 10K I think that's probably the more accurate overall distance from choros there and it was certainly closer to the markers each kilometer than the Gin throughout the race look at the actual track though I don't know where Garmin has picked up so much more than the corus they do look pretty similar throughout the race like both of them have little wobbles where they go quite wide outside of a street and the Finish Line they each have you on different sides of the roads entirely which is interesting because I don't think that fairly open bit of the course so I thought they'd be quite accurate there but then they really dial in on Long stretches where clearly the GPS conditions were a bit better but for a city center race I would say pretty impressive GPS from both those watches like was following the right areas most of the time was on the road not running through too many buildings and it just looks you given the twisty nature of the course in amongst high buildings I think they both did a pretty good job overall distance corus was closer and it was certainly better for pacing I wasn't really pacing with the watching the race I will say that so although I did notice you know every lap split and then looking at the markers and seeing how close they were they were both obviously coming up a bit before the marker came around because they end up with reading a bit long but if I was going to be pacing using the watch the chorus would have be more accurate on the day between the two of them so that's a win for the chorus as well so i' say overall and accuracy they're both pretty similar but you got to give the aage to the chorus I'd say on both of those fronts uh in that race I think the heart rate was a little bit more dialed in for the middle part of the race in particular and then the overall distance and pacing the GPS was probably slightly better as well but both performed really very well I think on the accuracy front now like this mult this mid-range band of watches is kind of my favorite band of watches now we've also got the sunto races and the polar Vantage G3 where you're getting the accuracy that You' get from the top end watch is now and it's really whether you want the other features from most and watch is like the you know more rugged designs or the maps which you don't get on the Garmin but you do actually get on the coros that was interesting and it was useful for me while I was here in Paris my first run in the city I did a long run using the navigation on both watches Maps was certainly A Plus on the pace Pro here so it's had a good weekend around it's also doing very well on battery life that was the other thing so I because this was a weekend away both of these AMOLED watches it's interesting to see if they could last the full weekend away and both of them have done but the chus has lasted longer on batter life i' would say so I charged these fully on Thursday afternoon I came over Friday morning did a long run and then ran on Saturday as well have done the race now and the choros is at 58% so very good really you know looking at that kind of period like it was you know over an hour and a half of running on Friday know the hour Rod yesterday and today and the Garmin has dropped to 29% so big disparity on the battery life there so the pace bro if you're looking at kind of an AMOLED watch you go for a weekend away without taking a charger doing a lot of running it would have the edge like it was only a 10K today I was looking at something like a half marathon start to be thinking about having to charge the Garment potentially but you know it would be fine until tomorrow but yeah I'm going back today if I was going back on Monday then the extra bat life from the choros would certainly been a bit of a boon so all around a good weekend for the coros pace Pro when looking at it in comparison to the uh the biggest name in that mid-range watchfield which is the 496 265 but certainly some of other advantages to the 265 will go into in more detail when we get round to more of a comparison video but all around really enjoyable out really fun race massive field out there loads of people out there like really was quite a good atmosphere throughout the race spite the fact it was quite damp and cold at the start everyone having a good time surprisingly fast course I would say given that I thought it wasn't going to be very fast at all but you know it was quick enough I'd say you go and run hard on that like I said great atmosphere I had a really good time out there and delighted with my result on the day\n\nFrom video 'Racing in Europe Next + US Skyrunning Group Run Announcement':\n\nhere we go here we go here we go all right update Vlog we're racing again it's so exciting we're going back to Europe I got three events to talk to you about and it's been since reram all right over two years ago since I was able to lace it up get to a starting line in Europe all right so we'll get to uh Italy Northern Italy here in a minute but first three events we're going to talk about here we go um man well first of all as you know the Olympics are kicking off very soon but a another Global world event in the specifically in the running world is going to go down September 6th through the eth in soraa Spain all right so here in about five or six weeks in soraa Spain September 6th through the 8th 2024 the United States is sending a sky running team men and women to Spain to compete on a global scale all right against the best Mountain some of the best Mountain runners in the world like we're talking serious Mountain running you know Sky running is steep big mountains that's what it's known for so all right so I want to put that out there the vertical the sky Ultra which is 70 km and then the sky which is 37 km all right so there's a little more information on your screen I will not be there all right I'm not going to be in Spain but my brother along with the other athletes men and women from the United States are going to be flying over for the world skyr running championships which Le which leads me to this Thursday July 25th in Boulder Colorado group run I will be there and my brother at the lasportiva store in Boulder Colorado Thursday July 25th at 5:00 p.m.\n\nFrom video 'Racing the Italian Sun: A Mountain Runner's Journey in Italy':\n\n[Music] [Music] no [Music] Hi how are you good how are you thank you good good uh 30 Seth more okay okay no no no that's okay see what size for the T-shirt small small [Music] large all right round two round two today 21 km 5,000 ft of climbing all right I'm excited about that spread that vertical out a little bit more than yesterday and uh see if we can't wake these legs up in Italy all right keep turning that door or not keep having fun enjoy the process everything from getting the bib number to putting the putting the bib on your your singlet and uh you know chatting with Runners at the starting line so that's what uh that's what it's it's it's a good part of the racing experience is to soak in everything happening around you um so let's go get the shoes on all right got the socks got the shoes get a little warm up in [Music] he [Applause] he he [Music] you he [Applause] he [Music] [Applause] good job good [Music] job job this work woo nice work there you go nice sh looking good looking good [Music] [Music] [Music] h know [Applause] yes sh there it is fishing up fish is right there go go go you got it

appreciate it yeah it was cool to check it out doing a little filmingo man you got that other camera yeah [Music] the game [Music] Ro [Music] that doggle hunt in high school we used to say uh when there was an epic view my friends and I would say that dog will hunt yes it will oh man we made it to the dolomites and quick little recap I will do a bigger recap back in Colorado uh but hello I mean look at that that's pretty amazing let the Italian vacation begin for a couple days meaning running running up there tomorrow hopefully the legs will allow me to do it um quick recap I believe I was 23rd today obviously not the placing I might have hoped for definitely not but um huge learning experience Clarity out there on the trails for life and the future through uh running the tro Nazo 30° C it was toasty um it was just toasty there's no other way to say it but I did carry a handheld you saw that throughout the race um I did I it was good like I it was fast like there's no other way to say it the the European racing circuit is Fast and the mountains are no joke and the races start later in the morning compared to Colorado races and so it it just it was I think it was about 80° fahit by the end of the race at yeah about whatever 30° C is in Fahrenheit so Lessons Learned there but um at the end of the day you know running with Joseph exploring Italy getting up and seeking Beauty that's what it's all about so we'll I'll get you a much more detailed recap um because now we got to go find some dinner and it's just like man it's like it's man you ital Italy you guys do not mess around with your mountains oh my goodness I can't stop looking backwards so onward and upward that's a little update it was uh actually one second uh 4,400 ft of vertical gain uh hour 51 for the final time and again 13 miles so 21k spot on and oh all the race organizers all the volunteers out there you crushed it and the fans oh my goodness like the people cheering along the way it was amazing so so cool to uh share the culture of running cross borders you know what I mean it's like uh run what am I always saying like running is the most accessible sport I think on Earth you don't need a pool you don't need a uh lacrosse ball you don't need a tennis racket all you need are your two feet and you let a rip and so the fact that I was able to experience the Italian running culture um in CCO Italy which is it was it was amazing it was and remember one of my goals I know I'm rambling now but one of my goals was to run a European Mountain race for the last four or five years you know we had covid we had you know two babies born uh my injury year there's just been a lot a lot of things happening in the summertime and so I haven't been able to get over here so it's so great to finally be able to experience Italy and Europe and let it rip and even in the heat so on where we go we'll toss it to the mountain actually no we'll do the the racing playlist this will end up there and again once I'm back in Colorado I'll give you more details on both races yesterday's race and today's race oh man all right seek Beauty work hard and love each other\n\nUser Question: olympikus

E315':\n\nhey guys real quick before we start the show uh guess what's happening winter grit registration opens today when this podcast comes out Arctic Adventure yes and guess what really we're going back to if you remember winter grit from a couple years ago where we had that green beanie hat which was my favorite M went back to that style hat it's the same thing but I got it in a different color this time and then we're doing a A6 sweatshirt we're going to throw in some stickers it's going to going to be banging if you're actually listening for the first time and have no idea what the hell we're talking about much this is basically our winter distance challenge where we challenge you five different levels pick your own level run that mileage in the month of January be a part of an awesome community community and get awesome swag it's honestly probably the best thing going for you in the new year I mean I don't have any other things lined up so it keeps you running through the January but registration opens today at 9:00 a.m. which is Black Friday uh and it will sell out so if you do want to participate you need to go to believe inther run.com grit ASAP and that's 9:00 a.m. eastern time because it will sell out so get in yeah if you're on the west coast set that alarm yep all [Music] right hi there is Thomas with believe in the Run this is Robbie with believe in the run and this is Megan with believe in the Run Robbie I love the way your hat almost matches your pants it's a beautiful did you plan it or was it just like I I didn't really plan it what it really matches is your ver 18 teens it does we talk about pallette of the year or something yeah Pet's always a word that I have trouble spelling cuz you have a cleft pallet yeah you're an artist aren you like that should be one that you know I know and that's to get the Emoji I like had to keep retyping it there it is it's confusing cuz there's the wooden palette is spelled different than a color palette right that's dumb it should just be p a l e tte but it's not and then there's pallative care if someone's dying and that has an i and an a in it does so Pala of care means that you're going to go yeah I think it's like hospice pretty much but maybe a little bit longer isn't hospice like you got a couple weeks the Robbie I if I have to go to hospice or Pala of care I give you permission written note that you can smother me with a lagoon pillow okay wow wow I'll do that is that a is that an ad spot they're hoping not let me fill out a questionnaire to see Ryan let me fill out a questionnaire to see which one will smother you the fastest yeah we could do that I think hospice sounds like a nice actually it sounds like something you put on pumpkin pie little bit H I was going to say the exact same thing can we move on from this not really making his back um and pal well palad sounds like your Pal's hanging out with you just sounds both both sound good to it's like palr Ralphie's on UNP palatable yeah dude's got he's very ill diara oh really do we need to get a lugon pillow over here stat no sorry Ralphie roll roll of did he contract a little uh dog Co when he was at the kennel I don't know but we had a night last night oh up every couple hours yeah he didn't take his chair Bundy he didn't chair Bundy sleep I don't think chair Bundy helps with that the dog Co yeah okay we'll test it out later um yeah anyway this is our TR recap episode okay did let's just start off with the fact people you don't understand the running event one day is equivalent to a regular week yeah that's actually true here's how I know because my kids were asking me about these Pokémon cards that they had bought the day before we left the running event like they bought them online I was like they should be here today or tomorrow and it was like the next day I thought it was a week late I thought it had already been most of the week had passed and it was I think it's just we start early in the morning and then we have appointments that are like back to back to back until what 4:00 or was it 3:00 9 to 4 pretty much 4:30 and then there's get togethers afterward mhm where you you shoo and hang out it's act it's just actually a day that goes on forever like and there's just stuff the whole time actually I think Aaron our friend from Solomon described it well cuz she said one of her co-workers was going for the first time and she was like it's basically Las Vegas you're in this room where there's no windows you don't know what time it is I actually said that to someone and then they randomly just start shoving boo in your hands yeah and and they don't unfortunately there's no smoking sex there um but yeah they they have all that stuff time disappears or stays the same whatever yeah it's a basically in a casino yeah yeah except a lose except you're losing would I feel winning would I feel sorry for I I feel like no I'm just kidding but what I feel sorry for like our feet by the end of the day are trash because we've been walking around it's a cement floor for hours we're going place to place to place but I actually feel worse for the people that have to stand in the booth for that entire time like can you imagine having to stand there and you don't really go anywhere you're just kind of like yeah it's like you're in Guantanamo Bay getting you might as well add a waterboarding booth next to the pickle ball cords speaking of things that were missing that would be fun there's a staple of every running event that I've been to it's the uh untapped Maple ice cream wait before we go hard in the paint with TR okay I was not on the podcast last week oh yeah because the lovely team of Adidas invited me to the dream Retreat ladies for the ladies yeah sorry you guys weren't invited it's not like a P Diddy party or anything that's like something else yeah how much baby oil was there oh jeez there was Zero um they invited us there to try out the new Supernova rise 2 uhhuh which it turns out it's very similar to the Supernova rise one but it has a it has a nice new upper I still don't know what this super NOA is I I'm pretty sure we've reviewed it I've come to the retreat and we learn about the whole line it's a basic trainer okay it is all right um so yeah they took us out to this really nice um resort spa hotel what's it called I don't know how to pronounce it I think it might be maraval no it's m i r i v okay marival is that it it sounds like it okay I feel they were saying it differently I feel like there's place is just like to put a lot of consonants together and throw a couple vowels in and say it's a place it was pretty funny though because sa wait were you at maral Lago no this is right outside of Austin wait which one's marag like they're really trying to get those tffs taken off huh yeah right when when we checked in this was like um like a wellness Resort if you will Island I was going to say it earlier sorry they handed us a little like sleeping bag pillow for our phones as if we were going to put them away for the whole time it was a p didy party what are you kidding me no it was supposed I saw videos of him making people do that none of us use them okay okay but it's supposed to be like this I want to know the time out spot Robbie's watching P Diddy videos no I'm watching videos of him of things that happened do you know who didn't know anything about it I I told Megan no I knew about it you knew that something you wouldn't watch the videos if it came out there's oh dude I'm watching I would watch it 24/7 I'd watch the like if they had the real world P Diddy Mansion yeah I'm in yeah I mean God with with yeah but M didn't know half the stuff that was going on she was like uh yeah I guess I didn't do a deep dive on you were still doing his songs at karaoke thinking it was okay she thought she thought it was a lot of uh normal stuff going on there just maybe and I'm oh like he just had like stolen goods or something he just had too many drugs anyways all I'm going to let you talk I'm sorry Meg I it's okay it's I it's a Hot Topic I get it top of mind I'm talking about sleeping bag things for your phone which I didn't realize was triggering but apparently it is yeah anyway we had a lovely time there we we ran the shoe um Ashley Mato was there and so was Jen ader and which I told her I've been calling is it genor I've been calling her genitor forever and and she introduced herself and I was like just so you know I've said your last name wrong this entire time sounds like a Transformer something I gotta I gotta tell her Jor is so much cooler than jater that's no it actually does s it sounds like a Pokemon character really genitor yeah how many how many hit points do she have so it was lovely hanging out with them and meeting a bunch of people um your elevation on your runs were in insane yeah so it was an interesting spot for a run Retreat cuz there wasn't really anywhere to run there there's no way this is a run retreat was like a a quarter mile Trail is like half mile I think Max okay so we did some Loops um and it was up basically up on a big hill so there was quite a bit of elevation dud it was like three miles and it was like 500 ft of elevation so that's so they try to keep you from escaping is that the idea well they already took it already put her phone in a sleeping bag yeah okay uh we did some yoga we tested the shoes we learned about the whole Adidas lineup it was it was fun so do you do yoga in normal life no the last 15 minutes of the class I just laid on the I was going to say what do you how do you pretend to do that I I tried and then I gave up are you I and I should maybe know this but are you flexible no I am not okay cuz like that's the worst part about they started out with us like doing toe yoga and okay try lifting up your big toe and not all your other toes oh I did it it's really hard is that like that was like the beginning of our toe yoga session so is the idea that you're just concentrating on one toe like directing all your energy towards one toe I'm you know I don't know how this stuff works I was able to do this with the toe and this I don't I don't even know if I can move my toes I might be paralyzed yeah I I'm not sure what's happening it seems to be the whole foot that's basically what kept happening to me so that was why I ended up laying on the mat and taking a quick nap but it was lovely we did it um in front of an infinity pool overlooking Austin in its Glory so wow it's nice okay yeah it was a good time all right and then the boys arrived the boys arrived into the City and oh wait I thought you were talking about the party my bad I know we were still talking about the ddy party yeah shoot all right yeah so then me and you really want this to happen I thought I was doing now um so yeah the last week's podcast showed up uh yes and plus Jared and Taylor no Jared didn't come until later Taylor didn't getent you guys all showed up eventually we all assembled Megan featherston joined us as well and um yeah we kicked it off with a fun party with our friends at as6 and then we went straight into it yeah uh woke up Wednesday morning well I went for a run right when I we landed I said I need to get well basically I procrastinated Tuesday and yeah that was silly well but we usually run when we get there but I didn't realize how late we were getting there we didn't leave until like 11:30 well that's what I was saying I don't didn't realize how late we were getting there and so I did go on a run it was pretty nice Carl and I were so happy that we had already run though I like running when you get somewhere though it just I get it like the plane and stuff travel rust cobwebs in your mind and stuff anyway so your mind we did do the do a run and then did you run Wednesday morning I did run Wednesday morning too yeah I ran that with Flores gearan from path projects and Billy Yang I was supposed to do a workout but kind of just abandoned to have a good run and uh Billy Yang had those Rayband s those Rayband recording glasses on that's not creepy yeah I know it's like I can't you can never tell like are you just are you asking me questions to have a conversation or are you trying to interview me did you ask him if you were being recorded uh I think it shows like a light on the front if you're being record I remember you got them yeah I I had them for a little bit I I tried them out one the style that I purchased I felt was a little bit feminine for my face two okay it took really bad photos yeah the quality of the stuff was just crap but the was the video bad yeah oh I I think I think and also like why like why do you need that why do you need to video record someone with your face I actually think they'll be fantastic in a couple years and I do think you're going to want to do it just cuz like right now you pull out your phone but the glasses you could talk to so you could be like you just double tap the thing and the video comes on so your hands are free so say that you're holding a shoe that's the only case I see it working is you're doing like an unboxing or eating a sandwich you're saying it'll show things in the in the lenses no it doesn't show will your eyeballs see the things in the lenses like you are using your eyes it's got cameras on the temples yeah but I'm saying I thought you were saying it was like a what do you call it VR type thing where it show I think you're thinking AR or augmented reality yeah where it shows the directions or whatever I do think that'll happen what I did like about it though you could connect it to your phone and stuff so I was able to ask for directions and Google stuff and and uh also siries stuff so you could be like hey what's the closest taco place and it would be like okay and it would give you left left right left walk 200 feet this direction I think the one thing that he said was interesting is that if you record on it kind of all day and then make it real people people who you know who are with you they're like when did you take all that video cuzz they just people are so used to having an obtrusive camera so it's kind of unobtrusive you can it's a more natural thing than having a camera front of yeah but you especially if you just color a Sharpie over the light yeah no knows just disable light I wouldn't do that at all yeah at all Meg would be like why are you wearing glasses in the bathroom glasses um but yeah so then we what' you guys do you went on a run too went we went on a run and T backtracked before I did and ran into Connor for running a warehouse and film some content yeah jar you know that guy can't not film content yeah I mean he has the hair for it so Jared was like running with me and we were trying to get back cuz we had to get to the Nike thing oh right so they were I didn't realize that I was going to be or or was supposed to be doing any content with them so we're running back and I get a text message I'm like if you guys want to do it we got to do it now so they're out on the trail setting up the thing so right where that spiral thing is the bridge we sat at the bottom of that and we did like the shoe spotting thing that you and I did yeah but honestly I just went off the rails and just talked yeah that's the way I said I'm cranky guys I'm really tired I didn't know that we were doing this whatever then this one guy who I I don't know what the guy was doing he can see that we're filming we've got mics on there's camera up the guy just sits there and starts talking us and Connor was just too nice was he a runner guy or is he just it's it's the running event so was somebody that like knew Connor well I mean it's Austin so Austin could have been a crazy person that's true true but yeah this guy just rolled up and sat down next to us he's like he's talking I'm like you're not on mic nobody's gonna be able to hear you and Conor's let you should have just gave him your mic I know and just left yeah said you're this tapped in seems to be working out because we are doing shoe spot and he was wearing super blast too okay yeah in that nice offwhite that's a good color and then I came running by I did make sure that I wore cuz that ladybird Trail destroys your shoes yeah it does I wore those um zoomfly uh six six but the ilad kip chogi color because it already looks like it's got dirt on it so I was like okay that works it's like authentic and just going to throw this out there uh ladybird Trail so much better than PR Trail doesn't even come close I think that you could name a lot of trails and be like that's better than PR I think that's my goal is to just name every Trail that's better than priest tril that would be a good map for people like like a map of the US trails that are better than most of America it's be green over here n you GNA say you ran by uh yeah when you were filming in the vomero 18 no I didn't have it at that point I was also wearing the zoom F six I wore the zoomfly 6 that day too wow what do you think yeah I like it a lot it's gr grown me the more I wear it right I agree yeah it's the best zoom fly there's ever been oh for sure that's not even close and I know we don't want to jump too far ahead but Nike right now I don't care what you think about the brand they're really starting to kill it in the daily stuff there's like three or four shoes now that I'm like it's about time honestly these are really good okay I'm interested to I haven't run the vomo vomero 18 which we then got that about 30 minutes after that run M's already got 20 miles in it I ran in this morning okay it's a it's definitely the best vomero all right and it should have been and now it's got 46 mm in the heel you know I'm like that is it really 46 yeah that's what they said good Jo for the video people yeah I got it you got it yep that's this one 46 in the heel that's what they said from 40 to 46 that seems wild what do you think how would you describe the ride M um like a neutral daily trainer it's not super light it's going to have a little bit of structure and support to it um I did think it was pretty stable yeah I mean it's got a pretty wide platform so definitely nice and stable it's it's like a Workhorse it's not like um a light fun bouncy ride but it's it's funny it's funny you said Workhorse cuz this should have been the Pegasus that's what I also I think that's what we said about the last fero too I think sure what they're doing with the peg right now like this has really nice 4 foot cushioning I do like this the layer of zoomx they I don't think they should it's misleading to put the giant zoomx here because I did think that was interesting they do that with all their shoes I know it's really a thin layer of zoomx underneath your foot oh really this isn't the zoomx react x no not at all nice you can see the line where it zoomx it actually on the back it has an arrow that says zoomx and then react oh the zoomx is the top layer I got you yeah okay but this feels really good the upper fits great the lock down is nice I even dig like you don't see this tongue around that much anymore but it's nice padded tongue it's gusseted on the sides yeah it's it's pretty sweet I think you'll dig it I haven't put it on the scale is that the scale Under Computer yeah we can try it I feel like it's away something something so yeah we're supposed to go do a run with Nike but they plan their run a little late we had a 9:30 appointment so we uh it's almost 12 ounces that's a big boy they said a game that's a chunky but they also said it's like this isn't a shoe that necessarily needs to be super light so yeah right about that um yeah so shees keep getting heavier Robbie yeah I think they people were fed up with the lightweights you know what else no go ahead oh no go ahead I was going to say but the but the ratios are getting even ligher so it's true so you take these off and like but it is interesting going to the running event we'll talk about we'll just we'll walk through some of the highlights that we saw but one of the interesting things is how messaging changes from year to year so remember two or three years ago sustainability was like everybody was talking about it and there was green shoes and Eco shoes and this and that everybody was like here's our carbon footprint do you hear anybody mention it this not a not a word once not once yeah I mean it's still like on on their Pages they'll say uh this is biodegradable this is whatever even as6 is putting their carbon footprint in the Shoe Right does anyone even know what that number means that means nothing no and the thing is it just goes to prove the point like we had said before like if the shoe feels good and will help you run miles and do that people are willing to be like maybe be sustainable in other areas of their life but you're you're making a product that you're making thousands of that is made of rubber and different materials and yeah I ride my bike to work every day so I can wear whatever shoe I want yeah that is true that's how that works even in the cold yeah it's even nicer in the cold I feel like I don't I don't know depends depends what you're wearing anyways but yeah um the so Ralphie shut the do you need me get the Lagoon pillow get the lagon Carl get the lagon pillow it's okay buddy all right um so highlights of highlights of the we doing it by day or just in general we can it honestly doesn't matter because no one knows what I don't know what day it was but let's start with the low light the low light I start to mention oh yeah every year they have an ice cream truck that we get so jazzed about soft serf maple syrup flavored ice cream it's like the most lovely treat in the middle of a Las Vegas day yeah and they showed up this year s's truck no truck I it's funny that we both went with s's truck that's how it works uh it was it it was disappointing for a couple reasons one I love that ice cream yeah and two I mean what's going on with them that they can't afford the ice cream truck anymore I don't know I guess it should be a sponsor of this podcast that will sell more maple syrup or maybe we need to do free spots for them so that we can get the truck ice cre truck we could just have a get the ice cream truck for every episode leading up to tr we'll give you free year-long sponsorship if you just bring the ice cream truck back yeah that's the deal I mean I'm in and I finally figured out that hack last year where I took the the honey Stinger waffle or the unta waffle and dipped it into the ice cream and then chunk it up and put it in man that was nice it's basically like a DQ Blizzard but handmade all right first check in man this is going to be a long podcast so buckle up anyway we're covering all the stuff from Trey and one of my favorite things to do is it like think about this you're out there running right now doesn't always feel the best but sometimes it does and the times that I really like having that Fitness is when we go on these trips so I can run with friends and get together with people so if you don't are lacking a little motivation right now think about just staying in shape so that if something fun pops up I don't know could be a turkey Tru could be a holiday 5K who knows what's happening but just uh stay fit over the winter here and uh you'll be in good shape to run with friends and have a good time all right guys element is still a sponsor of this podcast but for a limited time they're offering their chocolate medley oo that sounds pretty delicious you know it's not like the you're not going to put that in your bubbly water no you could could you you could uh you want it heated up I think yeah some hot water with either the chocolate mint the chocolate chai or the chocolate raspberry I've heard it's pretty good in coffee too you could also put it in your coffee okay would you do it before your run yeah okay some hot coffee some chocolate medley I do like a mocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also our offer is still available so you can go to element.\n\nFrom video 'Mizuno Neo Zen, Christmas and Chronukah and Nutcrackers and Multiverses | The Drop Podcast E321':\n\n[Music] hi this is Thomas with believe in the run this is Robbie with believe in the run this is Megan with believe in the run and you're back for a funfilled packed podcast holiday Christmas Hanukkah why is there a c in front of Hanukkah you can spell it two ways why I don't I that to me is they don't do they don't do good branding some people say Hanukkah some people say chanuka they still say Hanukkah but there's a silent sea I I well no like cha chica wait there's oh I just I assumed it was a silent sea Hanah it's probably something like that but that they really they got bad branding which is strange because typically yeah you know yeah we need w foot Jarrett to come on the show and give his Jarrett wife B and give his uh full indepth history it'll take eight days though yeah oh if you're out there getting ready to celebrate Hanukkah you know congrats yeah when does it's probably starting one of these days no I Googled it um it starts on Christmas oh is that like Passover you never know when it starts exactly it's on a different calendar right sorry for being so ignorant about this stuff but you know how it is yeah we we never claim ourselves to be the most educated bunch in the world no but you know that Google released this chip that says that there is actually a Multiverse Oh I thought that you going to say there's a Hanukkah two things a different day two things that blew my mind well multiverses Christmas and anuka that's two different true verses and they have different calendar so I going they should call they should make a holiday called chronica that's probably exists in certain circles I would believe Snoop Dog celebrates Chron Dr Dre and Snoop dogs um yeah but with the multi verse that one blew my mind with this new chip that Google has okay so what do you I don't understand you got to explain a little bit more the chip is existence in itself points at having a Multiverse because the only chip that would do the same work right now that we have would take a trillion years to do it oh I have heard about this so that this chip is actually they're saying has to be accessing multiverses to oh because computational power it almost like breaks the laws of physics or whatever exactly and the other one that blew my mind was this guy was talking about space travel and speed of light and we could get to it would take about I I think he said like it was like some ridiculous short period of time to get to the next closest galaxy uhhuh he said and to get back if you could travel at near the speed of light uhhuh he goes the only problem is you wouldn't be able to tell anybody about because by the time you got back it'd be four million years later on Earth man hold on I'm breaking my head I know I was just thinking about chips the only kind of chips that probably I was thinking more Kettle Kettle Coke or something that's some Kettle Coke chips feel like I'm in a Multiverse depending on the flavor yeah I also think that Megan time travels cuz when she runs a marathon it's about an hour faster than us and by the time we're done that's actually she's already had cocktails yeah there's definitely some time travel going on there yeah Thomas also everything he sees on Instagram now I mean there's no reason not to what what have I been wrong about so this week he sent me a real and it said it was Deep Creek Maryland uhhuh and it was Lake Co no I haven't been to Deep Creek in a while maybe it looks like Lake l in Italy it wasn't you you can't prove where it was no it was 100% from Italy and he sends it to me as if like cuz he's always looking like real estate like places where we could get like a cool like Lake Shore home or some place where we could go to to vacay and so I think the intent was to be like look how great Deep Creek is and I was like possibly it took me 15 seconds to realize that was in fact not Deep Creek oh wow and he was like yeah look at how great this could be look I also spend I don't do like in depth when I'm going through Instagram I scrolling I see something a that's cool send that yeah it's not like I go let me read the entire thing and see the fine print and maybe Lake like Deep Creek is the Lake Como no the person who posted it was trying to make everyone believe that that was deep like I don't know what people are doing on Instagram just posting I've seen these um I've seen these before I don't know if in Instagram by the way Deep Creek is man-made lake in Western Marland okay fun fact there's no natural lakes in Maryland at all yeah there's just reservoirs and I don't know Army projects but the I've seen this though people will post there's a lot of AI Genera stuff and it's like the Grand Canyon of uh Pennsylvania not like not even what it looks like there is this quote unquote Grand Canyon Pennsylvania that's a real thing but is it Grand actually it actually is pretty grand for p by Pennsylvania standards but uh but I'm like what what's the point of this I don't even understand the engagement part of it why do you need why you like what is like what brand deals are they getting from that wait I think that you guys like why do you immediately go to Brand deals well what are what are you doing I think there's all kinds of reasons for these bots on Instagram they build up a giant following then they sell the account to someone you think that's what's going on I think that's one of them I know that they do what they do is they'll try to build up a huge audience quickly yeah and they use all the little techniques and then they go to a business and you can change the name so then you buy it and you look like you have you know 50 to 200,000 followers and you're like boom I was talk did we talk about this on another episode about how I think we did but how if a real goes viral now yeah we talked about that it doesn't get any you said it doesn't necessarily do anything for the account yeah and on that but remember when it actually did like you would if someone had a viral post or real they would end up getting like 50,000 followers from it that I mean I look at like the hakua phen phenomenon yeah that happened this past summer yeah that Arc used to be like you had like six months right of it being funny and let's t-shirts and yeah all sorts of stuff now I really feel like you have like three to four weeks and it's gone yeah and then yeah but she got like a podcast stuff yeah that it was horrible of course I don't already done I think so and then she did a meme coin that she might go to jail for at this point okay do you think that she actually knew what she was doing like do or do you think someone said hey let's do a Bitcoin and probably not or a blockchain coin and I don't think but I don't know if that absolves you from the potential uh whatever violation SEC violations from yeah cashing out on it immediately after it spikes yeah I don't know um it I think I don't know how hard that stuff is to prove I will tell you that Bitcoin man it hit another high it did it yeah I haven't really been paying attention a bit you don't want to if you're not in it you get mad was it 110 like I think it hit like2 or something or that's all right yeah but whatever anyways um yeah for those of you not in the super power computational chips what do you call Quantum Computing yeah Instagram reels and crypto yeah imagine imagine jumping into this running podcast and you're just like what is happening anyone listening to this knows there's minimal running content these days I don't know if anyone there's tons of running content there's definitely has to be a number of people each week who come into this new new yeah thinking it's a running podcast which it is we'll get into that in two hours from now it's it's a like what can we relate it to that something that's like like this um like our universe is running but we're also going to talk about about the other stuff in the universe yeah I don't know like a some sort of barnab and Bailey freak Show it's still a circus they have tigers and lions but then off to the side it would be more like that if Megan had your mustache yeah you should try you should get one I don't think that's how it works I mean I don't I I've been I've known Megan for several years now I think over we're well over 10 years now and uh I've never seen her with a mustache well she digs into Carl's T stash uh creepy Carl creepy Carl oh guys don't make it stick creepy creepy Carl's not creepy he said he was he's a little creepy do you watch his stories um I love his stories yeah like I feel like I'm getting a look like it's like a little window opens up in car Carl's head and you get to see what's going on in there it's all through the lens of a binocular yeah binoculars from if there was apartment word for emo that started with K I would be calling him Kemo Cho I don't think you want to call him that that's not going to work no we need we need a word for emo off The Rocker Carl's been running though yeah I know I heard I heard there's been sighting Sasquatch sightings of Carl out there the grer films yeah yeah so was the Bruder the one who filmed from the null no the guy was on the null the grassy null the grassy null is where they think shots were fired from but the the camera was the one that captured like the Kennedy getting shot right that's the film yeah did you um speaking of which I was watching a thing when Trump was getting assassinate and I don't know if this one's a fake and me says I believe everything on Instagram you just said when Trump was assassinated so I'm thinking that's fake no attempted ass there's a woman sitting right behind him oh gosh who doesn't she doesn't Flinch she doesn't move she like holds up a sign then puts it down and nods and then the fire goes off and she doesn't move and then she just kind of smirks when everything that's going on and it's in the video and I'm like dude yeah I just I just think people react to things differently well yeah I don't know that one I'm starting to think I mean I don't know that the whole thing's insane so I don't I mean yeah I don't trust anything from anyone anyways and talk about surreal they showed a box at like the Army Navy and it was Trump Elon Musk uh like several other guys and you're just like looking in that box you're like there the weirdest group of people it's a weird time yeah I mean if there's any Multiverse we're living we're living in one of them the chip is proving it yeah um before we get off the subject of Christmas and holidays do you have some updates on new movies that we have watched oh okay if you want to hear about them I would like to hear about them you were there uhhuh well kind of um okay Operation Christmas drop oh yeah I've heard of this one before four out of 10 Stars really bad yeah not good not good it was really bad I couldn't tell you any of the actors in it um it was about I don't even really understand the plot and I watch the plot was that they're have to close down the military is making cuts and they want to close down a base and this one base went viral for dropping Christmas presents to um to like Islands out in the Pacific and they where they at bombs this guy this guy is wasting Resources by doing Christmas present drops on these islands and so they send out a rep an attractive rep uhhuh from the mil from the government okay one of the congresswoman's Reps and she goes out there and you make this sound better than it is she meets the guy and he's like debonaire and you know like no he looks like a Kendall like little cocky and so you think oh he's just a a-hole and then no you find out he's got a heart of gold oh okay and that what he's doing is he's helping people and he's doing it all through donations and stuff so it's not wasting the military uh money this sounds like a propaganda film but okay she falls in love with him the congresswoman comes out to spoil Christmas and be like you're close down oh and she gets a Christmas spirit as well and everything is great so it's kind of like uh what accent just happened I think that's my Christmas it's kind of like SpongeBob but instead of Bikini Bottom it's like the bikini at to they're like on top they're on land so Squidward is the uh is the one who wants to ruin Christmas SpongeBob no crusty Krabs wants to cut prices ah okay or expenses they're using too much fresh crab in the Krabby Patty okay this makes more sense now thank you for that's quid where it's like oh go check it out I think that's the accident you were going for yeah whe unintentionally SpongeBob okay that's not bad actually don't do anymore just stop that was perfect I I think the key to doing accents is doing one word and then no one can tell that was I had a friend who did James Bond she could do Bolt the door before you leave or something that might be too long yeah yeah too many words okay two other movies a sudden case of Christmas it had Danny deito in it didn't even finish it it was very boring not sure what happened like he got Co but it was Christmas Co no the parents were getting divorced and they were going to tell her in Italy is in it will will will yeah hold on the parents are getting divorced and then what they went to Italy where her dad lives to tell the daughter that they were getting separated and then she decided she wanted to have one last Christmas together but it was August so they decided to have Christmas in August okay first off the girl likes Greta thornberg so the little child is a big Greta thornberg fan oh like the the climate person yes oh okay sorry that's part of the plot that's she mentioned her in the movie Weir um and then from then on I just was like oh you little brat and she's she's uh she she's going she's going to visit her throwing pain on all the on the paintings the mum basically yeah she's you know that she's decided that she's going to have Christmas CU her parents are splitting up and it's summertime but who cares yeah that's entitlement if I heard it it's like you said the whole whole time I'm like this little brat um and then you can't have Christmas in August you maybe can do it in July because that's like a funny haha thing but August there's no way yeah no and her summer boyfriend that she visits when I hate this no he had a summer girlfriend she winter yeah was a whole thing she was like that was a thing and was like reverse cuffing yeah is that the deal yeah and is that Carl do you know that's true okay cuffing Carl oh he likes that actually that could be a band name that's like um yeah speaking of Christmas trees he just lit up yeah um um anyway yeah that one Danny deito couldn't save it which crazy but Vilma wi dama Wilmer vama that's it he's in it he's the dad added nothing okay yeah he hasn't done he must have just been there for the paycheck or something he was just like okay and then the final the final movie I'm guessing the parents got back together if we had watched it to the end yeah 100% it's a Christmas movie um the final one we saw was called nut crackers and it's a Ben Stiller and it is not at all what I was expecting it's about um four orphaned boys their parents are killed in a car crash and Ben Stiller is the brother of the mom who had the four boys and he's like this businessman that lives in Chicago and they were like in the suburbs of nowhere land no they weren't in the sub they're in the country in the country they're basically feral children so the parents were educating the kids at home their homeschooling these kids they're like homee all the boys have long hair like they all look like Bad News Bears like he shows up to the house and they're like on the roof and like ones in a costume like kind of creepy there's pigs in the house oh yeah oh it actually did sound like your podcast earlier this week I was like I was like that actually sounds pretty cool Min is the trash yeah uh it was it was it was pretty dark humor um it was a nice message at the end but yeah I don't know I didn't get to the end I don't think of that one either okay you fell asleep I don't know did I I think so oh jeez all right so that was Nutcracker nutcrackers yeah oh okay yeah we did watch Home Alone though yeah classic yeah I mean it's I def we watched that last week I think it's the best it's my favorite Christmas movie even the second one isn't a bad sequel like it's it's pretty pretty solid sequel It's the third one that was really bad yeah yeah but we um we finished I pretty much finished the uh Home Alone Lego set oh you did yeah finished it does it do stuff like does it have like little it's honestly incredible traps and stuff like that yeah it's incredible okay like the detail is you should do a little unreal you should do a little real I thought about it it's like going to take me too long but they so they have the the traps that they have are the paint can swinging down the steps I like that they have the they have a little thing that pushes a sled him riding the sled down the steps out the door they have the iron they have uh two levels where you drop the iron down the laundry shoot like that um the does marf get can you spin his head around has a red yeah can yep and uh and then he has in the basement they have that like stove or whatever the wood stove that if lift it up it has a light up brick that glows nice then the they have a Michael Jordan and a like record player that if you turn on a thing it spins both of them is it actually Michael Jordan yeah it's a they don't it doesn't say Bulls it says like bricks but it has 23 yeah and then um they have the treehouse with the zipline very good and did this make you wish you could shrink down to Lego size and play around yeah it's a it's oh and then they have uh inzz room they have shelves that collapse ni if you pull lever it it does it has the spider for that goes on Marv and the like it has a oh sorry yeah but it's not in the aquarium so it has a tarantula um but it's like on the wall near the staircase going up to the attic it's pretty awes like it's the detail is incredible um so I was pretty pleased with that and then you can get like a light up you can get lights for it and it it's not through Lego but third party makes a whole lighting system that you can intricately put into like every room and stuff so I haven't done

and people are walking around talking to each other and this is not that kind of this is more like what I would imagine like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 70s yeah like it's just iron and bars and like racks and stuff like that yeah there's no it's not pretty at all yeah I love it cuz I was thinking about this I like the the setting of a gym that's just kind of bones and work and not I was like if I had this equipment at home I would never do anything but I feel like when you're in a space that lends to that do you think it feels it kind of feels like a car garage like a uh like you would go

Elite 4 PB, End of Year Recap | The Drop Podcast E323':\n\n[Music] all right hi this is Thomas believe in the run this Robby with believe in the run and this is Megan with believe in the run and I don't know why I'm yelling but that was quite aggressive yells at Clouds this is the last podcast of 2024 really limping into the end here yeah I feel like wheels are coming off everyone's sick everyone's sick I think you know this is like I was been looking forward to this time because we traveled a lot we did a lot of things I was just like we'll get to the holidays we can kind of relax and I think my body is gone and said okay yeah let's get sick let's everything's broken yeah yeah I mean everyone's getting sick around these parts I think it's inevitable when it the weather gets cold I mean actually I think you two got it at the gym I that's why my theory I was going to go with that as well I don't know everyone's that or maybe I don't know my kids also get sick so maybe Robbie brought it in yeah Robbie's the real problem yeah I'm the small poox blanket of Believe In The Run hey Robie before we get started you got a package from tracksmith why don't you rip it open and let's see what's in it oh we're already starting Christmas presents I think I know what's in it I hope I know what's in it it's going to be so good tracksmith came out with this new piece of apparel it's what it is oh yeah it is actually that man yes they're running bibs what size are those dude that does look big looks big no it's a small look I mean they come up to your armpits and you got pockets in the back like a it's like a reverse is it like a reverse that actually is kind of cool basically like the same thing you'd wear if you went skiing or cycling yeah except for no no uh shammy yeah I don't know the pocket I think would be cooler front like a sweatshirt like on the bottom that's what I was trying to figure out do you wear what do you mean on the bottom like your do you wear underwear when with your no I think it's just normal tights like you don't wear anything underneath I don't wear any do you no man okay are you a never nude um but they what's a never nude it's from Arrested Development Tobias fun uh there's dozens of them but so you're going to wear a t-shirt under or a long sleeve or whatever shirt under that and that's it yeah I think I guess so that's kind of weird dude I dare you to run around with not a jacket over the top of that just a long sleeve shirt that's how they model itas I'll do it on Christmas yeah how else you going to model it like you can't show it with a jacket over cuz then you can't see it and if you wore a top over it would just look like normal running tights right so you got to wear underneath Farmer John I I will say I don't know I don't understand the utility of these versus a normal pair of running tights it keeps you warmer allegedly allegedly I mean so does a thicker like or a light jacket yeah but this makes it real challenging if you ever have to go to the bathroom the bathroom putting them on oh dude I wish it had a flap in the back like old uh cartoons where they had the just good the ouse and pull that flap down yeah this is I love tracksmith but this is an unnecessary I don't know what's waiting see what Robbie says maybe it's the new favorite thing yeah we got to test it out dude you should run with no shirt on underneath it's just the bib it's illegal in some countries it look like look like Bor B ass Carl's and Carl now has switched sides he's into it yeah he's going to cut the legs off it'll just be a banana hammock with the straps yeah I like it all right well I'll try it out I did actually run in the Fels turtleneck this past yesterday actually when it was very like 15 degrees and uh it was like I thought it was 20 was it it was in Pennsylvania you were that was a mistake there was actually I just wore that with a light Marino layer over top of that it was it was perfect my question though is like you ran in that mauno shoe that we all like which on my ratings on the you know I'm trying to get more accurate with the rating system for the videos yeah and I felt like I put it almost close to like yellow and I think it's a really good shoe but because of the way that we rate things now um it'll it'll be interesting because everybody likes it you like it me likes it I like it but I was thinking you were in colder temps did it affect the um I didn't I feel like it's such a soft foam that I don't feel like it really did I was a little nervous because the first there was a couple inches of snow on the ground so the first couple miles of it's like a you know where we went running yeah I recognized your Strava map I was like oh that's where we went yeah for Robbie's bachelor party that's not a bachelor party yeah midlife grais bachelor party didn't it feel like a bachelor party Carl it kind of was in a way uh we had like yeah we had Robbie's mom and uh Justine arsing yeah that was it yeah my mom wasn't hanging out the whole time she's she helped with the food but anyways just a little dancing left she still got it she still got it the and my uncle brought his stripper raccoons with it was good yeah the tassels were amazing yeah how do you train a raccoon to do that I don't know you can trust me um but they yeah so there's snow on the ground I was running at first in straight snow I was like this is a horrible idea um and then you got to the gay snow yeah yeah and it was super colorful and all all was good no it was then the crush gravel was showed up and it was fine uh but yeah it was I was wearing those tracksmith ndo tights which are like those without the suspenders yeah pretty much well they're you know how they're almost like a wet suit yeah I get the worst uh chaing grundle CH from those and I just take a whole handful of snow and shove it down with tights no that would make it worse yeah that's not the answer believe it or not it actually helped what all right yeah I don't understand that somebody who's a scientists in our audience maybe can help with this I can wear like the short tights yeah pretty much guaranteed to get grundle chafe uhhuh but I can wear regular tights and pretty much be fine oh weird maybe it's just a certain cut any short typ or is it because the weather that maybe I'm sweating a little more when you're wearing the shorts I don't know that's probably what it is but I there's nothing rubbing there I don't understand what's causing the friction I don't know some sort of yeah maybe there's it's antimatter or something dark matter yeah uh but I I do like it when it's super cold out like today this morning that was too cold for me she just as long as after you get past that first mile me didn't she came back in her skin was red I don't I don't think I was wearing warm enough stuff actually I that's probably why my upper body was fine I was wearing the new rabbit jacket they just sent called warm up and go I think that's what it's called yep sorry rabbit and that sounds about right and it was good so my like upper body was fine but yeah my legs felt like I Les I have to say the rabbit tights I think Traxx makes a great tight but the rabbit pocket tight oh is also one of my favorites for the winter that's actually probably my second favorite especially when it's getting cold yeah is it thicker it's thicker yeah which is funny because they're from California yeah but that is one thing they do really well is it the trail tights I think I I I think they mine are just the pocket tights yeah I don't know I don't know they are though I wear those all the time and trying to think what else was it is sometimes it's hard to dial in those temperatures but when you do is it's it's great I don't know but I nice I will tell you this we've been recommending those car hard gloves yeah and I wore those the other day when it was 20° cuz I'm like 20° too warm one yeah and when I I stopped to change my music cuz I had like this this new punk rock playlist and I was like not vibing on it so I stopped to change the music had to take the gloves off trying to get them back my hands back in cuz my hands were a little bit like not even that sweaty but just a little bit trying to get them back in yeah was nearly impossible I felt like it was like two things of rubber trying to go past each other it's like I know what you're talking about actually but yeah those are for running yeah it's almost has to be below 10° today would have been a good day for it I think yeah I had mittens on and I was still cold well the good news is I think you got a pair now for Christmas okay Thomas can't really good with the with the surprises really can't resist surprise oh man we should have just brought them in for the show this at that point I think they're probably from M's mom um just open Amazon package even better um yeah but otherwise what else has been going on well I wanted to since this is our last show of the Year recap the Year talk about some fun stats hey before we get into that can we talk about a show that we watched uh well we watched another Christmas movie but besides that we watch what Christmas movie red one red one yeah what is red one the one with the rock last night B oh yeah it was I thought it was about a Santa Claus it red one oh it really red one is Santa Claus okay so by the way it also sounds like a Russian spy movie the dude who does those State Farm commercials is like Santa Claus in this okay you looked up his name JK something yeah uh I forgot oh yeah from dude the drumming movie dude is strapped yeah oh really ripped and apparently he started working out when he was like 61 for a movie or something he's he had he like remember he had to like lose a bunch of weight for this role and then he wanted to gain it back so he started this like strength routine oh and he got jacked what was the what was the drumming movie Whiplash yeah and I don't know if I is that good yeah he's like intimidating in that movie okay so it's a great movie he gets jacked and he's playing side by side with the rock so you know look like you got any muscles at all next to the rock is impressive yeah dude's 69 wow man we looked up everything that's cool we know his background the movie on the other hand that was ter it had a lot of Rotten Tomatoes 30% Rotten Tomatoes it earned him yeah I mean hot Froot hot Frosty's been the Talk of the Town is it did you watch it I haven't yet but I heard I heard people talk about it at parties all kinds of stuff oh yeah I think it's so no we haven't out there that it's it's almost so bad it's good yeah kind of thing but yeah I think it helps that that guy is also jacked in the movie yeah so man Jack he's shredded yeah shredded he's shredded jul Julian salad um soy boys are out jacked and shredded is in that is true we also May so I started I go on Prime TV to watch the Beast show oh yeah and that's what I wanted to talk about and uh I I start watching I'm like I actually think me would like this uhhuh so I me was about to go out on a run I was like hey come here check this out cuz I won't watch ion I won't watch this if you like it uhuh I'll wait till we can watch it together Meg was glued to her seat and so we were like all right good I hate how much I I couldn't stop watching it I was like this is so dumb and I was like but I can't stop watching it no it's amazing the psychological game he comes up with is so messed up I was telling Thomas I was like does he have a degree in Psychology like where does this come from I'm sure he has Consultants that are like this is what will happen if you do this because that they so when I I'm Psychology major and throughout College they like they did all these tests after World War II to find out why the German public would go along with like extermination of the Jews and they did all these tests of like obeying authority figures and doing what you're told and we are kind of messed up yeah people yeah but like the the fact that there was such high emotion so early on was crazy well I think when people have that idea that just that seed is planet that you could have $5 million yeah I guess we should tell people who don't know what we're talking about what the premise of the show is so Mr well first of all who's Mr Beast I mean if you don't know who Mr Beast is you probably shouldn't be listening to this yeah but no he's the most he's the biggest YouTuber of all time he has like 300 million subscribers just ridiculous but I don't know I would say probably more kids watch it but teens but at this point I feel like most people know I think I don't know well maybe especially after this show which yeah yeah just started what is it even called Beast games Beast games so he's doing the largest game show in history which has a $5 million grand prize and giving away tons of more money like Millions every day and there's a thousand contestants it starts out with a thousand but it goes down pretty fast yeah so you start weeding out uh the contestants pretty quickly but the games and everything they're ridiculous the the people who like self-identified to drop out that that part was the craziest part for me I think like I yeah that wasn't so interesting to me and I was we were waiting for like the people that sacrific themselves for this whole other team to win like I was expecting Mr Beast to be like yeah here's a or here's a prize and it was just like bye I wonder if they come back later in the show but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't yeah I've only watched the first episode they had to eliminate a thousand I mean it's it starts with a thousand people I doubt those people are coming back the other thing that I thought was crazy is the people that informatically were like I won't take the deal I won't take the deal I won't take the deal and then they take the deal like and you're like you just screwed everybody everyone on your team yeah I mean like people are inherently selfish and terrible people I feel like like that guys falls apart quickly like you said with the whole self survival is there's two parts to it though you feel like when you start cracking you're like if I'm cracking then someone else is going to there somebody else will crack and this is my opportunity CU like right now they ended on the second episode with like a cliffhanger I haven't seen a second one yet I'm waiting to watch with my kids I won't tell you what happens but it's a cliffhanger and it's getting to a point where you know someone's going to fold and it's going to eliminate an entire team of people I mean the worst one for me was was and we can move on after there is a Mr be cuz he he does all these kinds of games on his show at other points but he had two people living together for I think several months and they were in the same room I remember you telling us about this yeah and then at the very end he gave him the chance to steal the other person's money like right when they were leaving the room like they were each going to get $500,000 or something and he was like you have 30 seconds to steal the other person's money I was like dude that's messed up did of them take it they didn't like but you know they would never see each other again they could it's pretty yeah but you got to live with that for the rest of your life I know but and the $500,000 I mean your taxes T be taking with taxes but anyway so it that that is entertaining that was I was looking forward to watching that the thing is that his premises are so simple mhm that you're like why isn't anybody done this but it's the resources he has yeah he built a city well what I love about him is that the whole rock and too he's been H he's just having fun and so he's like if he makes money he puts it back into having more fun that's what I love about him so much is that he he doesn't because he's definitely had a buyout offers from you know networks or companies but he literally just loves what he does and he doesn't do it for the money at all like he just pours everything right back into it which is why it's so successful and he's partly autistic stick I'm pretty sure like I think he's even said that they did they did have problems like my son was telling me that um one of the guys was got in trouble for messaging little boys oh yeah oh yeah I remember that he's not he's no longer on the show that makes sense um I mean but at this point Mr be has got to be worth a ton he's got chocolate brand well just his brand value the day he's got restaurant stuff have you ever looked it up yeah I did I did when we were watching and I forget what it said what I thought with genius is what he did during um Co where he 500 million put his Burgers into other people's oh yeah restaurants yeah no he's he's smarter whoever his team is but anyways uh so yeah that that's been cool and yeah what did I I had too much caffeine yesterday and sometimes I'll wake up that's do you know when you you wake up the middle of night and you can't go back to sleep why did you have so much caffeine I don't know I was just drinking stuff with caffeine in it like all day and night Monster Energy I had a couple these of coffee and then I had some Diet Dr Pepper in the afternoon and that usually in conjunction I don't do well with caffeine Dr Pepper has his caffeine mhm yeah and then so I woke up in the middle of night and I was thinking about you know all this stuff probably that we're doing now and you just start thinking about everything in life yeah that's the ones where I wake up and Mak like why did you get up and I'm like cuz I just knew I was up like yeah there's a certain level of alertness I almost I almost was there and then I was managed to fall back asleep but I I for some reason I think I had this dream about a cat like a kitten type cat kitty cat yeah and and I had this idea in my head that I couldn't let go of which was if if you found the two biggest house cats in the world okay and started what what size are what would you consider the biggest house cat like a large Tom cat like um like this big right or those cats that you like that are like I one of those that look like leopards yeah no these are just I'm talking like they are domesticated type cat talking a big big fat cat like Garfield yeah yeah and you started and you bred them could you eventually well if they're two Tom Cats you can't or what's the Tam cat what's the opposite of a tom cat I think just a female cat a mom cat so if you take those and you would breed them to create bigger Cats Could you ever reach the size of a tiger no over time I mean you could probably get a giant cat yeah like you could manipulate into larger and larger cats but it would probably like have like health issues you know how humans over time have gotten taller yeah so I'm talking about if you did this over centuries could you take a normal house centuries they reproduce a lot faster than us and if you we ours is naturally through selection happen we could artificially select for them and so so it could happen yeah I think you could that's they do that like that's have you heard I just want to see if you could have a house cat that was as big as a tiger they mix uh Buffalo with Buffalo with regular like bows and and steer oh and they got that what is it called like the like a liger it's kind of like that it's a it's a very hearty like big bowl thing bread with bread for skills and Magic yeah okay well anyway sorry that was ridiculous but I I was legitimately thinking about that 4:00 a.m.\n\nUser Question: ratatouille\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context above."}],

cushioned shoe':\n\nhey Tomy from the r testers in this video we are going to be doing our full review of the aex GEL Nimbus 27 let's take a [Music] look the A6 gel nibus 27 cost 180 or $165 it weighs 306 G or 10.8 o for men in a size 8 and the drop is 8 [Music] mm the ASX gel nibas 27 isn't add IC update to its predecessor but it does include a couple of big updates to improve the overall comfort of the shoe the most important of those is an increasing the stack height of FF flas Eco midell foam by 2 mm to add even more cushioning to the ride and the other is a new engineered jacked mesh upper to improve comfort and breathability in the rear of the shoe you'll still find the same pure gel technology designed to improve shock absorption and there's an authorly x55 sock liner to add even more cushioning to The Ride Like the earlier versions there's still plent of padding across the upper including a knit rib collar as well as a gusseted tongue wi fit system to ensure a good fit on the outsole is a hybrid aex grip to provide grip and protect the mid comes the fit of the ASX Jael ners 27 I have my usual size here which is a uk9 or a US 10 and it fits me really well I've got no concerns told about the fit I would stick to your normal running shoe size as I'm someone who's slightly on the fence between a 9 and 8.5 UK it's quite roomy in the toebox for me but not in a way that i' consider too roomy for a Big Easy Day Cruiser like this so yeah all around was very happy with the fit good hold around the hill of midfoot there was a lot of kind of cushioning at the back here but it didn't irritate my achilles at all sometimes found actually when walking that the slightly high collar here would feel a bit weird under my ankle but actually on the run that was never a problem so yeah all around nice comfortable fit as you expect I'd stick to your normal size with a nimbus same size I've used for the past three generations of the shoe just give you a quick word on fit then and I think this is pretty much more of the same as the aex Joe Nimbus 27 you've got really ample room at end of the toe box nice amount of clearance across the top of the toes there's plenty of flex these jackard uppers are a bit more structured than you got with the nip from the 26 but this is still a really roomy happy shoe to run long distance in oodles with space basically lots of Flex for the toes comes back up I get good lock down across the midfoot no problem there we've got these tongues that they're sort of quite loose they're sort of knitted they just take the edge off but they aren't maybe as padded as some you do have to make sure you get them in the right place into the heel colar I think you've got exactly the same heel package as you got in the 26 and they hold well there's lots of plush padding which creates Good Foot security little bit of a heel counter here that's not too stiff but very present holds you nicely I had no slipping no problems with lockdown and I would recommend going TR size in these shoes so fit for me has been very good overall in the gel nus 27 I've got mine in a UK size 8 that's my typical running shoe size that's generally the shoe size that works best for me in aex shoes that's the same shoe size that I had the jamus 25 in I didn't test the gbus 26 now like my experience with the jbus 25 given I've got quite skinny narrow feet I would say the fit is naturally very Ry and accommodating and you know for me that's been absolutely fine given also that there is a wider fit option here but I think for most people going for that standard fit is going to be generally fine I think you know when I talk about that room I think that's particularly in the middle section of the shoe I think in the toe box as well where I think personally I would take maybe things being rained in a little bit to give you something that sits a little bit closer but I think you know it hasn't been an issue having that kind of roomy kind of spacious toe box for me in my running time I think other things to mention here I think in terms of getting a good lock down here I think it it does take a little bit of work here I think you know given the material which is quite skinny and stretchy and that kind of stretchy tongue you're getting here I do find you have to pull them in quite tightly those laces to get a good kind of lock down there when you get further back into the shoe you've got a fair amount of padding there I think you know particularly in the inside of the heel collar the um kind of heel counter is you know it's a pretty flexible one didn't cause any kind of irritation for me at my achilles and there definitely some elements there creating that kind of supportive kind of comfort um at your getting at the hill of the shoe so yeah overall very good fit for me as I said I personally would take something maybe that's sat a little bit closer to my feet but I think in terms of my running time it has been absolutely fine and I think unless you want a really spacious roomy kind of wider fit option going for that standard fit option and going true to size should be absolutely fine for most people so the fit for me in the gel numberers 27 I have a size 8 foot uh I also have very average with feet I don't tend to have problems with shoes very often um the gel number is 27 absolutely perfect there's plenty of space in the 4 foot for me um it's not the widest shoe in the world but it's definitely wide enough on my feet and they are pretty average there is a wider version of the shoe as well so uh you can get that but for me with my average width feet and average sized feet for uh a size H shoe uh is absolutely fine very very comfortable I had no issues I really like the upper design um there's a little bit of giv it so it's quite comfortable around the sides of the foot and there's loads of padding in it as well it's definitely a shoe designed for Comfort I would definitely stay to my sides in the GEL Nimbus 27 run test then and in testing I've logged around 40 km in the GEL Nimbus 27 lots of slow and easy which is largely the intended purpose for this shoe but I've thrown in some faster miles as well tried building to a bit of Marathon Pace on a progression run just to see how they pick up now the big difference here is obviously that extra 2 Ms of softer tuned cushioning that aex has managed to add to the stack without increasing the overall weight and that does change the ride somewhat between the 26 and the 27 but essentially what you get is a shoe that stays pretty true I think to the Nimbus Heritage delivers a plush soft cushioned Comfort ride that's happiest when you're moving slower ticking out those got an easy miles it's not like the Nimbus 26 wasn't cushioned and plush an impact eating but the 27 now offers more of that there's more protection more softness more Long Haul comfort and I think there's also a smidge More Bounce and energy coming back from the midsole as well not enough to make me want to run a lot of marathon pace miles in this shoe which is generally a bit heavy uh it's ultimately still a heavier shoe but you can do marathon pace miles if you really need to though it's a bit harder work for the legs I find now I also did a side by-side Mile with the 26 on one foot and the 27 on the other and wait Wi on the run I think the shoes feel the same there's perhaps a touch less stability in the numers 27 because you've got the extra softness and you've got a bit higher off the ground but it's still a big wide stable shoe stable platform to run off I really like the uppers I think the changes are a step on there's a bit more structure to the jackard than you've got with the knit it's a minor difference here overall in terms of how it wraps the foot and overall I wouldn't say one is more comfortable than the other but I do like the more premium feel and I think it looks nicer than you've got with the old 26 knit I still generally prefer less shoe on the F something lighter and more compact for most of my runs but I still think this generation of the nimus delivers a happy cushion ride that if that's your thing you'll still really enjoy so in terms of my running time in the G num is 27 I would say overall it's been very comfortable I would say it's been a very reliable shoe to run in it's a very stable shoe um to kind of spend time in you know runs very smoothly as well I do think there are some changes here from the the previous gimbus which I tested the gimbus 25 and given that the gimbus 26 was really around kind of changes with the outsole the cor exp has been very similar to The Joe numers 25 I think there as I said some changes here that I think do make a nicer shoe to be one that you are you know is designed to absorb a lot of your running time this is a cushion shoe a cushion daily Trainer shoe that for me very much ve on that kind of easy kind of recovery Pace but I have found I've been able to run at more moderate running Paces in this shoe and it hasn't felt you know totally kind of awkward to do that but I do think this is a shoe built for those kind of you know when your legs are tied and you are doing those kind of easier runs and maybe kind of longer runs as well you're not running at your hardest or fastest now one of the big changes here is you're getting a little bit more of that FF blast Eco um foam here which is you know used in the super Blast 2 but not on its own and then you know we've seen with the Nova blast 5 you know asex has moved away from the um Eco plus kind of phone and use that kind of new FF blast Max phone which is definitely softer compared to this now having that extra you know you know stack of that foam doesn't make it a inherently kind of plusher shoe than the previous shoes I think you know gives you I would say a lot more protection and you know that would be the main quality I would say I think the biggest change for me has been really about where that foam you know is setting and I feel like the geometry of the shoe the slight changes for me have made it a nice issue to run in I think as I said for those Paces those easy recovery Paces I just found the num 25 the ride felt a little bit dull for me I don't think it rolled through as nicely and I feel like that has changed for me with eel Nimbus 27 I I think as I said I have been able to run kind of more moderate Paces in this and it's felt comfortable to do that it would be better if it was a lighter shoe and I think that would give it a touch more versatility but I do think overall it's been a nicer shoe and I think for me some improvements from the gers 25 for me I think out so wise I think there's not a huge you know major difference for me I run in a mixture of dry and wet conditions and for me I think you know this isn't the best outsole grip that you're going to get on a cushion daily train of shoe but I think it offers enough for me I think given you know how most people are probably going to use this shoe and as I say you know you know ticking off a lot of your training Mars when you're not running at your fastest then I think it's going to be generally fine I would be sticking to roads and Pavements maybe handling a little bit of those going to Li to Trails so yeah my experience has been very good overall very much feels like a Gel Nimbus I do think the real story here that the geometry has changed and made it a nicer shoe to tick that running time off and I do think makes it a nicer shoe for me than the joers 205 is it the cushioned you know or the best kind of aex cushioned daily Trainer shoe you should get I'll get into that in the verdict and more so the GEL Nimbus line or the last two versions of it which were the updated versions of the shoe the previous versions uh I never really got on with but the last two versions um I've I've always enjoyed uh I've always found them to be shoes that do what they say on the tin they're comfortable daily shoe you can do easy runs in them recovery runs longer runs um the changes to this version of the shoe essentially from uh the perspective of the experience of the ride is is that midsole a little bit extra midsole foam in there um and for me it doesn't massively change the the ride I'm getting a very similar experience to what I got from the previous two versions of the shoe I think it probably does feel a little bit softer because you get a little bit more of that mid foam in there but for me the um the way I run in the shoe I'm a midfoot striker uh so I'm hitting it right in the middle um the way the geometry of the shoe works uh and the previous two versions of the shoe I don't get much of a roll through in this shoe it's a very comfortable shoe to wear but I I just don't get any sort of transition or comfortable transition um that makes it in any way versatile it still is a very Slappy shoe for me um not as Slappy as the first uh well the the 25 that was the Slappy version of the the new versions of the shoe um it's not as Slappy as that but is quite Slappy for me and I think the reason is that it does have this quite flat bottom section of the shoe I know Nick is a heel Striker so he's probably benefiting a lot more from this big wedge of um mopo at the back for me I'm hearing it dead on this flat section uh and I'm not really getting any sort of transition from it that's not a massively bad thing if you're just buying this shoe for comfort and those easy day runs those longer sessions where you just want Comfort um the runs that I've done in it I've not found it to be particularly versatile it's fine it's comfortable it's nicely stable for um a Max stack shoe uh and as a result it's probably quite accessible for a lot of people who want a load of cushioning but don't necessarily want a really wobbly or or soft shoe uh which can be the case with a lot of Max stack shoes at the moment so over those runs what I've really found about the shoe is that is very much the same as what I've experienced in those pre two two previous versions it's a solid shoe that is just very good for comfort and and everything about the shoe really screams Comfort the upper the the way the midell sits um I did try and pick up the pace in it on a couple of runs didn't really enjoy it one because I really started slapping it quite hard I was actually one point where my girlfriend was about two streets away walking the dog and she saids she could hear me um coming back home so it is quite a loud shoe from that perspective and it really does when you pick up the pace uh I I really start hitting that midsection really hard um so for longer runs I think it's uh I've only got up to 15K in this shoe but for that it was really nice I don't think about this shoe on my feet when it's on there it just feels very comfortable I don't have to worry about the stability of the shoe or anything like that so I think really it's a shoe that is quite nicely balanced if you're looking for a lot of cushioning whereas that's not always the case with these Max stack shoes the outside of the shoe uh it does have quite a lot of exposed areas from that from that midsole foam um the rubber itself is is fine I wouldn't say it's the grippiest outsole on any shoe I've tested but I haven't had any problems on it uh on wet Pavements uh the exposed section here I've not seen any issues on it so far but that does concern me a little bit because this rubber doesn't go out very far from the midell foam so that is just a concern which I think I'll just keep an eye on as I continue to use these shoes all in all though uh outsole is fine just nothing that impressive when compared to some of the better outsoles on the market so I done about 60k in the ax ja Nimbus 27 Now using for a mix of easy and long runs and one progression run move from an easy to slightly faster Paces by the end and on my first run I'd say that the main update that aex had really done to the shoe was to bring it out in teal and send me a teal shoe which is a smart thing to do it immediately made me like the shoe a lot more than previous versions just straight away cuz teal is the best color we all know this but actually I didn't think it' Chang much at all on the run like it has got a little bit of a higher stack heite but in that first run I thought yeah it's a nimbus it's nice comfortable it's protective cushy solid enough job but actually as I've done more runs in the shoe and done different types of runs in the shoe I started to like it a bit more I do think it actually is know a sneakily big upgrade on the previous models of the shoe so you got a little bit more stack heite there which doesn't add too much really in terms of the overall comfort of the shoe it was already a very comfortable shoe but I think the extra end of the foref foot is important and I think actually the geometry has been changed a bit more on the shoe and that's what's made me enjoy it a bit more especially as a heel Striker I think you've now got a much smoother transition from Heel To Toe like I get quite a Slappy ride with the Jo nus 25 and 26 and actually it sometimes even create a bit of discomfort coming through on the shoe and I think it's definitely been smoothed out here I really noticed it when I was running at slightly faster Paces in the shoe and I did that easy to steady run like in the previous models you know as I started to increase the speed it would feel quite Slappy and it wouldn't feel great at all like it's not really the best shoe for speedwork still because it's quite heavy and big it definitely felt less Slappy and more comfortable to me like it's still slightly Slappy shoe but definitely less Slappy than previous models and I do think the heel has been redesigned to just ride a bit more smoothly and I really did notice that as a heel strike and it made it a lot more enjoyable on long runs and then when I was moving a slightly faster Paces at all so like I said I did that easy to steady run pretty standard daily training run but moving down towards almost marathon pace by the end and I thought you know this is going to feel a bit unpleasant in the shoe cuz it is quite big but no not at all I think it's got a stiffer and faster ride than I think I expected and you'd probably expect from a shoe like this I'm not going to say it's a superv style shoe that I'd love to go do a load of speedwork in it but I do think it now has a bit more hostility to it and even as a heavy shoe uh I think it does work as you know a daily trainer for people who want to really cush and ride but one a shoe that can then do kind of tempo effort you know the odds kind of long session long long runs that kind of thing I think it you can do them okay in the ja nus 27 if you're not that fuss about those kind you're not someone like me who's someone who have a rotation have a dedicated speed work shoe for those kind of runs if you just want you know one shoe to do lots of different kinds of runs then the Nimbus 27 is actually better than than I expected for such a big shoe while obviously really excelling on those nice relaxed easy runs as well because of the comfort you have underf foot like I say the ride is a little bit stiffer than I expected and some people might not like that so much an easy shoe but I think it probably the kind of thing that breaks in a little bit like it's eased a bit over the first few runs already and I didn't find it uncomfortable at all but yeah it's probably a slightly different feeling than you might expect from a shoe like this when you step into it you're not getting that soft squishy feeling you get on some of these Big Max cushion shoes like the 1080 line or the Nike Invincible or something like that like it has a bit of firmness to it and resiliency while still being really comfortable and that I think does help with the smoothness and the speediness of the transition from Heel To Toe which is something that I find comfortable like it's not really the definition of comfort but have that smooth and natural transition from Heel To Toe that just means I can tick over without thinking about the shoe too much is almost how I Define Comfort on those easy and long runs and the Jo nimbers for such a big shoe does disappear on the foot nicely so after you know prettyy standard first run that I thought was going to be much the same as previous models I've actually ended up really enjoying the gimbus 27 more than I expected I think it's a really natural feeling shoe for such a big shoe and you do get a little bit more versatility than you might expect and yeah it comes in teal so that's fantastic so my ver on the ax GEL Nimbus 27 is that this is a very solid update to the Gel Nimbus line and for me personally it does feel like an upgrade on the previous gel nimas shoes I think particularly from a ride point of view you and I think if you are looking for a shoe that is very comfortable very protective I think very stable and you know you know can really help you kind of tick off that running mileage then this is a shoe absolutely can do it I think if you're looking for your first running shoe this is a good option if you're looking for a good long run shoe this is going to fit the bill as well I think when you look at the other kind of cushion daily trainer shoes and asx's kind of range of shoes I think there becomes a bit of a problem I think you know look at the Nova blast 5 which is cheaper and I think you would use for the same types of runs as the gel number 27 which is a more expensive shoe I think that is a shoe that can work for long runs as well I think gives you that comfort as well and that protection in a slightly different way but I still think in a very effective way I do think there are super Blast 2 qualities in the GEL Nimbus but that's really around the midsole and you know when you look at what you get in the super Blast 2 and you know it just has a quicker feel to it has a lighter you know overall weight as well is apparently a more versatile shoe compared to the jail ners 27 I think if you look outside the aex range I think it becomes a problem as well again for the Jael nimbers particularly around the the midso foam and just having other midsole Foams that are just a bit more enjoyable just has a little bit more fun about it I think you look at what you're getting in kind of you know Brooks's range particularly at the moment I think you look at saky as well what you're getting from New Balance as well so I think you know from that point of view at this kind of range this type of shoe maybe aex is playing a little bit of catch up is falling a little bit behind but crucially it does have something in the Nova blast 5 and I think that FF blast Max phone which I think probably for me will probably end up in the ja Nimbus some way down the line if not you know very soon the Next Generation the ja Nimbus but for me I've had a very good experience with the G Nimbus 27 I do think it's Improvement on the G nimus 25 which I tested and the g nimus 26 which you know wasn't massively changed from the Jus 25 and I think if you like the JIS range the most recent range and you like the idea of something that just has a little bit more of a noticeable kind of you know rocker and ride in it then I think that's what you're going to get in the jail number 27 if you're looking for the best kind of value cushion daily Trainer shoe the most memorable shoe this is probably not it but I do think a lot of people are going to like what you get from the GEL Nimbus 27 to my verdict on the aex GEL Nimbus 27 I think it's pretty much more of the same of what you're getting from the previous two versions of the Jael Nimbus line it's a very stable comfortable um accessible shoe if you're looking for easy runs longer runs um recovery runs that sort of thing I don't think it's particularly versatile still I don't think the updates that have been made to the Midol foam have had a dramatic impact on its versatility I would pretty much only ever use this for those easier runs daily runs are I'm going out ticking off the miles and I'm not really bothered about the speed for me that's probably going to be about 5 minute kilm 5 minute 15 km feel spying at those Paces picking up the pace in this getting down to like 4:30 doesn't feel very comfortable doesn't feel like it wants to do that and definitely I don't get a lot of um smooth transition from the the geometry of the shoe it feels very much like I'm landing on it it's comfy and then I'm pushing off again it doesn't feel like there's any sort of comfortable smooth transition uh from this from this geometry there are a lot of alternatives to the shoe and at £10 this is quite an expensive shoe I know a lot of shoes are getting quite expensive now but I've always thought the nimus line is a very expensive shoe for what you get from it for me um I'd look at something like the new band Mo V5 is considerably cheaper than shoe little bit softer now um but I just get better transition from that shoe I feel like um it just smoothly Glides me forward as I'm maintaining a nice consistent Pace at like 5 minute 20 or something like that um and I get a lot more of that transition from that shoe um so I definitely go some like newbound more V5 for my style of running over the over the Nimbus uh I think that she was like 108 v14 quite similar in a lot of ways to this shoe um but I do think that the um 1080 is a little bit more versatile in the more recent version it just has a little bit of a smoother RVE for me and just feels a little bit lighter on the feet and then something like the um Brook ler in Max I think is very similar in this shoe to a lot of ways um but the only difference is I just think it's a little bit more versatile not massively but I would prefer that shoe to this shoe if I was doing very training sessions in it and I wanted something maybe from marathon training or something like this uh I probably would Reserve would use this shoe primarily always for those easy runs or uh daily runs where I'm getting up to about 15K or something but I definitely would try and do anything faster in this shoe so I definitely enjoyed my time in the axd on Imus 27 I think it's one of the better Big Max cushion shoes out there probably put it in line with the sakon hurcan 24 is my favorite of these Big Max cushion shoes which are not generally the kind of shoes I go for like even on my easy runs long runs I tend to prefer to be in something that's a little bit smaller and lighter and just a bit more Dynamic and ticks over a bit better but the Jo 27 is certainly would be a contender for my iritation if I was going to have you know a big Max cushion shoe in there it would be between this and the suc Hurrican 24 which also thing is an excellent shoe that runs a lot lighter than it is has a nice rocker has a little bit of resiliency to push against and that's build more as a stability shoe and has maybe you a few more stability features but the gel 27 is also a very stable shoe for a neutral shoe and yeah wouldn't really you know worry about it on that front at all despite the high stack so yeah a really good shoe I think a nice update on the previous model I still think the previous model is more similar than different to this shoe I prefer the ride on this shoe for sure and I'd get it over the Jael ners 25 or 26 if there was only a little price difference if you are finding the older shoe at a massive discount then I'd probably still get that because that is still a good comfortable easyday shoe but at the same time I do think this is a better shoe and one I enjoyed a lot more than the previous model so I do think it's a successful update despite the fact it felt like quite a minor update to me initially also in the attics range you have the NOA blast of course now the no blast 5 I really like as well I think that's a good shoe that also had I think a redesigned heel bevel this year that made it a smoother riding shoe no blast is still really cushioned that's probably the shoe I'd go for as more of a generalist cushion daily trainer like it's a lot lighter than the ja num 27 has a bit more versatility they're both really good shoes I think they almost do quite similar jobs so I'd just get the lighter shoe and the no blast and the cheaper shoe as well but if you're a slightly heavier Runner or really crave like loads of cushioning under fo then the ja nimus 27 I think does a really good job and we'll provide that at that slightly higher price few other shoes you know in this big Max cushion Market I think the 1080 v14 is a lighter shoe and a slightly smaller shoe and that feels a bit more Dynamic and maybe has a slightly more exciting phone than the G Nimbus 27 I think that's another one that I think has a bit more versatility and almost feels more like a similar Feud to the Nova blast the de Nimbus these days for me because it is a little bit lower stack and feels a bit more like a cushion daily trainer this feels bit more build just as a Max stack shoe even though I do think it is a bit more verstile than you might expect I think I prefer it to some like Su Triumph 22 which is just not a shoe I really got on with that well there's a Brooks Glycerin Mac which is a bit more expensive and you know has quite a similar Vibe actually a big Max cushion shoe a bit of resiliency there you probably got a livel foone with the glycerin Max but you're paying a bit more for it and don't necessarily think it's a much better shoe for faster runs or anything like that and the Nimbus 27 is certainly as good if not a little bit better for just allout easy runs so yeah that' be a bit of a toss up there's a glycerin 22 coming as well which looks interesting so all around I think this is one of the better Max cushion shoes out there for sure it's probably one of my favorites like I say with the sakon Huracan 24 just got a ride that is big and cushioned but turns over nice and speedily feels quite natural has more versatility than you expect and is nice and smooth from Heel To Toe with a little bit reduced slapp compared to previous models so a successful update for me the SX Jo Nimbus 27 verdict then Nimbus fans are going to like this Nimbus because this is textbook Nimbus just soft and more cushioned without adding any extra weight that's a trend I think we're going to see a lot of the stack Heights rise across many shoes with new light performance Foams coming across the lineups for me the Nimbus is a shoe it's a bit limited on versatility I'd only tend to use it for my slowest runs I think that's still the case despite there being a little bit extra energy out the midso it wasn't great at marathon pace but the Nimbus 27 does an equally good job as the 26 for that easy slow Comfort running if you wanted more Kush than the nimus 26 offered you'll absolutely love this shoe if you prefer things a little stiffer then I'd stick with the nus 26 if you own the 26 I wouldn't rush out and buy the 27 until you need to the changes aren't that pronounced the other plus I think is the numers 27 feel built a last this is a shoe that should have long mileage lifespan and even if that phone bottoms out a bit I think it's still going to be more cushion than many shoes out there if you like your easy Run shoes to also pack a bit more versatility though I think the new Nova blast 5 might be worth a look probably not as sort of overall cushion but it's got a little bit more softness I personally like the Brooks ghost Max 2 which is a bit snappier but it's not as cushion and sof as the nimus 27 I also think the New Balance 1080 v14 now offers sort of nimus style easy Comfort but maybe a bit more energy as well that's it from us on this review of the asex gel niers 27 thanks a lot for watching don't forget to like subscribe and click that little bell and if you're going to catching below you can find into our podcast which comes out a couple of times each month thanks lot for watching catch you next time [Music]\n\nFrom video 'Asics Gel-Nimbus 27 | The Running Event 2024':\n\nall right hi this is Meg with believing the run and today I'm at the A6 booth at the running event with Paul Paul Lang Paul what's your title uh senior Global product manager performance running okay that feels shorter than I think it actually is but uh we are going to chat about the new Nimbus 27 yeah let's do it so first of all what are the updates so this has always been the queen of cushion for us so for this version we're going to give you a little bit more cush but it's deceptive so you still see that FF blast Eco label right there yeah it's not the same foam as it was last time even though it has the same name so it's a new recipe we talked about it on the Pod you know all the Foams are kind of like baking a cookie we rebake this one and so it's the same weight that we were in the previous version but we've got two extra millimet of Stack under the foot so it's a lighter weight formulation we're giving you more cushion at the same weight you know I like more Stacks so that's going to make me happy know to the moon so what is the what's the actual height in the heel here so the rear foot is going to be 43 1/2 and then we're offset at 8 so we go down to 35 1/2 in the 4ot okay so new formulation feel similar what are like the main differences yeah so the goal was we didn't want it to be any heavier but we wanted to see if we give a little bit more cushion so it's going to be soft it's going to be plush um it's going to be a little bit more breathable so if you remember the last couple versions had that knit upper to it so we've gone to this jaquard using monofilament fibers it's a little bit more breathable than what it was but what we kept that people love that knit ribbed collar the knit pull tab the knit tongue so the idea is when you put Nimbus on it kind of envelops the foot you feel that super soft plush cushion and that's before you even take your first step and then with that additional stack that new foam it's just going to feel even softer and more plush so this is your high cushion kind of Premium driver you know if you want to feel fast and bouncy we'll get you an Nova blast if you want something soft and a little bit of a different experience that's what gel Nas 27's about okay so you have a broken down version of the shoe here because it is a gel nimus talk to us about the gel part of it even with this great foam we've still got that gel piece that sits in that rear heel and so the idea is for shock attenuation you know when that foot initially hits the ground takes that shock spreads it out all over the midso so the foam can really absorb it and give you that good cushion that you want so even though it's only this little tiny bit in here it still does all that work yeah so that's the idea rear foot Strikers are going to come in down there and you just kind of see that shock spread out into the shoe this knit tongue is like maybe my favorite feature of this whole shoe although I am excited to try out this new foam formulation um that sounds exciting what is the release date and the price point of this guy the us it's going to come out in January for $165 okay all right thanks com soon you're welcome\n\nFrom video 'ASICS Gel Nimbus 27 First Run: ASICS' easy miler brings more cush to your easy miles':\n\nhey people welcome to the Run testers welcome to a wet and windy and stormy UK there's been severe weather warnings not for London but all around it's pretty miserable I'm about to head out and do my first run though in the ASX Jael n 27 which arrived just now got to keep testing wead to bring you the videos can't stop for the weather so let's get out there in the mix and see how we get on so let's give you a really quick look at what's new and some of the key details with the aex Joe nimas 27 starting with the stack and that's where the biggest change happens the asex Joe Nimbus 27 stack height now comes in at an increased 43.5 m in the hill 35.5 m in the 4 foot for an 8 mil drop which is the same but that's 2 mm more midsole foam across the foot using the same flight foam blast Eco plus foam but with a tweak recipe that allows for more cushion without adding weight speaking of weight the nimbers 27 weighs in at 10.8 o or 307 G in my UK men's 8 A2 that's marginally light than the Nimbus 26 despite that extra stack which asex says will add even more softness and plushness to the cushioning for those longer easier runs which is what this shoe is primarily designed for now the ners 27 moves to a jackard mesh Upper from the knit uppers that we saw in the 26 a little more structure here to these new uppers which feels a bit more premium as well and like they won't hold as much water as the knit did on the 26 now the heel package and the tongues stay the same and they've got the details like the heel pool here and a heel pool and that's sorry the pull on the tongue they're all still here us price also stays the same at $165 we don't have the UK price at the time recording this but we'll add that to the caption as soon as we have it we'll bring it into the review when we do but this is the new ASX Jo nus 27 so I've just done my first run in the asex Joel Nimbus 27 now the major difference here obviously is that extra 2 Ms of Mile foam this tuned slightly softer and more cushion that's across the B some of that mids salt across the whole foot you do notice it they are softer I've also done like a side by side mile I've got them both on at the moment with the Nimbus 26 and you do feel the extra softness into the 27 it does make a difference I mean it's not like the limbus 26 wasn't cushioned and plush and brought that kind of Road eating impact protection anyway but the 27 are going to offer more of that crucially you know as says they've managed to add this extra stack Without Really adding too much extra weight and the feel on the foot is the same in terms of the weight these are both big kind of sort hulking heavy shoes big plush padded heel collars you know maximum kind of comfort for long miles that is still here in the 27 but you will notice just a bit more cushioning a bit more Road eating there's a little bit more sort of cushion protection overall I do find in that first run I'm think there's a little bit more return as well bit more spring back maybe a little bit more bounce into the 27 whereas you're going to get a little bit kind of more stiffness in the 26 I think if you like the 26 I don't I think you're not going to like the 27 there may be a little bit less stability it's not a huge amount but with that higher stack you do feel higher off the ground than you would with the 26 that might be a a point of difference here that will make a difference for some people I don't particularly find that there was too much to choose and I've just done a happy mile but with one sh on each foot and it didn't really notice difference too much I took the 27 through their Paces from on tried to do a six mile progression run uh where I sort of up paced if one of the miles I did was just faster than my Marathon Pac sort of 630 you know it's kind of place there there's a bit of Bounce a bit of energy they can do that but you wouldn't want to do too many miles like that the mile after that I was struggling and when I got up running that fast I certainly felt a little bit more of a hot spot under foot from you know on under the kind of main sort ball of my foot so that was something for the high pce obviously they're not really designed for that but I like to test them just to see overall I think you're getting more of the same here with the 27 nice new uppers I think they do add a little bit if you there a little bit less Flex maybe in the knit they're not tight or More Hugging this still plenty of room plenty spacious toe box here these are built to give you space to run long in Comfort there's a bit more structure I think to the jackard than you get in the knit minor differences here but overall I wouldn't say one is more comfortable than the other I do like the more premium feel of the jaak card I think it looks nicer I think it's a bit more protective in the wet won't hold as much water perhaps as the knit which is another point of difference but overall com comfort and hold all of those kind of things I think you're going to get a very similar ride here the main change as I said is down to that mid Sole and if you were looking for a little bit more softness then the 27's going to deliver it if you already own a pair of 26 I wouldn't massively quickly run out and go and get a 27 I think this is going to be one of those shoes that you're going to want to upgrade basically when it's time if you want to go from 26 to 27 yeah I I don't know if you really like the way the 26 is now and you didn't want more softness then I'd stick with 26 if you were looking for a little bit more softness even more cushion and more stack then the 27 is going to be the way to go so first impressions on the Nimbus 27 from the first 10K that I've just done there in about an hour it's more of the same for me I think you're getting a shoe that's very very similar there there are changes here aesthetically the shoes look very similar you've got a little bit more stack obviously got those changed uppers the heel package and everything Remains the Same you got that same Comfort got the same tongues so the main difference here is in that little bit of cushioning on the ride I I personally don't think it changes how I would use these shoes I would use the 27 and the 26 for the same kind of runs which is basically my easiest slowest runs where I want to have the most cushion protection the most kind of Road impact eating where I'm going nice and slow and I just want guaranteed super plushness super Comfort I think that is going to be exactly the same here for the 27 so yeah if you're only 26 I wouldn't rush out and upgrade if you're looking for a really sort of super cushioned plush long easy or just easy r run shoe and I think the Jo ners 27 is very competent very capable feels good on the foot it's sort of a happy slow and easy mile shoe it's also probably a positive that they've stuck at the same price at least in the US we will reserve the verdict for and the comparisons to the other shoes until we've done the full review the other run testers will have it and then we'll give you a little bit more about how this Stacks up against other kind of super plush chrisan shoes but my first run in it I think business as usual for the Nimbus and if you like the Nimbus range then you're going to like this as well let give you a quick word on fit then and I think this is pretty much more of the same as the asex Joe nimus 27 you've got really ample room at the end of the toe box nice amount of clearance across the top of the toes there's plenty of flex these jackard uppers are a bit more structured than you got with the knit from the 26 but this is still a really roomy happy shoe to run long distance in Oodles of space basically lots of Flex for the toes comes back up I get good lock down across the midfoot no problem there we've got these tongues that they're sort of quite loose they're sort of knitted they just take the edge off but they aren't maybe as padded as some you do have to make sure you get them in the right place into the heel collar I think you've got exactly the same heel package as you got in the 26 and they hold well there's lots of plush padding which creates Good Foot security little bit of a heel counter here that's not too stiff but very present holds you nicely I had no slipping no problems with lock down and I would recommend going true to size in these shoes that has been my first run in the aex Joe nimbus 7 we'll do loads of more testing the other guys will try and get these shoes on their feet to bring you the full multi- tester verdict in the full review that will be coming soon if you want to know something about the shoe hit us up in the comments below tell us what you'd like us to work out find out we'll go and see if we can answer those questions uh otherwise go check out loads of other shoe content on the channel we've got some really good top picks that we've done a series

a young was too much to C with why you think the BX nickname and cook should have been called D robbery staring I maybe Grand lony I didn't\n\nFrom video 'Brooks Glycerin Max':\n\nwhen it comes to running shoes softness is a deceptively complex feature and previously Brooks's take on softness for me personally always felt uncomfortably firm but this is the new glycerin Max with its new foam and bold design will this be the max cushion Brooks that I've always been wanting it's time to lace up the glycerin Max and take it for a run [Music] yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm a non Elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the allnew Brooks Glycerin Max but before I give you my thoughts on this shoe I do want to go over some disclosures this is a pair of shoes that Fleet Feet sent to me for the purpose of review so I did not have to pay for these shoes however nobody's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the Brooks Glycerin Max and let's start with the specs this is a tall shoe 45 mm of total stack height in the heel with a 6 mm drop giving you 39 mm of Stack height in the 4 foot and the main story for this shoe at least for me is that they're using an all new foam in this shoe Brooks calls this foam DNA tuned it's a Nitro based foam which means they're using nitrogen gas is part of the manufacturing process and it's kind of a two foam system in a way it seems to me like it's all kind of like one piece of foam but there are two different size cells that they're using in the foam itself and by cells there're using little beads of material Source material compressing it and heating it up to a very high level and then injecting the gas in it and that makes bubbles and then they're using larger cells or larger bubbles in the heel of the shoe and then smaller bubbles in the forefoot and Brooks tells me that the reason for that is that the larger cell foam gives them more cushiness more softness and then the smaller cell foam is more tightly compressed and packed together and so that's going to give you a little bit more sense of Bounce and I think there's two main things that are notable about this one is that I'm excited when ever Brooks experiments with new Foams they're notoriously a little bit reluctant or conservative when it comes to experimenting with their shoes especially for a storyed line from Brooks like the glycerin and that's why I think there's this glycerin Max which is an offshoot that lets them play around a little bit more but the other thing that's notable about this is that it switches the Paradigm that Brooks typically uses in their shoes so like at least in older shoes like the shoes that I first started testing in Brooks which would have been like the Brooks ghost 10 several years years ago they flipped it around where the firmer foam was in the heel and the softer foam was in the forefoot and the idea being when you come crashing down on that heel they needed that part of the shoe to be firmer so they could better absorb the full force of your foot and body hitting the ground and then inevitably because of that 12 mm drop when your foot slapped down you needed to have a soft material to absorb the impact from that Heel To Toe slapping that a 12 mm drop can create for some people like it did for me now it's reversed where the softer foam is in the heel so you have a softer Landing if you are a heel Striker and then as you're rolling forward you're bouncing and pushing off of a more responsive foam and that whole motion is aided by what Brooks calls its Glide roll rocker geometry in other words the front of the shoe is carved a little bit so that way it helps you roll forward and this large stack height is a little bit easier for your foot to manage now to protect all this fo Brooks has put a bunch of rubber on the outsole it's not full coverage rubber outsole so we're not looking at some of those old Brooks ghost 10 uh there is some exposed foam in here to help shed weight and make it easier for this foam to bend and squish uh but also there is plenty of rubber where there is rubber on the shoe so not only do I think that this foam based on the way they've made it is going to last a long time I think this rubber is also going to give you plenty of grip for a long time as well moving to the upper I think that the design on this shoe is fantastic and the upper is very comfortable as Brooks uppers always tend to be we're using a pretty standard material for a Brooks shoe in the upper here uh the tongue I think is pulled straight from uh Brooks ghost uh and there is a decent amount of padding in the back of the heel and into this Achilles flare a little bit more padding than I would have liked to have seen uh and there's also a lot of structure in this heel cup again more than I would have liked to have seen but something that's pretty common for shoes in this category of Max cushion shoe and overall I do really like the design I also really enjoy this Brooks logo that they put on the side of this shoe it's over the top and it definitely adds unnecessary weight but I do think it overall adds to the aesthetic that makes this probably the best looking Brooks shoe that I've ever seen now Brooks tells me that this shoe comes in at a weight of 10.5 o for their reference size but I am reference size and my size n that Brook sent to me came in a little bit heavier coming in at 10.8 Oz or 308 G now that we've talked about what the shoe is like on paper let's talk about what it's like on foot and I got to say the Brooks Glycerin Max is the max cushion shoe from Brooks that I've always been waiting for I love the amount of cushion and softness that I'm feeling in this shoe I'm feeling absolutely pampered every time I put my foot into it the softness here is what I think softness should be every time my foot hits the ground I feel like I'm compressing the foam really nicely it's absorbing the impact of my foot strike and then I'm rolling through with that gly roll rocker geometry and then the foam is decompressing and giving me a nice pleasant amount of Pop as I head into the next step I feel like it's a very modern shoe and a very comfortable shoe I feel like they're using technology to the runner's benefit in it it's comfortable it's going to be great on feet for a long period of time whether you're running a recovery run or looking to set a longdistance PR this is a very comfortable shoe to be in it's also looks great and very comfortable for all day casual wear the one thing that I wouldn't do in this shoe is take it for workouts it is a heavy shoe with my size 9 weighing in over 300 G and over 10 o by a hefty margin uh you can do things like uh strides where you're picking up the pace for a very short bursts of time and the actual speed really isn't the point of strides but anything that's longer than strides in terms of picking up the pace workouts I really would reach for something else uh and and save the Brooks Glycerin Max for a day where I just want to have a comfortable experience now there is a quite wide footprint on this shoe as well and so that's going to help the shoe from getting too unstable when your foot hits the ground so without having traditional stability elements the shoe does have some stability or motion control kind of built into it I didn't find this to be a problem and I felt like the shoe was ultimately quite comfortable and it all made sense to me but for those of you who are traditional glycerin fans you might find this shoe to be a little bit too mushy and a little bit too wobbly so you might want to stay away from something that's this soft I went true to size for my glycerin Max and that worked out really well for me if you're familiar with Brooks I would go with your normal Brooks sizing [Music] now before we wrap up this video let's take a step back and look at the Brooks lineup a little bit more generally to see where the glycerin Max fits in and right now with Brooks they have pretty much an entire lineup of Max shoes so let's try and make a lineup using that with the daily trainer we have the ghost Max which is the ghost that I've always wished that Brooks would make and so that's going to be the kind of centerpiece of a Brooks lineup if you like the Max shoes and then I think for workouts a shoe that you can hop into is another Max shoe and that's the Hyperion Max I think that would go over here that's something you could use whever you want to go a little bit faster than you might want to go in your ghost or ghost Max that's where I reached for the Hyperion Max the Hyperion being one of my favorite shoes that Brooks had ever made at the time that it first came out now there's a Max version of it a little bit more stack height a little bit more softness to it but still very much a speed oriented shoe not a shoe that I would necessarily reach for for every day but for the fast days that's when I'd reach for the Hyperion Max and then the glycerin Max fits in on the other side of the spectrum over here for those days where you want to be on feet for a long time and as comfortable as possible this is where I would reach for the glycerin Max now for racing there is the Hyperion Elite shoe and technically that would fit over here it has a carbon plate in it and it's even lighter the upper is absolutely fantastic very minimal padding very floppy heel cup the kind of things that I want to see when I want to go fast but I don't actually love this shoe and I think that this rotation is better served if you just leave it at these three shoes use the ghost Max for every day glycerin Max for Recovery days and long runs and then you reach for your Hyperion Max for your workouts and for your racing I think right now the Hyperion Max is the best racing shoe that Brooks makes now Chicago marathon was earlier this week and I did just see it what looked like maybe perhaps just a color update but I think there's a little bit more to that story I don't have any information that's been confirmed yet that I can report on so keep an eye out for something new from Brooks in the race category but for now this is the lineup that I would go with and I will note that both the ghost Max and the Hyperion Max do have updates so we're on version two of each of these shoes I have put in a request to Brooks to see if they would send me a pair of those those are all on the way so stay tuned And subscribe if you want to see updates of those videos but this is the Brooks lineup that I am really excited [Music] about now let's wrap up the video by talking about the buying guide and then we'll also go into some Alternatives that you're going to want to consider if you're interested in the glycerin Max the Brooks Glycerin Max is the max cushion shoe that I've always been wanting for Brooks to make and I hope that shoes like this and the ghost Max are signs of shoes to come and not just one-off experiments that languish in the BL labs this is a brand new shoe so there isn't a PRI years version that you might be able to save a couple of bucks on and I also think that this shoe is substantially different than the existing glycerin Series so I don't really feel like these are meaningful substitutes so if you want to get your foot into the new newness from Brooks you're going to be looking at $200 I think that price is a little bit High I wish it were lower than that but let's take a look at some of the competition to see where that $200 Stacks up the first shoe I want to talk about I think is the shoe that is the closest to the glycerin Max and it's also a shoe that I very recently reviewed on the channel and that's from Puma it's the mag Max another Max suffix shoe like the glycerin Max this is a very tall shoe using Nitro based Foams The Source material for the magmax is a little bit different and I think that's the main differentiator between these two shoes well they both look like they could be big cushy comfortable shoes and in many respects they are I do think that the magmax is a little bit bouncier and a little bit less mushy or in other words the glycerin Max is a little bit more comfortable and a little bit more plush but they're both really great examples of the max cushion genre the mag Max though comes in at a $20 discount of 180 bucks and then the other shoe that I don't think really lines up all that well but I think because of the pricing and because of the size of the shoes a lot of you guys have been asking me to compare these two so I will and that's from as6 that's the super Blast 2 these are both very tall shoes that look like they're going to be all day low and slow Cruisers but I actually use these two shoes quite differently the giser max is an excellent example of Max cushion shoe where I don't care about Pace but I'm trying to log time on feet and get those miles in in the most comfortable way possible the super Blast 2 can be used that way and it's pretty good for that but at $200 I think that's overkill for that task the way I love to use the super Blast 2 is for something where I am going to be on feet for a long time but it's a situation where I'm going to want to go fast for an extended period of time now it doesn't have a carbon fiber plate so it's not per se a race shoe but it does have racing foam in it as its main ingredient there's also a daily training foam on the bottom to help kind of stabilize all this foam and keep it from getting too unstable but this is a shoe where if I have a long run where I'm going to be running a lot of marathon pce miles or if I'm going to be doing a workout where the reps are very long this is a really great shoe for for me to be in so it gives me that combination of Max cushion and racing shoe kind of sandwiched into one in a way that on paper doesn't always Mak sense but on foot it just does even then I think that $200 is touch high for what the super blast offers but they both come in at the same price and depending on what you want out of your big shoe I think that's really going to Define which of these two options you're going to pick so those are my thoughts on the Brooks Glycerin Max great job Brooks I really love this one let's see more just like it if you have any questions about this shoe or any of the shoes that I talked about today feel free to put them in the comments down below or better yet stop by the live stream that I do Mondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all I for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see you in the next one yo what's going on [Music] I\n\nUser Question: brooks ghost\n\nPlease provide an answer based on the context above."}],

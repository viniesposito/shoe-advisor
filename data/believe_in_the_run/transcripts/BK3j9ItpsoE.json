  "text": "hi this is thomps with believe in the\nrun this is Megan with believe in the\nRun Megan is a mystery uh it used to be\na mystery it's not a mystery anymore\nit's not a mystery anymore what is it\nthis is the mauno Neo\n[Music]\nZen and when we were handed this they\nwere like hey it's a mystery shoe but\neven then we kind of knew what it was I\ndon't know I kind of thought it was the\nNeo Vista V2 I was knew it didn't have\nthat like Valley with a plate so and I\nmean we'll get into what's in there but\nlet's start up like we normally do from\nthe top let's talk about this upper this\nupper so knit uppers are always a little\ntricky cuz I feel like if you don't get\nit just right it's usually really bad\nbut the good news is I feel like they\nnailed it with this one they did they\ngot it right with a caveat so normally\nI'm a size 10 and a half but this time\nwhen this shoe came I got a 10 and 1/2 I\nfelt like I had too much room up front\nand kind of felt a little sloppy which\nalso affected the fit of the upper for\nmy foot it's already a narrow foot and\nso when it was a little too big I had a\nlot of puckery and a lot of stuff going\non so I asked them to send me a size\ndown so I got a size 10 and once I did\nthat perfect yeah so I didn't have the\nsizing issue that Thomas did but I'm\nsomeone who prefers a little bit more of\na roomy toe box and I'd rather size up\nthan down so I was actually okay with my\ntrue to size women 7 and A2 so this\nisn't a small small stack and this upper\neven though there's not a ton of\nstructure to the knit it was able to\nhold my foot in place over the midsole\njust fine it has a really nice feeling\naround the collar there's not a ton of\npadding but it doesn't really need it\nthe one thing I did notice is I much\npreferred when I wore a sock that was\nlike uh higher than just a no show or\nankle sock cuz I feel like this while\nthis is soft it if it rubs you while\nyou're out there running it can kind of\ncreate some some hot spots so I always\nwore a taller sock with these as far as\nbreathability goes we have been running\nin cooler temps but I didn't feel like\nthis was a upper that was too warm no I\nagree with you it was nice and\nbreathable um it stretches really well I\nfeel like overall it's very comfortable\nsometimes with these these knit um\nuppers you can get some issues with the\nlacing feeling like it's like cutting\noff the circulation on the top of your\nfoot I had no issues with that yeah but\nspeaking of lacing not much favorite\ntype of lacing this ribbon lacing just\ndoesn't feel like it holds very well\nit's it's light it's I I don't know I\ndon't love the laces on this I probably\nwould go with something I would love\nthis if this had like that saw tooth\nlacing of like more of like the race day\nfeel but this one has that slippery like\nnot great and also lengthwise I felt\nlike it was a little short when I was\njust trying to do my uh regular lace bow\nthat I do to keep it from un tying your\nshoes that's it when I do do that and uh\nthis didn't have a lot of extra room for\nthe way I like to tie my shoes but\noverall very nice upper very comfortable\nbreathable does the job fine okay so\nlet's talk about this midsole what do we\ngot nerz NXT or energy next all right so\nthis is a nitrogen infused super\ncritical TPU you sure about that I feel\nlike that's what it said in the next\nsheet yeah and I don't know you can call\nit whatever you want it's bouncy it's\nsoft it's fun like that's this has that\nF factor that we like the fun Factor the\nfun Factor yeah so this was actually a\nbig surprise for me I really liked the\nNeo Vista but I didn't love it like a\nlot of people I really loved this shoe\nuh specifically for the midsole and how\nit fell out on the roads I feel like\nthis was a bit more stable than the Neo\nVista you have this wider platform um\nthe cushioning is really soft but it\nalso feels kind of resilient and bouncy\nso it was just a really nice ride\nvery smooth transition and great for\njust easy Miles when you say it's more\nstable I think what you're hinting at is\nthe deep valley that was in the Neo\nVista kind of had you going on two rails\nover here and you can sometimes feel\nthat so with this having less of that\nValley it did feel a little more stable\nbut this shoe when I tried it I was like\noh Megan's going to love this because\nyou love the soft cush this one it's\nit's right there at almost being too\nsoft like it's bouncy it still feels\nlike it gives you that energy back it\ndoesn't feel sluggish with its softness\nbut it is a very cushion Sous so if you\nlike a firmer ride this isn't going to\nbe the one for you yeah no this\ndefinitely falls into that like Max cush\ncategory where you think of that plush\nsoft really nice um ride great for easy\nmiles recovery days that kind of running\nnot for your fast tempo days um maybe\nsome long runs that are easy but I\nwouldn't I wouldn't be using this for\nMarathon specific work yeah on the long\nrun that's where I kind of found a\nlittle flaw on it for me but before we\nget there we're talking about a 6 mm\ndrop we got 40 in the heel 34 in the 4\nfoot plenty of cushioning plenty of\nprotection your feet are going to feel\nreally well protected in this shoe and\nwhen me was talking about the long run\nstuff when I was doing my eight mile\nruns in this the shoe felt fine felt\ngreat I love the way my legs fell\nafterwards I came back from runs and I\nwould basically run up to Megan be like\nhey you got to try the shoe this is\namazing it feels so good my legs feel\ngreat I really dig it the closest shoe\nthat I can say that's kind of close to\nit with foam would be the Adidas Evo SL\nthat a lot of people haven't gotten a\nchance to try yet but that one also has\na very nice soft Landing but still with\nthat energy return the difference one\nthis one's slightly softer and gives a\nlittle bit more so when I was on a long\nrun my legs were a little fatigued I was\ncoming in it wasn't the best of runs\nanyway so I don't want to dock the shoe\ntoo much about it might have been more\nme but I just felt like that give\nstarted to like give my foot a little\nbit of fatigue but the traction on the\nbottom of the shoe yeah so there's\nplenty of rubber coverage on the bottom\nof the shoe as you can see here and\nthey're calling it XT or X10 rubber I'm\nnot really sure I guess it's mizuno's\nrubber but what's nice about this is it\nfully covers the bottom of the shoe but\nit's pretty thin in in design so you\ndon't feel like you have this clunky\nrubber under foot and it just it adds\nnicely to this squishy softer midsole\nfoam without taking away from it yeah I\nactually think it was good on the bottom\nof the shoe to give it a little bit of\nthat stiffening so without the full\ncoverage I think it would almost be a\nlittle too loose so this does a really\ngood job there as far as confidence ran\nit in the rain ran it uh icy conditions\nwasn't like amazing in the icing\nconditions but it handled it as good as\nany rubber is going to handle that\nsituation one other added nice feature\nis the sort of like it reminds me of an\northolite it's not branded ortholite but\nit's that kind of spongy insole we don't\ngive enough attention to the insoles of\nthe some of these shoes yeah so this guy\nis coming in at\n$150 and this colorway we have here is\nthe quote mystery version so it will be\ncoming out in more I guess standard less\ndots less craziness uh in the midsole\nver some people are going to be upset\nabout that they probably want the\nmystery look you could purchase this so\nit was a limited time it's I think it's\nstill available right now for 150 bucks\nso you can actually get this exact one\nif you want it at 150 bucks this shoe\nfits into some of my top shoes at that\nprice point we didn't talk about the\nweight my size 10 came in at 9 oz or\n250\ngrams cheat codes over there uh my\nwomen's 7 and a half came in at 6.7 Oz\nor 198 G and honestly that's really nice\nand like for a daily trainer with all\nthis deack yeah it definitely fits in\nthat range under 10 oz is always what I\nlike to see in a daily trainer if they\ncan do it so let's get into ranking it\nme start off with form form out of five\nI'm giving this one a four um it's a\ngood looking shoe the weight is really\nnice um it's not perfect you know I feel\nlike it could the lacing could be\nupdated and just the design is it's a\nlittle crazy all right I'm going to give\nit a three on form just\nbecause I think that there's some things\nthat could be tweaked I still get some\npuckering in the upper I didn't love the\nlaces and just in general I thought\nthere's a little bit of fit issues that\nwe could get into in the next category\nso let's hit fit all right I'm going to\nalso give this one a four I know you had\nissues with it but I kept my original\nsize so it it fit pretty well I feel\nlike it's really nice wide and\naccommodating um my issue with fit was\nreally around the collar and heel here\nwhere I felt like maybe there was some\nrubbing and a little issues there all\nright now this one's getting docked\nmostly because I had to go from my\nnormal size 10 and 1 12 to a size 10\nthat's going to affect the way I feel\nabout the shoe but going down a size to\nthat it did fit really well so I'm not\ngoing to dock it too hard it's going to\nget a three still had that puckering I\ntalked about earlier and just some\ngeneral like not a as snug as I'd like\naround around the sides here all right\nthe last one is function I'm going to\ngive this one a four I'm only really\nknocking it because it's not the most\nversatile shoe in the world it's pretty\nsoft I think it does great for Recovery\nruns easyday runs but if you feel like\npicking it up in this shoe it's not the\nbest option I'm going to give it a four\nas well and it's pretty much the same\nreason I just fell on that longer run\nwhen I started to feel a little fatigue\nin the shoe I think from the way that\nthe cushion is it made it feel like\nmaybe the shoe should be more in the\nrecovery shoe the daily trainer for\nmaybe you know miles under 10 miles I\ndon't know some people probably get it\nand be happy with it well over that the\ncushioning is there you certainly\nprobably would take it further than I\nwould want to take it but I just thought\na little bit I want that a little maybe\njust a tweak more firm in the midsole\nthan uh I was getting so that's where\nI'm going to give it there now with all\nthat said I still think this is a great\nshoe and one of the best shoes at the\nprice point so you're 10 out of 15 I'm\n12 out of 15 but I think we'd both agree\nat $150 this is a really solid daily\ntrainer and it's really nice to see this\ncoming from mauno because I haven't been\nsuper excited about the brand in a long\ntime and this is getting me there yeah\nit's definitely a shoe that you got to\ntry if you haven't yet definitely go\nlike this video subscribe to our Channel\nyou can find us on Instagram all the\nsocials we have a

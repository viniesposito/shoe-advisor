  "text": "hey this is Robbie with believe in the\nrun and today we are here with Sketchers\nperformance and Ben Stewart Ben what's\nyour official title senior director of\ntechnical performance one of those long\nones that's how you know it's good D all\nright so I'm excited to talk about the\n2025 lineup for Sketchers which I got to\nbe honest we haven't se last year was uh\nkind of a drought I would say maybe you\nwouldn't say that but it looks like you\nmore than made up for it coming into\n2025 because I'm seeing some stuff that\nlooks pretty awesome so let's tell walk\nme through this this uh three new models\nthat are coming out um yeah where do you\nwant to start yeah you got it let's uh\nlet's start uh let's start at the top\nhere so for 2025 we're going to\nintroduce the all new AOS series um so\nreally taking uh inspiration from uh\naerodynamic shapes in different\nIndustries whether it's car or flight\nwhat have you um but that's really going\nto set the tone for the design de\nthat Sketchers is going to move forward\nwith that you're going to see throughout\nthe product here so aot Tempo here this\nis a versatile fast sto so um we've got\n38 mm of stack in the heel we got 34 in\nthe 4ot okay it is our single density\nsuper critical hyperburst midsole right\non and we are still leveraging our\nproprietary Goodyear rubber on the\nbottom I like how you stick to your you\nstick to Good Year you're like you\nfollow them follow them than to battle\nhim back uh that's good stuff and but\nyou know what I got to give you credit I\nalways got to give Sketchers credit for\nbeing the first to do super critical\nmidols so you're the OG's in that game\nyou've did it before anyone else is\ndoing it so it's nice to see is this a\nnew version of hyperverse that's coming\nout in this in the in the Arrow series\nthis is a new let's call it a new blend\nof hyper it's going to come out here\nyeah so we've been tinkering with that\nand perfecting it and subtly different\nacross the different uh models that\nwe'll we'll talk through today Co um but\nyeah all right and what was the weight\non this one again about eight and a half\non the men's side about seven on the\nwomen's side okay and this I got to tell\nyou this upper feels pretty fantastic\nlight incredibly breathable it's a TPU\nwoven upper exactly right it is light it\nis breathable and secures the foot\nnicely all right and what's the price\npoint in release State on this\n$160 160 okay at a uh 5 oneish April\ntime frame okay and again this is going\nto be more of your uptempo shoe things\nlike that it is\nawesome all right let's move on to the\nnext one this is going to be our Max\nstack Arrow burst so this is for those\nlong slow miles but also for an everyday\ntrainer where you want your uh you want\nyour legs to feel great the day after\nyour roll yeah right who who doesn't\nwant that right exactly so we're rocking\na 42 mm stack in the heel and 36 in the\n4T for that 6 mm drop nice we are still\nleveraging that uh Goodyear rubber on\nthe bottom I you know what I like that\nyou have a more you you we had that pod\nperiod or whatever that was going on\nlook like Pac-Man grid underneath there\nbut now we're back to more like just\nstrategically placed rubber that good\nyear I like it exactly and we put some\nhorizontal Flex screws throughout the\nshoe as well to make sure that it is a\nnice smooth transition nice and so I\nhave this uh kind of breakaway parts\nright here so walk me through what's ins\ninside this midsole awesome so\ninternally you are going to see a carbon\ninfused H plate here so that's really to\nshore up the shoe here um nice little\ntorsional rigidity and nice little pop\nat toe off and we've seen the H plate in\nsome of the past models shoes before so\nthat's kind of you're kind of seeing\nthat just in a different version\nexactly and uh and then we have and uh\nprice point on this price point is $140\noh okay yes and I do want to call out oh\nyeah my bad I didn't mean to neglect the\ninsole it is an old new um Arch bit so\nwe know that that has been a staple in\nthe past um but we wanted to make it a\ntouch more democratic than we have okay\ngood that was kind of an issue in the\npast yeah all right so we've kept some\nnice geometry on the top side but we've\nreally sculpted out the bottom here a\nbit um zonally engineering um that uh\nthat foam um so you're going to get that\nnice contouring but it's going to be a\nlittle bit more natural for more Runners\nnice cuz yeah it's just dependent on\nwho was running in a shoe but sometimes\nthat Arch could get a little bit\naggressive and really dig in there on\nthe longer run so that's really cool to\nsee this is pretty and what was the\nweight on this shoe by the way the\nweight's right at uh 11 oz on the m so\n11 oz a little little on the heavier\nside but again this is going to be more\nthat kind of Max cushion like recovery\ntype easy day eat up miles exactly all\nright so we got one more one more to\nlook at so lastly is the arrow spark so\nthis is going to be your more\ntraditionally stacked shoe here we have\n36 in the heel 30 in the 4ot all right\nalso a um super critical hyper burst ice\num midle okay subtly different in the uh\nin the compound internally just\nleveraging Eva um in this where the\nburst is a combo Eva TP right okay we're\nalso going to have the um H plate in the\n4 foot of the spark um Li more\nbreathable engineered upper um and nice\nuh medial gusset to keep that tongue in\nplace nice and so what was the weight on\nthis again did you say the weight I\ndidn't it's right around uh 9.7 o on the\non the M okay so pretty normal daily\ntrainer type situation um okay and this\nis the arrow\nspark question has the G run been done\naway with we are focusing on the Arrow\nuh Series going forward is the go run\nstill technically part of the name uh\nwe'll have to see when Lun comes out uh\nyou have my vote to throw it out um\nanyways that's just a personal opinion\nuh nothing against the shoes but when\nwriting whenever I have to do like edit\nthe reviews I'm always or writing the\nreviews on website I'm always like go\nrun how do I spell this how do I make it\nwork anyways just a personal editor's\npreference moving on uh I'm excited this\nis cool because you know we we we've\nloved Sketchers in the past especially\nlike the razor line\nwe had the I mean personally the ride 11\nwas I feel still one of the best shoes\nof 2023 uh even probably a great shoe\nnow the max Road huge fan of that um so\nlet me ask you is this going to replace\nthe max Road and shoes like that like\nare the past models that we seen the\nride the max road we we have the Razer 5\nthat's out but are those other models\nthey're they're gone they're gone okay\nwe're focusing here the arrow is the is\nthe name of the game exactly all right\nmhm I don't know if I I guess time will\ntell I guess we will see after running\nin it because I got to say like the the\nmaxroad um one of my favorite shoes of\nall time I think Max Road 6 and maxroad\n5 um so I feel like sketch has always\ndone a great job I'm going to have faith\nI have faith I haven't even tried the\nshoes yet but I have faith that you guys\nare going to pull it off and it's\nexciting cuz you know we were we weren't\nsure but it's cool to see this um see\nthese new ones is out on the table and\nhopefully on our feet in a couple months\nyou got it yeah super exciting awesome\nis there anything else I forgot to cover\nare we good we're good all right thank\nyou a pleasure all right",

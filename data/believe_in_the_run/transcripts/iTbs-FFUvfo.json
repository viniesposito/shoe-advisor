  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and now we're here with Russ Stevens\nPLM at toppo athletic uh we're here to\ntalk about Trail yes your Forte my forte\nthis is what I love yeah yeah so we're\nhere to first talk about our new\nMountain racer 4 which is a product\nthat's going to be launching in May the\nMountain racer is the cushion option in\nthe Topo athletic line for running\nquickly over technical Trail this has\nbecome that kind of go-to almost daily\nTrail runner for folks looking to run on\ntechnical terrain within the Topo\nathletic line with this product we\nhaven't done any major updates we've\nkept the same midsole and outsole here\njust changing the durometer of the\nmidsole to be a little bit softer but\nyou still get that same really technical\nvber Mega grip outsole delivering\ntraction and slip resistance on\ntechnical Trail y like I said same\nmidsole with a 33 to 28 mm midsole\nplatform just a little softer a little\nbit more responsive underfoot and that\nthat zip foam has been doing really good\nthroughout your lines um a lot of great\napplication for this particular zip foam\nand why why is it why is it such a great\napplication for trail sure so our ZIP\nfoam formula actually changes a little\nbit shoe to shoe we use zip foam as an\numbrella term to cover all of our Eva\nbased Foams so I think the versatility\nof that of that name and that foam is\nkind of what you're experiencing where\nthe zip foam in something like Traverse\nwhere it's more hike oriented kind of\nmeant to be more protective a little\nfirmer exactly it's going to be a bit\ndifferent than the zip foam in something\nlike Mountain racer or the next product\nwe'll talk about where it's a little\nsofter a little more lively kind of more\nrun oriented y um something else that's\ngoing to make the shoe a little bit more\nlively is this new footed that we're\ngoing to be using which is our fkt\ninsole got to feel that right away yeah\ngo right ahead oh yeah yeah it's uh made\nusing TPU beads so delivers a really\nnice soft and comfortable step- in feel\nuh really resilient foam and is also\nclosed cell so it doesn't hold as much\nwater which allows the shoe to drain and\ndry water more quickly if you're going\nto go through a stream Crossing or\notherwise just get your feet out when\nyou're running on the trails okay um\nyeah also just updating our Gator\nattachment system on our shoes to\nsomething that's a little bit more\nunversal so it can work with um other\ntypes of gators within the market as\nwell as the Topo athletic Gator that we\nbe releasing our Switchback Gator which\nwill be compatible with these models\nokay is this your bestselling Trail shoe\nthe ultra Venture is actually our\nbestselling Trail shoe this is this is\nnumber two close because I I see most\nwhen I go to races I'm looking around at\neverybody's shoes and when I see toppo\nathletic and maybe it's more at those\nUltra oriented type events that I do see\nthis one a lot yeah I honestly I don't\nhave the numbers in front of me but I\nwould be surprised that in the Rockies\nwhere you live this might be our number\none Ultra Venture from a national\nperspective is the number one but uh it\ncan change regionally kind of pocket to\npocket what what that most popular but\nthis has the grip it has really nice fit\nin the upper of course you guys are\nknown for that more anatomical shaped\n4ot um and so it has like Comfort\nmeasures and Technical measures on lock\nright thank you yeah yeah that's the\ngoal yeah exactly and what does this\ncome in out uh this is going to be\nlaunching in May it'll retail for $1150\nand the men's n comes in right around\n10.4 ounces okay it's it's really hard\nto find a good shoe these days that's\nlike $150 $140 so I mean this is tried\nand true already yeah we try and always\nmake a you know make product with a\nreally good value and really high build\nquality when we're when you know we're\nstarting that process and always always\ntry and deliver a lot of value to the\ncustomer totally and and the third\nversion of this got a lot of uh a lot of\nHigh Praise from us personally and\naround the industry yeah um and so this\nfour is just going to improve the ride\nand that's pretty much it right exactly\nwhich is great I mean it's it's a good\nproblem to have where you shouldn't have\nto update it year after year MH so this\njust a little bit of experiential update\nI think a lot of people will be happy\nwith that we hope so yeah we we\ncertainly hope so okay but cool so\nwhat's next next let's talk about\nsomething that's a a bigger a bigger\nchange and some more more excitement and\nuh maybe even more excitement which\nhopeful athletic a shoe that I'm really\nstoked about um this is our new Vista\nwhich is going to be coming in June and\nthen will retail for yeah you feel that\nright away yeah uh and it's going to\nretail for\n$170 okay this is going to serve as the\nmax cushion Trail Runner within our line\ndesigned for technical terrain okay so\nthis product really came out a feedback\nfrom our athletes and customers that\nwere running in the Mountain racer and\nUltra Venture so folks in the Mountain\nracer were using that shoe for you know\neverything from their daily Trail runs\nto 50ks 100ks even 100 MERS and folks we\njust reviewed the ultra Venture for and\nlike that's something it punches above\nits weight class in terms of like what\nyou can handle in it and and maybe what\nit's described as being yeah but you're\nright there sometimes I would want a\nlittle more out of some of the technical\nfeatures yeah a little bit more um\ndefinitely in terms of Stack height but\non the ultra vendor especially we had\nsome customers that were just looking\nfor a little bit more out of the outsole\ncuz we wanted to and we didn't want to\nchange that we wanted to keep that\ndesigned for really mile to moderate\nTerrain Road to Trail use allow for\nfolks um that want room Trail pack\nsingle track things of that nature so we\nwanted to bring out the Vista with even\nmore cushioning and a more aggressive\nlugging as well yep so this is the\nhighest stack heite we've ever put out\nin our Trail line with a 38 to 33 mm\nmidsole platform we have uh vbra Mega\ngrip outsole with 4 mm lugs uh and a\nsegmented outsole design to allow the\noutsole to flex semi-independently\nallowing it to kind of adapt to the\nunderfoot terrain so it's not going to\nkind of Kick the whole shoe out if\nyou're running over rocks are underr\nrelating Trail it's going to flex into\nthe midle just keeping you really\ncomfortable and secure over the platform\nokay um as you felt the soft as zip foam\nwe've run on our Trail line before super\nsoft I want to throw these on right now\nafter a day at the EV I've been sending\nnear daily AML store production team\nbegging them for my FIT trial pair so\nyeah as soon as I have it let you know\nuh along with that um we're going to be\nusing our fkt insole here as well that\nsame insole that you saw on the Mountain\nracer made from TPU needs and then we\nalso have that new pokon Loop Gator\nsystem on the heel yeah and I I mean\njust looking at this the colorways you\nguys are bringing out too this looks\ngood this is a trail shoe that looks\ngood thank you I appreciate that yeah\nwe're we're really excited with the kind\nof evolution of our Aesthetics in on\nrecent lines and and feel like we're\nreally headed in the right direction\nokay looks good feels good ready to run\nany Trail\nreally that's awesome yeah yeah so like\nI said retails for 170 will weigh right\naround 10.9 o and look for this shoe\nwhen it comes out in June awesome thank\nyou very much Russ all right thank you\nTaylor appreciate it",

  "text": "hi this is Thomas with believe in the\nrun this is Megan with believe in the\nRun we got a treat for you today today\nwe are talking about the Nike vomero\n[Music]\n18 what's interesting about this shoe is\nthat now the vomero just isn't the\nvomero it's going to be the vomo the\nVero plus and the vomero premium we've\ngotten a chance to look at the other two\nwe can't show them to you but you should\nbe excited and what I find really\ninteresting about this shoe lineup now\nis that the vomero kind of waffled\nsometimes sometimes it felt like the\nPegasus plus where it was like a builtup\npegasus and other times it seemed like\nthey were trying to go for the max\ncushion and kind of missing the mark but\nnow they've like dialed it in Megan and\nwhat is the vomero going to be it is now\nthe max cushion shoe of the lineup which\nis very exciting for me cuz I love a Max\ncushion shoe and it it feels like the\nRomero finally found its place in the\nworld it did and I actually appreciate\nwhat Nike's doing with the three columns\nit'll be interesting to see how those\nshoes not only line up but how consumers\nrespond to it yeah so Within These\nlineups which is the vomero the Pegasus\nand the structure this they're calling\nit The Icon the vomero 18 is the one\nwe're going to talk about today let's go\nthrough like we normally do and break it\ndown from top to bottom and let's start\nwith this upper yeah so you have a new\nengineered mesh here and they've added a\nbit bit more padding to all of the right\nplaces so the tongue the collar all\naround here so the steping feel of this\nshoe just feels really nice and plush I\nmean that's it it's you're going for\ncomfort and cushion this upper has it I\nfelt it was true to size I had plenty of\nroom for my toes my feet I didn't have\nthe problem that I've been having in a\nlot of shoes lately where the volume is\ntoo much in the shoe this one feels like\nit's accommodating but also didn't feel\nbaggy on the foot I think that's cuz\nthere's lots of padding in the tongue\npadding in the heel counter and around\nthe collar it just gave a really nice\nfit true to size yeah and I typically\nfind that Nikes run a little bit narrow\nbut for this model I felt like it\naccommodated my wide foot fine and even\nin the forf foot I felt like there was\nplenty of room for my toes display so\nfit really well for me as well I mean\nthat's impressive when it can fit your\nfoot and my foot and we both like it\njust fine so let's move down to the\nsecret sauce M what do we got here in\nthis midsole so a couple different Foams\nhere and for starters we said max\ncushion shoe because it got more foam\nUnder Foot so 6 mm more overall so\nyou've got 46 millim in the heel now\nwe're talking real max Kush and is a\n10mm drop so 36 in the 4 foot yep so\nright beneath the foot you have a layer\nof zoomx which is as we all know the\nstuff they put in their race day shoes\nthe most bouncy most responsive and then\nbeneath that you have the react X foam\nwhich I really enjoyed in this model we\nhad a kushlan I think in the previous\nversion and I feel like now you really\nget that softer but responsive ride that\nI was craving from the last version it's\nkind of interesting because you can look\nit on the back it indicates where the\nreact X is and where the uh zoomx is\nzoomx really does give you that nice\nplush Landing it's normally like what we\nexpect from it in the shoe is to give\nyou that bounce and that Airy pop coming\nthrough your stride and then the nice\nthing about the react X is it does\nprovide a pretty stable ride yeah below\nthat on this outsole you have plenty of\nof rubber coverage and they have this\nvery iconic to Nike waffle lug pattern\nhere and so I was a little worried that\nmaybe there was so much rubber it would\nfeel a little bit blocky a little bit\nclunky but out on the roads I felt like\ntransition wise it was really nice and\nsmooth yeah I would agree it's a smooth\nfeeling underfoot I'd give that back to\nthe foam again that feeling that you\nhave when you land with that zoomx just\nkind of softens the blow and then it\njust rolls and the shape is held by the\nreact X the heel I don't heel strike but\nI did find that it it almost feels a\nlittle bit like a stability shoe where I\nfelt like I was getting guidance through\nmy uh stride so I do think this could be\nfor somebody who wants light stability\nthis could be a shoe that they could\nturn to yeah and I feel that way sort of\nabout most Nike shoes while this is\nconsidered a neutral daily trainer I\nfeel like there's just more structure\nand support in general to the shoe\nwhether that's in the upper or beneath\nthe foot it just feels more like a quote\nstability shoe does rather than a than a\nneutral shoe even though it is for the\nneutral Runner now Meg one thing that's\nkind of crazy about this and I don't\nknow if I'm taking crazy pills or if\nit's just happening that all the shoe\ncompanies are just saying screw it when\nit comes to weight this isn't a light\nfella and the thing about it is normally\nlike a year ago or so maybe it's the\nFoams I'm thinking maybe it's the you\nknow the energy return you get from the\nFoams but up until now like if a shoe\nwas over 11 oz I was just like not even\ngoing to consider it I didn't weigh this\nbefore I ran in it because I'm trying to\nget used to the fact like what does the\nshoe feel like rather than the you know\ngoing right off of the weight this one\nweighs 11.7 o or 332 G for my size 10\nand 1 12 yeah so uh mine was also heavy\nuh it weighed 8.65 o for my women's 7\nand A2 which again I think because we\nare getting used to these Brands making\nthese super trainers where there's a lot\nof tech there's plates there's overlays\nthere's all sorts of stuff going on that\nwe're just maybe getting used to a bit\nof a heavier shoe I also think the\nweight distribution has a lot to do with\nit so because this shoe doesn't feel\nsuper bottom heavy because some of the\nweight is coming from the structure and\nsupport in the upper it feels like it's\nwell distributed so I don't feel like\nthe weight really like you feel it out\non the roads I don't think you do but\nhere's where I did feel it when I took\nthe shoe off and went to uh like a\nuptempo shoe or a lighter shoe I was\nlike wow this feels a lot faster that\nmay be a good or bad thing maybe you\ntrain in a shoe like this and then race\na feel so fast that you get that extra\nboost it's almost like holding back on\nthe caffeine and then taking caffeine\nyou like Skyrocket through the sky yeah\nbut I have to say it does affect the way\nthat I'm going to rank the shoe for\nfunction just because as a heavier shoe\nI wouldn't use it for as many things as\nI would a shoe that was like a little\nmore middle weight I think this achieves\nwhat they're trying to do with the max\ncushion comfort feel it does feel great\non the runs most of my runs were around\neight miles in this shoe and I didn't\nhave any wasn't like at the end of the\nrun I was like ah I feel this like\nweight at the bottom of my shoe the shoe\nstill feels great I'm going to again\nattribute that maybe to the uh energy\nreturn from the Foams yeah um I think my\nlongest run in this was probably 10\nmaybe 12 miles and I thought it felt\ngreat throughout I do feel like this is\none of those shoes that you can probably\ndo some longer runs and then all of your\neasy day training definitely this would\nbe a great shoe for I don't know that I\nwould pick this for going out for a\ntempo run or any sort of speed work but\neverything else I think this does a\npretty good job of covering but you\nbrought up the function so let's go\nahead and give our point system so out\nof five for form fit and function okay\nform what do you give it three and a\nhalf I'm going to give it a 3.52 I think\nthat the weight plays into that a little\nbit kind of knocking it down I think the\nlook of the shoe is great everything\nelse is pretty dialed in and intended\nfor what they're looking for all right\nfit out of five\nuh it's a really good fit I'm going to\ngive it a four on fit yeah I went 4.5 I\nfeel like it's it's one of the more\naccommodating Nikes I've ever put on my\nfeet and I just think this addition of\nthe padding around the collar and tongue\njust it's a nice feeling shoe yeah I\nmean this is one of those shoes if I was\njust going to wear around casually it\njust feels good it's everything's right\nabout the upper there's no puckering\nit's good all right and function out of\nfive I'm going to give it this where I'm\ngoing to dock it a little bit I'm going\nto give it a three on function just\nbecause I don't think it's a versatile\nshoe I think that it functions for what\nthey wanted to which is a well cushion\nso it's not like a bad shoe but if I was\nlooking for one shoe that I could do all\nmy training in this wouldn't be it yeah\nI'm going to go with a four because I do\nfeel like I could do the long runs the\neasy runs most of most of my runs except\nfor the speed work in it so yeah I'm\ngoing to give this one four out of five\nall right so that gives me a 10 and 1\nhalf and me a 12 all right so that's it\nfor the vomero 18 Megan anything else\nyou want to add um yeah so this is\nactually coming out in February of

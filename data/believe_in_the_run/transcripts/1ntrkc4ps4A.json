  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and we're talking Trail now with\nBecca Becca can you introduce yourself\nand yes yes uh I'm Becca bro on the\nsenior director of performance fitware\nat Hoka okay and I mean um I would not\nbe doing Hoka due diligence if I didn't\nsay that it started in trail I'm always\ngoing to say that it's a trail brand at\nheart and um bringing back a shoe moving\nforward a shoe that started it all is\nthat what we're here with today yeah\nmafat is a huge part of our origin story\nas a brand you're totally right we\nstarted on the trail start with Max\ncushioning on the trail so we were\nreally pumped to use this opportunity in\nSpring 25 to add a new mafat inspired\nMax cushioning option to our Trail line\nawesome awesome can you walk through\nyour specs and what we can expect what\nseparates this from other uh shoes with\nX noted on it so absolutely uh so the\nmafat franchise has existed previously\nso we have a great shoe in the lineup\nright now called the mafat speed 4 for\nus that has been amazing Staple in the\ncollection we've seen people use that\nfor everything from Long Haul Trail\nefforts uh to one of the top three shoes\nthat we usually have for the brand at\nraces like UTMB yeah and we we talk\nabout that of like as another option the\nspeed goat is so popular it's the more\ncushioned option a little more generous\nbut you can still access the same type\nof train yeah and there's an element to\nthe mafat that has always been about\nlike the duration of the experience so\nfor us mafat means absolute Long Haul\ntotally what we thought we could do to\nshake things up with the franchise a\nlittle bit though was consider a couple\ndifferent things how can we interject\nmore plated technology into the trail\nspace and how can we also consider a\nbroader variety of trains so when we\nbuilt mafat X we did a couple things in\nmind we actually took a little\ninspiration from the Skyward X on the\nroad side that uh show with a couple of\nprops here so you can actually see the\nsetup of the shoe so like the Skyward X\nwe have this amazing top bed of peba so\nthis is our highest most resilient uh\ncushioned and bouncy foam in our\ncollection right here would this be the\nsame formula that's found in the tecton\nX 3 or slightly different similar top\nfoam to what's in the t tecton x 3 yep\nuh beneath that we have this amazing\ncarbon fiber plate here that's going to\nadd some really great articulation at\ntoe off a little bit more connection at\nmidfoot and this amazing shape that's\ngoing to help provide not only that\nfeeling of like suspension and dampening\nbut then also that little bit of\npropulsion at toe off that's going to\nNest within a super critically foamed\nEva chassis so when those two things\nwork together you get a really amazing\ncombination of cushioning responsiveness\nand just that little bit of dampening\nsensation to help you when you're on\nreally gravel gravel your Rocky train\ntotally and it looks like this plate\nlooks like there's still some of that\nside by side and kind\nsuspension going on there but is there\nanything more about the plate that you'd\nlike to share yeah so I think one of the\nthings that we've loved in a shoe like\nthe tekon X3 is how those parallel\ncarbon fiber plates work to really\nprovide that articulation medial to\nlateral and\nEnV when you're little cutting in this\nexample of the mafat X we did want to\nmake that for Really T stack Heights\nwe're also considering that torsional\nstability and that control in a trail\nenvironment so when we're going taller\nwe got to make sure that those base Nets\nare a little bit wider and where that\nplate can help us get just that little\nextra rigidity through the midfoot we\nfelt like that was a really good call\nfor when you start getting fatigued\nlater stages and long races that's\nawesome and then what is what is the\noverall stack with this shoe uh so we\nare close to 50 mil on this men's so I\nwe at like 48 49 mil on this so that's\ngoing to consider that really amazing\nSCF Eva chassis the plate stack height a\n5 mil sock liner in there um and then a\ncouple really amazing details here our\nincredible designer Sean who worked on\nthis product he's also an ultra Runner\nhimself so he uh was really excited to\nput the the fun and functional on this\nuh you do some lawn hul Trail racing\nstuff abely yep are you hungry during\nthe race always so am I so is Sean uh so\nwhat we wanted to do was just put some\nreally fun Easter eggs in this thing for\nUltra Runners out there if you flip this\nbad boy over uh you'll notice we have\npizza and Tacos on the out soole for us\nso if you are behind someone who is uh\nwho's running this Sho you're going to\nbe motivated by that that footprint of a\na food kind of picking up the pace in\nfront of you and that doesn't at all\ninhibit the grip and the grab it has on\nit's all designed with be's help to make\nsure that we're not detracting from any\nsort of functionality here on that\ngravel Rocky terrain awesome and this\nlooks like it's it comes from like the\nChallenger line a little bit of like a\nlittle bit more exposed foam have the\nrubber in the right places um looks like\nit'll go on a lot of different terrain\nincluding the smooth stuff and feel good\nyeah and for the mafat in particular we\nwanted to make sure that for those\nlonger more runnable courses you had\nthat really great cushioning when you\nneeded it but then you also felt like\nwhen you were on those more rolling\nportions of like a lighter gravel that\nyou could pick up the pace so so that\nwas super important for us so very\nversatile lot of Stack a lot of fun uh\nwhen can we expect this uh so we're\ngoing to be launching this uh this\nspring at $225 okay yeah so just another\nlong haul option race or not\nyep if you're a slow 50k Runner like me\nperfect option out there absolutely okay\nthat's awesome thank you for taking us\nthrough this absolutely fat X that's\nexciting",

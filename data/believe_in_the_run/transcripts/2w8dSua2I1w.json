  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun I'm here with ran Smith athlete for\nlost sportiva also founder of Rocky\nMountain Runners also just a great\nCommunity member down in Boulder here\nhis name all over the place but we're\ntalking about the prodigio max what can\nyou tell us about the shoe how your\nexperien has been in it maybe a little\nbit about the product itself yeah yeah I\nmean I've been using the the prio lineup\nfor quite some time now with the current\nprio obviously which is out in Market\nyou can buy now um uh the pro that I'm\nwearing now I've been using kind of for\na lot of races this year and finally\nI've got my hands on the last month or\nso on the Maxes which I'm pretty excited\nabout I've been using these personally\nfor a lot of kind of training runs a lot\nof recovery runs the kind of elevated\ncushioning um you know is just really\nnoticeable I think when I'm kind of you\nknow maybe done a hard workout the day\nbefore um I'm also doing a lot of kind\nof transition stuff so some Trail and\nthen I'm onto road back and forward a\nlot and this um you know the the the max\nreally kind of performs really well on\nboth those kind of um and it really is\nMax cushion for the trails like 37 in\nthe heel to 31 in the 4 foot so yeah\nyou're going to feel it and do you do\nyou know much about this midsole can you\ntell us a little bit more about that\nyeah I mean it's a it's like a nitrogen\ninfused mold so it's you know similar to\nthe um the rest of the prio lineup\nreally is kind of a performance\norientated foam um you're going to feel\nthat obviously just in that kind of\ncomfort factor but as well in the kind\nof energy return so this would be a\ngreat shoe for probably longer runs as\nwell or longer races should I say so I'd\ndefinitely be eyeing this up for maybe\n100 mile which is kind of my forte um\nbut I'll be using it kind of dayto day\nas well as kind of a regular shoe\nawesome yeah we're seeing that Inplay\nand and this outso is quite versatile it\nseems have you found that in your yeah I\nmean I think again with the whole\nprodigio lineup the outsole I think is a\nbit of a standout on this kind of line\num it's it adds a nice kind of stiffness\ncomponent to the whole shoe so both on\nkind of energy return but then just in\nlateral stability as well it's going to\nreally come into its own um the log\npattern is very effective so great on\nkind of you know wide variety of terrain\nyou know Boulder gets very dry and you\nknow occasionally we get a bit of rain\nand it's great for that too but um yeah\npretty good for kind of the the kind of\nColorado West for sure and that's why\nI'm using it most able to like stack the\nmiles on a decent variety of train um\nyeah I think the comfort factor is worth\ntalking about as well just in terms of\nthe oper you know this is a really kind\nof luxurious feel you slip it on there's\nno kind of like you know burning time\nrequired like right from the gun you can\ngo out here and you know hammer out kind\nof a 10 mile or something no problem at\nall absolutely and and that's great to\nhear and you've been with Las portiva\nfor a while now and how does this would\nyou say this separates from what is\ncurrently there there or it's passed and\nhow does it stay true to yeah that's a\nthat's a great question I've been\nrunning with uh sporta for about 10\nyears or so so I've kind of gone through\nthe whole gamut of uh shoes and lineup\nsome have come some have gone you know\nI'm glad that several of them have stuck\naround for the whole time I've been\nthere things like the Bido the mutants\nthe real Classics I think the podio\nlineup is definitely um quite Innovative\nit's I think it still kind of keeps that\nsportiva ethic right they're like\nthey're really making a shoe for the\nmountains you know so like with the pro\nobviously it's a Performance Racing shoe\nbut I think when you see that out soole\nyou slip it on you know that's really\ngoing to perform really well not just on\nkind of flat easy Trails but also pretty\ntechnical stuff so I think it's probably\ngoing to be a nice entry point for\npeople coming maybe from the road it's\ngoing to have that feel to it but I\nthink just kind of elevated obviously\nwith the technical outsole lateral\nstability is really second to none in my\nopinion on sportiva products and and\nLongevity you know this thing's really\ngoing to last a long time lot of miles\nout of this I think in terms of drometer\nthis is a little um slightly more dense\nthan the prodigio pro correct yes but\nthe higher stack gives it a softer feel\ncomparatively absolutely so I mean and\nyou're a long distance 100 mile Master\nYou've Won many you're probably\nuncomfortable with but you've won many\nquite prestigious trail races and if you\nwere going to line up yeah I would\ndefinitely shift to this kind line up so\nfor me it's going to be probably this\nshoe or the pro you know one of those I\nthink going forward whereas historically\nfor example I've run a lot of miles in\nand things like the mutant you know\nwhich for me just Comfort durability\njust that known quantity it kind of\nworks really well wide variety terrains\nis comfortable for the Long Haul but I\nthink my kind of go-to is Shifting to\nthe prodigio lineup you know as this\ncomes out so me also a game changer and\nyeah and I mean for trail running\nspecific this gets a little more\ngenerous in the foot as you're running\ncompared to other sportiva models so\nit's going to maintain that from the\nprio which has been such a great sh this\nyear like award winning and we're just\ncontinuing on yeah I think it's going to\nprobably gel with a wider kind of gamut\nof Runners you know things like the Bido\nhistorically it's quite a narrow fit\nvery snug you know that obviously brings\nstability and performance I think but\nlike the P line lineup is a little um\nlittle bit of a wider fit than I think\nhistorical kind of sportiva models have\nbeen so I think that's going to fit and\ngel well with you know a wider kind of\ngamut of people but it works pretty well\nfor me I have a narrow foot you know but\nthe lacing systems are really good I can\nget a snug fit on it totally yeah cuz I\nmean Las portiva holds the midfoot holds\nthe heel and now with more generous forf\nfoot that's going to be yeah speaking to\nthe American audience exactly exactly\nand I think that's going to work on like\nlonger kind of races and things your\nfeet swelling you know I certainly think\nI could do a whole hundred one pair of\nthese no problem\nthat's awesome that's great to hear\nokaya PRX thank you Ryan apprciate it\nyeah cheers thank you",

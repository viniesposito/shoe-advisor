upsetting that we have a\nsponsor that I don't like I'm like come\non man I need that creatine I'm trying\nto bulk up here yeah yeah a matter of\nfact like I really need it cuz December\nI'm joining a weightlifting gym this is\nnot like your regular like Fitness gym\nI'm actually going to one that is like\nspecifically plates and bars and just\ngetting\njacked really do three things but I need\nthe I need the protein recovery with a\ncreatine for for for my getting all\nhulked out swole you're absolutely\ncorrect that's exactly when I think\nRunners need creatine the most is when\nthey start adding like a different\nlifting routine or want to increase\nmuscle mass\ngain some strength all that kind of\nstuff so yeah you're going to be like\nthe poster child for this product well\nwhat I'm hoping is that a strong like\nbody translates to healthier running and\nstaying injuryf free because I'll be\nworking they really it's weird they only\ndo like the Three core things are\ndeadlifts squats and uh bench press and\nthey just work the hell out of those and\nI guess that's that gets your whole body\nwell remember when I did that strength\ntraining program over the summer with\nMary Johnson back before Chicago and\nthen Meg started coaching me for Chicago\nI had like a seven minute Marathon PR I\nwas like holy cow I mean there was a lot\nof things happening there but one of\nthem was strength so I'm just trying to\nhold on hold on to something you know\nkeep the from falling off as I run I\nfeel like I'm one of those like rickety\nold trucks that like screws are falling\nout as they go down the road yeah 41 has\nnot been fun I get that I'm like man\nwe're going to have to change some\nthings we're getting\nold add that protein and creatine to\nyour life there we go right

original\nproduct that we started with um but you\ncan go to runway. lifee so that's rnw\ndolie and then use the code feathers 15\nfor 15% off your purchase just okay so\nlast time we spoke Megan you we were\nchatting about sourdough and you said\nyou were going to quote get into it and\nget some starter so I saw on Instagram\nthat this actually occurred I dove in\nhead first real fast I mean like I think\nit was like the next day I ordered a\nstarter from King Arthur we got rolling\ndo you think that do you think that the\nsourdough life is like the cat lady life\nit seems like people who get sourdough\nit becomes is a big part of their life\npeople are really into it let me tell\nyou because after posting some of my\nsuccesses and failures in my stories you\nshould just see my DMs just blowing up\nwith\npeople oh yeah which I honestly this is\nwhy I haven't gotten into sourdough yet\nbecause I do I really do feel like it's\nan art and it's a commitment and there's\na lot of educating yourself about how to\ndo things in a proper way to get the\nright outcome and I just don't honestly\nhave time for that so like I just try to\nand it definitely didn't turn out super\nwell but everybody keeps telling me I\njust need to stick with it people are\nsending me books I can't decide how into\nthis I'm actually going to get though\nlike I I I don't know this haveed the\nyeast or something sure do this is like\nanother child I feel like like this is\ntakes a lot of tender love and care this\nis like Megan was talking about tag\nGucci the other day that's was on this\non this podcast and thereis not tag\nGucci well you got the lowbudget ones I\nget the fancy one\nhis have like really great shoes yeah\ntaguchi do you feel like it's something\nthough that once you kind of nail it\nthen it's like riding a bike like you're\ngood to go you'll make grape bread all\nthe time yeah Helen our office manager\nis like cranking out yeah like loaves of\nsourdough everybody keeps telling me\nlike your starter really does have to\nlike sometimes it takes a minute to get\neverything rolling and yeah yeah get the\ngood product and the kids are having fun\nwith it so they've been helping me in\nthe kitchen they think it's so cool and\nso I mean that's been fun to get them in\nthe kitchen more but we also have a\nphenomenal Bakery it's called Brimfield\nbread oven and they make the best\nsourdough bread and it's like $2 for a\nloaf so part of me is like do we really\nneed to do this like see that's that's\nthe thing I want Megan to make it\nbecause I like it when the house like\nwhen she's making pretzels the house\nsmells great when she's making Bagels\nthe house smells great when she\noccasionally makes chocolate chip\ncookies they're amazing but that's the\nproblem like I tried brewing beer and it\ntakes so long and you have to wait so\nlong and and I'm like I could just go to\nthe store but that's why I think you\nit's like running right you have to\nenjoy the process of it like you can't\njust be excited about a loaf of bread\nyou have to enjoy making it and the\npatience that goes along with it and the\nkneading of the dough and the I think\nyou have to find a way to enjoy that if\nyou're going to do it yeah yeah making\nthe beard I hate it I'm not giving up\nyet I am not giving up yet but I'm also\nnot fully invested yet either which\nmight be the problem so we'll see TVD\nhow how often do you have to feed the\nstarter thing you're supposed to feed it\nevery 6 to8 hours when you're leaving it\nout on the counter and it said to feed\nit like three or four times before the\nfirst bake so I fed it three times and I\nwas like oh it's bubbly it looks like\nthe picture I'm going to make some bread\nbut everybody's saying maybe I need to\nkeep feeding it they put it in the\nfridge we're going to delay this process\nI put it in the fridge and I'll get back\nto feeding it again some other day but\nyeah it's like so when it's in the\nfridge you don't have to do anything it\nleave it in there yeah yeah you can just\nlike let it be for a moment okay I'm\npicturing this you you get up in the\nmorning you're going to go to work or\nit's like waking up do whatever to feed\nyour kids you feed your you feed your\nyour pile of goo yeah and then you go\nabout your business day yeah it's dinner\ntime you're like little more food for\nyou\nyeah yeah like you just keep doing that\nall the time yeah and then go to bed and\nthen wake up and feed it again I guess\nit's like morning and evening I haven't\nread a book yet or any any information\nbesides the three page pamphlet that\nKing Arthur sent me so I'm by far no Pro\nbut um it feels as though that's exactly\nwhat it is yeah I could see May getting\ntotally into this I yeah I think that's\nthe problem is sometimes I would go like\nI'd go like too hardcore into it and\nthen like read every book about it and\nthen i' yeah it'd be too much I I\nwelcome it I would love loaves of\nsourdough in the house and tell I mean\nthis is a nutritional podcast we're kind\nof off subject here but we're not really\nbecause it's a carb it is a tasty carb\nthat's what like with the like discard\nwhen you feed it you take some of it out\nand that's called the discard so we made\npancakes and we made sourdough pretzels\nand those were a winner those were great\nbut bread so far work on yeah they we're\ngood all right well keep us posted on\nthe sourdough and obviously we'll be\nfollowing your Instagram to see if we\nget any updates there as\nwell um okay before we dive into\nlistener questions there's a couple\nthings on here that we want to chat\nabout perhaps some new brands on the\nmarket people wrote into about these or\nwhere these come from yeah yeah a couple\npeople on Instagram sent me this new\nhydration company called Cadence you\nguys hadn't heard of it either no I know\nthere's a run group from like Belgium or\nsomething that's called Cadence running\nso I immediately clicked on it and I put\nthe link in here so you guys can click\non it it legitimately looks like Morton\nthe way they're photographing things\nexcept for being black with white\nwriting it looks white with black\nwriting like it literally L looks like a\nhydration product show me the link they\nreached out to us um I didn't recognize\nthey must have changed their website cuz\nit looked like a Zoolander ad the last\ntime I went to it and yes you're right I\nremember that now yeah they reached out\nuh back in June saying that they were\ngoing to launch this new electrolyte\nproduct can I see their stuff oh yeah\nyeah they're right looks like Martin\nyeah they they they're going hard oh I\nlike I kind of like The Branding though\nI like clean I really loved it and then\nit's got like a sparkling beverage\nthat's what made me think about it but\nit's only half the sodium it's 500\nmilligrams of sodium instead of a\nthousand like element and then they have\ngood because I could have two right then\nthey have little sachets of like energy\nwhich has 100 milligrams of caffeine or\nsleep that had like I don't know calming\nstuff so it was like very cleanly\nbranded what was that word you said\nsachet sashet isn't that what they're\ncalled a\nFrench a packet packet okay a pack\nit you\nfancy yeah so I don't know I just I was\nI was intrigued by it I do kind of want\nto try\nit um I'm going to assume it's expensive\ndid we look at that I didn't look at the\nprice I mean got you got to pay for\nrebranding somehow yeah yeah I mean even\nthe way they're pouring the liquid from\nthe can like dropped uhoh cuz it was\n$223 and I'm wondering what that what\nthat gets you\noh oh it's 24 pack of electrolyte drink\n28 core hydration sashet they're called\nsashet yeah that's probably where she\ngot the word 28 energy hydration 28\nsleep and a bottle so that's a month of\nstuff and it's nearly\n$250 okay well now that this product is\nout I'll respond to this email and\nasking for some samples to send to both\nof us so stay tuned people for what we\nthink yeah I don't know I liked\nit our first question this week is from\nCarrie\nwhile Carrie W I think um thank you for\nyour super helpful content and always\nentertaining podcast I've caught bits\nand pieces throughout the show about\nyour running backgrounds but would love\nto hear more about when and how you got\ninto running how running has changed\nover the years for you all Etc you are\nall humble people so this might feel\nweird but always fun to know running\nhistories thanks for all that you do\nthat's a fun question that is I thought\nso too I thought so too I figur we could\njust say how we started running and how\nit's changed I thought that was fun yeah\nMH thanks all right T kick it off all\nright since I probably started before\nboth of you guys I don't know about\nfeathers but in um you know 2006 I was\ngoing through a tough time my father\npassed away from uh like kind of like a\nmix of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's I'm\nnot even sure they never really came up\nwith a\ndiagnosis but it was a really sad time\nin my life and I noticed though the\nwhole time his brain was going his body\nstayed really\nstrong and so when I went to a running\nevent and I was like I did the 5K and I\nwas like wow I didn't even know these\npeople existed there's all these happy\npeople running around and I was like you\nknow I was going to bars and doing that\nkind of thing and I was like oh all\nthese happy people what is this and so\nI'm sitting there and while I'm having a\nyou know a beer afterwards with some\nfriends one of the guys rolls up\nand this he was a bigger dude and he\njust finished the half marathon and he\nwas like yeah that was tough but I did\nit and I was just like if that guy can\nrun a half marathon I can run a half\nmarathon so I said to my friend I think\nI'll train for a half marathon he's like\njust train for a marathon you run a half\nmarathon on your way way to doing it so\nI kind of went into the deep end similar\nto somebody else I know um and started\nrunning and it just kind of got me\nhooked and I think the thing that\nhappened to me was there was two things\nonce I ran my first marathon I realized\nthat I could do anything I was like if\nyou have a plan and you execute on the\nplan there's nothing you can't do and so\nthat was kind of like really exciting to\nme like oh wow it opened up all these\nopportunities for me to look at life a\nlittle bit differently and then the\nsecond thing it did was I never wanted\nto lose my fitness because I was like it\ntook so it was so much work to get to\nthat point I was like I don't want to\nstop and have to start over again so\nlet's just sign up for another marath\nand it's gone on from there so at this\npoint I think I've run around 41\nmarathons done all six Majors uh I've\ndone several Ultra distances so Meg and\nI actually did trans Rockies together at\none point I've run 250 MERS I've done\nlike more than a few handfuls of uh\n50ks and uh I don't know I still love\nrunning like I was just thinking like\nright now I'm really enjoying it um when\nI don't necessarily have\na goal like I I don't know what my\nspring marathon's going to be I have an\nidea what it will probably be but I'm\nliking that kind of like no pressure\ntraining where I'm out there I'm running\nI'm running six days a week and just\nreally enjoying like body moving and\nthen my coach will throw on some fart\nlcks or today I had 800s so I still get\nget to like get you know move my legs\nand go fast but you know it's just\nthere's there's so much to get out of\nrunning and uh I just love getting up\nearly the different seasons like\nsometimes the sun's coming up when you\ngo for a run in the summer you get that\nheat over the we get to run by the water\nbut yeah and then um I started working\nwith this girl\nMegan and um we were in an office\ntogether and I looked over at her straa\nand I was like were you on straa no that\nthat didn't even exist at that time what\nwere you doing how did I see your runs I\nhad a I had one of those not until later\nI had uh the Nike watches that was\nbasically like a timx I think like it\ndidn't maybe it had like Pace or I don't\nknow it had like two numbers on it and\nit didn't sync to anything like it's\njust the data just like stayed on my\nwatch I think is a digital watch I think\nis what you're saying yeah those things\nyeah but I grew up hating running like\nabsolutely hating it like it was the\npunishment for any sport that I played\nso I loved soccer I love field hockey\nlacrosse you name it I loved Sports and\nbeing part of a team but the Running\npart I legit hated and then when I went\nto school to college I gave up all the\nsports I was playing and so it was kind\nof like I need to do\nsomething and just started like jogging\nand I would do like one mile maybe two\nmiles Max like every other day or every\nday and I did that all of my college\nlife and then\nwhen I moved back to Baltimore I met\nThomas and he told me he was running a\n50 mile and I was like this dude is\nbatshit crazy and I have no idea what\nhe's doing and he convinced me to sign\nup for a\n10-mile which I did well I mean I don't\nknow how I was seeing her Paces but I\nwas like you know for someone who's not\nreally consider I was running 930 minute\nmiles you were running faster than that\nI was not okay\nanyway but so I ended up signing up for\nthis 10mile and I had so much fun I\nthought it was the coolest thing ever\nthat I was drinking a beer at 9:30 in\nthe morning after I ran 10 miles\nand then she also crushed it she ran\nlike a a 730 Pace on a really hard\ncourse that has Hills yeah I I beat\nThomas which was also like my really\nexciting thing a week after the 50 mile\nyeah so I was like oh I beat that dude\nso I'm like definitely a runner now and\num went to go sign up for a half\nmarathon that fall and realized it was\n$10 more to sign up for the full\nmarathon and when you're in your 20s and\nyou're very dumb that seems like a great\nidea so I signed up for the full\nMarathon 3 weeks before it did a couple\nlong runs no taper just went straight\ninto that marathon and I just I thought\nit was so fun and so cool and I couldn't\nbelieve that I did it and then similar\nto Thomas it was like well I got to do\nanother one and I got to see if I can do\nit faster and faster and faster and it\njust snowballed from there the best part\nwas I picked her up after the\nmarathon cuz we were going out with\nfriends to a um a whiskey tasting yeah\nyou would loved it it was bourbon\noo yeah and at this at this point Megan\nand I there was no relationship at all\nlike it was just\nco-workers and like this was just I I\nwas like Ah that's great you did a a\nfull Marathon let's I'll pick you up we\ncan go to the the whiskey tasting and I\nI you were probably dating someone else\nat the time and uh yeah but we ended up\ngoing to a horse track and drink whiskey\nyou would have died Megan if you knew\nwhat I ate before during and after that\nMarathon like you would be like how are\nyou still alive\ntoday you know we live and we learn a\nlittle right learn a little more that's\nhow we get\nbetter I love it I love it yeah I mean I\nfeel like my story is similar to you\nguys's you know like you kind of stumble\non it and trip and then you get stuck\nand you just keep snowballing forward\nbut um like Meg I grew up playing sports\nand I was always quote unquote the\nrunner on the team but I never wanted to\nrun unless it was part of a sport right\nbut in the back of my mind if I'm really\nhonest I was always very intrigued by\npeople who could run for a long time so\nlike even in high school like my senior\nyear between Seasons I would try to run\na little bit because I'm like okay I'm\nthe you know midi on the field or the\ncenter and Lacrosse I've got to make\nsure that I can run and have the stamina\nto you know keep going back so I started\nkind of running for fun my senior year\nof high school but it's hard I mean\nrunning is really hard like I remember\nbeing like this is a really hard thing\nso then in college like maybe I ran a\nmile or two but nothing crazy um and\nthen in grad school you know we had\nother things we're working towards and\nan internship taking you know the exam\nto become a dietitian so I had all these\ndifferent focus and then I landed a\nfull-time job and I was like this is it\nlike this is what we do now like I was\nso bored I wanted a challenge I wanted\nsomething to work towards and in the\nback of my mind I always never thought I\nphysically could run a marathon I would\nwatch people do it and be like that is\nlike very cool but in the back of my\nmind I'm like that's not ever something\nthat you're going to do you know like\nthat feels very very hard to think about\nthat and then the guy I was dating at\nthe time was training for the Cleveland\nMarathon and I was like well why not why\nnot go on training runs with him you\nknow then there's somebody to run with\nin the middle of the winter in downtown\nCleveland to stay safe and all that kind\nof stuff so I started training he moved\naway we broke up he\ndidn't end up running the marathon and I\ndid\nso yeah right right and it was my first\never road race was a marathon like I'd\nnever run a 5k I'd never you know pinned\na bib to my shirt and it was kind of\nlike that I I think I needed the\nchallenge of can I actually do this\nversus like it wasn't exciting for me to\ngo run a 10K because I was like I can\nrun that far you know but the unknown of\nlike can I actually do this was very\nintriguing to me so I just did that and\nthen same thing finished in barely under\nfour hours is very undernourished\ndehydrated and was like hm let's do it\nagain and then the rest is his that was\nin 2009 so it's been a been a hot minute\nso you were 2006 you were 2009 I was\n2012 there that's crazy that's wild the\ncraziest thing about well I I guess I\ndid it in 2 I'm not sure if I started\nrunning yeah it would have been 2006 but\num it's interesting to me that all three\nof us are what I would call adult\nrunners like we didn't run in high\nschool or college all of us played sport\nI played Midfield lacrosse at my school\nI played basketball I was a avid skier\nand snowboarder but it's almost a\nblessing to start yeah as an adult cuz I\nyeah I think that if you knew how fast\nyou would could like I'm watching my son\nright now he's like dropping sub you\nknow he's he's an 18-minute 5K for his\nCrossCountry team and getting faster he\njust he just joined track for the winter\ntrack indoor track season and he's going\nto be really fast and when he's the age\nthat I started\nrunning he's going to be not able to run\nas fast as he could probably back in at\nthese times and I think it can do a\nmental F to people that you're like okay\nyou can't get that longevity that\nLifetime Love for running if you're\ncomparing yourself to high school and\ncollege and that stuff like I had no\nwhen I started running I had no idea\nwhat fast was I had know it like what is\nfast like you remember you asked me what\nshould I run my first marathon and I was\nlike I know a lot of people like going\nsub\nfour so what' you end up doing\n256 or 356 sorry yeah and you sounds\nlike you did the same thing yeah 358\nyeah yeah it was wild and I do I think\ntoo A lot of people who start running\nearly or running College get really\nburned out you know like I I I see a lot\nof people that don't enjoy we the three\nof us love to run and I think that's a\npiece of this too like even when it was\nhard and it still is hard I still love\nthe way running makes me feel and that's\nwhat keeps me coming back it's not the\ntimes it's not that I work in the\nrunning industry now you know like it's\nliterally like I love how I feel when I\nrun during runs after runs and I think\nthat's what keeps like us coming back to\nit and then it's cool that we can also\nget faster and do cool things and go to\nEpic races and travel and do all these\namazing things with something we love so\nmuch um okay now that we've chatted all\nabout our running for for a good bit of\nthis podcast let's get into a few more\nquestions here this one is from Adrien\nRustin they said I recently ran the 2024\nNew York City marathon hey\ncongrats I battled an injury in my\ntraining cycle so I fully expected a\nslower time on course just enjoying the\nday not a Meg 3:30 chill but more like a\n435 situation knowing I wasn't racing I\ndid set a goal to nail my nutrition I\ntook sis gels every 30 minutes just as I\nhad all my training runs at about the\n230 Mark I could no longer stomach my\ngels also I had been alternating water\nand Gatorade throughout the race and the\nGatorade was also making me queasy I\nended up running a 420 but didn't take a\ngel after the 3-hour mark and definitely\nfelt the energy start to wne what could\nI have done differently to keep my\nnutrition going could I have been\ndehydrated I did I did drink it every\nsingle stop any other things that could\nhave caused my nausea I feel like you\nhave addressed this before huge fan of\nthe podcast thanks for keeping us\neducated on nutrition it's it's\ninteresting because when I was running\nwith Carl and this was early on like\nmile 4 he had just taken one of the\nGatorades and he was like oh that did\nnot sit well he's like I am not feeling\ngood and so I'm wondering if like always\nthey weren't exactly um the right\nmixture of well also were they training\ndid he train like I don't I never train\nabsolutely not and that's I wonder the\nsame thing about Adrienne like maybe she\ndidn't train with the Gatorade because\nit sounds like she trained with the sis\nJs every 30 minutes so that was not\nsomething that was new maybe the\nGatorade situation was new and the other\nthing that I do worry about if if\nGatorade is watered down you're not\ngoing to get as many electrolytes so\nthat kind of sucks but it's not going to\nharm your stomach but if it's too\nconcentrated our stomach doesn't like\nthat especially if we're taking a\nconcentrated liquid with a gel it's just\na lot of carbohydrates in our stomach\nthat could potentially cause some nausea\nso it's possible that it was that um a\nlot of times nausea is a lack of sodium\nso yes it wasn't very warm that day but\nmaybe she went into it a little bit\ndehydrated and then wasn't getting\nenough sodium because the sis gels only\nhave four milligrams of sodium per gel\num so it's even lower than Morton is and\nthen you know so it could have been a\nlack of sodium you know not knowing if\nshe's a salty or heavy sweater that\nwould be you know a piece of interest\nfor me um the sis gels you know tout\nthemselves as being quote unquote\nisotonic which means the concentration\nis similar to our stomach so we talk\nabout like if we dump a bunch of sugar\ninto our stomach we have to dilute it so\nour stomach doesn't get upset so the sis\ngels are supposedly the same\nconcentration as kind of how our stomach\naccepts things so it shouldn't have been\nthe gel um however you know sis gels\nalso do have some artificial sweeteners\nin them which doesn't make a whole lot\nof sense to me so I don't know if\nsomething like that could have upset her\nstomach but a lot of us drink things\nwith artificial sweeteners too she also\nsaid that she didn't take a gel after\nthe three-hour Mark and I'm wondering\nwondering if she probably didn't do a\ntraining run longer than 3 hours yeah I\nwas thinking that too cuz she's running\na slower Pace than she is used to\nrunning so she's going to be out there\nlonger she's going to be taking more\ngels than her body is used to taking in\ntraining or in another Marathon so I\nthink that could have potentially had an\nimpact um the other thing I wondered too\nis nausea could be related to what we\nate like before the run so given that it\nwas a late start if she ate more fat\nfiber protein those types of things take\na longer amount of time to empty from\nour stomach so it's possible if she had\nsomething that had a lot of fat or a lot\nof fiber or more protein than she was\nused to pre-run that could have trickled\nover and impacted how she felt out there\nso lots of different factors so I I\nthink for her maybe it was the time on\nfeet was longer than she was used to\nmaybe she needed more sodium um and then\nalso maybe what she ate before those\nwould be kind of the boxes to check see\nthis is why you're a genius because I\nwas going to ask you about you know the\nstuff that that we do before the race\nyou know we always stick to you know\npeople eat toast with peanut butter or\ndo stuff but a lot of times when we're\ntraveling you kind of scrape together\nwhat you can get at a location I know\nmag's now in the habit of stuffing a\nshoe with graham cracker so that she has\nwhat she needs before run but a lot of\nus like we'll go to like the grocery\nstore before and we'll get some raw\nbagels or you know like whatever's there\nand we'll go to the aisle with the\npeanut butter and just get like even\nmaybe a brand we're not used to like if\nyou get the Justin's packets or\nsomething like that to squeeze on a\nbagel and you're cramming them down even\nthough you're not hungry before you\ngo how does that affect during the race\nbecause I would think that most of the\ntime we're digested about before the\ntime the race starts if we're eating the\nthe two hours before or whatever MH no I\nthink that and that's something I always\nwork with my folks oneon-one like very\nearly on I'm like hey like we're\ntraveling for this race or maybe we're\nnot right it's more so for people\ntraveling what are we going to be eating\nthe morning of our race let's start\npracticing that now before our long runs\num so I do think that's a good thing to\nbe thinking about and practicing and it\ncould be a very small element that\ndoesn't impact a lot of people but in\nher case like maybe it did you know so I\nthink we're dialing everything else and\nlet's make sure that pre-run nutrition's\ndialed in\ntoo so do you find like you've worked\nwith several people now um for multiple\nraces the people that really follow your\nadvice what's the percentage of those\npeople that are having a GI issue or a\ncramping issue or can't get things down\nis it have you had pretty good success\nwith people avoiding these situations\nyeah I mean the marathon's a beast right\nlike things can pop up even when we do\nabsolutely everything correct you know\nit's a it's a wild west we see that in\nthe results in marathons we can never\npredict who's going to win and who's not\nright and it's wild I mean just look at\nNew York City like no one didn't think\nHelen would win again you know um so it\nit is pretty crazy what can go down in a\nmarathon but as far as when we have\ncommitted to working through all of the\npieces and parts to support ourselves\ncome race day people have outstanding\nresults like even you know people I work\nwith with different PRS and then also\njust people who listen to the podcast\nand take our advice you know come back\nwith I had a 10-minute PR I had a\n15minute I mean it's wild I I screenshot\nthem all the time and I'm like I'm gonna\ndo something with these at some point\nand I haven't yet um but it's it's just\nso cool to see when people take this\ninto their own hands and really dial in\ntheir nutrition um like how much better\nrunning can feel and how much better the\nresults are and how much more you know\nback to our initial conversation of like\ngetting the most out of our bodies from\nrunning you know from where we started\nand where we are now it's just\nabsolutely incredible what we can\naccomplish physically that we never even\ncomprehended mentally when we really\ndial in all these\nthings all right let's get in another\nquestion here this is from Meg Tim she\nsaid love the podcast I'm a literature\nand research nerd so if it's backed by\nscience I'm all over it my question is\nregarding fueling and long runs and\nraces I currently take a gel every 30\nminutes in long runs and race scenarios\nI often find myself in the situation\nwhere my watch gives me the fueling\nalert but I only have 1 mile 10 minutes\n20 minutes Etc left is there any time in\nthe final miles of a run that taking a\ngel doesn't benefit you what is the top\nend threshold for that probably not it's\nprobably always going to benefit you to\ntake that gel right like I think that's\nkind of the golden rule here but since\nMeg like us loves research um let's chat\nthrough it right so a lot of things can\nchange our rate of gastric emptying and\nthat is going to impact how quickly that\nnutrition gets into our bloodstream to\nactually benefit our performance so we\nknow um normally if we take a gel such\nas a Morton or something that is more of\nthat engineered fuel that empties very\nquickly that is designed to get into our\nbloodstream fast it's in our bloodstream\nin about 12 minutes so most of these\nscenarios I'd be like take the gel take\nthe gel take the gel right um now things\nthat can delay gastric emptying would be\na higher exertion level like if you're\nrunning way over your skis Pace planwise\nthat's going to make it take longer to\nto empty if your core body temperature\ngets too hot so some of us feel very\nnauseous when we get too hot when we're\nrunning and like don't want to take gels\nand that is kind of a slight protective\nmechanism because our stomach's not\nemptying quite as quickly um the weather\ncould be a piece of it um or other food\nconsumed with it like we were talking\nabout in the last question like if\nthere's some fat or fiber or that's why\nsome of the whole food gels take longer\nto empty our stomach and hit our\nbloodstream um just because of some of\nthose additions in there so there are\nthings that are going to impact it but\nlet's just say right in like 10 or 12\nminutes those gels are within our system\nso I mean even if we have two miles left\nit's still going to benefit us to take\nit and honestly may actually allow us to\nhave a kick at the end or finish a\nlittle happier because our brain loves\ncarbohydrates but then the other piece\nis even if it doesn't hit our\nbloodstream we have those carbohydrate\nreceptors in our mouth which tells our\nbrain like yo carbs are coming and we\nhave an increased in performance so\nthat's why I say it's probably never too\nlate to take one because you're going to\nget those immediate benefits of just\nhaving carbohydrates in your mouth\nbefore it even hits your bloodstream so\num you know I and and and also like in\ntraining taking a gel at the end even\nthough we only have 20 minutes left\ntrains your stomach to take gels when\nit's hard when you have less blood flow\nso it all kind of pans out I mean yes\nthe cost of the gel sometimes you're\nlike I could save that for the next run\nright but like when we really think\nabout it like you know it is it is\nhelpful to to fuel right up to the end I\nI have never regretted\ntaking an additional\ngel MH I agree yeah just do it folks all\nright more of the story just take it I\nmean I'm I'm proud of of Meg for being\nlike willing and and wanting to take\nthose last gels all the time because my\nstruggle is not like oh should I it's\nlike I physically cannot take this right\nnow is usually the answer for me it's\nnot like should I yeah B comes back with\na sweaty crinkled up one that's now and\nit's not saving it because she'll put it\nin the drawer and she won't pull that\none out for the next run it just sits\nthere for it looks gross now and then it\nexpires and then it expires so it's\nactually a wasted gel yeah that's a good\npoint nobody wants it I'm not I'm not\nlike I'll take this Morton that looks\nlike it went through with a I brought\nthem all to New York City marathon and I\nleft them in the VIP section for people\nto have if they needed them great they\npre- swe it on yeah no it was it was not\nit was just a bunch that I had that were\ngoing to expire in like a week or\nsomething that's why people are getting\ndiarrhea on the\ncourse all oh goodness um sabotage okay\nour next question is from Seb short for\nSebastian I don't know how to say his\nlast name g g g g\ng g a g NE yeah okay Seb said love love\nthe oh he's Canadian love the podcast\nand I'm a loyal listener up here in\nMontreal Canada my question is about\nsodium maple syrup I've been using more\nelectrolytes for my long and not so long\nruns more consistently I feel like this\nhelps me as I'm preparing for my first\nmarathon this fall I was looking into\nhow much sodium is needed for the for\nthis distance I found an an article in\nrunner world that said that sodium\ndoesn't really help to prevent cramping\ndehydration or nausea is this actually\ntrue the article was dated from 2019 and\nI wonder if re research since then has\nconfirmed any benefits of taking sodium\nsupplements for longdistance running\nkeep up the good work and thank you in\nadvance for answering my question and\nbefore we start Seb I'm sorry that\nyou're paying for a subscription to the\npay wall of Runners world you can just\nget this for free on on uh on Megan\nfeatherson website or read stuff on\nbelieve in the Run do you think Morton\nsponsored that article on Runners World\nprobably 2019 it's\npossible yeah it's very possible yeah um\nI had to giggle about this one because I\nmean how many times have we read Runners\nWorld articles that are just so black\nand white and just so ridiculous and\nyou're like was this actually helpful or\nis this actually more confusing than\nanything yeah so I feel like that kind\nof what this one was like but again back\nto the black and white like there is no\nblack and white in nutrition right so\nyou cannot say sodium does or does not\ncause muscle cramps muscle cramps are\ncrazy multifactorial there is a million\ndifferent theories about why our muscle\ncramp there's a million different\nreasons why our muscles cramp but it is\ntotally neglectful to say that it's\nnever sodium or dehydration because it\ncan be it absolutely can be there's a\nlot of factors we want to take into it\nwhen we're assessing whether someone's\ncramping is related to sodium and\ndehydration so I always want to ask like\nare you a heavy sweater are you a salty\nsweater when do the cramps hit what are\nyou fueling with now do you avoid sodium\nin your daily life right there's a\nmillion things to help us figure out if\nthese are sodium related or not and then\nwhat do we do scale up sodium and see if\nit helps the cramps and if it does ding\nding ding that was the issue right\nhowever there is a lot of research that\nquestioned that for a while and it was\nprobably around 2019 would be my guess\nand what they were finding was they were\nthey you I think we've discussed this on\nhere before was that is it more an\naltered like neuromuscular control right\nlike is brain not telling our muscles to\ncontract the right way um and that's\nwhat's causing muscle cramps and it has\nnothing to do with hydration so I'm\nassuming this article was going down\nthat route um that's why hot shot was\ncreated to try to trick our neurons into\nlike oh this is spicy don't tell my\nbrains to CRA to cramp yeah yeah so I\nmean that's one\nTheory she hurled I remember listening\nto that one yeah I do I I think it was\n2019 when I went down that rabbit hole\nand did all that research you wrot an\narticle on the site about and my\nconclusion was that it wasn't related to\nelectrolytes because yeah I like I was\njust basing it off of everything that I\nhad done up until that point and\neverything that I read but I was so\nuneducated on what a proper amount of\nsodium was or nutrition was or any of\nthat so I didn't have that knowledge to\nunderstand that that was a huge piece of\nit well yeah that's like I think that\nwas before you were even doing hyper hyd\nation or anything like that like you\nwere getting like a Gatorade and you\nlike hated the taste of Gatorade and you\nwere like H that's not it yeah but there\nI mean and to this day I think you can\ngo and find a research article that's\ngoing to support what you believe yeah\n100% um but it's and and like Seb said\nhe said if he feels like it's helping so\nit probably is right well Megan didn't\nit like we talk about your leg cramps\nthat were debilita yeah what fixed it I\nmean it was definitely proper hydration\nand nutrition was a huge piece of it but\na big part of that was sodium MH yeah\nfor sure and I've had plenty of people\nthat I've helped through muscle cramps\nand there have been a few times that I'm\nlike I don't think this is nutrition\nrelated right like that happens but\nthere's plenty of people that have\nhelped through it that have not had\nmuscle cramps when we altered their\nsodium and hydration plan so you know I\nthink this is a great exercise in\nresearch is fantastic research is\nphenomenal it helps guide our train of\nthought especially me as a sports\ndietician clinician like it really does\nput some guide rails on me to help\npeople help themselves more but it's not\nall black and white when it comes to\nresearch the application of it the trial\nand error with Runners I have learned so\nmuch working with people and then\nthere's research involved but then\nthere's also a lot of I've been in this\nlong enough to see what's working and\nwhat's not and you know working with\npeople and all of you guys and you guys\ngiving me feedback is just makes me\nstronger and being able to help\neverybody with this type of stuff I also\nwonder like when Runners world is\ntalking about this what athlete are they\ntalking about because some of these pro\nathletes that are out there for 2 hours\nand 11\nminutes they like we we saw the diet of\none of them when we were in Berlin she\nhas a cup of tea and a biscuit or\nsomething before the Before the Race but\nshe's out there for 2 hours in and 10\nminutes and she probably eats a ton you\nknow when she's preparing for runs and\nstuff like that I don't know what she\neats maybe she doesn't um but there's a\nbig difference between somebody who's\nout there for 2 hours and 20 minutes mhm\nand somebody who's out there for 2 hours\nand 40 2 Hour 3 hours 4 hours 4 and 1/\nhalf hours just the amount of sweat cuz\nlike when you're out there for 4 and A2\nit's not like you sweat less right than\nif you were out there for 3:30 or or\nthat you're probably sweating more\nyou're out there longer so and you're\nstill giving an exertion and that's the\nother thing like I've run 320 marathons\nI've run 5 Hour marathons by accident\nand the effort the effort really does\nfeel very similar on depending on the\nday so you know it's it's I don't know\nyeah yeah and I mean even in some of the\npros like I think Clayton Young is a\nperfect example like he is visibly much\nsweatier than a lot of his competitors\nand when we talk to him and we talk to\nhis wife like he puts a lot of sodium in\nhis bottles you know he he has this\ncertain concoction that he's worked on\nthat works best for him so that he you\nknow doesn't have a decrease in\nperformance related to his sweat losses\num but some pros are just bulletproof\nand barely sweat and obviously they can\nhave a very different approach um and\nthe same thing applies to all of us\nRunners you know it's like we just got\nto make sure that we're getting what our\nbody needs to perform its best and\nthere's no cookie cutters equation for\nthat okay Seb I think that while that\narticle might have some wonderful\nresearch attached to it we have tried\nand tested and it sounds like you have\ntoo that electrolytes are probably\nhelping you out so I haven't talked\nanybody that we've said hey you know\nwhat something that we've done is like\nload up on salty beverage the night\nbefore drink some salty beverage in the\nmorning when you go out in the run at a\ncertain point maybe can carry your\nbottle and have some salty beverage in\nit nobody who's done that has said you\nknow what that really didn't work for me\nyou're not wrong\nyeah so like at at worst you're just\ngetting some salty beverage at best it's\nactually helping you from cramping MH\nagreed okay I think that does it for\nthis week um thank you all for\nsubmitting your questions if you have a\nquestion we haven't answered you can\nsend us an email at fuel for thee Soul\npodcast gmail.com and we would love to\nanswer it here on the show especially if\nyou make it funny and if you know you\nknow peas and\ncar bye SN bye\n[Music]\nstop touching your microphone I well\nthen I have to go over here no Ralphie\nyou're not helping oh my God Ralph I\nknow see you're a you're a mess today\nmate all this is on record so that's\nexciting that's it I like it cuz you're\nMak me yeah dude every time\nall right you ready for it in five four\nit already did three\ntwo I don't trust yeah I don't trust\nchildren at all and so when I saw you\nusing child labor to roll out your prets\nI was like I don't know if I'd eat those\nI can't I I will probably cut that out\nthey're they're they're probably mad at\nme for the pay wall comment whatever\nthey did it",

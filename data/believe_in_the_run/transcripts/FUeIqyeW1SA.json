  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and I'm here with Brandon the\ncategory manager for North America for\nSolomon and we have a a big brand new\nSolomon shoe ready for yesing yeah uh\nbig would be an understatement for us\ntotally definitely the biggest shoe that\nwe've come to Market with you got a\nchance to try it out in Shaman uh this\nis the S laab ultraglide um so this\nlaunches uh February 1st um 41 mm in the\nheel 35 in the 4ot so definitely the\nbiggest uh stack height that we've come\nto Market with especially anybody on the\nmarket that's that's very high yeah\nabsolutely and and so when you go so\nhigh with stack we know there's other\ncomplications with it and you guys have\ncome to try to solve that issue in a new\nway in anything that do knowes that's\nslab denotes it means it's top Echelon\nhigh performance so how how does that\ncome together in a shoe like this so\nnormally we come from slab um from a\nperspective of working with our athletes\nin order to achieve a Podium this is\nkind of the first slab shoe that we've\never built that was uh made not just for\nthe athletes that are up on the podium\nbut any athlete trying to finish an\nultra distance race um and just finish\nan ultra distance race so we've got a\nthree uh three part foam construction\nthat we utilize here um underneath the\nfooted is our energy foam plus so our\nsuper critical foam that we're utilizing\nhere we use a footed of that and then we\nencapsulate it with our standard energy\nfoam that we used in shoes like the slab\nGenesis that cordney de Walter runs in\nprovides a little bit of stability here\nbut uh really allows the runner to sit\ndown and really be cradled by the firmer\nfoam with the really nice soft bouncy\nfoam underneath their foot so and and\nit's a little bit different construction\nthan a typical uh carrier foam in a core\nyou said it three pieces so like one\nside here one side here and then\nslipping in that really premium high\nenergy High cushion layer right\nunderneath the foot yeah and I think\nit'd be great for viewers to know that\nSolomon felt strongly about not putting\na plate into a shoe like this yes I mean\nit's an ultra distance shoe so we wanted\nto maximize the amount of comfort that\nyou have underneath your foot so we\nreally wanted the consumer to be able to\nfeel that soft cushy foam mile after\nmile um they've done some work\nunderneath the foot as well so we've\nadded in these divots that we call our\nrelease sphere technology that really\nadds um and helps dissipate um uh the\npressure underneath the foot in high\npressure areas for ultra distance\nathletes so really from top to bottom\nthis has been made uh in a way that\nwe've really never done an S laab shoe\nbefore yeah I I mean and it's going to\nappeal to a lot of the same Runners that\nSolomon has in the past and so many more\npeople I would say the fit it's more\ngenerous uh but it also feels very\nperformance oriented I don't want to\ngive too much cuz I have done a ton of\nmiles in this shoe but I mean you're\nyou're on to something something new\nlike big horizons with a shoe like this\nfor it's really exciting times I mean I\nthink we see um what consumer\npreferences are and what is going on in\nthe market and um most anything we do\nstarts with uh a goal that we have for\nour slab product we want to take our\nlearnings from the slab product and and\nbring it to the rest of the market and\neverything that we do so this is um this\nis a really exciting time to uh to be at\nSolomon because I think this is a a new\nfrontier for our s slad product to go\ntotally and one more note on just the\nshoe in particular I feel like Solomon\nhas in the past always went from slab\nand filtered it throughout whereas this\nUltra Glide series started as the ultra\nGlide right and then went upward so it's\na different approach in that sense it is\na different approach there um so moving\nforward uh in the future Seasons we will\nhave another Ultra Glide that will be\nthe takedown to this um throughout 2025\nthis will be our answer if somebody\nwants to know what Solomon's point of\nview is in uh comfort and in cushioning\nand in long-distance racing we want it\nto be the SB ulture Glide we felt very\nstrongly about uh how this is\nconstructed um how much uh how many\ndetails and how much um emphasis was put\ninto making this something not just for\nagain Runners on the podium but all\nrunners totally so we wanted this to be\nwhat we highlighted and really what we\nemphasized in 2025 and it's already on\nyour athletes it's already had some\npretty big podiums already um and when\ncan we expect this so this will be out\nin North America on February 1st okay\nand at what price point uh so it's going\nto be 250 um part of that is the uh the\nvery unique construction the different\nmaterials and everything that we're\nutilizing here but um like I said with\nthe uh longevity that a consumer is\ngoing to be able to get out of this the\nmiles they're going to be able to put on\nit everything that kind of adds up um\ninto what we're offering here um we\nreally actually see the value for for\nmoney here because this is going to be a\nshoe that's hopefully going to last them\nmile after mile so yeah and and for\npremium performance which absolutely I'm\ngoing to say this is a premium shoe it\nfeels like a premium shoe that's just\nwhat the going rate is these days I feel\nlike it doesn't even have to be\njustified anymore it's like if you have\npremium product that's the price you're\npaying and here we\nare as premium As It Gets and we're\nexcited to have it in the market yeah\nit's a great too thank you very much\nBrandon absolutely thanks",

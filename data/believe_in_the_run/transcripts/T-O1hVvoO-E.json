  "text": "hey this is Thomas with beli in the run\nthis is Megan with beli in the run I\ndon't know why I said hey maybe I was\ntrying to get your attention but now\nthat I have it let's get into it me what\nare we holding today this is very\nexciting we have the saky Endorphin\nElite\n[Music]\n2 what did we think of the elite one it\nwas it was good it was a great shoe um\nit it didn't feel like it was that\npremium level above the pro I'll tell\nyou what I didn't like it okay and\nRobbie had the same opinion of it we\nfelt like it was super firm and I'm\nwondering did we get like a bad batch\nlike was something wrong with ours cuz\neverybody else was like oh it's a soft\nand Squishy shoe what was it the HG foam\nthey had in that they're like oh it's\ngreat and I was just like I just don't\nfeel it it felt like clunky it almost\nfelt like a wooden clog going down the\nstreet so I was a little bit like man\nnot too excited to get this one\nuntil you felt the Mido this when we\nwere at the running event and uh we'll\nget into what this midsole is but let's\njust start with the top the fit let's\nget into it right off the bat you can\ntell this is a very minimal upper you\ncan actually see through these are\nthey're calling them t or they are tpe\nYarns so it's very minimal um you can\nsee your foot through them and then\nthere's this molded 3D heel counter I\nwas expecting it to like I was a little\nworried about the fit especially when I\nfirst put my foot into it it felt a\nlittle bit short but once I actually\nstarted walking around started running\nin the shoe the fit was actually really\nnice I think what it is is this weave\nactually opens up a little bit and you\nhad the toes spring so when you first\nput your foot in it did feel a little\nshort with this toes spring and a\ntighter weave and then as you got into\nit it stretches out a little bit so it\ngets the right fit so if you try it on\nand it feels a little tight in the store\nor wherever you get it if you ordered it\ngive it a shot before you you know get\nnervous because it does kind I feel like\nit opens up a little bit the more I ran\nin it the looser the upper felt and also\nthis is a race day shoe so it is meant\nto have a little bit more of that snug\nfit like hugging the foot versus some of\nthose daily trainers where you have a\nnice wide forf foot for your toes\ndisplay this is like really meant to hug\nyour foot so that you can run fast and\nand quick around turns and everything\nlike that a neat feature it does have\nhere you come up to this knit stretchy\ntongue which I really like yeah and you\ncan see you can flip up the top here on\nthis tongue and why would you want to do\nthat well you've got got the lace lock\nhere the runnner loop that you could use\nif you want even more kind of a lock\ndown feel and then you can come across\nthe top of this without having to you\nknow worry about it biting into the top\nof your ankle but if you're not using it\nyou can just fold this down and have a\nnice clean tongue so it's not you know\ngoing up onto your uh ankle there the\nonly thing I would say that I didn't\nlove about this upper was it does still\nhave a little bit of gaping and and\nopenness to the like collar area it's\nhard to cut weight and have structure in\nthese areas of the shoe it didn't affect\nthe ride I did feel like I was talking\nabout it loosened up a little bit as I\nused the shoe more I did start to feel\nlike I needed to kind of cinch down the\nlaces to get the proper fit another\nthing you do not have a removable insole\nso that sucker in there um I didn't have\nthe issue like you did with the gaping\naround the collar here I was worried\nthat there might be some rubbing just\nbecause of the way this is structured\nand molded like this but I had no issues\nwith rubbing got no blisters no hot\nspots no if I actually really enjoy the\nupper totally breathy breathy is that a\nword I don't know it breathes could be\nbreathing it's breathy um it breathes so\nthat's good uh let's move down to the\nsecret sauce yeah so this midsole\ncompound is a brand new foam from saky\num it's so squishy what are they calling\nit incerun yeah the the name of the foam\nhas mixed feelings here the team some of\nus think it's good some of us think it\nsounds like kindergarteners got together\nand made it or you know you think of The\nIncredibles yeah like oh it's\nincredibley it's incred run yeah I don't\nhate the name I really honestly a lot of\ntimes I don't give a what they call the\nphone as long as the phone feels good\nand this one does yeah so this is this\nmaterial let's see if I can get this\nright is a co- polyester elastomer yeah\num so the way it was described to us is\nbasically it's a blend of of materials\nand it's part of the tpe family which is\nsimilar to a PE PX but just different\nyeah it's different we're no chemical\nscientists here let me just tell you in\nlayman's terms what this foam is it's\nsuper bouncy super responsive like this\nis probably one of my favorite Foams\nthat I've tried ever in a running shoe\nthe closest one that I would say to this\nif you're like looking at Foams in race\nday would be the Adidas Pro 4 they\nreally took that and made it kind of\nsoft and and balance it like this but\nnot quite as gooey as this one yeah I\ncan't think of a shoe that feels like\nthis underfoot I was talking to you\nearlier before we started recording and\nto me when you're walking around in this\nshoe and not running fast it feels\nsimilar to like a Jello-O consistency\nlike it's it's very soft it feels almost\nlike there's a vibration when you're\nLanding in this shoe like it's it's\nunlike any foam that I felt how many\njello shots did you do when you were in\nCharleston none oh yeah that's a lie\nright there come on we pride ourselves\non honesty now when it comes to this\nshoe I agree with you it has a really\nspongy feel but I like it the balance on\nit what I think is the most interesting\nthing about this foam is when you're\nrunning like your easy warm-up Paces so\ntypically when I'm doing a speed workout\nmy coach gives me 2 to three miles warm\nup and then we get into the paces and a\nlot of times some of the speed shoes\nfeel a little wonky at those like\npedestrian paces and then they come\nalive when you start running faster this\none does something kind of interesting\nit's really soft and cushiony reminds me\nof like that clo X1 feel when you're\nwarming up it's just really nice bouncy\nkind of like little energy in your step\nand then when you pick up the pace the\nfoam actually firms up and like almost\nchanges Personality yeah I do agree with\nyou there I feel like as soon as I\nstarted to pick up the pace in this shoe\nwas when I really started to enjoy it in\nfact I'm I'm not really training right\nnow but I am doing a few workouts here\nand there and I took this out for some\n4minute hard segments and my Paces felt\nlike I was running a certain pace and\nwhen I was looking down my watch it was\n20 to 30 seconds faster than I thought I\nwas running so I do feel like there's\nsomething to this and it's and it's\nreally comfortable like you were saying\nit feels very different at slower Paces\nbut it's not a bad feeling not a bad\nfeeling at all as a matter of fact when\nwe were talking to Stony when we were at\nthe running event I was like oh so this\nis just for your Premier athletes tip of\nthe spear people are going fast and he\nmade a point to be like no this is\nactually a really great shoe for those\npeople that are also running 330s to\nfour plus Miles because of that soft\ncushioning yeah and I tend to agree with\nthem I think that you can get away with\nthis shoe for a wide range of uh Paces\nfor the marathon including the super\nfast people I think you're going to see\npeople running in this shoe that are in\nthe low twos all the way up into the\nfours and fives and they're all going to\nhave a good experience because of this\nfoam it's kind of crazy now one thing we\ndidn't even talk about was the plate in\nthe shoe okay the plate in the shoe is\nuh pretty good I like it it's responsive\nI felt like you can feel it when you're\nget picking up the pace yeah so it's a f\nlength carbon fiber plate but it's also\nslotted here and um I think when you do\nhave this very squishy foam it's nice to\nsort of have that also slotted feel so\nit's not quite as harsh um you get more\nof that nice Bounce from the foam and\nthen the last thing that we didn't\nmention is this I think they call it\npower track uh yeah the power track\nrubber which is typically what they put\nin their trail shoes so it's like very\ntacky very um grippy but it's just a\nsuper thin layer of it so it's not\nadding much to the weight there it's\njust giving you a really nice like\ncushion I mean like um drip grip yeah\nthat's I think that's the word you're\nlooking for um I have to say it is super\nthin I don't know how durable it's going\nto be my shoe right here has about 50 to\n60 Mi on it I was going through a\nsection that it was kind of crazy that\nhad like a broken water man and so there\nwas water on the street I was like oh\nthis is almost like a water stop where\nit's like 100 ft of water on the road is\ndry road then little 100 ft of wet water\non the road and then dry road again I\nwas like this will be just like running\nthrough a water stop and as I was going\nthrough I wanted to see how the rubber\nfelt going through the the wet and and\nit felt fine it still felt tacky as a\nmatter of fact going through the water\nand then getting back onto the dry I\nfelt like it like cleaned off the Rubber\nand I had even more tackiness to it now\nthe other thing we ran through today\nwhich no shoe would help was some ice\nand of course it felt slippery on the\nice yeah I don't know that there was a\nsolution for that from any shoe so that\nis what it is the last thing we want to\ntalk about here is the weight so my\nwomen's 7 and 1/2 came in at 6.2 Oz or\n175 G which is really nice nice and\nlight my have a size 10/2 us mine came\nin at\n7.75 Oz and I'm going to read it right\noff the shoe here 220 G I mean that's in\nthe light range for me like anything\nunder eight is really starting to get\nexciting in the race category especially\nwith this much cushioning M did we say\nthe drop uh no so it's the same as the\nlast iteration of this shoe so as close\nas they can get to stay within the legal\nlimit so 39 um and a half in the heel 31\nand A2 in the 4 foot and then makes it\nan 8 mm drop does all right and they\nstick to that speed roll shape that they\nlove over at socony I guess all we have\nleft is to give it our our form fit and\nfunction yeah form fit and function all\nright so form out of five what do you\ngive it five I really enjoyed this you\nthe look the style the fit good yeah I\nthink I'm going to give it a four it's\nit's a little weird looking to me it\nlooks a little bit short and a little\nbit stocky um so Aesthetics are a little\nweird for me but see docking it points\nfor being short short and stocky yeah I\nknow oh that's mean uh so four out of\nfive all right all right and fit fit\nthis is where I'm going to knock it a\nlittle bit I'm going to give it a four\nonly because where the collar kind of\ngets like not very structured it wasn't\nquite exactly perfect and then I'm going\nto dock it again for a little bit like\nit's going to be confusing I think for\nconsumers when they try it on whether\nit's they're going to feel like it's too\nshort not knowing that the shoe kind of\nopens up as you're running and kind of\nspreads out yeah I'm also going to give\nit a four I do feel like it it\nespecially at stepp in it feels pretty\nshort if you're wearing a thick sock I\nalmost didn't put the shoe on at all\nbecause I had a thick sock on so yeah\nthe fit isn't perfect so we'll give it a\nfour function out of five I'm going to\ngive it a five this shoe is doing what\nit's supposed to do and I think it's\nactually a tremendous race shoe for just\nabout anybody so the amount of people\nthat are going to be able to run well in\nthis shoe from you know we've Ted talked\nabout other shoes being Democratic in\nthe past where is really like hey if you\nwant a super shoe and you're not going\nto be running sub three maybe this shoe\nis good for you it's a little heavier\nit's got a wider bottom you know what\nshoe I'm talking about but this shoe I\nfeel like is going to replace the idea\nof that shoe where I I could recommend\nthis to somebody who's going to be\nrunning a 4-Hour Marathon or somebody\nwho's going to be running a 2 and a half\nI'm going to give it a four and I think\nI'm knocking it mostly because while I\nlove this midsole feel it's a little\nunstable so I felt like when I was\ntrying to run fast like this jelly style\nfoam sometimes when you're running\naround corners it just didn't feel like\nI could have that confidence around\ntight turns all right so your total is\n14 and mine's going to be 12 and again I\nI think it's a great shoe I knocked it\nfor a few minor things but overall I'm\nstarting to notice a pad and I think\nyou're a little harder on things than I\nam\nokay so this will be out March one for\n$275 so if you have a spring Marathon\nyou're looking for something I'm going\nto say I recommend this yeah all right\nif you haven't yet definitely go like\nthis video subscribe to our YouTube\nchannel you can also find us what did\nyou call it a YouTube what channel okay\nthat's better what did I say Channel or\nsomething I don't know go ahead you say\nthem all right and we also

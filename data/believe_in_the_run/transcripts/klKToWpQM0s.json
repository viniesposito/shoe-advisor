  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun I'm here with Nick founder and CEO\nof norda um if you're not familiar with\nnorda there's you guys have created some\nsort of cult following for sure with\nyour your first shoe the 01 sure and\nthen brought in that a little bit with\nthe 02 more technical option um and now\nyou're here with the 05 the race Day\nOption first of all can you tell us a\nlittle bit about when you started with\nthe 01 all the way to how we got this\nshoe here sure thanks D um look we're\nnorta we're a canadian-based trail\nrunning company uh we're only three\nyears young we launched on the market in\n2021 our first shoe was the 001 it was\nour uh ultra distance uh High stack shoe\nthen we introduced the 002 that was in\n2023 it was our lower stack shoe so you\ncan get a more technical closer to the\nground feel we introduced the 003 uh\njust last year that was our laceless\nshoe I for when you're not running we\ncall it the approach shoe but you you\ncould run in it I've done some trail\nmiles I actually have I want to see if\nit's possible it's yeah it's just a shoe\nwe wanted to make for ourselves when we\nweren't running so exactly it's a it's a\ngood fun one and um naturally we would\nhave to come out with the 004 but if you\nnotice we skipped the 004 we're coming\nstraight to the\n005 one of the reasons was that the 005\nwas so fast it skipped ahead of the\nnumber for okay okay so yeah here we are\nwe're here with our\n005 uh race day shoe and I mean you guys\nare also known to have the most\nbeautiful trail shoes too like this\none's no exception but when you have it\nin hand we have it on foot like yeah\nit's it's a true race day shoe cool and\ncan you take us through the specs tell\nus more about it thanks I was hoping you\nwould see that I was always envisioning\nthat believe in the Run would be saying\nuh norta could make the most beautiful\nSuper Shoe so thank you for saying that\nall right let's literally go from the\nbottom so here we are um basically from\nthe bottom up uh our shoe features three\ngamechanging uh Technologies the bottom\nis meain with meag grip elite elite it\nis a brand new compound from Vibram we\nall know how good meag grip is um well\nthey decided to try to make it better\nit's basically the tackiest rubber that\nuh vibrand has ever created\num yeah it's a little bit lighter and\nit's just super tacky it's like a\nFormula 1 race day compound yeah so and\nin your I mean durability is something\nthat's needed in the trail world has has\nthat been any sacrifice going lighter\ngreat question um it is a softer rubber\nuh there is a\npossibility um that it could be less\ndurable uh the truth is over the course\nof the last year all of our athletes\nthat have been testing it we just\nhaven't seen yeah exactly any reduction\nnow could you use it on road for sure as\nwe did this morning as yeah asphalt\ncould tear it up maybe a little bit more\nbut we just haven't seen any reduction\nokay that's awesome cool and then yeah\nlet's go move up to the midsole here\ncool yeah so the midsole is made of\narnitel uh it's 100% pure\nTP uh formulation 100% what does that\nmean look the truth is most brands they\nall want their own specific feel and\nride Etc and durability so they do\nblends um we don't really believe in\ndoing Blends we just want to make the\nfinest and uh we asked the factory if we\ncan make a 100% blend uh they told us\ntheyve never done that and we said okay\nlet's try and uh we succeeded at uh\ndoing that and the shoes just\nexceptional um it's tested and worn by\nour team and we know Jason schlarb and\nhas worn it to multiple podiums this\nyear even Rich Lockwood uh won Run\nRabbit Run with issue and actually\ntomorrow morning with the same exact\nshoe he's lining up at um uh UT uh utct\nin Cape Town Cape Town yeah yeah with\nthe same shoe so super cool okay that's\nawesome and and tpe is known for being\nlike even softer to the touch like yeah\nyou get some of that bounciness but it's\nalso it's super soft under fooot we've\nbeen in it all day on this concrete and\nit's really impressive absolutely yeah\nthe comfort and performance cool okay\nhow about to the\nupper yeah so here we are with the upper\num as you guys probably know norda makes\nalmost all of their shoes actually all\nof our shoes with biobased dyema uh\nbiobased dyema is the lightest strongest\nfiber on Earth um yeah it's very hard to\nmake shoes with biobased dynemo it took\nus two years to to figure it out um and\nwe finally track the code so this shoe\nuh is almost 100% woven biobased\ndyema um it's extremely strong it's a\nwider weave um than some of the prior\nshoes so the water drainage\nbreathability is excellent and just show\nyou one other thing as you see on the\nback of our shoes there are no seams\nthere are no cuts um cuts and seams can\nbe points of friction or they can be\npoints of weakness so yeah and I mean\nif any part of the shoe breaks down it's\nprobably going to be the out sole which\nwe've seen on some pairs but that took\nlike 1,000 miles yeah or more on some of\nthese shoes you guys know you've tested\nyou've run in nordes for the last couple\nyears and um we have this philosophy\nwhich is uh show me uh don't tell me I'm\nnot going to tell you our shoes should\nlast 1,000 miles just go see just go see\nthe community just go see all the\nYouTube videos people who are so\nsurprised at how long the shoes last and\nand Taylor that's really important to us\nbecause there's so many great\nTechnologies from all the different\nbrands uh today we just believe that we\nneed to make shoes last longer um and\nnot throw them away so that that's our\nreal contribution to sustainability and\nresponsibility yep yeah and and that's\nunique in this industry if you can get a\nshoe that truly lasts longer and you're\ngoing to have a similar experience and\nthat so far that's what we've been able\nto have with any of the N of shoes that\nwe have yeah so exactly that's\nsustainability\nso yeah could you tell us when when we\ncan expect this and what's the weight on\nit yeah absolutely so uh the weight is\nonly 214 G in a uh men's us 9.5 okay um\nit's about 70 G uh less expensive uh\nsorry 70 G less uh than uh the current\nSuper Shoes from other brands I mean the\nEnergy Efficiency that you're saving\nover the course of the race is is really\na game changer and the MSRP it's going\nto retail for\n325 uh us and it will release in March\n2025 so not too long away a 7 and2 O\nRace shoe yeah actually it's sub7 sub\nseven 6.8 okay yeah it's crazy yeah cuz\nthat was 9.5 okay awesome I was giving\nto you in metric you know I'm can I'm\nCanadian it's not my fault yeah so yeah\ncool yeah can you tell stack height and\ndrop on this too sure it's a 28.5 at the\nback and 21.5 at the front and it has a\n7 mm uh drop awesome it is that\nincluding out soole and okay awesome so\nreally moderate stack you could use this\nfor Ultra you it's that comfortable and\nit's light enough and low profile enough\nto be able to go on those more technical\nfast race St too Taylor it was very\nimportant for us that through Science\nand Tech technology with the foam we\ncould actually get you closer to the\nground but give you that that power that\nconnection you know for the last few\nyears because of the technology of the\nFoams that we had it's been taking us\nfurther away from the ground to get that\npop but this foam is so special we can\nactually give you higher return but get\nyou closer to the ground it's extremely\nimportant because the sensations that\ncome from your feet send direct signals\nyou know to your brain so it's very\nimportant y okay well thank you so much\nNick this been a pleasure and we're\nexcited to get this to the trail and on\npeople's feet thank you thank\nyouis yeah are there any more surprises\nyeah surprises we've got lots of\nsurprises n look today we just released\num the first ever uh stealth black\ntoolbox our norta duffel bag so that\njust released today um we have skipped\nthe 004 as I mentioned earlier 005 was\ntoo fast and next is going to be be the\n008 so what is the 008 going to be um\nI'll just give you a hint it might be\nsomething very very important to go with\nthe 005 so what would be the first thing\nthat you would put on after you finished\nyour race now what goes with the race\nshoot i' have to do something with a\nlittle bit of recovery post race so\nthere's a little hint\n008 I'm tracking I think I'm tracking on\nthat one yeah okay thank you Nick really\nthat's",

you have a cleft pallet\nyeah you're an artist aren you like that\nshould be one that you know I know and\nthat's to get the Emoji I like had to\nkeep retyping it there it is it's\nconfusing cuz there's the wooden palette\nis spelled different than a color\npalette right that's dumb it should just\nbe p a l e tte but it's not and then\nthere's pallative care if someone's\ndying and that has an i and an a in it\ndoes so Pala of care means that you're\ngoing to\ngo yeah I think it's like hospice pretty\nmuch but maybe a little bit longer isn't\nhospice like you got a couple weeks

well\npalad sounds like your Pal's hanging out\nwith you just sounds both both sound\ngood to it's like palr Ralphie's on UNP\npalatable yeah dude's got he's very ill\ndiara oh really do we need to

yeah\nhe didn't take his chair Bundy he didn't\nchair Bundy sleep I don't think chair\nBundy helps with that the dog Co yeah\nokay we'll test it out later um yeah\nanyway this is our TR recap episode okay\ndid let's just start off with the fact\npeople you don't understand the running\nevent one day is equivalent to a regular\nweek yeah that's actually true here's\nhow I know because my kids were asking\nme about these Pok\u00e9mon cards that they\nhad bought the day before we left the\nrunning event like they bought them\nonline I was like they should be here\ntoday or tomorrow and it was like the\nnext day I thought it was a week late I\nthought it had already been most of the\nweek had passed and it was I think it's\njust we start early in the morning and\nthen we have appointments that are like\nback to back to back until what 4:00 or\nwas it 3:00 9 to 4 pretty much 4:30 and\nthen there's get togethers afterward\nmhm where you you shoo and hang out it's\nact it's just actually a day that goes\non forever like and there's just stuff\nthe whole time actually I think Aaron\nour friend from Solomon described it\nwell cuz she said one of her co-workers\nwas going for the first time and she was\nlike it's basically Las Vegas you're in\nthis room where there's no windows you\ndon't know what time it is I actually\nsaid that to someone and then they\nrandomly just start shoving boo in your\nhands yeah and and they don't\nunfortunately there's no smoking sex\nthere um but yeah they they have all\nthat stuff time disappears or stays the\nsame\nwhatever yeah it's a basically in a\ncasino yeah yeah except a lose except\nyou're losing would I feel winning would\nI feel sorry for I I feel like no I'm\njust kidding but what I feel sorry for\nlike our feet by the end of the day are\ntrash because we've been walking around\nit's a cement floor for hours we're\ngoing place to place to place but I\nactually feel worse for the people that\nhave to stand in the booth for that\nentire time like can you imagine having\nto stand there and you don't really go\nanywhere you're just kind of like yeah\nit's like you're in Guantanamo\nBay getting you might as well add a\nwaterboarding booth next to the pickle\nball cords speaking of things that were\nmissing that would be\nfun there's a staple of every running\nevent that I've been to it's the uh\nuntapped Maple ice cream wait before we\ngo hard in the paint with TR okay I was\nnot on the podcast last week oh yeah\nbecause the lovely team of Adidas\ninvited me to the dream Retreat ladies\nfor the ladies yeah sorry you guys\nweren't invited it's not like a P Diddy\nparty or anything that's like something\nelse yeah how much baby oil was there oh\njeez there was Zero um they invited us\nthere to try out the new Supernova rise\n2 uhhuh which it turns out it's very\nsimilar to the Supernova rise one but it\nhas a it has a nice new upper I still\ndon't know what this super NOA is I I'm\npretty sure we've reviewed it I've come\nto the retreat and we learn about the\nwhole line it's a basic trainer okay it\nis all\nright um so yeah they took us out to\nthis really nice um resort spa hotel\nwhat's it called I don't know how to\npronounce it I think it might be\nmaraval no it's m i r i v okay marival\nis that it it sounds like it okay I feel\nthey were saying it differently I feel\nlike there's place is just like to put a\nlot of consonants together and throw a\ncouple vowels in and say it's a place it\nwas pretty funny though because sa wait\nwere you at maral Lago no this is right\noutside of Austin wait which one's marag\nlike they're really trying to get those\ntffs taken off huh yeah right when when\nwe checked in this was like um like a\nwellness Resort if you will Island I was\ngoing to say it earlier sorry they\nhanded us a little like sleeping bag\npillow for our phones as if we were\ngoing to put them away for the whole\ntime it was a p didy party what are you\nkidding me no it was supposed I saw\nvideos of him making people do\nthat none of us use them okay okay but\nit's supposed to be like this I want to\nknow the time out spot Robbie's watching\nP Diddy videos no I'm watching videos of\nhim of things that happened do you know\nwho didn't know anything about it I I\ntold Megan no I knew about it you knew\nthat something you wouldn't watch the\nvideos if it came out there's oh dude\nI'm watching I would watch it 24/7 I'd\nwatch the like if they had the real\nworld P Diddy Mansion yeah I'm in\nyeah I mean God with with yeah but M\ndidn't know half the stuff that was\ngoing on she was like uh yeah I guess I\ndidn't do a deep dive on you were still\ndoing his songs at\nkaraoke thinking it was okay she thought\nshe thought it was a lot of uh normal\nstuff going on there just maybe and I'm\noh like he just had like stolen goods or\nsomething he just had too many\ndrugs anyways all I'm going to let you\ntalk I'm sorry Meg I it's okay it's I\nit's a Hot Topic I get it top of mind\nI'm talking about sleeping bag things\nfor your phone which I didn't realize\nwas triggering\nbut apparently it is yeah anyway we had\na lovely time there we we ran the shoe\num Ashley Mato was there and so was Jen\nader and which I told her I've been\ncalling is it genor I've been calling\nher genitor forever and and she\nintroduced herself and I was like just\nso you know I've said your last name\nwrong this entire time sounds like a\nTransformer something I gotta I gotta\ntell her\nJor is so much cooler than jater that's\nno it actually does s it sounds like a\nPokemon character really genitor\nyeah how many how many hit points do she\nhave so it was lovely hanging out with\nthem and meeting a bunch of people um\nyour elevation on your runs were in\ninsane yeah so it was an interesting\nspot for a run Retreat cuz there wasn't\nreally anywhere to\nrun there there's no way this is a run\nretreat was like a a quarter mile Trail\nis like half mile I think Max okay so we\ndid some Loops um and it was up\nbasically up on a big hill so there was\nquite a bit of elevation dud it was like\nthree miles and it was like 500 ft of\nelevation so that's so they try to keep\nyou from escaping is that the idea well\nthey already took it already put her\nphone in a sleeping bag yeah okay uh we\ndid some yoga we tested the shoes we\nlearned about the whole Adidas lineup it\nwas it was fun so do you do yoga in\nnormal life no the last 15 minutes of\nthe class I just laid on the I was going\nto say what do you how do you pretend to\ndo that I I tried and then I gave up are\nyou I and I should maybe know this but\nare you\nflexible no I am not okay cuz like\nthat's the worst part about they started\nout with us like doing toe yoga and okay\ntry lifting up your big toe and not all\nyour other toes oh I did it it's really\nhard is that like that was like the\nbeginning of our toe yoga session so is\nthe idea that you're just concentrating\non one toe like directing all your\nenergy towards one toe I'm you know I\ndon't know how this stuff works I was\nable to do this with the toe and\nthis I don't I don't even know if I can\nmove my toes I might be\nparalyzed yeah I I'm not sure what's\nhappening\nit seems to be the whole\nfoot that's basically what kept\nhappening to me so that was why I ended\nup laying on the mat and taking a quick\nnap but it was lovely we did it um in\nfront of an infinity pool overlooking\nAustin in its Glory so wow it's nice\nokay yeah it was a good time all right\nand then the boys arrived the boys\narrived into the City and oh wait I\nthought you were talking about the\nparty my bad I know we were still\ntalking about the ddy party yeah shoot\nall right yeah so then me and you really\nwant this to happen I thought I was\ndoing now um so yeah the last week's\npodcast showed\nup uh yes and plus Jared and Taylor no\nJared didn't come until later Taylor\ndidn't getent you guys all showed up\neventually we all assembled Megan\nfeatherston joined us as well and um\nyeah we kicked it off with a fun party\nwith our friends at as6 and then we went\nstraight into\nit yeah uh woke up Wednesday morning\nwell I went for a run right when I we\nlanded I said I need to get well\nbasically I procrastinated Tuesday and\nyeah that was silly well but we usually\nrun when we get there but I didn't\nrealize how late we were getting there\nwe didn't leave until like 11:30 well\nthat's what I was saying I don't didn't\nrealize how late we were getting there\nand so I\ndid go on a run it was pretty nice Carl\nand I were so happy that we had already\nrun though I like running when you get\nsomewhere though it just I get it like\nthe plane and stuff travel\nrust cobwebs in your mind and stuff\nanyway so your mind we did do the do a\nrun and then did you run Wednesday\nmorning I did run Wednesday morning too\nyeah I ran that with Flores gearan from\npath projects and Billy Yang I was\nsupposed to do a workout but kind of\njust abandoned to have a good run and uh\nBilly Yang had those Rayband s those\nRayband recording glasses on that's not\ncreepy yeah I know it's like I can't you\ncan never tell like are you just are you\nasking me questions to have a\nconversation or are you trying to\ninterview me did you ask him if you were\nbeing recorded uh I think it shows like\na light on the front if you're being\nrecord I remember you got them yeah I I\nhad them for a little bit I I tried them\nout one the style that I purchased I\nfelt was a little bit feminine for my\nface\ntwo okay it took really bad photos yeah\nthe quality of the stuff was just crap\nbut the was the video bad yeah oh I I\nthink I think and also like why like why\ndo you need that why do you need to\nvideo record someone with your face I\nactually think they'll be fantastic in a\ncouple years and I do think you're going\nto want to do it just cuz like right now\nyou pull out your phone but the glasses\nyou could talk to so you could be like\nyou just double tap the thing and the\nvideo comes on so your hands are free so\nsay that you're holding a shoe that's\nthe only case I see it working is you're\ndoing like an unboxing or eating a\nsandwich you're saying it'll show things\nin the in the lenses no it doesn't show\nwill your eyeballs see the things in the\nlenses like you are using your eyes it's\ngot cameras on the temples yeah but I'm\nsaying I thought you were saying it was\nlike a what do you call it VR type thing\nwhere it show I think you're thinking AR\nor augmented reality yeah where it shows\nthe directions or whatever I do think\nthat'll happen what I did like about it\nthough you could connect it to your\nphone and stuff so I was able to ask for\ndirections and Google stuff and and uh\nalso siries stuff so you could be like\nhey what's the closest taco place and it\nwould be like okay and it would give you\nleft left right left walk 200 feet this\ndirection I think the one thing that he\nsaid was interesting is that if you\nrecord on it kind of all day and then\nmake it real people people who you know\nwho are with you they're like when did\nyou take all that video cuzz they just\npeople are so used to having an\nobtrusive camera so it's kind of\nunobtrusive you can it's a more natural\nthing than having a camera front of yeah\nbut you especially if you just color a\nSharpie over the light yeah no knows\njust disable light I wouldn't do that at\nall\nyeah at all Meg would be like why are\nyou wearing glasses in the\nbathroom\nglasses um but yeah so then we what' you\nguys do you went on a run too went we\nwent on a run and T backtracked before I\ndid and ran into Connor for running a\nwarehouse and film some content yeah jar\nyou know that guy can't not film content\nyeah I mean he has the hair for it so\nJared was like running with me and we\nwere trying to get back cuz we had to\nget to the Nike thing oh right so they\nwere I didn't realize that I was going\nto be or or was supposed to be doing any\ncontent with them so we're running back\nand I get a text message I'm like if you\nguys want to do it we got to do it now\nso they're out on the trail setting up\nthe thing so right where that spiral\nthing is the bridge we sat at the bottom\nof that and we did like the shoe\nspotting thing that you and I did yeah\nbut honestly I just went off the rails\nand just talked yeah that's the way I\nsaid I'm cranky guys I'm really tired I\ndidn't know that we were doing this\nwhatever then this one guy who I I don't\nknow what the guy was doing he can see\nthat we're filming we've got mics on\nthere's camera up the guy just sits\nthere and starts talking us and Connor\nwas just too nice was he a runner guy or\nis he just it's it's the running event\nso was somebody that like knew Connor\nwell I mean it's Austin so Austin could\nhave been a crazy person that's true\ntrue but yeah this guy just rolled up\nand sat down next to us he's like he's\ntalking I'm like you're not on mic\nnobody's gonna be able to hear you and\nConor's let you should have just gave\nhim your mic I know and just left yeah\nsaid you're this tapped in seems to be\nworking out because we are doing shoe\nspot and he was wearing super blast too\nokay yeah in that nice offwhite that's a\ngood color and then I came running by I\ndid make sure that I wore cuz that\nladybird Trail destroys your shoes yeah\nit does I wore those um\nzoomfly uh six six but the ilad kip\nchogi color because it already looks\nlike it's got dirt on it so I was like\nokay that works it's like authentic and\njust going to throw this out there uh\nladybird\nTrail so much better than PR Trail\ndoesn't even come close I think that you\ncould name a lot of trails and be like\nthat's better than PR I think that's my\ngoal is to just name every Trail that's\nbetter than priest tril that would be a\ngood map for people like like a map of\nthe US trails that are better than most\nof America it's be green over here n you\nGNA say you ran by uh yeah when you were\nfilming in the vomero 18 no I didn't\nhave it at that point I was also wearing\nthe zoom F six I wore the zoomfly 6 that\nday too wow what do you think yeah I\nlike it a lot it's gr grown me the more\nI wear it right I agree yeah it's the\nbest zoom fly there's ever been oh for\nsure that's not even close and I know we\ndon't want to jump too far ahead but\nNike right now I don't care what you\nthink about the brand they're really\nstarting to kill it in the daily stuff\nthere's like three or four shoes now\nthat I'm like it's about time honestly\nthese are really good okay I'm\ninterested to I haven't run the vomo\nvomero 18 which we then got that about\n30 minutes after that run M's already\ngot 20 miles in it I ran in this morning\nokay it's a it's definitely the best\nvomero all right and it should have been\nand now it's got 46 mm in the heel you\nknow I'm like that is it really 46 yeah\nthat's what they said good Jo for the\nvideo people yeah I got it you got it\nyep that's this one 46 in the heel\nthat's what they said from 40 to 46 that\nseems wild what do you think how would\nyou describe the ride M\num like a neutral daily trainer it's not\nsuper light it's going to have a little\nbit of structure and support to it um I\ndid think it was pretty stable yeah I\nmean it's got a pretty wide platform so\ndefinitely nice and\nstable it's it's like a Workhorse it's\nnot like um a light fun bouncy ride but\nit's it's funny it's funny you said\nWorkhorse cuz this should have been the\nPegasus that's what I also I think\nthat's what we said about the last fero\ntoo I think sure what they're doing with\nthe peg right now like this has really\nnice 4 foot\ncushioning I do like this the layer of\nzoomx they I don't think they should\nit's misleading to put the giant zoomx\nhere because I did think that was\ninteresting they do that with all their\nshoes I know it's really a thin layer of\nzoomx underneath your foot oh really\nthis isn't the zoomx react x no not at\nall nice you can see the line where it\nzoomx it actually on the back it has an\narrow that says zoomx and then react oh\nthe zoomx is the top layer I got you\nyeah okay but this feels really good the\nupper fits great the lock down is nice I\neven dig like you don't see this tongue\naround that much anymore but it's nice\npadded tongue it's gusseted on the sides\nyeah it's it's pretty sweet I think\nyou'll dig it I haven't put it on the\nscale is that the scale Under Computer\nyeah we can try it I feel like it's away\nsomething\nsomething so yeah we're supposed to go\ndo a run with Nike but they plan their\nrun a little late we had a 9:30\nappointment so we\nuh it's almost 12 ounces that's a big\nboy they said a game that's a chunky but\nthey also said it's\nlike this isn't a shoe that necessarily\nneeds to be super light so yeah right\nabout that um yeah so shees keep getting\nheavier Robbie yeah I think they people\nwere fed up with the lightweights you\nknow what else no go ahead oh no go\nahead I was going to say but the but the\nratios are getting even ligher so it's\ntrue so you take these off and\nlike but it is interesting going to the\nrunning event we'll talk about we'll\njust we'll walk through some of the\nhighlights that we saw but one of the\ninteresting things is how messaging\nchanges from year to year so remember\ntwo or three years ago sustainability\nwas like everybody was talking about it\nand there was green shoes and Eco shoes\nand this and that everybody was like\nhere's our carbon footprint do you hear\nanybody mention it this not a not a word\nonce not once yeah I mean it's still\nlike on on their Pages they'll say uh\nthis is biodegradable this is whatever\neven as6 is putting their carbon\nfootprint in the Shoe Right does anyone\neven know what that number means that\nmeans nothing no and the thing\nis it just goes to prove the point like\nwe had said before like if the shoe\nfeels good and will help you run miles\nand do that people are willing to be\nlike maybe be sustainable in other areas\nof their life\nbut you're you're making a product that\nyou're making thousands\nof that is made of rubber and different\nmaterials and yeah I ride my bike to\nwork every day so I can wear whatever\nshoe I want yeah that is true that's how\nthat works even in the cold yeah it's\neven nicer in the cold I feel like I\ndon't I don't know depends depends what\nyou're wearing anyways but yeah um the\nso Ralphie shut\nthe do you need me get the Lagoon pillow\nget the lagon Carl get the lagon\npillow it's okay buddy all right um so\nhighlights of highlights of the we doing\nit by day or just in general we can it\nhonestly doesn't matter because no one\nknows what I don't know what day it was\nbut let's start with the low light the\nlow light I start to mention oh yeah\nevery year they have an ice cream truck\nthat we get so jazzed about soft serf\nmaple syrup flavored ice cream it's like\nthe most lovely treat in the middle of a\nLas Vegas day yeah and they showed up\nthis year s's truck no truck I it's\nfunny that we both went with s's truck\nthat's how it works uh it was it it was\ndisappointing for a couple reasons one I\nlove that ice\ncream yeah and\ntwo I mean what's going on with them\nthat they can't afford the ice cream\ntruck anymore\nI don't know I guess it should be a\nsponsor of this podcast that will sell\nmore maple syrup or maybe we need to do\nfree spots for them so that we can get\nthe truck ice cre truck we could just\nhave a get the ice cream truck for every\nepisode leading up to tr we'll give you\nfree year-long sponsorship if you just\nbring the ice cream truck back yeah\nthat's the deal I mean I'm in and I\nfinally figured out that hack last year\nwhere I took the the honey Stinger\nwaffle or the unta waffle and dipped it\ninto the ice cream and then chunk it up\nand put it in man that was nice it's\nbasically like a DQ Blizzard but\nhandmade all right first check in man\nthis is going to be a long podcast so\nbuckle up anyway we're covering all the\nstuff from Trey and one of my favorite\nthings to do is it like think about this\nyou're out there running right now\ndoesn't always feel the best but\nsometimes it does and the times that I\nreally like having that Fitness is when\nwe go on these trips so I can run with\nfriends and get together with people so\nif you don't are lacking a little\nmotivation right now think about just\nstaying in shape so that if something\nfun pops up I don't know could be a\nturkey Tru could be a holiday 5K who\nknows what's happening but just uh stay\nfit over the winter here and uh you'll\nbe in good shape to run with friends and\nhave a good\ntime all right guys element is still a\nsponsor of this podcast but for a\nlimited time they're offering their\nchocolate medley oo that sounds pretty\ndelicious you know it's not like the\nyou're not going to put that in your\nbubbly water no you could could you you\ncould uh you want it heated up I think\nyeah some hot water with either the\nchocolate mint the chocolate chai or the\nchocolate raspberry I've heard it's\npretty good in coffee too you could also\nput it in your coffee okay would you do\nit before your run yeah okay some hot\ncoffee some chocolate medley I do like a\nmocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also\nour offer is still available so you can\ngo to element.\nslthe drop and get a free element sample\npack do you know if the sample pack\nwould have this chocolate in yeah ohes\nthere you go so go get them and\nenjoy speaking of ice cream put my hands\nin that ice cream and all mixed it up we\nwent to BJs yesterday because we're\ngetting stuff for Thanksgiving it's a\nstore and just had the for those you\nknow just Costco it's the baltimor\nCostco yeah I feel like we need to prep\nthat every time yeah um anyway went BJs\nI love I love that there was no better\nname nobody or nobody you know what\nmaybe maybe we shouldn't be that let's\ncall it 69 Club\nyeah uh anyway uh so we went there and\nwe're getting we got a apple pie and I'm\nlike I like vanilla ice cream with apple\npie mhm that's a pretty American thing\nyeah uh so I go to the freezer to get\nthe ice cream and they have a half\ngallon of hogendas vanilla okay and a\nhalf gallon I think it was a full gallon\nmaybe it's a gallon gallon of DJs they\ndon't they go hard gallon of hogendas\nand then there was a gallon of Premium\nwhatever their store brand okay but I'm\nalmost 90% sure it's the same stuff it's\nin the same looking container like it\nthe containers look the same yeah\neverything looks the same how much do\nyou think the hogendas vanilla ice cream\nwas for a gallon for a\ngallon at BJs\nM $122\n$77.99 how much do you think the in\nstore brand was $12\n5.99 dude what dude I was like how is\nthis possible I really thought he was\ngoing to come back with the hog and do I\nwas like knowing you did so what you\nwhich one did you get I got the low\nprice I I can't I couldn't do even I'm\nI'm extravagant but that was like\ninsulting too much especially cuz you're\nprobably not going to eat the whole\nthing so was it fine and I'm going to\nmix it with apple p yeah I don't know I\nhaven't tasted it yet but I have a\nfeeling it's the exact same\nstuff yeah I mean I and I feel like ice\ncream is generally ice cream and\nobviously there's some that are better\nbut yeah I mean the container looks\nexactly the same with just different\nwriting yeah you're going to be fine\nyeah plus I predict apple pie with it I\npredict a pleasurable experience for\ndessert I'll probably have leftover you\ncan probably come over and okay do some\nblind tast ice cream that sounds good I\ndon't know the boys are in are going to\nbe enjoying it as well so yeah all right\nwe'll see anyway so yeah the ice cream\ntruck was not there not there and then\nwhat other low lights were there I don't\nknow if there were everything else was\npretty standard I think some of the Riff\nraft that they let into the convention\nis a low light yeah including us yeah\nyeah we shouldn't be alled I will say it\nis it is I don't even know what it is at\nthis point because they do just\nbasically anyone that can fog up a\nmirror is led into the convention\ncenter um and so it's fine but a lot of\nBrands now just hide their stuff behind\nin cabinets and behind wall I do think\nit's it's not as exciting as it used to\nbe just for that reason definitely not\nyeah it used to be you'd walk the floor\nand immediately see like wild crazy like\nyeah stuff that may not ever even get\nproduced they would like just throw here\nsome stuff we're working prototypes yeah\nand now it's like you get to see what's\ncoming out in a couple months like in\nFebruary yeah not even in Fall now I did\nappreciate some of the brands that were\nsay what were you going to say what what\nyou're about to say you say it you say\nit\nokay I was going to shout out the brands\nwho actually showed all the stuff for\nnext year I'm sure it's not all the\nstuff but it's most of the The Heavy\nHitters who did that Hoka on\nBrooks Brooks tell Brooks put all their\ncards on the table Yeah they sure did uh\nI have to say that was probably my\nfavorite like run through of all the\nstuff just\nbecause I felt like he was very sincere\nyeah he's great nille yeah so Nik walked\nus through uh nikil Jane walked us\nthrough the Brooks um lineup and you can\nsee that on YouTube if you want to watch\nit\none I feel like Brooks is actually\nmaking an effort now to really Advance\ntheir shoes where I felt like they were\ngetting a little stale and I feel like\nthis is a really good thing for them\nbecause they didn't wait until they were\nin the garbage can to do this mhm like\nI'm really excited about some of their\nproduct we could even have like the\nglycerin which one is this\neight glycerin 22 yeah we're already at\n22 jeez the glycerin 22 here and and I\nwe just named glycerin\nMax our top Max yeah uh cushion trainer\nand this has a lot of similarities to it\nit's got that double uh density super\ncritical foam MH in a lower the ground\npackage so I think this going to be a\ngood shoe I you know me I don't love\nNavy or blue shoes but a lot of the\nstuff they were showing us was really\ngoodlooking yeah there I mean the\nhyperium Max 3 was there the Hyperion\nElite 4 and A2 and five uh both of the\nshoes by the way he did give us a little\nbit of credit and I don't know that it's\nnecessarily what we said in the video\nabout the Foams I think it was more our\naudience thank you people for chiming in\nand also agreeing that you would like to\nsee Brooks have a paback uh phone Runner\nand for all of those of you that were\nlike you don't need peab bags and this\nguess what they're going heavy into\npacks and their their athletes are\nwinning in it yeah so that's what um Dez\nwas wearing in New York Josh Kerr was\nwearing and so that'll be coming fall\n2025 the Hyperion Elite 5 yeah and even\nuh the guy that was leading the Olympic\ntrials for the first 20 miles was\nwearing wearing the pabb version of the\nshoe yeah and and then the the the four\nor the five right that one's pretty well\nI think that's what I was talking about\noh I was talking about the\n4.5 I think he said they were wearing\nthe five though oh were they yeah okay I\nmean it's it's a similar shoe right uh\nbut anyways so they are and what else\nthe hyper the regular Hyperion the trail\nthe trail stuff everything it's looking\ngood yeah so that's that's cool the\nghost Max ghost Max yeah even ghost Max\n3 even the launch everything the ghost\noh yeah the ghost look good yeah like\nit's getting a nice update there's the I\ndon't understand though the launch and\nthe in the Hyperion the launch is\nbasically their lowest entry level shoe\nso for years it was $100 I think even\nmaybe until last year yeah why would you\ngo with that over the Hyperion less\nexpensive H the Hyperion is still what\n140 yeah okay\nso\num but anyways so Brooks was cool Hoka I\nthought their stuff looked pretty solid\nI mean the Mach X2 or Mach X3 I'm so\nhappy they also are bringing the Bondi\nand a new Clifton this year like it's\nbeen ages yeah and those are a fan\nfavorite so there's a couple changes to\nthem some of the drop\num it went from what four uh 5 mm to 8\nmm someone's saying that the compression\nof the foam it'll even out to about a 5\nmm over time but I don't think that's\nthe truth people were some people\nweren't were not like that change well\nin the comments try it first yeah I mean\nI'm neither here nor there on it I I I\nalso one of my favorite shoes from this\npast year was The Mach\nx two yeah yeah so the three so they\nfixed the problem which is the heel was\nan absolute travesty on this year's\nversion that would have been shoe of the\nYear probably for us if it wouldn't have\nbeen for the heel thing absolutely but\nthey fixed it so that's good news yeah\nyeah and it it looks good um I'm\ndefinitely am also excited about the x\n1.2\nclo lost\nanoun X11 2.0 yeah it's it's the\nFibonacci code yeah seriously I was\ngoing to say you might as well call it\nBJs um the yeah the right you're going\nto be able to unlock the Constitution or\nsomething with a code on the back with\nthat that number may maybe it is a\nhidden in plain site thing code for some\nmap well I will tell you that it dropped\nan\nounce in weight did it really I didn't I\nmiss so I missed the yeah so they saying\nprobably going to the bathroom or\nsomething yeah dropped an ounce how\ncould you the bathroom when we're\ntalking to Rebeca bro she's our favorite\nno I actually was looking at I was at\nthe speed L you Robbie had to go eat a\nsandwich he was going to be hangry at\nthat point no I would no for oh oh it\nwas was that when I was hungry yeah oh\nyeah that is when I was hry we were like\ngo eat your sandwich somewhere we'll be\nwhere did you get a sandwich the burrito\nburrito burrito the size of our heads\nyeah we found the craziest taco joint 10\n10 Taco it wasn't called that taco 1010\nyeah something like that have fun\nfinding it but it's literally a hole in\nthe wall and an alley that you think is\njust a bar and then you take a back door\nto the restaurant it it looks when\nyou're walking down the alley it looks\nlike you're going into the back of a\nrestaurant yeah then you walk in it's\nkind of like a weird bar and then you\nwalk through what would be like a\nfreezer door mhm similar like when we\nwent to Paris yeah it's like a Speak\nEasy style yeah 10 10 Taco I'm pretty\nsure that's no it's not that 10 to 10\nsomething 10 to\n10 10 T okay is it tin I'll up the\nadventures of tin yeah you keep you keep\nlooking it up do and so yeah I had to\neat I was getting hangry though I was\ndude that burrito was good it was too\nmuch burrito but it was good yeah it was\ndefinitely too much but just in case\nyou're wondering our Taco count was\npretty high this trip oh my gosh I think\nI had at least 20 tacos can you explain\nwhy the breakfast taco thing is just not\neverywhere in the US why is it just in\nTexas why aren't there breakfast tacos\nat Roo at whatever just out it's the\nmost simple amazing Cuisine that you\ncould ever in the morning breast Megan\nmade herself a egg on a tortilla Tak\nTakara 10 to\n10 you did say 10 to 10 I said 10 to 10\nwait you said 10\n10 can we rewind the tapes I was the\nclosest I think Tak 10 to 10 anyway go\nfind this little hole in the wall it's\nreally good yeah do you think it's open\nfrom 10 to 10 I don't know that may be\nwhy like\n7-Eleven yeah but it's pretty close to\nthe convention center so it was packed\nyeah well it wasn't yeah this was a\nmistake on part cuz we ducked out faster\nthan you and Taylor and Carl yeah yeah\nso we got there and there was no line\nyeah we just strolled right up and\nplaced our order and then apparently the\nline went out the door yeah I remember\nsaying can confirm I looked I turned\naround and I said oh we got here at a\ngood time then Robbie and Carl and T\nshowed up had to stand out in the alley\nwa it for 40 minutes in line no\njoke it was worth\nit yeah it was for a moment you would\nhave been able to enjoy it more if you\nhad gotten it when we did probably\naccurate Carl would have enjoyed it if\nhe had gotten it hot yeah like a\nbackpack bured if he had a hot carl yeah\num anyway so then we ended up uh going\nfrom so hok we don't have to get the\ntimeline but hok was great what uh what\nwas the other one that was on on was\ninteresting although how many yes how\nmany Cloud Surfer shoes can you have\nturns out\nfour I am kind of excited to try the uh\nCloud Max yeah obviously Cloud Surfer\nMax or Cloud boom Max Cloud boom Max\nokay the one that's the that's a racer\nit's not a racer it's well it's a 3:30\nto 4 hour marathon shoe oh that's right\nso it's another one of those that's\naimed at I I think that's going to be a\nnew trend is like okay look you don't\nwant to be wearing the race Pinnacle\nRazor's Edge spear of the tip yeah tip\nof the yeah but at the same time s had\nthe the totally opposite strategy where\nhe was talking about the Endorphin Elite\n2 and he said this is for the marathoner\nwho runs four and a half five hours if\nthey just want the premium\nproduct and I have to say that foam felt\nlike it'd be fun to run in but from the\nEndorphin Elite too yeah or the cloud\ncloud boom no uh the cloud boom seemed\nlike\nlike it would be similar foam to what\nwas in the cloud boom\nEcho okay um or maybe what Adidas uses\nokay um the Endorphin Elite endorphin\nPro Elite\ntoo just the Endorphin Elite too just\nendorphin Elite it it was so spongy and\nand bouncy and it felt light and Squishy\nyeah D so when we got the adorf for\nelite do you think we got a early\nversion of the shoe cuz cuz everybody\nelse was like it's soft wonder that cuz\nI feel like they were the only people\nwho didn't love that shoe and like a lot\nof people really loved it especially our\nour guy that ran like every marathon in\nit last year\nuh um floberg yeah MH but yeah the two\nlooks very promising though ours was\nblocky so maybe we didn't get the right\nformulation but it just didn't feel\ngreat yeah all right so then there is\nthe on so there's the the on shoes on\nhas a trail shoe coming too that looks\nkind of interesting uh I forget the name\noff the top of my head um well Ralph's\nlike a lightning rod over there and then\nwe uh and then we what was the other I'm\ntrying to think what else was cool that\nday could just pull up the list of\neveryone we talked to yeah you could I\ndid like\num what about I I really enjoyed seeing\nthe Adidas stuff oh yeah they have fun\nstuff in the works we can talk about but\nthen also the product coming looks great\nand I don't want to tell you I tried\nsomething that we got hyped up about\nlast time and then I kind of blew it\nPrim x drung three yeah it I it boy it\nit looks like it could be fun again but\nyou're too scared to say it I'm too\nscared to say it but I tried it on and\nRobbie tried it on and they made sure\nthat we didn't run too far but it was\nthe final product they said so well\nspeaking of crazy and fun the Puma uh\nfast RB yeah RB rld RB LD yeah yeah once\nagain so that what was interesting to me\nabout that was I assumed that that was\nsupposed to be a race day shoe same and\nwe were told by Todd who's head of\nproduct there that it's actually just a\nfun wacky like cruising\nshoe yeah and it's I don't even know\nwhat's happening with it it's basically\nthe RB just laces right yeah correct\nthat's the LD that's the only difference\nLac Lac okay I mean basically he\ndescribed it as like a you want a really\nfun shoe to go out and run in and you're\ncomfortable spending $300 there's your\nshoe and it looks crazy I mean that's\nbasically what the cx1 is yeah it's $275\nor the prime X yeah but cx1 they're\nstill trying to tell you it's race Prime\nX Dr then I know what they're saying but\nI'm saying I I would agree it's closer\nto the primx\nstrung\num okay I don't know what other shoes\nlike that like there's a ton of shoes\nevery shoe that I loved last year\neverybody's like that's too expensive\nokay I was like well I mean I mean but\nthe Puma Sho is why you love them I know\nthat's that's why I'm trying to tell you\nwhat the best shoe is I didn't trying to\ntell you what the best value is if\nyou're getting the best feeling out of\nsomething you're going to love it it\nmight cost a lot uh the other\ninteresting thing speaking of ALS so\nexpensive the speed land speedland has a\nrunning shoe a road running shoe coming\nout it looked nice yeah and they it's\ninteresting because what they did was\nbasically what Adidas did with the Evo\nPro is they have a block of uncompressed\nfoam that\nthey I don't know lasered out and it\neven has raw kind of edges to it so it's\nnot even Ultra finished and then they uh\nput that underneath of they kind of\nusual you know insole uh yeah they're\nDro in insole as as well as the um upper\nwith a boa fit system did you try it\nwith both the plate and without the\nplate I didn't because it didn't fit me\nso okay I tried it with with the plate\nand without the plate I had one on each\nfoot and I have to say you need the\nplate okay and even they agree they're\nlike cuz it's a huge stack of foam and\nit's very soft and it feels very soft\nand bounc yeah yeah but the plate all it\ndid was kind of like the lateral to\nmedial side kind of like stabilized it a\nlittle bit yeah now I didn't I wasn't\nrunning it so I don't know but I'm going\nto assume that that would help yeah I\nagree yeah and that's uh $300 so that's\nthe same prices like you're saying all\nthose other\ncrazy uh shoes with everything like that\nin it you know we said there wasn't a\ntheme this year I think there is a theme\nokay expensive $200 shoes like\neverything's going up to 180 to well\nbecause everyone's putting the the\nreally expensive yeah phones and\nmaterials into their daily trainers and\nthere has to be a higher profit margin\non that either way it has to be oh for\nsure like even if you are putting in\nmore expensive components they have\ntheir own profit margins so yeah so it's\ndefinitely like if you're hoping that\nyou're going to be able to find those\ngreat one 120 shoes 130 but then look at\nthe look at the Evo SL that you Rave\nabout that's $150 shoe that's now the\nbudget is EV SL and the SL2 pretty good\npretty good price for some excellent\nshoes Robbie didn't didn't we name one\nof those the shoe of the year yeah I did\nI put the SL2 on there I felt like it\ndeserved it I and make didn't even run\nin it we had we had we had a internal\ndiscussion about that getting the top\nshoe because while I think it's really\ngood it's the other factors that play\ninto it make it the best well that's\nwhat I wrote It's the overall so it\ntakes into account all the things the\nversatility the price the the mids soole\nmaterial it almost be like it's a Honda\nCivic versus like yeah it's not the\nPorsche yeah it's not the Mercedes but\nit is the the shoe that's going to get\nthe job done in a really good way and a\nin a really good value at at\n120 130 130 full price but you know like\nI'll bet you if you Google it right now\nwhat what's it cost let me see cuz the\nis always dropping some crazy sales well\nthey're in Europe so they have those\nlike they don't go by the map pricing\nyou can find it I don't know what this\nwebsite is probably a scam but just take\nyour chances uh that was 80 bucks but\nthey only have one size knocking it off\nyou can find it at\num it looks like most places it is still\n130 but okay still a bargain shoe these\ndays yeah\num but the the evos is going to blow it\nout the water yeah true I did want to\nsay that also mounta Coast is I feel\nlike gaining a lot of traction not just\nfrom some of the stuff they have coming\nlike their Trail shoe and some of the\nFoams that they're going to be using but\nthe I've seen it on more people and even\nwhen I went on Wednesday morning Flores\nand Billy were both wearing the shoe\nthey really loved it yeah I was\nout is how many people are buying it I I\nthink a lot more I mean obvious but I'm\nsaying is Flores and Billy and those\nguys did they purchase those or those\nsamples it's a good question I mean\nprobably samples but yeah but I don't I\nmean they're wearing it they have plenty\nof other shoes I'm\nsure um now you we we talked to a guy\nthat's now doing their foam MH and now\nhe's or he's at Mount Coast now where\nwhere did he get his start so started he\nwas at we talked about this before but\nhe was at Sketchers\ndoing the super there super critical\nfils before anyone else was doing it and\nthat was when was this\nrazor it's a long time ago at least 10\nyears ago right uh dude I think it was\n10 years ago can't be what would be 10\nyears ago it was a couple years before I\nstarted here that was six years ago so\nyeah at least eight years you're you're\npre I had the razor before I had you oh\nyes Dad uh but it was it was longer than\nyou think okay I think maybe now I was\ntrying to find this yeah so okay this is\nthe photo of\nthe so they're using this Mala Coast is\nusing this foam that\nis made\nfrom it actually takes natural gas and\nextracts the\nlike methane or biomethane from it and\nthen converts it into essentially like a\nbiomass midso foam it's kind of a wild\nthing but I believe the entire so the\nentire midsole is\nthen biodegradable like you could\nliterally just throw it in the ground\nit'll light it on fire disintegrate it's\nnot any oils or anything huh but\nsupposedly it has all\nthe bouncy properties cuz I don't think\nthey're I mean the mount the coast shoes\nare pretty bouncy as it is I don't think\nthey're going to sacrifice\nthat so it says here let me read this it\nsays Circle cell which is their new foam\nthe world's first performance running\nshoe midsole technology to fully\nincorporate\nbiomass balance biopolymer made by 100%\nrenewable feed stock powered by our own\nSuper critical foaming process it\nmatches energy return a peba while\noffering 91% more durability so we will\nsee if you say natural gas yeah you're\nnot talking about like that you barbecue\non you're talking about methane from\nanimals think yeah they just hook it up\nright up to their anus and harvest that\nis that like fracking yeah jeez I think\nit's something like that that's why\nwould they want to ban fracking because\nyou just have cows farting\neverywhere I think that's what the\nscience says sounds\nright second check in all right you need\nmotivation you probably just ate so much\nyou're like ah how many miles am I gonna\nhave to run to burn off this food that I\njust gobbled down probably some drinks\ntoo so this is the best time of year to\njust kind of do some slow miles where\nyou burn them calories and you get you\nknow all the benefits of running and\nbeing outside and probably is going to\nmake you feel better too so if you're a\nlittle hung over getting some fresh air\nis nice\nall right guys another sponsor of this\npodcast one of our favorites cherub\nBundy now available in gummy form why\nwould I take Cher Bundy make um it helps\nwith recovery it helps with sleep it's\ndelicious now they come in gummy form\nand they're very delicious yeah is kind\nof like a treat you snack on them all\nday long it's a treat that is good for\nyou yeah uh we have jars of them at home\nand I've been taking them before bed\nwhich I've tried to use instead of\ntaking my melatonin which has been\nworking so far um but also if you want\nto just try them out right now they have\nthe sample four packs of the gummies\nwhere would I get those at the feed.com\nah they got everything over there our\ndiscount won't work on the feed.com but\nyou can just get the little sample pack\nand then if you really like them then\nyou can go to chundy dcom get the big\njar of them and use our code uh the drop\nfor 20%\noff um and so\nthat was that was cool and I think that\nwas like mostly the first day of what\nwas\ninteresting and then we the second day\nis that cool moved the second day yeah I\nthink we already talked about some the\nsecond day too yeah we did uh we because\nwe already talked about saky got pizza\ndude we forgot to say we hosted a\nfreaking Q&A at the satisfi bo was that\nthe first night yeah Wednesday night\nokay that was okay one of the booths\nthat blew me away yeah\nand look I get it satisfy has its own\nVibe and and literally it looked like\ncoffee Baristas were going through\ntraining there like everybody outside\nhad a beanie on and like you know cuffed\npants yeah it's like you it looked like\na scene from The Warriors but if they\nwere all Starbucks bruers but like at\nthe not even Starbucks like some\nunderground one where you had to knock\nthree times to get get a coffee and it\nlike steampunk Starbucks yeah it's like\nthere's probably more tattoos there than\nin the rest of the convention center\ncombined but on on one guy's neck so it\nis a little stereotype but I have to say\nbrand storytelling and packaging\nand everything that goes into like\nbuilding a cohesive brand it's like a\nmaster class like every piece of\nclothing oh yeah was fit into a\nspecific like you know it satisfy\nwithout looking at a label or anything\nlike that and they know what they're\ndoing sure yeah they're launching their\nfirst shoe mhm which we can't really\ntalk about right but even that like the\nconcept behind it and the execution was\njust\nFlawless yeah they do just the whole\nvibe and look and I mean they had a\nbooth a big Booth right in the middle of\nthe floor smack da in the flooor like\nbetween Nike and Hoka or something I\nmean it was prime prime real estate and\nit I mean just everything was beautiful\nI we got to talk to the shoe designer\nand uh the guy who's going to be heading\nup shoe design for uh Hoka who used to\nbe at Solomon in North Face um and just\nlike the product is next\nlevel and then we did get to talk to\nScott jerk the number one Trail Runner\nof time no big deal yeah that was\nawesome and do you have that do you have\nthat magazine that I got sign I want to\nput that in the FR yeah in my backpack\ncool did you get one sign for yourself I\ndidn't but that's all right all right\nwe'll hang it up at the office everybody\nwill be all enjoy it yeah and so it was\nit was really awesome talking to him I\nswear everyone from Minnesota is like\njust born with a nice Jean well not not\nno I think they're born with a freaking\nlike they everybody like think about\nevery Runner that we know from mon yeah\nthey're monsters athletically and also\nthe nicest people in the world Courtney\nde Walter they're like Canadians almost\nTaylor boty and her own trail\nreviewer Ben Johnson Ben Johnson Dakota\nlorm Dakota lorm I like the mil City\npeople I saw one of them at the mosh pit\nduring the y' Out Boy yeah shouted out\nsomething that I regret now but um we'll\nget there later uh but the um\nwhatchamacallit\nwhen we were interviewing him Robbie\ndoes an amazing job by the way I thought\nyour questions were fun and you brought\nit down to like a really nice level that\nwasn't is that gonna be a episode here\nare we going to be able extract that\naudio and and make that a podcast\nepisode maybe we're going to have to\nlisten to the quality and see how it\ncomes out all right we'll see yeah I got\nto ask him if he ever blew up spray\npaint cans in a bonfire as a kid like\nhe's not listen nobody else is asking\nhim that yeah I think he was into it he\nwas yeah we had a good time me he walked\nup beforehand he's like when we were\ntalking about doing the interview and I\nsaid look we don't normally do like the\nstand like we're not going to just be\nlike what was your favorite race what\nwas what time walk us through western\nstates yeah what did you eat before that\num I said we're usually very\nconversational he goes perfect because I\nyou know I get asked the same questions\nall the time and and I go I know we just\nread the the possessed article and it's\nlike I didn't want to just do yeah the\nsame questions they were in there we did\nmess up with one thing though what do we\noh no what' I say we didn't mention your\nboy Scott's Instagram page how did you\nnot do that I I it was the biggest\nmissed opportunity it's just when you're\nin a conversation you jump into it and\nthen you're car and then you're going on\nand by the time you know it it's over\nand you just forget yeah that's the I\nthink that's a good nice thing about a\ngood conversation is that sometimes you\njust forget to ask the most the list the\nthings you have on a list um but I\nactually am kind of glad didn't because\nI felt like it's a little awkward for\nhim in a way do you know what I mean\nlike I would have loved to have heard\nthat yeah make it weird I mean well we\ndid ask him about it afterwards yeah and\nhe basically was like it's he thinks\nit's funny he thinks it's funny but he\nalso it it for him some people actually\nthink it's him a lot of people a lot of\npeople it's pretty sometimes it could be\nharsh on some of the trail running\nathletes and he's like it's not I I\ndidn't say that so they actually think\nthat he's like ripping on Ultra and all\nthese like wow other athlete stereotypes\nand things and it's it's like it's stop\nme I mean that dude does go hard on alra\ndid you see the post on T though CU that\nhit hard that was pretty spot on that\nwas good wait would I I saw it but which\nthing got you good\num I don't I'm trying to remember now\nwhat my favorite slide was obviously the\nultra was funny um yeah I had to go back\nand I forget all them something about\nthe no someone mentioned us in the\ncomments of it but did they really yeah\nthat's amazing probably in a very\npositive way right\nso oh they they're ripping on the on\nparty oh that was good I like the on\nparty yeah they made it look like it was\nwhat's his name in in the office yeah\nwhich I hadn't I we didn't go to that\nit's perfect but I'm glad we didn't it\nwasn't a parking garage it oh that's the\none\nyeah um apparently there's nobody there\nyeah I do like the close your eyes\nimagine the most obnoxious Runners you\nknow they're all standing around in a\nbig open room the volume of idle\nconversation is deafening everyone's\nsocial skills are below average you've\njust attended\nTrey what was a comment that mentioned\nus um someone was like it is is it even\na party if the jumpsuit wearing believe\nin the Run crew or kafui don't show up\nno which I don't know if that was\nactually a that's not yeah that doesn't\nsound that bad that was Joel I don't\nknow I recognize this dude from some of\nour comments Joel we did switch it up\nthis year and did not do the jumpsuits\nwe did a\ntracksuit which I enjoyed I thought I\nthink it was more comfortable for two\ndays than the jumpsuit yeah it was and I\nthink I have a different idea for next\nyear okay so keep it fresh nude suits\nmhm it's actually Saran Wrap I don't\nhate that we're just going to\non your believe you're so doing it um\nthe Diddy oil by the way to bring it\nback if you bring the Diddy oil I'll\nbring this I'll wear this dude why don't\nwe just make our own brand of Diddy oil\nit puts the lotion on its skin yeah oh\njeez a no party like a diddy party yeah\nI don't know by this time next year he\nmight not even be alive so oh yeah\nthere's no way yeah the I these shoes\nright here that if you're watching\nYoutube you know so James uh from upper\nvoid\nhad reached out to us about these shoes\nand at first Sometimes some people from\nAsia will reach out about a product or\nshoe and it's usually like not a very\nhigh quality product yeah and so I'm\nhesitant sometimes but he was really\npersistent and I took a look at these\nshoes online before we committed to\nanything I was like these actually look\nkind of cool so if you're listening\nthey're basically insulated mule\nSlippers With bulbous\noutsoles like Caterpillar soul but it\nit's like a sleeping bag upper with a\nlittle you know almost like a pull tab\nuh lace system yeah like a quick lace\nlike a Solomon type situation and\nthey're pretty comfy dude I wore them I\nwalked to work here today and I wore\nthem and then I I wor I thought you ride\nyour bike every day uh or walk both\ngreen okay sometimes I do drive I have\nto I already caught him in a lie um\nanyway James came to our hotel and met\nus which again I was like we're real\nbusy during Trey so when somebody that I\ndon't know is like can I meet you and\nI'll come by and you're like oh okay\nwell I don't think he said to me I just\nsaid you can this is when this is the\nonly free time we have if you swing by\nthe hotel and sure enough I came in for\nmy run when we came back around 8:20 and\nhe was there already and you messaged me\nI'm like he'll have to wait and I was\nlike dude I got to take a shower I know\nbut then you came down I came down and\nuh I love these things man I I really do\nthink I mean there's a couple things I\nmight switch up about what are you\nwhat's the point of them it's a recovery\nshoe it's like a it's like a slipper\nthat you can wear outside I like I said\nI wore today it was what 40\u00b0 yeah feet\nwere warm the whole way it's great I\nworm back from the air airport so I\ncan't believe I'm touching because I\nwent in the airport bathroom in here I'm\ngoing to have to wash my hands but I\nwarm the whole way home from the thing\nthey were comfy they were cozy you know\nhow normally sometimes you can be on the\nplane your your foot expands or\nsomething and the shoes feel restrictive\nyeah these felt great the whole time and\nthen yeah they're perfect for walking\nthe dog I just slide them on so yeah\nthey're great so here's a lesson this is\na if you haven't re read between the\nlines I'll just spell it out for you for\nany of you shoe people product people\nwhatever if you really want to get\nsomething in front of someone you got to\nwork for it like it's nothing magical\nit's just going to show up and make your\nthing big nothing's but like I mean the\nsame thing happened with a I say Michael\nfrom a tray TI five years ago or\nwhatever pulled a Sho out of the bag\nyeah found us on the floor pulled his\nshoe out of the like I respect that 100%\nyou have a 10 times better chance of\ngetting your shoe in front of people if\nyou fly to Baltimore and knock on my\ndoor and hand us the shoe and then you\ndo about emailing me 55 times so I'm\njust saying they're all looking up your\naddress now good luck to you necessarily\nmy you could just say 1805 1805 yeah\n1805 Eastern Avenue between the hours of\n9:30 and 5:00 p.m.\nyeah I I would let's be a little more\nI'd say 10 to 4: yeah you might have to\nsleep over people knocking on the door\nwhy aren't they here yet but but I do\nrespect that like I love when people go\nabove and beyond also and that means\nthey care about it right also the\nclothing I liked I think that that they\nhad\nlike fashion forward like clothing also\nlike that kind of go with the shoes um I\nmean definitely I think there's some a\ncouple things I would improve about the\nshoe but I I think right now as is it\ncould be a hit yeah um so that was cool\nand then\nwe W what else as6 only had the gel\ncumulus but they did give us a sneak\npeek of their Ray shoes and I even got\nto try them out right Megan wor Megan\nwore a secret shoe yeah and I got to say\npretty excited about it now the fit was\na little bit off cuz it was a prototype\nyeah if the fit wasn't off how do you\nthink that she will compare to like the\npremium Market something like the Evo\nit's going to compete with the Evo\nthat's where it sits in in weight and\nperformance and that's my feeling I\nagain I didn't have the correct size so\nbut you've worn the Evo yeah raced a\nmarathon in it did you think there was\nbetter cushioning\nsame cushioning I don't know how\nmuch they want me to say I think you\ncould just say if you thought it was\nbetter or same I would say equivalent if\nnot better okay I think that would be\nfine okay speaking of mysteries I'm\nholding one yeah oh yeah mauno we popped\ninto that booth for a hot second yeah\ngot to see a bunch of mystery shoes well\nthat's the thing like they got to drop\nthe mystery I don't understand cuz they\ntold us what the shoe was but I guess\nwe're not supposed to say what it is so\nthere's mystery o1 O2 O3 and o4 but they\nlook like a shoe that you know so you're\nlike oh is that I think this is a\nmarketing strategy that is not it it's\nlike when you dress a dog up as a ghost\nlike put a sheet over the dog you know\nit's still a dog just dressed as a ghost\nit's not a ghost it's not a ghost dog\nyeah it's just like when you put a few\npolka dots on a Neo Vista 2 I know what\nit's going to be but I don't think this\nis a Neo Vista 2\nsee it is that isn't but the other the\nother one there was it was yeah but I\nactually ran 12 miles in this one\nyesterday\nokay I actually think wait is that not\nthe neist maybe it is a maybe it is a\nghost not a dog in a sheet I know that's\nthe thing well I don't are we allowed to\nsay the names of the other mystery well\neveryone knows the Neo Vista 2 is coming\nbut I think this is the other one okay\nand I cuz I don't think it has I'm not\nsure if this this is the plate that the\nokay other at least it didn't feel like\nit was the plated version I also ran\nthat shoe and it and I liked it quite a\nbit Yeah the cushioning is really nice\nthe only problem I have it's a half size\ntoo big for me oh and this is a 10 and a\nhalf so and our friend Justine who works\nthere MH when I posted that hey I ran in\nthis and I felt like maybe it was a half\nsize too big she said that she also\nfeels that okay well it's also uh I'm\nassuming an\nearly mystery yeah production model of\nthat sh mystery mystery machine so I'm\ngoing to actually request a half size\ndown cuz the cushioning on this feels\ndelightful really okay all right mauno\nthat's exciting to hear because you I\nmean I like the Neo Vista a lot so well\nyou'll like this okay uh but you with\nall your issues with um sizing yeah like\nliterally Robbie can get five shoes same\nbrand and be a different size in each\none um I I'm curious if if one if it\nfits you and two if you I I I have a\npair at home yeah we all got them right\nmine fit fine by the way did Carl get\nthese no you want these 10 and a half to\nsee if they fit\nyou all right he says unconvincing I did\nI did run 12 miles and them gross dude\num I dude the also man the norda norda\no5 which we should probably talk about\nsince we wore it the whole time we were\nthere yeah mhm I did go in a run with\nthat on Thursday\nmorning uh she's fantastic it's going to\nI mean just on Saturday their Matteo\nsidel or Mato that's his Instagram Matt\ncidel uh their their Trail athlete he\ntook third at JFK 50 Meer ran point the\nwhole length of the race in the shoe you\nknow how a lot of people change out when\nthey get to the to Toe Path he wore the\nthing the whole\nway the ls AR finished with the eighth\nfastest time overall the lugs weren't\nthe um they're not super aggressive I\nsay they're like 3 mm lugs right and\nthey're kind of spaced apart so it's not\nlike but it has they have the vbr mega\ngrip Elite or something like the new vbr\nrubber that's not on anything else yet\nit's their first shoe to have it yeah um\ncourse it's pretty shoot too yeah so I T\nwhen we were at the satisfy thing too I\ntalked to Max um max joffre's the the\nthe dude who won the Moab 240 yeah a\ncouple weeks ago I like he's super nice\nwhy am I forgetting his last name and\nuh and he\num he told me I asked him how many miles\nhe had on his a pair of\no1s he's one of those guys who has like\n500 miles right dude 1,500 miles he said\nhe still would wear it but the vbra more\nthe whole way through so the upper still\nintact which is crazy for a shoe with,\n1500 miles but has that dyema so it's\nreally if like I could get it resold and\njust keep rocking it but and so this is\nwhy and I know we talk about this but\npeople were like oh it's a $300 shoe\nlike dude you just paid $100 for a pair\nof shoes because you got most trail\nshoes break down at Round 500 or the\nuppers or something get destroyed\nsomething's going to happen or any shoe\nso you're you just got you could get\n1,000 miles out of it 1,200 maybe it\nalso looks great and it looks good I\nmean it is like\nI it's it's funny there's some brands\nthat you just you just really like and I\nthink that norta does a good job like\nsatisfy that you immediately recognize\ntheir\nproduct it it's cohesive it all it it\ntells the same story in a different way\nbased on use and I just think it's so\nclean and so good-looking and yeah just\nso well thought out I mean and I a few\nsatisfied things and I think they're a\ncouple of my favorite things ever um but\nI also understand like yeah a shirt's a\nshirt like you can wear a shirt well\nthat somebody asked me so when we were\nin the mosh pit I was wearing the\nsatisfy shirt with the holes in it yeah\nand he said is it worth it I said no\nit's a cotton t-shirt with holes in it\nright but it it's it is worth it if you\nbuy into the\nwhole satisfy lure hey it is a\ncomfortable t-shirt I'll say that it is\nbut like you but yeah it's right I get\nit I also that Abra comi what Olympic\nshirt it feels very similar and it was\n$40 yeah and but that that's the thing\nthey the other piece the technical\npieces like that shirt that you you wore\nso much that I stopped wearing mine oh\nyeah the uh tan one uh the western shirt\nor the river shirt yeah the river shirt\nthat shirt I like the quality and the\nfeel why cuz I wear it because like you\nknow it's like I'll show up and then be\nRobie and me dressed like going Safari\ntogether\num yeah that's also a great one but the\nat least in the shoes like with the\nnorta you're you are\ngetting D like they're going to outlast\nany other shoe like that's just for sure\nhave you worn any of the NIS out cuz\nwe've gotten several pairs from them um\nlike what do you mean to run in after y'\nOut Boy you guys got your I'm taking\nphot I'm taking photos of my o5s with\nthe y'all out boy pit juice jues yeah it\nlooks like I\nDida um the Whatchamacallit the like the\no1 my original pair that I first got\nfrom them MH I wore it casually all over\nthe place wore it for every trail run\ntook it to Tahoe yeah run some of the\nfaster basses runs in it everywhere I've\ngone the thing while it has some it was\nan allwhite version so it has some like\ndiscoloring from dirt MH but it's it's\nstill super solid oh yeah I have the the\nsatisfy one we got\nwas which is actually the only poor\nbuild quality they had cuz there's like\na tape on it that was coming off but if\nanyone had that problem I think they\nreplaced them yeah they did but they uh\nit wasn't a structural thing it was just\na cosmetic thing but bonding still uh\nthat's the one I just wear for if I'm\nrunning in this shoe or that one's\npretty pretty beat up but like just\ncosmetically really um anyways they I\nthink they do a great job the o05 is\nlike the o one but somehow better um\nwell it's different it's there it's\nreally lightweight I think it's like in\n7 ounce range for my size 10 and a half\nuh a little bit seven and a half M I\nthink mine was or maybe for yours it\nmight be eight mine was seven okay yeah\nbut that's incredibly light for trail\nfor trail with a full like full coverage\nuh vbr bottom and like a pretty\nsupportive upper yeah and it's a dyema\nupper it's a

your\nLagoon pillow I was my head is it's like\nperfectly comfortable keep my head cool\nwhat's super exciting you guys have\nprobably heard us talk about Lagoon a\nbunch if you listen to this podcast

use the code\nbelieve to save a bunch of money\nanyways so that was cool the the oh go\nwe talked about the on one uh yeah the\nother thing I was going to say was the\nNike oh the Nike cuz there's some cool\nstuff there is there's stuff that we\ncan't see I can tell you this though\nwhen I was interviewing the uh designer\nasley or Ashley the PM um I ask because\neverybody always asks is the tempo next\npercent ever coming back\nand she alluded to saying that some form\nof that purpose in that design of a shoe\nwill be making a return I didn't get\nthat I heard that the zoomfly six is\nyour close\nsecond H watch watch watch the I'll have\nto watch the video again interpretation\nI guess that's actually that's actually\nwhat I heard cuz I watched it this\nmorning oh you did yeah okay uh it\nseemed like she said it wasn't but that\nthere will be she either the zoomfly 6\nor other things will not make you miss\nit is kind of the idea zoomfly 6 it's\nalready out yeah but she's saying oh no\nshe said the zoomfly but I I think she\nwas saying at one point what rewatched\nit because I when I asked her I felt\nlike she was telling me that there was\nanother shoe coming well no because I\nwatched it well okay maybe but I watched\nit after you said that because I was\ninterested to see what she was saying\nI'll have to watch and it sounded more\nlike we have other stuff that you're not\ngoing to worry about it you know yeah I\ndon't know they are streamlining their\nwhole lineup which is nice so you have\nairbags and stuff vomo Pegasus structure\nand then they'll each have a premium\nplus a plus and a premium plus and a\npremium and then like the standard so\nright now you know already that Pegasus\nhas the Pegasus 41 Pegasus plus which\nlooks like the turbo mhm and then you\nhave the pegas premium which is the one\nwith the full length a\nair bubble at the bottom so that's how\nthat goes so we just got the vomero and\nwe got to see it but we can't really\nshare or talk about it too much the vomo\nplus and the vomo premium and I'm pretty\npumped and if you extrapolate the\ndesigns of the Pegasus you could\nprobably figure out some of the things\nthat will be incorporated into the into\nthe both structure and and uh and the I\nwasn't you guys were going Gaga over\nsome of the structure stuff dude it\nlooked great freaking awesome I thought\nit was okay okay you guys were like like\nI was really excited about the vomero\nstuff I think it was also shocking to\nthink that the structure was going to\nlook good I think maybe that was part of\nit yeah and it does look really good now\nbut here's the thing I was like okay\nwhere do the zoomfly fit into this\nstructure I guess there's racing and\nmaybe because the zoomfly should be with\nthat kind of thinking zoomfly would be\nthe\nvaporfly and then you'd have vaporfly\nwould be the vaporfly plus and the\nalphafly would be right vaporfly\npremium sure that logic works the only\nthing I'm that makes me a little\nconcerned about all these pluses and\npremiums and whatnot is that it seems\nalmost are they performance shoes or\nwhat are they are they lifestyle shoes\nbecause it's there's a very heavy\nlifestyle vibe to a lot of\nthem yeah I would say look the the\nPegasus premium to me looks like a\nlifestyle shoe running in it though it\nfelt like the Glide ride Max no but like\nMegan for example is just her premiums\nwere here because they came while she\nwas at that Adidas Retreat I'm excited\nto see what you think about them and a\nmatter of fact I want you to run those\nas soon as possible we could do a first\nthoughts but I also have to I do I\nalready have all my miles in it h yeah\nI'm interested because and that's not a\nlight shoe just as the vomero is also\nnot they're all coming in around 12\nclose the premium is is over 12 O for me\nbut the difference is like it really\ndoes have a trampoline effect with the\nairbag and the zoomx that when I I ran\nwhen I pulled out I didn't feel that\nheavy in my hand then I ran I did a\n12mile run out of the box and I was like\nI didn't think it was Heavy at all okay\nand so when I got back and I posted a\npicture people like oh it's a break it's\nheavy I was like no I'm going to go wait\nand prove these guys wrong and I was\nlike whoa it's 12 and half I was like\nthey're right it's heavy but it doesn't\nfeel like it on your foot I got you okay\nI I hope people at least give it a a\nchance before they they just bash it out\nof out of hand\nyeah all right well we'll see for sure\nuh I don't know if there's any I mean\nSketchers is back I thought they were\ndead and I thought they had a\ngood-looking shoe what was that shoe\ncalled um I I don't know but it was\nwait what's the name of the new I can\nsee it on the wall and I can't read it\nfuriosa I think it starts in F though\ndoes it frenzy no Fireball I don't know\nwell we'll look it up you'll hear about\nit soon it was actually a pretty decent\nlooking shoe it's like a Tempo kind of\nmiddle Tempo trainer super trainer type\nthing if it had been the like if they\nsaid that's a Razer 7 I would have been\nlike okay yeah but yeah and then a Max\nlike essentially a Max Max cushion shoe\nthat's not the max Road it's not the max\nroad that one felt pretty good I put it\non my phone yeah yeah you both tried\nthat on didn't you yeah that was nice so\nI guess yes although Robbie looked the\ndude straight in the eyes and said it's\nno Max Road I mean nothing ever will be\nthat's true it's one of the best shoes\never made I stand by that Husker do\nHusker don't yeah Max for six and and go\nrun ride 11 yeah and then I'm holding\nright now the Solomon arog Glide three\nand they've gone to a super critical\nfoam like that popcorn style I think I'm\ngonna like that one I do it it uh it's\nnice and clean looking like it's there's\nit doesn't look crazy um I'm guessing\ncan you put this on a scale cuz I'm\nguessing this is going to be a little\nbit on the heavy side yes\nsir oh no 9.3 9.3 not bad at all that's\nnot bad and it feels that's got some\nkush tell me what the stack is on that M\nbecause that's got to be like oh I don't\nknow she give me a spec let me see it\nbut I'm gonna say that's\n45 that's pretty\nnice yeah Solomon all right arog Glide\nthree you're new talk to gion about\nthese\ngion um dude he was running the cross\ncountry Championship yeah that was also\nhappening on Thursday morning yeah he's\nlike you can just do it even though I'm\nfrom France really yeah how about cross\nout of our country and run your own race\ndude I'm just kidding I'm I'm just\nkidding you're very lovely human you're\nmore than\nwelcome gan gan that dude's cool yeah\nI'm always like intimidated by him like\nwhat he's like uh he he's nice in that\nway he's a Frenchman and he's nice but\nyou you also feel the disdain coming off\nhim for Americans which I don't blame\nhim I feel he's more of a pace shamer\nyou think so like uh it's nice that you\ntried running you know because he's\nprobably like a 210 Marathon oh he's\nsuper fast he's like uh is it\ninteresting that you like this sport\nsince you are so bad at it it's funny\ncuz we were talking he ran New York City\ntoo this year for fun like I did and he\nwas like yeah it's the best you just run\nit at like a Tempo pace and I'm like\nwonder what his like Fun Pace was and\nnow I got to look it up it has to be a\n245 like a 230 casual yeah yeah he's\ndefinitely fast no he's super cool\nthough I didn't mean to say that about\nthe I was just no I like The Stereotype\nof the French yeah no I was talking\nabout the cross country so remember how\nwhen we were in France and we saw the\nfire department and they were like fit\nand handsome dudes uh yeah I guess we\nwere in the supermarket say I saw the\nBaltimore County or Baltimore City\nFirefighters yeah not the same oh yeah\nit looks like they haven't saved\nsomething since\n1989 uh certainly not a chicken wing\nyeah just vaping out\nfront oh God actually I would if they\nwere smoking I'd almost feel like okay\nyou're you're getting used to the\nenvironment that you're in you know\nyou're getting you're it's like it's\nlike a heart rate training for them yeah\nyeah absolutely like I want you to be\ninhaling a little bit of smoke just in\ncase you do inhale some while you're\nsaving someone so that you know what\nit's like and you the frch days are\nsmoking that's true they do yeah yeah\nthat's probably why they're so healthy\nover there I did that there's when Jack\ncop when we were in Paris and he was he\nwas smoking away yeah yeah he was I\ndon't I'm sure that happened um Robie\nyou would know I\nwouldn't anyway Terry was great we C can\nwe end can we cap off the what how we\ncapped it off yeah y'all Out Boy always\ny'all Out Boy which is always fun it's\nalways the Brooks party I was not\nanticipating them to start singing so\nearly we showed up like 30 minutes late\nupset that we missed Mr bright side cuz\nwe were we were at dinner and when we\ngot there we missed it by like a minute\ntoo that is the worst and then they took\na break right after it yeah they had a\nbreak between sets oh I have to say\nthere's one dude who tried to calm Carl\nand tailor down and I had to give him\nthe wait there's a what oh you don't\nknow about this they were getting they\nwere getting a little aggressive in the\nmiddle and you know it's fine so when\nthe music Started Carl who roduced us to\nbringing the mosh to the party last year\nthat no one wants nobody wants but\nthat's the thing you think you don't\nwant it and then you want it yeah and it\ngot there but this one guy turned around\nearly in the in the um when the band was\nplaying and you just Taylor and Carl\nstart bumping people and he's like hey\nyou guys almost ruined it last\ntime almost I'm pretty sure they did\nruin it no Dez Lyon crowd Sur was insane\nlike it was the best we had a great time\nso I just looked over at\nhim and told him how I felt about it I\nknow and told him to turn around and\nlike look if you don't want to be in it\nget out of the\nfront yeah you're he wasn't a PR person\nwas he he I'm sure he's somebody that I\nshouldn't have been yeah mean to he's\ndefinitely listening to this right now\nif you're listening to this or you told\nyour friends and your friends are\nlistening I was no part of\nthis I was just looking from\nabove situation if you're listening I\nstill feel the same\nway wow I was I we could be

have been\nexcept for t look Taylor myself I don't\nknow about Carl cuz he was bopping\naround but Taylor and I were down to\nlike I felt like we had violence yeah in\nus and I didn't expect this from Taylor\nI think he was he was ready to go I\nthink he had some stuff to drink\nincluding possibly Jagger no I think I\ndon't think I of us had anything he was\nvery lovely at breakfast very animated\nthe next morning that's because he was\nstill a\nhammer um back to\nteaching thank goodness he got the later\nflight originally he was supposed to fly\nout at 6:00 a.m. on Friday morning

Joint yeah\nbut I me it was all in all it was a\npretty good weekend it was a week\nactually not a weekend yeah a couple\ndays it was a few but true and that it\nwas a couple days over a week what

an in\nbetween year if you will everyone's\nsaying 2026 is going to be great yeah so\nI think there's that\num but I mean whatever that's how it\ngoes there's always like a year last\nyear was crazy a lot of new stuff and\nthen you know but was nuts about last\nbut what was nuts about last\nyear which I'm looking forward to this\nyear is all a little surprised we didn't\nknow about the Skyward X we didn't know\nabout the CL X1 we didn't there's a\nwhole bunch of shoes that came out from\ndifferent brands well that's the is that\nwe probably don't know a lot about some\nof the stuff that's coming

people are going for PR probably's\ngoing for a line of sight the best\ncontent I ever went to was Tegan and\nSarah do you know who they are yeah yeah\nthat was the best concert here's why is\nbecause it was all it was all lesbian\nchicks who were like 2 in shorter than\nme so I could see over the entire crowd\nat any given moment it was perfect no\ndude no lines for the bathrooms I was\nlike one of five dudes there it was\nfantastic that is amazing like the Best\nConcert Experience of my whole life so\nare you going to lill Fair this year if\nthey have bring it back I'm there yeah I\nI'll do it just to see over the crowd I\ndon't even care all right well you don't\nhave to now that you could have the the\nfast\nRB RB yeah I think people when also when\nthey see me in person don't realize I\nI'm not extremely short I'm 5'6 and a\nhalf but the uh but on camera you can't\ntell it's hard to tell how tall people\nare so I think people are surprised do\nthey think you're tall I think they\nnormally think I would be taller okay\nbut then that's bizarre because then how\ntall would I be I think just in camera\nthough you don't really notice those\ndifferences even though okay you are a\nfew inches taller than me like it's or\nwhatever how tall are you 510 six six\nfeet I don't know get a measuring tape\nare you yeah how much do you weigh 175\nyeah remember people I\nknow one time Thomas said that in riew\npeople were like dude there's no way I\nsaw this guy at a star line he's at\nleast 200 or something it's like no he\nreally does weigh that much yeah I'm\nactually\n5'11 are you okay because you didn't\nwant the comments people no I'm I'm I'm\n51 I thought you told me that before\nthat's why I was no I am I am what\nhappened oh it's I think it's touching\nthe metal I'm 5'11 but you'll never\ncatch me without a pair of shoes on so\nI'm six foot um okay I don't think\nthat's how it works at a doctor's office\nI don't go to a doctor a doctor yeah I\nthat's the official measurement is the\ndoctor's office no I don't believe that\nyou can't put it's not a Hershey Park\nride you can't put your shoes on and say\nthis is how tall I am yeah pretty much I\ncan get on the bumper cars that's my\nheight I feel like you can make Megan\ntries to say she's 5'4 there's no way\nshe's 5'4 yes I am that's what the\ndoctors say and they're the official\nrulle keep okay we're getting a tape\nmeasure out no not you the doctor you\nneed the scale you need to stand on the\nscale with an extractable telescopic uh\nmeasuring tape all right that's the only\none that's official all right I've\nalways my dad was 6'1 so I always wanted\nto be at least 6 feet I come up just a\nhair short yeah I mean sometimes that\njust but Meanwhile my son is 63 already\nhe's 15 yeah he took the missing the\nmissing height from you and transferred\nit\nover anyways so that was a good trip all\nkinds of fun we'll be posting a preview\nof stuff to the website who knows when\nthat's going to get done CU it takes so\nlong to do what was your favorite oh by\nthe way speaking of the website our best\nof shoes are up so go check that out\nwhat was your favorite thing that you\nate while we were there that I I I still\nthink I mean that steak we had the one\nnight was pretty fantastic yeah the that\nwas the best for me that was definitely\nthe best but the V honestly the v313\npizza is just always good to me I think\nit's good that or the burrito or the the\nburrito from 1010 the tacos I had so\nmany tacos I'm trying to remember which\none was my favorite\nI have to say I think that the taco one\nfarra Cruz was it Taco one taco one was\nthe little like cold place that we went\nfor lunch yeah I I like their tacos and\nI got the chips I felt bad cuz there's\nthis one dude who had like a barbecue\nplace in the convention center in his\nown restaurant he's like yeah just come\nback and get some like some barbecue\nI'll just give you a plate and I just we\nwere so busy I didn't get to make myself\nmake my way back there I think it was\ncalled like slab barbecue I bet he did\nokay oh yeah so yeah yes it's called\nslab barbecue and beer it sounds\ngood I do miss that we didn't do any\nbarbecue this time yeah that lame and\nI'm like what is in Maryland that you\nwould eat like if you came I take\neverybody to Ean but like if you were\nhere like crabs are pretty much it and I\ndon't like eating crabs all the time\nlike you can eat a taco any time of the\nyear all the time like I'm not going to\nfor crabs in Christmas time yeah oh man\nlook think that's a slap barbecue this\nfood looks legit I'm real hungry I\nalready eat my lunch all right it's oh\nme lost her mic she's gone okay so oh\nback here you got to just talk into it\nRalph all right we got

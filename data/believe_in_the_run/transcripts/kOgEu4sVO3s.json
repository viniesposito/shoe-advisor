  "text": "[Music]\nhi this is Thomas with believe in the\nrun this is Robbie with believe in the\nrun this is Megan with believe in the\nrun and you're back for a funfilled\npacked\npodcast holiday\nChristmas Hanukkah why is there a c in\nfront of Hanukkah you can spell it two\nways why I don't I that to me is they\ndon't do they don't do good branding\nsome people say Hanukkah some people say\nchanuka they still say Hanukkah but\nthere's a silent sea I I well no like\ncha chica wait there's oh I just I\nassumed it was a silent sea\nHanah it's probably something like that\nbut that they really they got bad\nbranding which is strange because\ntypically yeah you know yeah we need w\nfoot Jarrett to come on the show and\ngive his Jarrett wife B and give his uh\nfull indepth history it'll take eight\ndays though yeah oh if you're out there\ngetting ready to celebrate Hanukkah you\nknow congrats yeah when does it's\nprobably starting one of these days no I\nGoogled it um it starts on Christmas oh\nis that like Passover you never know\nwhen it starts exactly it's on a\ndifferent calendar right sorry for being\nso ignorant about this stuff but you\nknow how it is yeah we we never claim\nourselves to be the most educated bunch\nin the world no but you know that Google\nreleased this chip that says that there\nis\nactually a Multiverse Oh I thought that\nyou going to say there's a\nHanukkah two things a different day two\nthings that blew my mind well\nmultiverses Christmas and anuka that's\ntwo different true verses and they have\ndifferent calendar so I going they\nshould call they should make a holiday\ncalled chronica that's probably exists\nin certain circles I would believe Snoop\nDog celebrates Chron Dr Dre and Snoop\ndogs um yeah but with the multi verse\nthat one blew my mind with this new chip\nthat Google has okay so what do you I\ndon't understand you got to explain a\nlittle bit more the chip is existence in\nitself points at having a Multiverse\nbecause the only chip that would do the\nsame work right now that we have would\ntake a trillion years to do it oh I have\nheard about this so that this chip is\nactually they're saying has to be\naccessing multiverses to oh because\ncomputational power it almost like\nbreaks the laws of physics or whatever\nexactly and the other one that blew my\nmind was this guy was talking about\nspace travel and speed of light and we\ncould get to it would take about I I\nthink he said\nlike it was like some ridiculous short\nperiod of time to get to the next\nclosest galaxy uhhuh he said and to get\nback if you could travel at near the\nspeed of light uhhuh he goes the only\nproblem is you wouldn't be able to tell\nanybody about because by the time you\ngot back it'd be four million years\nlater on Earth\nman hold on I'm breaking my head I know\nI was just thinking about chips the only\nkind of chips that probably I was\nthinking more Kettle Kettle Coke or\nsomething that's some Kettle Coke chips\nfeel like I'm in a Multiverse depending\non the flavor yeah I also think that\nMegan time travels cuz when she runs a\nmarathon it's about an hour faster than\nus and by the time we're done that's\nactually she's already had\ncocktails yeah there's definitely some\ntime travel going on\nthere yeah Thomas also everything he\nsees on Instagram now I mean there's no\nreason not to what what have I been\nwrong about so this week he sent me a\nreal and it said it was Deep Creek\nMaryland uhhuh and it was Lake\nCo no I haven't been to Deep Creek in a\nwhile maybe it looks like Lake l in\nItaly it wasn't you you can't prove\nwhere it was no it was 100% from Italy\nand he sends it to me as if like cuz\nhe's always looking like real estate\nlike places where we could get like a\ncool like Lake Shore home or some place\nwhere we could go to to vacay and so I\nthink the intent was to be like look how\ngreat Deep Creek is and I was like\npossibly it took me 15 seconds to\nrealize that was in fact not Deep Creek\noh wow and he was like yeah look at how\ngreat this could be look I also spend I\ndon't do like in depth when I'm going\nthrough Instagram I scrolling I see\nsomething a that's cool send that yeah\nit's not like I go let me read the\nentire thing and see the fine print and\nmaybe Lake like Deep Creek is the Lake\nComo no the person who posted it was\ntrying to make everyone believe that\nthat was deep like I don't know what\npeople are doing on Instagram just\nposting I've seen these um I've seen\nthese before I don't know if in\nInstagram by the way Deep Creek is\nman-made lake in Western Marland okay\nfun fact there's no natural lakes in\nMaryland at all yeah there's just\nreservoirs and I don't know Army\nprojects but the I've seen this though\npeople will post there's a lot of AI\nGenera stuff and it's like the Grand\nCanyon of uh\nPennsylvania not like not even what it\nlooks like there is this quote unquote\nGrand Canyon Pennsylvania that's a real\nthing but is it Grand actually it\nactually is pretty grand for p by\nPennsylvania standards but uh but I'm\nlike what what's the point of this I\ndon't even understand the engagement\npart of it why do you need why you like\nwhat is like what brand deals are they\ngetting from that wait I think that you\nguys like why do you immediately go to\nBrand deals well what are what are you\ndoing I think there's all kinds of\nreasons for these bots on Instagram they\nbuild up a giant following then they\nsell the account to someone you think\nthat's what's going on I think that's\none of them I know that they do what\nthey do is they'll try to build up a\nhuge audience quickly yeah and they use\nall the little techniques and then they\ngo to a business and you can change the\nname so then you buy it and you look\nlike you have you know 50 to 200,000\nfollowers and you're like boom I was\ntalk did we talk about this on another\nepisode about how I think we did but how\nif a real goes viral now yeah we talked\nabout that it doesn't get any you said\nit doesn't necessarily do anything for\nthe account yeah and on that but\nremember when it actually did like you\nwould if someone had a viral post or\nreal they would end up getting like\n50,000 followers from it that I mean I\nlook at like the hakua phen phenomenon\nyeah\nthat happened this past summer yeah that\nArc used to be like you had like six\nmonths right of it being funny and let's\nt-shirts and yeah all sorts of stuff now\nI really feel like you have like three\nto four weeks and it's gone yeah and\nthen yeah but she got like a podcast\nstuff yeah that it was horrible of\ncourse I don't already done I think so\nand then she did a meme coin that she\nmight go to jail for at this point okay\ndo you think that she actually knew what\nshe was doing like do or do you think\nsomeone said hey let's do a Bitcoin and\nprobably not or a blockchain coin and I\ndon't think but I don't know if that\nabsolves you from the\npotential uh whatever violation SEC\nviolations from yeah cashing out on it\nimmediately after it spikes yeah I don't\nknow um it I think I don't know how hard\nthat stuff is to prove I will tell you\nthat Bitcoin man it hit another high it\ndid it yeah I haven't really been paying\nattention a bit you don't want to if\nyou're not in it you get mad was it\n110 like I think it hit like2 or\nsomething or that's all right yeah but\nwhatever anyways um yeah for those of\nyou not in the super power\ncomputational chips what do you call\nQuantum Computing yeah Instagram\nreels and crypto yeah imagine imagine\njumping into this running podcast and\nyou're just like what is happening\nanyone listening to this knows there's\nminimal running content these days I\ndon't know if anyone there's tons of\nrunning content there's definitely has\nto be a number of people each week who\ncome into this new new yeah thinking\nit's a running podcast which it is we'll\nget into that in two hours from now it's\nit's a like what can we relate it to\nthat something that's like like this um\nlike our universe is running but we're\nalso going to talk about about the other\nstuff in the universe yeah I don't know\nlike a some sort of barnab and Bailey\nfreak Show it's still a circus they have\ntigers and lions but then off to the\nside it would be more like that if Megan\nhad your mustache yeah you should try\nyou should get one I don't think that's\nhow it works I mean I don't I I've been\nI've known Megan for several years now I\nthink over we're well over 10 years now\nand uh I've never seen her with a\nmustache well she digs into Carl's T\nstash uh creepy Carl creepy Carl oh guys\ndon't make it stick creepy creepy Carl's\nnot creepy he said he was he's a little\ncreepy do you watch his\nstories um I love his stories yeah like\nI feel like I'm getting a look like it's\nlike a little window opens up in car\nCarl's head and you get to see what's\ngoing on in there it's all through the\nlens of a binocular yeah binoculars from\nif there was apartment word for emo that\nstarted with K I would be calling him\nKemo Cho I don't think you want to call\nhim that that's not going to work no we\nneed we need a word for emo off The\nRocker Carl's been running though yeah I\nknow I heard I heard there's been\nsighting Sasquatch sightings of Carl out\nthere the grer films\nyeah yeah so was the Bruder the one who\nfilmed from the null no the guy was on\nthe null the grassy null the grassy null\nis where they think shots were fired\nfrom but the the camera was the one that\ncaptured like the Kennedy getting shot\nright that's the film yeah did you um\nspeaking of which I was watching a thing\nwhen Trump was getting assassinate and I\ndon't know if this one's a fake and me\nsays I believe everything on Instagram\nyou just said when Trump was\nassassinated so I'm thinking that's fake\nno attempted ass there's a woman sitting\nright behind him oh gosh who doesn't she\ndoesn't Flinch she doesn't move she like\nholds up a sign then puts it down and\nnods and then the fire goes off and she\ndoesn't move and then she just kind of\nsmirks when everything that's going on\nand it's in the video and I'm like dude\nyeah I just I just think people react to\nthings differently well yeah I don't\nknow that one I'm starting to think I\nmean I don't know that the whole thing's\ninsane so I don't I mean yeah I don't\ntrust anything from anyone anyways and\ntalk about surreal they showed a box at\nlike the Army Navy\nand it was Trump Elon Musk uh like\nseveral other guys and you're just like\nlooking in that box you're like there\nthe weirdest group of people it's a\nweird time yeah I mean if there's any\nMultiverse we're living we're living in\none of them the chip is proving it yeah\num before we get off the subject of\nChristmas and holidays do you have some\nupdates on new movies that we have\nwatched oh okay if you want to hear\nabout them I would like to hear about\nthem you were there uhhuh well kind of\num okay Operation Christmas drop oh yeah\nI've heard of this one before four out\nof 10 Stars really bad yeah not good not\ngood it was really bad I couldn't tell\nyou any of the actors in it um it was\nabout I don't even really understand the\nplot and I watch the plot was that\nthey're have to close down the military\nis making cuts and they want to close\ndown a base and this one base went viral\nfor dropping Christmas presents to um to\nlike Islands out in the Pacific and they\nwhere they at bombs this guy this guy is\nwasting Resources by doing Christmas\npresent drops on these islands and so\nthey send out a rep an attractive rep\nuhhuh from the mil from the government\nokay one of the congresswoman's Reps and\nshe goes out there and you make this\nsound better than it is she meets the\nguy and he's like debonaire and you know\nlike no he looks like a Kendall like\nlittle cocky and so you think oh he's\njust a a-hole and then no you find out\nhe's got a heart of gold oh okay and\nthat what he's doing is he's helping\npeople and he's doing it all through\ndonations and stuff so it's not wasting\nthe\nmilitary uh money this sounds like a\npropaganda film but okay she falls in\nlove with him the congresswoman comes\nout to spoil Christmas and be like\nyou're close down oh and she gets a\nChristmas spirit as well and everything\nis great so it's kind of like uh what\naccent just happened I think that's my\nChristmas it's kind of like SpongeBob\nbut instead of Bikini Bottom it's like\nthe bikini at to they're like on top\nthey're on land so Squidward is the uh\nis the one who wants to ruin Christmas\nSpongeBob no crusty Krabs wants to cut\nprices ah okay or expenses they're using\ntoo much fresh crab in the Krabby Patty\nokay this makes more sense now thank you\nfor that's quid where it's like oh go\ncheck it out I think that's the accident\nyou were going for yeah whe\nunintentionally SpongeBob okay that's\nnot bad actually don't do anymore just\nstop that was perfect I I think the key\nto doing accents is doing one word and\nthen no one can tell that was I had a\nfriend who did James Bond she could do\nBolt the door before you leave or\nsomething that might be too long yeah\nyeah too many words okay two other\nmovies a sudden case of Christmas it had\nDanny deito in it didn't even finish it\nit was very boring not sure what\nhappened like he got Co but it was\nChristmas Co no the parents were getting\ndivorced and they were going to tell her\nin Italy is in it will will will yeah\nhold on the parents are getting divorced\nand then what they went to Italy where\nher dad lives to tell the daughter that\nthey were getting separated and then she\ndecided she wanted to have one last\nChristmas together but it was August so\nthey decided to have Christmas in August\nokay first off the girl likes Greta\nthornberg so the little child is a big\nGreta thornberg fan oh like the the\nclimate person yes oh okay sorry that's\npart of the plot that's she mentioned\nher in the movie Weir um and then from\nthen on I just was like oh you little\nbrat and she's she's uh she she's going\nshe's going to visit her throwing pain\non all the on the paintings the mum\nbasically yeah she's you know that she's\ndecided that she's going to have\nChristmas CU her parents are splitting\nup and it's summertime but who cares\nyeah that's entitlement if I heard it\nit's like you said the whole whole time\nI'm like this little brat um and then\nyou can't have Christmas in August you\nmaybe can do it in July because that's\nlike a funny haha thing but August\nthere's no way yeah no and her summer\nboyfriend that she visits when I hate\nthis no he had a summer girlfriend she\nwinter yeah was a whole thing she was\nlike that was a thing and was like\nreverse cuffing yeah is that the deal\nyeah and is that Carl do you know that's\ntrue okay cuffing\nCarl oh he likes that actually that\ncould be a band name that's like um yeah\nspeaking of Christmas trees he just lit\nup\nyeah um um anyway yeah that one Danny\ndeito couldn't save it which crazy but\nVilma wi dama Wilmer vama that's it he's\nin it he's the dad added nothing okay\nyeah he hasn't done he must have just\nbeen there for the paycheck or something\nhe was just like okay and then the final\nthe final movie I'm guessing the parents\ngot back together if we had watched it\nto the end yeah 100% it's a Christmas\nmovie um the final one we saw was called\nnut\ncrackers and it's a Ben Stiller and it\nis not at all what I was expecting it's\nabout um four orphaned boys their\nparents are killed in a car crash and\nBen Stiller is the brother of the mom\nwho had the four boys and he's like this\nbusinessman that lives in Chicago and\nthey were like in the suburbs of nowhere\nland no they weren't in the sub they're\nin the country in the country they're\nbasically feral children so the parents\nwere educating the kids at home their\nhomeschooling these kids

there's pigs in the house oh yeah\noh it actually did sound like your\npodcast earlier this week I was like I\nwas like that actually sounds pretty\ncool Min is the trash yeah uh it was it\nwas it was pretty dark humor um it was a\nnice message at the end but yeah I don't\nknow I didn't get to the end I don't\nthink of that one either okay you fell\nasleep I don't know did I I think so oh\njeez all

a\nweird world speaking of jawser size and\nother sizes we're exercising lifting\nI've seen I've seen Robbie at the gym\ntwo times and our gym is not like and\nnot exercising like demons and stuff\nlike well maybe like spin head spinning\naround puking actually sometimes I feel\nlike that but it's not like it's not\nlike when I think of a gym normally I\nthink of like a merit or like that one\nwhere it's like social and people are\nwalking around talking to each other and\nthis is not that kind of this is more\nlike what I would imagine like Arnold\nSchwarzenegger in the 70s yeah like it's\njust iron and bars and like racks and\nstuff like that yeah there's no it's not\npretty at all yeah I love it cuz I was\nthinking about this I like the the\nsetting of a gym that's just kind of\nbones and work and not I was like if I\nhad this equipment at home I would never\ndo anything but I feel like when you're\nin a space that lends to that do you\nthink it feels it kind of feels like a\ncar garage like a uh like you would go\nthere to get your car fixed yeah it's\nyeah it's an old Warehouse kind of space\nthat has if you've ever been to any of\nour grit parties we've gone or grit\nparties what else do we do at Mobtown\nand just party parties Mobtown Mobtown\nBrewing it's a same building basically\njust further down and uh so like how\nmany people are in the gym when you're\nin there uh like four that's it cuz we\ngo a little bit earlier I think later if\nyou're there at 6:00 p.m. or something\nthere's more but yeah it's pretty much\njust us yeah cu the other people are\nstaff that are usually there so there's\nmaybe four to five people in the gym but\nRobbie and I were the only two working\nout thanks yeah maybe one or one other\nperson but then it's nice because\nthey're you can you can just ask them if\nyou have any questions the the owner and\nthe coaches or whatever they're super\nhelpful not just ask them like she was\nall up on my stuff making sure that I\nwas doing stuff which I was a little\nnervous because I stopped you had four\nsessions where you work with like a\ntrainer to make sure you're getting your\nform right and kind of understanding how\nthe Reps and the stuff work because it's\nkind of like a philosophy of this three\nthree times five so you're doing at your\nmax weight five reps\nthree times yeah so\nuh I finished up with my like kind of\nlike Mentor coach MH and then Robbie was\nstill on your last one last night right\nI was a little nervous like when I okay\nso I'm going to go back in Monday oh I\nwas taking notes in the notebook to make\nsure I'm not doing messing anything up\nbecause I don't I don't remember\nanything you know you're doing better\nlike I just was like I don't remember\nanything and and I went in and it was\nfine I'm like so what do I do like she's\nlike let me see your notes from last\ntime and I had just like the Reps and\nthe weight mhm and she's like okay\nhere's what you're doing today yeah I\nwas like you were benching like 500 lb\nand stuff I I didn't bench yesterday\nokay yeah yesterday was deadlifts we\ndon't need to discuss the weights actual\nweights on the bars yeah start maybe in\na year yeah yeah the uh you go up five\nbasically increments of 5 lbs every time\nthat you're there I do feel like it's\nonly been two weeks or whatever I feel\nlike you can even already notice\nsomewhat of a difference well it's\ninteresting cuz I did you know the\nsquats last night you know and then I\nwas like I had hill repeats this morning\nI was a little nervous how my legs were\ngoing to feel MH I felt great like I I\ndid well when you say you can notice a\ndifference do you mean like in your\nappearance or in how you feel just how\nyou feel okay that's trust me yeah well\nright now Robbie's feeling muscles he's\nnever felt before yeah although is nice\nI'm not really sore like I was that\nfirst\ntime but yeah it's it's been pretty cool\nand they were actually on uh NPR last\nweek on all things considered yeah they\ndid like a 9 Minute segment on them what\nwere they saying um about how they work\nwith older athletes there's like an 86y\nold woman there who's seems like they\ninterviewed her she's more coherent than\nI am you have to send me a link to this\nit's really cuz they kind of fell into\nNiche where they were working like a\ncouple older athletes started just\nwanting to not even athletes they just\nwant to build muscle cuz they're losing\nit you know they're in their 50s or 60s\nor older and then it just word spread\nthat they're a gym that will help older\npeople stay strong and now it's like the\nplace to go it's like it's like cocoon\nin the neighborhood yeah yeah so\nit's going to an old person gym as well\nit's great I love love it it's like my\npeople yeah well what I did noce I told\nMegan earlier I said Robbie really does\ntalk to people I go when I was doing my\nsessions like I lifted the weight I did\nwhat the guy told me to do I focused on\nmy form Robbie like I swear the whole\ntime I just\nhe and I was like Wow Robbie's talking\nto him the whole time yeah telling him\nstories I didn't know what was going on\nit's true yeah you got a friends now a\nlot of good feedback on your podcast I\nthink people really enjoyed your yeah I\nthink so life I was talking to Upper\nvoid this morning you know James that we\nmet and he's like I listened to the\nentire two hours of Robbie's he goes now\nI know him very well for better for\nworse yeah it's funny too cuz I was\nthinking I mean I was just kind of\nriffing and I forgot that I never even\ntalked about how I got into TR like\nlooking for trash and stuff or any of\nthat I know that seems to be kind of a\nkey part of my life mine's coming up on\nMonday and I was like I didn't we didn't\ncover half the stuff that I normally\nwould talk about when it comes to\nrunning or or why and all that stuff\nlike or even I didn't get to talk about\nfireworks that much which I think which\nwas a regret we can have you back on I\ncan put in a good word could be like the\nthe the stuff that didn't make the two\nhours the 5 Hour sides yeah um when are\nwe recording yours today or tomorrow uh\nThursday Thursday okay we have a busy\nweek somehow I'm going to come up with\nsomething good oh this should be fun\nlike I'm Cur I'm curious cuz I don't I\nthink I know everything yeah I don't\nyeah um so I'm interested but the of our\nchildhoods I think Megan has the\ncleanest I don't know I bet we if we dig\nin we can find something yeah her dad\ndid yell a lot I mean yeah yeah I mean I\nfeel like you have some interesting\nstuff for sure but the um I was going to\nsay we should tell people that we're not\ndoing this podcast for the last week of\nthe year\nwhich I think would be the new year\nright the third of January you will not\nhave an episode from us so you'll have\none so we are doing one we're just\nskipping one yeah basically after the\nNew Year the 3rd of January you will not\nget your normal Friday podcast but\nyou'll have all the Monday podcasts and\nwe'll continue right back on on the 10th\nof we're doing one next week though like\nthe week of Christmas okay yeah um and\nthen me was like do we wear the sweaters\nthat one or this one I was like you\ncan't you got to\nBefore Christmas after Christmas is like\nwell technically you're recording Before\nChristmas it doesn't matter you got when\nthe people see you they don't put like\nthe Christmas specials are probably done\nin the summer but they put them out in\nChristmas mhm got I think that works I\nthink that analogy works but the like\nthey wouldn't draw Peanuts Christmas the\nday of Christmas it works me that always\nscares me when you don't you you did a\ngood job the hard tea on that one but\nevery if I said it people would be like\nthat's a different that's a different uh\nshow yeah you started out with drawing\nand then yeah I didn't know where you\nwere going with that but no you got it\nright wait what did you say drawing the\npeanuts\npeanuts Christmas special yeah Peanuts\nChristmas I got you they created it by\nthe way one of our underappreciated\nmusicians of all times is the guy that\ndoes the um a soundtrack for that oh um\nVince gatei yeah his stuff is gold\nreally is I was we watched so we watched\nthat this week Charlie Brown Charlie\nBrown's Christmas and I was like yeah\nthis is nice if you can't get\nemotionally moved when they\n[Music]\ngo\nyeah it's like sad but uplifting it well\nwhat it is like it makes you appreciate\nwhat you have that little crappy tree\nand Linus on that piano and a robot\nteacher talking to down to them yeah\nactually think she talks in that in the\nChristmas\nspecial yeah yeah she probably don't\ncome I do appreciate how they don't let\nadults talk in any of those things in\nThe Muppets or in it's just all kids\nthat's cool well no The Muppets had\nadults I thought they also but didn't\nthey talk the same way yeah yeah that's\nwhat I mean I like how they they no The\nMuppets didn't do ww that's what he just\nasked no The Nanny The Nanny did in uh\nwell in Muppet Babies I think yeah\nMuppet Babies is that's a little bit\ndifferent I don't even know what Muppet\nBabies is that's like being a fan of\nDuckTales yeah the same similar same\ntime frame it was a short live little\nbit before Rugrats whatever happened to\nthose duck hunter dudes oh the the Duck\nDynasty yeah remember they were real big\noh I they might have just I think they\ngot in trouble for being racist feel\nlike there was a canc I don't think it\nwas I don't think it was reac's I think\nthere was a cancel thing though they\nweren't involved with that whole butter\nthing that lady that used all the butter\nin her\ncooking oh Pauline yeah dude Pauline got\nin trouble dude if you want to get the\nPauline uh corn Castro recipe is real\ngood yeah you need to check that\nout noted I don't like are you do you\ncook stuff for Christmas like are you\nthe chef not really sometimes but I was\nthinking of doing a baked ham for this\nyear we just figured out what part of\nthe pig the ham is because I had to\nGoogle it I knew what it was she didn't\nbelieve me I didn't I don't I just I\ndon't know I guess I didn't think about\nit I didn't want to think about it it's\nlike the I should know this from do you\nknow where do you know where the Boston\nbutt is but I was thinking it's the hind\nquarters it is yeah do you know where\nthe Boston butt is um I mean somewhere\nin Massachusetts I guess m it's found a\npig the Boston I didn't know it called\nthe Boston butt\nyeah it's probably not where you expect\nwait so tell me not the butt it's the\nshoulder oh interesting\nyeah I don't know why I Googled that and\nthen we looked at a whole pig and now\nI'm just I like after all those cuts are\noff that's when they make those grapple\nso if you yeah so if you went up to\nsomeone said I like your Boston butt you\nbe like shoulders talking about your\nshoulders yeah you'd be like I've been\ndeadlifting I've been uh uh pressing all\nright I'm going overhead press I don't\nthink you should do that I'm going to\nstart complimenting people that way we\nshould do a t-shirt for Boston next year\nthat's like nice Boston butt yeah okay\nthose will do well so when if you're\nrunning Boston you just say to people as\nyou're passing them you're like no your\nshoulders look good yeah would you like\nto lick my Boston butt and we could have\na little thing of ham there didn't need\nto go that far well it wouldn't be him\ncuz ham\nis put it on a big old lollipop stick\nand run around with\nit finest Boston\nbutt yeah all right gy up you don't\nthink we should pitch at the New Balance\nno I'm Adidas or whoever you pitch it\nyou tell me how it goes maybe the ham\nFarm reserve of America I feel like\npeople need to yeah expand their minds a\nlittle bit to Encompass\nmore more philosophies of thought here I\nI'm the marketing departments need to\nreally think outside the butt did you\nwant to talk about these spices while\nwe're talking about food oh yeah I mean\nsomeone someone that was a good Segway\nmate that was really nice I just need to\nget off of that so someone was I think\nwe talked about get off the butt yeah\nspeaking a buto this guy who uh he was\nat TR they had a stand in the food court\noh okay like and he was he had wanted us\nto does he realize that that one bottle\nis not going to work um what do you mean\none like that I think there's another\none actually oh there is yeah is there\none for for the other household yeah Oh\nyou mean you can't share anything I\ncannot actually I actually already\nopened that I'm sorry I was craving some\nbarbecue sauce did you so there is\nanother bottle I thought I had it but\nmaybe I left it at home what is this\neven called so it's called slab barbecue\nit's from Austin and I think it's a\ndecent he sent us some shirts too um\nslow low and banging since 2006 I like\nthat I like slow low and banging\nbackyard red sauce pour one out yeah and\nit have a rub and stuff anyways I\nthought i' give him a shout out cuz he\nsent us some stuff for Christmas or\nwhatever oh his website is dope bbq.com\nI like it it's pretty good wow his F he\njust got like three hits yeah there you\ngo but he's a runner so he he follows\nour stuff like that's cuz he came up to\nus in TI when he saw me in the food\ncourt meaningless speed hanging out in\nthe food court yeah I was SC scavening\nthe the tables for any leftover treats\num and then yeah he he said he was a\nhuge fan of ours so I thought yeah\nthat's excellent I like his marketing we\nshould do we should do\na I wish I did have a smoker I don't\nhave a smoker anything I'll tell you\nwhat if he'd be willing to come to\nBaltimore it could be our summer grit\nthat'd be cool our summer grit party\nfood that'd be awesome well I told him\num I was like dude you need to partner\nwith Solomon cuz it's slab barbecue I\nwas like you next time with Tes in\nAustin you definitely need to partner\nand do a an event like slab slap yeah\ndud I would love to throw a Solomon s\nlab maybe if we go back out to Broken uh\nArrow this summer yeah we could uh have\na uh a barbecue with Solomon and slab\nright there in the village be perfect\nyeah a slab slab yeah I like it anyways\num that was what was that what were we\ntalking about the butts again probably\nbe done with that part trying to get off\nit you were talking about how you make\nyou might make ham for Christmas oh\nright oh you know we'll have I we'll\nhave our our steak and Cake yep we\ntalked about it oh yeah right great that\nsounds good I we are making we're having\nsome people over this weekend and we're\nmaking a oh that's weird yeah she didn't\nget\nthe it's just people in our uh in our\nneighborhood you don't live there Carl\nand I is Carl going no it's like we're\ndoing our Christmas party and then oh\nit's whatever no Carl didn't get invited\nI don't need creepy Carl in the in the\nhouse Robbie did you did you beat Thomas\nand playoffs and\nfantasy did I okay okay I didn't check\nI'm I'm not trying to be Megs all happy\ncuz actually I beat\nChad big guy Chad lost oh I love D\npretty hard to me 147 to 124 I was\nprojected to lose the whole week Meg\ncoming in strong yeah that's pretty cool\nthat's fun for me why is I don't know is\nit that's not me is that you or is that\nme is that someone maybe it's my phone\ncoming it's probably your phone or it\ncould be the polyester sweater we're\nwearing\nbe throwing off some um I didn't realize\nyours was like three-dimensional I got\nthe most boring one oh I didn't realize\nmine was either until you just said\nit yeah mine has like pom poms and stuff\nhanging off now how is that guy he's\nbecome Christmas and he was from one of\nthose\nclaymation Rudolph for those listening\nwe're wearing Christmas sweaters I have\nBumble from the original Rudolph like is\nthat just open he's no licensing for him\nno they have license it's sh it said on\ntheir website they had license for this\nokay yeah I'm getting a Spam risk um\ndude I'm um I was going to make a Spam\njoke but then I decided against it the I\ndid beat you by 20 I'm sorry okay how\nmuch did you beat me by let's talk about\nthis in the Fantasy Football 20 point 21\npoints uhuh uh so I had a player that I\nhad Megan help me I didn't I didn't play\nbaitman it had 23 points 23 points and\nthat's why you don't let guest coaches\ncome in and yeah you can do your own\nlineup next time T it's fine by me I\ndon't care whatever even if you would\nhave swapped him out for another player\nI still would have won but yeah but it\nbut it's a two- we thing so the points I\nstill don't understand that we have the\ndumbest P off situation why didn't we\njust stick with the original one I don't\nknow who made this sry Lindsay did it\nand I felt like Lindsay wasn't that\nactive she's she's one the more active\nwas she active yeah okay but I don't\nknow I think it was cuz when we were\ndoing Fantasy last year was like so\ncrazy it was the it was towards the time\nwe were doing the Olympics and\neverything else and it was just I was\nlike I can't be managing this she took\nit over but maybe next year I'll come\nback as kamish or just I think we should\nmaybe you you work with her okay and we\nget back on the Yahoo one cuz the ESPN\none I don't think is as good the SPN\ninterface is terrible uh anyways but\nwe'll see see what shakes out so it\nspeaking of Christmas since it is\nChristmas most people are looking for\nChristmas gifts for runners yeah what\nwould you what would be your top\nrecommended thing probably should have\ndone this a couple weeks ago but that's\nall right get it yeah but so what you\nhave you get gift cards yeah okay if you\nwere wishing for something this\nChristmas that had something to do for\nrunning what would it be that I\npresuming we don't I don't don't have\nany of this mhm like what's cuz okay\nhere's the other thing people get stuff\nand they're like crap I didn't get\nanything I really\nwanted so now they have maybe a gift\ncard or something and they're like I'll\nredeem this or I used to like if I\ndidn't get what I wanted for Christmas I\nI just buy it for myself I know I almost\nbuy everything for myself anyways cuz I\nI know when the sales are going to be\nand I know how to say like where to find\nit and I'm just like I'll just can I\njust get this also like you don't even\nthink about as an adult now it's like if\nyou need something you just kind of get\nit yeah like it's rare I actually was\nable to get Megan two\nthings one of them she probably would\nhave gotten for herself if I just waited\nlong enough mm and the other thing\nthough you know whatever okay but like\nso what so exciting I you can't give it\naway though right yeah that's why I\ncan't supposed to be a surprise say\nanything yeah um okay do you with I'm\nsure you do cuz your kids are okay you\nwant to answer the question yeah let's\nanswer the question if you were going to\nget if you're going to recommend one\nthis what you were going to say so hold\non that but the one thing for for R\nrunning related yeah running related\nwell I'm working on this article I'm\nalmost done hopefully I can get out this\nweek so every really want to I'm I'm\nworking on like why every Runner should\njust be wearing Marino wool at least in\nthe winter time so anything bass layer\ntype is yeah either the new uh not new\neither the tracksmith Brighton Bas layer\nor there's several other brands that be\nhighlighting um I love my sore one sore\nmakes a nice one I wear that this week\nand I was like that's a really good one\nbut\neven uh face guy has them obviously\nsmart wool um things like that I think\nit's the most useful piece of apparel\nthat you can buy and it's a little bit\npricier because it's you know made from\nMarina wool but so if it's a present\ntreat someone treat yourself it's\ntotally worth it though for the value\nthat it gives\nyou that's what iend mine's pretty\nsimilar like the bright and base layer\nlike any of those pieces that I use like\nall winter long oh see I or even like a\nnice pair of gloves that's where I was\ngoing go I I love a a good pair of\ngloves or mittens is priceless through\nthe winter\nmonths all right second check in\nsticking with that holiday gratefulness\nI guess the next thing that I'd be\ngrateful for is surrounding myself with\na team of people that I love achieving\ngoals with and uh it really makes it\ngreat when maybe I don't have the best\nrunning performance at a race or\nsomething like that but I get to cheer\non the people around me and they're\nhaving a good day or whatever it is or\nwhen I do have a good day I get to share\nit with a group of people that I really\nenjoy being\naround all right guys let's talk about\nour sponsor Lagoon pillows all right\nlet's do it we've been using them for\nyears now still my favorite pillow ever\nand now's a great time to gift a pillow\ndo you ever remember sleep without a\nlagoon pillow under your head I mean\nwhen we travel and it's not great yeah I\nI felt like the last hotel we were at it\nwas almost like someone rolled up some\nsocks and put it in the pillow to give\nit the stuffing socks and rocks yeah\nyeah well if you want a really great\npillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com\nslel there is a quiz is right on that\npage just hit the button fill out your\ninformation say what you like what you\ndon't like and it'll populate the\nperfect pillow for you and if you use\nthe code believe at checkout you can\nalso\nsave and the other thing is I think\nworks all year round is headphones yeah\noh I mean if if you don't have a good\npair That's essential yeah I think that\nwas the other thing the bo they're price\near but there's the Bose open ears I\nlike the Bose open ears but when I was a\nat the airport and my earphones died so\nI went to the like kiosk or whatever and\nI bought a pair of Bose sport those have\nbeen fantastic I mean they're not the\nopen ear one you can hear what's going\non around you so I think if you live in\nthe city and stuff they're definitely an\nadvantage to to that but and I also love\nthe open ear ones like if you like music\nand like when we're running with a group\nin like the Saturday runs with faster\nbastards yeah sometimes I find myself\nwith people talking and sometimes I'll\nfind myself in a no man's land where I'm\nby myself yeah a half a mile into the\nRun personally yeah the open year ones\nwere great for that because you could\nhear people and talk to people yeah and\nthen if you wanted to like when you get\nby yourself you still have music and\nthey actually have good sound unlike the\nshocks headphones that sounds like\nyou're listening to Tin Can telephone\nI'm not 100% sure but I think shocks may\neven come out with one that's like the\nBose where it's like the speaker in the\nyear instead of they should instead of\nthat I'm not 100% sure on that but I\nthought I saw something like that um I\nwould say also yeah the gloves for sure\nI have what's crazy is my favorite pair\nof gloves is a SmartWool convertible\nMitten but they don't make it anymore\nwhich is really strange because it's\nsuch a good you can usually find I find\na product like that there's a parallel\nproduct from somebody else yeah a lot of\npeople do this convertible Mitten which\nsay sky has one that's really good L\nlemon makes good one too do they yeah I\nthink that's my favorite glove because\nif you need to keep your do the Mitten\npart you can do that or you\ncan I'm explaining how convertible\nMitten works it's still never as warm as\na mitten though like your fingers need\nto be touching yeah but it's I find it\nvery rare that you need an actual Mitten\nhere's the weird thing though tracksmith\nhas a really nice I didn't like it at\nfirst cuz I didn't think is warm enough\nMH cuz air gets through it but it's a\nmitten and what I found that because air\ngets through it it still works like a\nmitten but it's so breathable that you\nheat up it's not the um and at first I\nwas like this doesn't work I can feel\nthe wind coming through and my hands are\nstill cold but as you start running\nright it you get all the benefits of a\nmitten but it still lets heat out okay\ninteresting so you don't like feel like\nand I know we recommended before but\nthat the car heart winter Mitten I\nbought that one cuz the $29 that thing\nis insane it's unbelievable that that is\nI reserve that one for like it's got to\nbe super cold 10\u00b0 cold yeah that's the\nthat's the 20 below yeah when it's 20\nand Below I'll throw that guy on but the\nprice the value to price is it's I think\nit's waterproof too and windproof that's\na I still I'm always shocked at how\ncheap that glove is because this\nequivalent if you bought an arteric\nglove or something like that you're\ntalking $120 for basically the same\nthing so my son who's just getting into\nrunning he needed now he's got workouts\ncuz he's you know mandatory workouts so\nhe's like freezing his fingers off cuz\nhe didn't realize that hey you need\ngloves so he asked me for gloves I gave\nhim an old pair of sakon convertible\nones and he's probably not listened to\nthe podcast so I could say when I added\ninto his Christmas presents I just went\non Amazon and they had like um I think\nadidas gloves that were convertible for\nnot that expensive like I'm saying say\nlike under $20 okay\nyeah um yeah you can definitely find\nsome some deals out there but that's uh\nthe cart heart one's a good one I'm\ntrying to think if there's any others\nbut wait speaking of Adidas you finally\ngot a pair of the evos have you run in\nthem yet I oh what I was going to say\nI'll put the I'll put shop links in the\ndescription for the stuff we're talking\nabout but the Evo SL I haven't run it\nyet just got it yesterday so I was going\nto run tonight I think with some of the\nfaster bastards that do work out Tuesday\nnights so I'm not sure if I'm where do\nthey work out they do at the annex oh\nreally yeah okay so I might do that\ntonight but I'm not sure if I'm going to\nwear it I guess I could what for a\nworkout yeah it's fine it's light enough\nthat you'll feel a turnover um it's not\nit wouldn't be the ideal like if you\nreally wanted to Boogie yeah but it's\nit's light enough and the foam's good\nenough that you can do like uptempo\nstuff if not I'll wear it tomorrow or\nThursday for sure I'm excited to see\nwhat you think since the rest of us are\nall like yeah apparently every and not\njust you guys if feel like I've seen\neveryone who's bought it pretty much\nloves it\num what are we going to ask that a\ncouple minutes ago\num like I feel like I'm super old school\nand that I like to surprise people or\nespecially like kids or or family or\nwhatever with gifts like that are\nwrapped and they don't know what they\nare and I feel like you Thomas like do\nlike that's irrelevant like he'll ask\nthe boys what they want for their\nbirthday and it's not even like a wait\nhe'll like order it in front of them on\nAmazon oh yeah and like they're fine\nwith it and he's fine with it but I'm\nlike I feel like that's not how it's\nsupposed to be no I have to do that I'm\nwith you okay\nyeah I mean it maybe for my wife it's a\nlittle bit different\nbecause I'm just going to be like what\nexact she's like I want a raincoat or\nwhatever yeah and you're like which one\nwhat color do you want which one do you\nwant I'm not sending stuff back just\nlook at CU I was trying to ask her and\nshe's like let me just look like yeah\njust tell me and I'm going to order it\nyes and I guess so my\nlook it it it goes back there I didn't\nreally have birthday parties I didn't we\ndidn't have like holidays and stuff like\nthat so like just getting something was\nexciting was that's it mhm and I'd\nrather just what do you want I mean know\nit's it's partially irrational CU like\nthey know like the boys know what's in\nthe things that I'm rapping but I'm\nstill wrapping them there's like no\npoint but I actually I wanted for the\nfor myself I'll give my wife a list of\n10 or 10 things and pick something yeah\nand I try to forget what I even ask for\nso I'll do like a month in in advance\nand then and then I'm a little bit\nsurprised I like being surprised a\nlittle bit I can't think of anything\nthough that I want like when if Megan\nwas like what do you want the only\nthings I want are ridiculously\nexpensive like a Rolex watch yeah I'm\nlike you could get me an Omega watch or\na Rox he sent me a link to a watch it\nwas like $27,000 I was like what am I\ngoing to do with this if something\nhappens maybe you come into some money\nor something yeah that's the first thing\nI'm sure that's the first priority of\nbusiness yeah also now like I was\ntalking to somebody at that party and he\nsent me a link to that camera that was\ntalking about oh gosh now I want that\ncamera Carl you need to you need to make\nit it's the Leica q34 that's this is not\nhow he described it to me he was like we\ncould really do a lot more if we had\nthis C like he was convincing we're\ngoing to have a camera museum by the by\n2026 and believe it or the lens on it is\nsupposed to be the most accurate to like\nwhat your eye sees and the amount of\nmegapixels and all that stuff makes it\nso that when you take a photo if you\nneeded to take it from way and you blew\nit up it's still in good quality it\nsounds nice yeah and it looks insane\nit's like a beautiful piece of equipment\nall\nright and maybe then uh I can send\nTaylor out the uh\na73 shoot shoes can't we just get a\nsponsorship with one the camera brand\nseriously I mean I'd love it if Sony was\njust like we need Sony DJI and Al Leica\nthose three companies I'll work on it\nyeah I was uh looking through I don't\nknow you know this cord cases and stuff\nand I found my go GoPro that I've been\nmissing for like a\nyear I was I was pretty excited about\nthat I don't know why I don't ever use\nit but I had taken it to Colorado last\nyear and I I just assume I lost it in\nColorado I was like oh sweet I found\nokay here's the problem you know that\nnew charger for the the cororo pace Pro\nyeah I think I already lost man lost my\nlittle n wow I that aming keychain thing\nyeah and I went to go find it the other\nday and it wasn't in the keychain thing\nyeah so the new coros Pace Pro GPS watch\nit has a colored screen a full AMOLED\ndisplay and everything else which is\nnice but it has a new charger another\none we always need more Chargers and\nit's like a little portable piece that\nplugs into a USBC lightning\nconnector but it has a keychain glove\ntype situation so con case with it and I\nput that in my backpack and attach the\nkeychain to like my backpack has like a\nkeychain string interesting and I went\nto grab it the other day\nand he said creepy Carl got his fingers\nin\nthere CRA crafty Carl yeah his long\nfingers just stretched across of Carl\nyeah I just I'm sorry dude this is the\nlast episode car klepto Carl\nyes oh chronic Carl klepto\nCarl just other we're just coming up\nwith more and more so have you have you\nquit running yet or are you still\nrunning with your work with your\nweightlifting I quit running you said\nlast time you're like H kind of not\nrunning CU I'm weightlifting I will\nadmit I didn't do a long run last\nweekend but I know I I I actually woke\nup early yesterday morning I\nran uh have you signed up for the 50k I\nsaw him out one day he was I didn't see\nhim but Thomas ran right past me today\nthis morning as I was coming around a\ncorner and I yelled at him did you\nreally this morning yeah didn't hear him\nyou didn't see him H wow yeah he was\nlike going straight and I was coming\naround the corner how was my form yeah\nlooked pretty good all it was a great\nmorning for running today it was oh 50\nin the 50s I was wearing shorts and a\nt-shirt I know I saw you m the coast\nt-shirt yeah\nI love that t-shirt they did a nice job\nwith that one yeah I'm actually I was\ntalking to uh upper void this morning\ncuz they're in China so I had to get up\nearly and get on a call with them\nand I'm thinking that maybe I'm going to\ntalk to mount Coast but I think that we\nshould do a trail run with faster basts\nand believe run Club you know how we\nsometimes do that trail run all together\nM get a food truck little party in the\nparking lot and uh try out the new Mount\nCo shoe and uh for Recovery everybody\nwould try the upper void uh little\nrecovery shoe they got that sounds\npretty cool I know and then we could do\ngarments cuz upper void has some really\ncool clothes they're going to send us\nsome by the way all right I'll talk to\nyou about that later but I really like\nthe style there that sounds like a good\nidea yeah a little bit of business talk\nfor y'all\nbusiness um it's party business so you\ndidn't sign up for the 50k hat 50k I did\nnot okay that's definitely on the fence\ndude you should do it I think you just\nsign up and then you signed up and you\ncan also it's one of the races that you\ncan get a full refund if you don't do it\nokay is it and they also have good swag\nthey actually do they're one of the few\nraces the blankets the blanket or the\nthat's oh hat just has hat doesn't do a\nblanket they'll do like a they have done\na blanket they'll do like a Patagonia I\nthink the reason the NCR does the\nblanket is cuz originally hat did I feel\nlike I have a hat blanket you do it's\nit's insane that they almost don't\nsponsor us because I feel like we've\nprobably mentioned them more times than\nanything else on the podcast yeah I\ndon't think I don't think they're flush\nwith cash they are but I'm just saying\nthey're getting probably the most free\npromo of any race ever I love I what\nI've always loved about that race is\nthat it really is just a community race\nlike they just put it together there's\nthere's not like a a bunch of fanfare\nyou come in you grab your number put\nyour stuff at the drop they always have\nexcellent uh food drops like the aid\nstations are insane yeah uh just like\nwell-manned well stocked the pris the\npis the potatoes and the salt the uh\nthere's like licorice bowls out there's\ne licorice chips there's flat soda sodas\nof every kind yeah it's really great and\nif you run in Baltimore you're going to\nsee everybody you know like is either\nvolunteering or running it if you catch\na good day where it warms up\nlater chilling on the hillside watching\nthe finishers drinking a beer it's like\nthe best it's like the kickoff the\nspring you you guys are making me want\nto run it you know what it's like you\ncan't you it's bad timing for you

there so I'll just\nbe out there okay dude I should run hat\nthen yeah Gear Up for your uh Carl\nshould run it with me as a precursor to\nyour\nOC\nyeah which definitely looks like it's\nhappening Carl maybe you should watch\nsome some of the OC just to get even\nprepared well the OC the show okay yeah\nyeah just wondering how that was get\nthrough that I can get through anything\nclose enough to the name of the race\nthat I feel like yeah OC oh dude the\nfirst couple seasons of OC were amazing\nyeah I watch that whole thing yeah\nthat's good stuff better than Christmas\nmovies one of the best soundtracks to a\nTV show too remember remember they used\nto do actual CDs for the show like every\nseason they'd have a fullon CD sound\nyeah so when you ran hat last time and I\ncame out I don't know if that's the last\ntime you ran it\nbut I don't think you were there when\nthe last time how many times did you run\nit three okay I think it was your second\ntime yeah yeah that's when you came out\nwith jar came out and I I just remember\nit was a crappy day it was cold it was\nwindy MH and I was just like I'm so glad\nI'm not running today yeah that was uh\nis that the C I don't know yeah it was\nyeah yeah and I was just like I mean if\nI run it two more times I'll have 10\nhats which might be interesting yeah at\nthat point you might as well open a\nhaberdashery the one thing I will say\nthat I do not like and I think that they\nshould\nfix is the race used to be shorter than\n50k and they use like when they list out\nthe times and like time all time fastest\nyeah it they have the oh you're right\nyeah when signever part part of the\nproblem with that is it's the original\npeople who started the race who have\nthose fastest yeah times like it's\ncalled a hat because the hinty Anderson\nTrail race right and it's like all their\nit's like okay well done yeah it' be\nlike if we started a 5K and then made it\na 10K and was like oh yeah you guys will\nnever get close to my and then we just\ninvited ourselves for the first year and\nthen Chang the distance yeah we should\ndo\nthat make our make ourselves legendary\nthat would be great\num yeah yeah I oh we will do one episode\nmore before grit starts I mean if it's a\nmonth out before\nLondon that's\npossible that's what I mean that's what\nI did last year and it was I think two\nweeks before no it was three weeks\nbefore Boston last year I did hat and\nthen I did Boston it's not like and it's\nnot like a rate it's it's such a\ndifferent like you're using such\ndifferent muscles I feel like it's not\nyeah but I've always felt like like when\nI've come off of hat I've always felt\nstronger in the next run yeah can you\nimagine if I did a yeah that would be I\ndon't know I'm I'm I'm interested now\nyeah be good I'm gonna have to reach out\nto caster and be like what do you think\nand then Robbie we're gonna have to go\nrun Hills we didn't even talk about the\nwe did a well we didn't do a Beer Mile\nthis past weekend but we spectated Beer\nMile for the faster bastards I I would\nsay I hosted somewhat yeah but we didn't\nrun it no yeah I'm I I don't like beer\nmiles to beon watching it is hard enough\nlike everyone's so\nuncomfortable and we also it was cold it\nwas cold it was very cold I was the bike\nlead yeah you did a great job trying to\nclear the path for the and you were you\nwere like moving like they were running\nfast yeah I think he I think it was uh\nwhat was the winning time do you know\nseven something\nlike there's been there's been faster\nbut I don't know on that it wasn't an\nofficial track it was more than a mile\ntoo that was the thing it's probably 1.2\nmiles yeah but also you're like chugging\na beer so that's like a 5 minute\nmile yeah well depending how fast you\ncould CH he was couple guys in the lead\nwere doing it pretty fast yeah well I\nthink we allowed the shotgunning too\nwhich I know is frowned upon but there\nwe had one well no only one guy shotgun\nit yeah and I told him he couldn't do it\nafter the second one Robbie laying down\nthe law but uh I\ngot he's like can I can I shotgun I was\nlike yeah\nwhatever no you can't uh well someone\nelse said it to him the guy who was in\nsecond was like dude you can't shotgun I\nwas like he's actually right you're not\nallowed to\nyeah I don't know I always forget their\nname because I don't I'm not that\nfamiliar with a lot of the new people\nthe thing is though that for me it's\nlike we're not an official group that\nwasn't an official track if you want a\nshotgun any way that you can get that\nbeard that's a good point I'm like like\nit's faster bastards it's not I should\nhave allowed it all rule breaking is\nyeah it's like dude like if you ran in\nactual jeans I would love it\nyeah are you supposed to running jeans\nfor the Beer Mile no that's a jean mile\nblue jean M but if you combine the two\nokay imagine that yeah that'd be a good\none we did do the gene mile a few years\nago MH all right I'm going to tell you\nthis this morning I went out for my run\nand I think this should be a\nchallenge I got off the phone and I\nneeded to get the run in before we got I\nhad to go check out the Press by the way\nwent and looked at the and picked out\nthe thread for the sweatshirts to see\nthe test print for the winter gr win\ngrit sweatshirts yeah they're going to\nlook nice um so I had to do that all\nbefore coming in here so when I got off\nthe call I like try to be as quick as\npossible to get out the door to get my\nrun in and I had hill repeats uhhuh but\nI forgot to go to the bathroom before I\nleft the house which one number one or\nnumber two oh snap yeah dude so I was\ncarrying that with me the entire Hill\nrepeat session and you know I'm trying\nto Boogie and my hill repeats I have to\nsay I was pretty proud they were like\n520 519 530 you know like in so I was I\nwas moving as fast as I pretty much can\nokay and then immediately like did my\ncool down two miles and got into that\nhouse as fast as\npossible yeah dude that you should that\nshould there should be a great adjusted\npace for having Dro a deuce on Strava\nshould be like what they should have\nthat as an option like just click a\ncheckbox during your activity did I have\ndid I not go to the bathroom before yes\nokay that could 10 seconds perile good\nbut it's also I\nthink as a challenge it is challenging\nthat's the worst it's just a bad idea\nlike think of the consequences yeah no I\ndon't want to yeah I don't know\nhow yeah usually my body for some reason\njust what shoe did you do your Hill I\nuse oh you know what I went back to an\nold familiar friend I did the SE Elite\nV4 why did you choose that I like that\npretty blue color I know it's really\npretty like a teal color I was like\nlooking at my rack today and I was like\nI want something that has a little pep\nto it and I was like uh and I saw that\nteal blue and white and I was like oh\nthat looks pretty so I just grabbed that\nnice that's a good yeah it's a good\ncolor we and you know what's weird that\nfelt really soft to me but now compared\nto the saky um endorphin endorphin\nElite yeah that thing is I\nthink the reason I didn't love the SC\nlike I really do like the SE Elite for a\nlot like I loved wearing it in New York\nbut I feel like it just doesn't feel\nlike that light race day vibe no the\nplatform's wide yeah it's a little bit\non the heavier side I think it's great\nif for that like if I was going to say I\nwas going to go out for a marathon at\n100% effort it's not the one that I\nwould probably pick but if I'm going for\nanything below 100% 80% yeah then solid\nit's such a great shoe because it's so\ncomfy all right final checkin something\nto be grateful for obviously it's you uh\nwe're so grateful that you tune in and\nlisten to this podcast we really\nappreciate it so many the things that we\ndo we want to bring that you along on\nthe experience and hopefully see you at\nsome of these things so the fact that\nyou're tuning in and listening and you\nknow playing with us while we give you\nthis nonsense we really appreciate it\nand a big heartfelt thank you from\neverybody here at the believe in run\nteam but uh yeah the the idea of like\nand and then you know every time I wear\nit now though I think a Chris Chavez\ngoing his first sub three in it oh so\nlike for some people it will work I mean\nthe shoe's not going to make your race\nit's just what you're comfortable and\nconfident yeah but that was his first\nsub three like he threw down in Houston\nwhich he's coming up on his year\nanniversary wow when do you think okay\nso like when you claim PRS MH I I kind\nof think I have an alltime PR and then I\nhave a\nrelatively close PR uhhuh what do you\nthink the time frame for like like when\ndoes your PR expire or just like yeah\nlike you're kind of\nlike I because I feel like you certainly\ndeserve your alltime PR\nyeah but there's also like in the last\nfive or six marathons where's where are\nyou yeah it should be you're saying like\nage adjusted almost but see here's the\nweird thing is I even think so one of my\nfastest marathons in recent times\nwas the 325 I ran at NCR uhhuh and that\nto me feels like\nyesterday and I just realized that\nthat's three is it is it I think it's\nfour or five yeah I think it was 2017\nwasn't it hold on wait really no was it\npre-co or postco it was\npreco so it had to be 2019 then I think\nit's 2019 well it's at the end of the\nyear yeah so I think it might have been\nDecember\n2017 no cuz I remember that and I don't\neven think I really cared about you it\n2021 oh it was 2021 yeah well that's\nrecent enough I'll take that damn dude\nI'll take that sense of time I lost you\nmight be time traveling right now as we\nspeak dude that loss of time for Co has\nreally thrown me off 2021 so that's\nthree years three years I'll take that I\nthought it was only three years\nago that feels like 10 years ago all\nright yeah it does feel like a long time\nago so I'll take I I'll take 325 that\ncounts close enough for close enough\nyeah but I do I'm worried\nnow like I'm like I don't know if I have\nthat in me anymore like I I am that's\nwhy you're going to the gym and building\nmuscles you might get it back maybe um\nbut like this weekend C Caster was like\nHey Run for the 10 miles that you're\ngoing to do and like 8 to 7:30 pace and\nI'm\nlike can I like are you sure about that\nyeah you sure about that uh speaking of\nthe weight lifting and or I don't know\nwhat you're speaking of but did you see\nthat Nick bear got hit by a car in this\npast week was he able to stop the car\nand lift it over his head close what\nwhat happened he cuz he did record a\nvideo saying how he got hit by a car he\nwas running by his house and I guess he\nhas this stretch where of a mile road\nwhere he has to get to the dirt roads\nwhere nobody is on\nbut it's like a 55 mph Road I think it\nhas a shoulder but it's still yeah and\nit was dark and he said he has he had a\nGarmin that has a flashlight on it but I\ndon't think he wore any headlamps or\nlights or anything and he there's this\none part where you have to cross over\nand get and he crossed over and there\nwas a right turn lane and a normal drive\nlane and I guess a car came up on him in\nthe right turn lane and an SUV and go\ngoing pretty fast and clipped\nhim and next thing you knew he was in\nthe left lane somehow like on the ground\nsomehow it's cuz it got hit by a car no\nbut he was on the right lane the right\nside of the car clipped him I think or\nmaybe that's crazy and maybe it wasn't\nthe right side but yeah it was he said\nit was a passenger side of the car so\nthat clipped him and he handed up in the\nother\nlane broke the like broke the mirror off\ndent in the door he had tire rubber in\nhis leg like destroyed his elbow and\narms like was all busted up I mean he's\nlucky he's alive nothing broken I don't\nknow I didn't uh I didn't know if he\nsaid it was broken or not but I mean\ndude you get hit by an SUV at any speed\nyou're lucky to be alive so this weekend\nI had to do uh my run out in the county\nmhm uh Theo had practice so I'm running\nbasically backwards on the Charles\nStreet 12 course so like running back\ntowards kennworth yeah and this cars are\nflying yeah down that hill and stuff as\nI'm going up the hill I'm like and they\ncut in like cuz it's kind of like Cur\ncurvy they'll cut in and there was a\ncouple times where I was like if one of\nthese cars hits me I'm like splattered\nlike there's nothing going to be left\nfor sure and there was like this one\ntruck it was looking the other direction\nlike to emerge into the other lane oh\nyeah and he swerved into like the\nshoulder where I'm running right and I\nwas just like and he was going probably\n50 m hour and I'm just it's like all\nright this is getting a little freaky\nyeah I mean honestly I feel like that's\nwhy it's just safer to run in the city\nas much as there's I think so still\ncrazy drivers intersections you have\nmuch better chance of surviving a 20 m\nper hour but I also think that people in\nthe city are looking for people I think\nwhen you're out in the county they're\nnot expecting people to be although I\nknow you bust my nuts for wearing a\nheadlamp when it's dark out but I don't\nI a I'm trying to not to roll my ankle\nbut B it's like I have noticed many\ntimes where cars like stop cuz they\nactually like what the hell like they\nsee me\nwhich I mean there's plenty of places in\nwhere it's dark enough at inter you know\nhow we just got a headlamp yeah do I\nneed to plug that in or\nsomething I think does it have a battery\nor does it have like a charge it does\nhave a battery uh I haven't looked at\nthe charging I guessing it's a USBC or a\ncuz it didn't come with like a cord or\nanything it just came in like a I feel\nlike things don't come with cords\nanymore I well probably if it's all USBC\nyou don't need an extra one but so we\ngot we opened up and we I'll put\ntogether a re for it soon of a unboxing\nof a Nike cortex Pegasus and in that\npackage from them one there's Lube or\nsomething but I didn't I didn't use that\nI just left that for Carl yeah we we put\nit in his box yeah that he keeps by his\ndesk yeah crafting\nCarl the um and then there was a\nheadlamp yoink\nand took that but it was just loose in\nthe bag yeah it's a black diamond I\nthink it's Astro which might be new\nheadlamp cuz the Black Diamond Sprint is\nprobably my favorite head lamp of all\ntime cuz it's just a nice little\nportable doesn't not intrusive are we\nBing you m no sorry put in your pocket\nshe's definitely bored um are you loves\nheadlamps you know what that's actually\nI do love headlamps it's like one of my\nweird interests but the I was that was\nanother that's another good Christmas\ngift cuz it's like 25 bucks or something\nthe Black Diamond Sprint it's such a\ngreat headlamp um and they sent\nessentially a version of that but yeah I\nthink you have to charge\nit either with the USBC or micro USB\nokay so it's not a removable battery no\nthat's definitely\nrechargeable I love it when the brands\nsend like a little extra yeah it's nice\nto get a little little something and the\nmetal case it came in Carl's going to\nuse for uh keeping that the shoes came\nin yeah the brands do love sending uh\nshoes that are locked up with a code\nweird boxes it's an interesting uh I\nthey need to do something like like put\nit behind the Constitution make us do a\nlittle Nicholas Cage action I like\nthat yeah like it's actually someone\nbroke into\nthe yawning now yeah it's contagious\nwhen you do that yeah do you think we\nshould talk about\nwait wait let's let's talk about both\nRobbie brought in his\nendorphin uh trainer trainer which I\nhave to\nsay well I'll let you go first Robbie\ntalk about it uh yeah so I mean this is\nbasically the replacement for the kvar\npro endorphin shift I think it covers\nboth the bases yeah uh which if you\ndidn't read our review I thought the kar\nPro was not a great idea yeah I think\nthe kar Pro I rolled my ankle severely\nin the first\n100 feet of it out the\ndoor um and I did I think I wore it a\ncouple other times but felt it was a\nlittle dense right in the midsole yeah I\ndidn't see a point to it and I hate to\ntell you but so the newest version\nhas it's actually very similar but it\njust has a top layer of incred run foam\nthat stuff squishy super squishy yeah\nyeah it's\nin can I pet yourg\nit's in the uh it's in the new endorphin\nseries basically Elite is it in the\nspeed no Elite has power run HG does he\nno we have in cred run it's in crun it's\nall in cred run that's why it's so\nsquishy and guess what it is incredible\nyeah so this has that foam which is I'm\njust going to mention it's the worst\nname for a foam every time I mention it\nuh then what's on the bottom it sounds\nlike a Sketcher name but then the the\nbottom is just a normal Power run foam\noh which is a rubberized Eva yeah so you\ndon't necessarily need I mean rubber on\nthe outside if there's any contrast\nnight and day contrast I mean squish the\ntwo see this is I the sometimes this\nworks but I feel like rarely it works\nwhere you have this nice layer of race\nday foam under the foot and then you\nruin it when you put a giant slab of\nthere's there's two shoes that I would\ndisagree with you on that M I'm going to\nsay the Nike as zoomfly 6 did a really\nnice job of combining but I think that's\nthe the amount and I'm also going to\nthrow the vomo in\nthere the Vero but also that's I feel\nlike react is a little bit softer yeah\nway softer well would don't you say also\nthe Hoka Hoka Mack X too and cuz that's\nalso the top top lay dual layer yeah the\nmocha the mocha the Hoka\nmax2 the mocha this doesn't should I\nmean I didn't wear this shoe I wasn't\nseated it but this foam and my hands\ndoes not feel great for me initial run\nin the shoe first off the upper is great\nI thought the upper is really nice it's\njust like on the ride pretty much and\nthen I felt like the initial step in I\nwas like oh you really can feel the\nincred run this is going to be a nice\nswitch up but then as I ran in it it\njust felt like a normal daily trainer\nand for a shoe that has in credit run a\nplate and a power run underneath I'm\nlike you're making this really\ncomplicated shoe that could just\nbe yeah done better like I feel like the\nride is a better version of this shoe\nyeah I mean it's a softer feel than the\ncavar pro because of that top layer but\nit just it even feels a little bit\nclunky just not harsh it's just I don't\nknow like would you say it's just like a\nnormal Eva daily trainer yeah with all\nthat work and all that stuff put into\nthat that should feel like something\nelse and I know it's a rubberized Eva\nmidsole but there's really no rubber on\nthe out soole right we're talking this\nlittle patch here and here and I think\nit works okay though you don't think so\nI felt the grip was fine I mean I guess\nI didn't run in in the rain at all but I\ndon't know\nI I I I thought the fit was a little big\nbut similar to the just maybe I needed\nto get a different size but I didn't\nthink it was that I thought it was a\nlittle bit roomy I put in my miles and\nand I never will wear that shoe again\nthat's how you know it's good uh I think\nRyan said the same thing or other\nassistant editor Ryan I think he has a\npair okay and I think he said the same\nthing he's just like yeah it's not I\njust don't know about the shoe like I\ndon't know why they're trying to make it\nwork but I I think they want a daily\ntrainer in the endorphins\nseries they have one they just don't\nrealize that's what I was going to say\nit's the speed it's like why are you\nfighting it just let it\nbe yeah I it's a little confusing it's\nbasically the same way I felt about the\nkar Pro not much has changed U but then\nyou ran in the Muno Neo Zen yes so this\nis a surprisingly good one I really like\nthis\none I put I I put in a lot of miles\nright in a row in it so I did kind of\neventually come to a different\nconclusion oh but but I had to go down a\nhalf size so when I first got it the\nupper was too big and I contacted a\nfriend Justine who you know is Alex's\nwife uh who works at Muno and I was like\nhey I like it but I think I like the\nfeeling of the foam but I think the shoe\nruns a half size Tu big and she agreed\nwith me so I asked and requested to get\nanother pair um in a half size down so a\nsize 10 uhhuh fits perfect yeah I have\nsame thing happen with me so I have\nanother pair on the way okay it may\nyou've run in it I kept my normal size I\nthought it was fine but I prefer to have\na roomier toe box if anything so maybe\nthat's just a personal thing so I guess\nI want to wait until you get your pair\nand they're also apparently sending us\nthis is the mystery version they're\nsending us the actual colorway yeah yeah\nthey've shrouded the whole thing and\nmystery of odd mystery that's yeah I\nwon't go\ninto relas so the the foam itself though\nthis nerz next NXT uhhuh do you like\nthat foam\nname yeah it's better than incred I\nRobbie to come up with a foam name I\nmean give me 10 minutes and I could beat\nany of these companies branding name I\nlove fresh foam I think uhh no fresh\nfoam's actually fuel cell is a good one\nI like that one and I like\nuh I'm uh zoomx I'm okay with yeah\nflight flam has way too many iterations\nI don't like flight foam plus it's a\nhard to say flight foam is hard to say\nand it's really hard to say flight foam\nflight flight foam blast plus flippy\nfloppy anyway so this one you come to\nthis midsole this is a gooey midsole so\nit's basically it feels similar to the\nmauno uh Neo Neo Vista but there's no\nplate so it's a lot gooier mhm I would\nthe closest thing I would compare it to\nis probably the evos SL from Adidas with\nthe light Pro wow okay so it kind of has\nthat soft give when I said the things\nkind of changed I love it like when I\nfirst tried this I was like this is a\nphenomenal shoe wow and once I got the\nfit right and the second run I was also\nbut I was doing some my longer runs in\nit and I felt like maybe it's a little\ntoo soft okay and people always\ncriticize us for liking really soft\nshoes so if I'm saying it's a little too\nsoft maybe Ian soft in the way that the\num Neo Vista is yeah it gives like I'm\nnot sure something in my the only thing\nI will disagree with you is I feel like\nthe Neo Vista felt more narrow to me\nwhereas this platform feels wider so I\nfeel like you get more of that stable\nride with the squish so it feels better\nto me okay and it could have just been\nlook last week I was he kept ramping up\nmy miles M and I had two 10 Mile runs in\na row and you know maybe I was just like\ntired and so the soft\nfelt like non fast yeah I got you and\nalso like I'm not sure there's like on\nmy foot as like the front of my foot\nstarted hurting and I'm wondering if\nit's because I was like spreading as\nlike it collapsed yeah and spreading my\nfoot but it that could just be me but\nhonestly the the shoe feels amazing 150\nbucks which is a really nice price point\nthere you go so I do think I do think\noverall I would still highly highly rate\nthis shoe yeah um I don't know that it'\nbe the only shoe I'd want my rotation\nbecause of the softness I think I'd want\nlike to have something that felt little\neasier to pick up the pace weight feels\nlight I haven't weighted though let me\nsee and this shoe's out now so if people\nwant to get it they 150 for this shoe\nseems like a steal like I definitely it\ndoes like it the upper feels like a\npremium quality shoe all right yeah it\nweighs 8.8 o for my size 10 so I went\ndown a half size so if you're 10 and a\nhalf you would go down to a 10 8.8 o I\nknow some of you love the gram so here\nwe\ngo oh do you know what my goal is for\n2025 to learn the conversion of gr yeah\nlike and be able to miles to cams do it\nin my head oh why don't you go full uh\nmetric European okay you want to know\nhow many Grand I don't know if I'm\nwilling to give give up that much\nAmerican in my life but um don't look oh\nI was not paying it I was looking\nWithout You processing what you were\nsaying so I can already kind of see 8.8\nounces is how many grams go I don't know\nI haven't done 249 yeah so 249 gram well\nI know that 10 I think 10 oz is 200 uh\n284 I\nthink okay that's right so that's where\nI'm starting out at that's a good\nstarting so we talk about knit uppers\nand uh when they work and they don't\nwork getting this in the right size\nreally made a big difference uh for me I\ndid find it's a little tough sometimes\nto find the right tension on the laces\nand this has that ribbon lacing mhm\nwhich I don't I didn't love the laces\nthat was the other thing I hated about\nthe Endorphin trainer was the laces yeah\nI don't know what it is with sock and\nlaces though like I'm running in the\nride and it's got that yarney stretchy\nlace and I just I I hate and it curls\nweird the wor I'm like what are you guys\ndoing just put in I think if if this was\nmy shoe that I like we review so many\nshoes that we'll switch out but I think\nif I purchased a shoe and I was going to\ngo for it I'd probably try to put the\nsaw tooth laces in this yeah that'd be\ngood that'd be a good move yeah but\noverall I really liked it Megan likes it\nall right cool I I'm hoping Robbie likes\nI think we should probably wait to do\nthe full review until I'll probably like\nit you try and Carl uh got Carl he's\ntaking the 10 and a halfs I have have\nyou tried it on fits me fine oh so he's\nat 10 and a half and he says it fits him\nfine oh maybe you maybe you are your\nfeet are shrinking like mine Thomas they\ncould be I do get them wet quite often\noh yeah raisin raisin On The Run yeah so\nmy this is definitely one that we're\ngoing to yeah Raisin in the Sun pretty\ngood one I got it yeah I got it take\ncredit for that one all right that'll be\noh biography it's about that time anyway\nthis's definitely a shoe that we're\ngoing to have to put in contention for\nuh like I feel when we get shoes this\nearly in the year for well this one's\navailable this year so\nis it's still\n2024 so do we call this a 2025 shoe or a\n2024 shoe it is no anything that comes\nout in the second half of December I\nthink is we just kick that over wait it\ndoes it does come out this year it's\nalready out get it right now but it came\nout like the 13th yeah I still think it\nI think that was the idea that's what we\ndecided know you know when we're doing\nour round at the end of next year\nthere's going to be so many other shoes\nbut that's why I'm saying we got to we\ngot to start charting but we can't like\nwe had we put out our any any normal we\nhad to put out our list in November so\nit's like anything that comes after that\nyeah yeah I think that's how we do it we\njust a bad move though for Brands\nthey're going to get\nlost it is the worst time to

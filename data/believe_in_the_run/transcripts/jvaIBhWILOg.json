  "text": "[Music]\nhi this is Thomas with believe in the\nrun and this is Robbie with believe in\nthe run this is Megan with believe in\nthe run and you're listening to the drop\nour weekly podcast about all things\nincluding running mhm mostly the all\nthings part yeah exciting week some of\nthe running yeah we've got I I know what\nit is but these new mics I'm always like\nit's never quite right yeah it's\nliterally the best it's like exact you\ncould put it exactly how you want it no\nlike I wanted to I want to push it that\nway a little bit press the uh the filter\nthe on your mic Meg what the foam the\nfoam thing press that the whole way down\nyeah it's not the whole way down there\nyou go now that everyone has heard weird\nnoises yeah we're good to go yeah um\ndespite everyone saying they were Revolt\nif Ralphie wasn't on this episode he\ncouldn't come into the office today but\nhe's doing fine we didn't we didn't want\nto risk him with Chad coming in to do\nhis big guy shoe pcks we thought he\nwould go nuts and oh be out of sorts and\nthen now he'd be like on Megan's\nshoulder like a parrot yeah trying to\nhang out so yeah we just decided yeah so\nnow he's just home alone he's setting\nbooby traps up he is probably I was like\nbig we should leave him a nice chew toy\nfor him to hang out when she's like he\nwon't use it he'll be in anxiety the\nwhole time we're going gone yeah he just\nsleeps or has anxiety the whole time\nwe're gone but that's does that even\nmean if a dog has anxiety dude they used\nto make us give him pills for it and\nthen I was like this is too much now mag\ntakes the pills yeah yeah Thomas got\ninto them before his last\nmarathon trying to I had such high hopes\nfor Ralphie being a running dog yeah and\nthen you broke him you tried I did wait\nwhy didn't that work out he would run\nwith me he'd like doing like a mile\nThomas took from one mile to eight miles\nno no no no I I bumped it up to\nfour then I bumped it up to six uhhuh\nand then when I did eight he was like no\nnever again we got to we got to about\nfour miles out and he sat down and just\nwas like not for me sounds like my kids\njust we bought one of those um like dog\nrunning leashes that you tie around your\nwaist and one day I tried to go out for\na run with him in the afternoon and he\nlike saw a squirrel or something and it\njust the whole thing just broke in half\noh so yeah but he was done running\nbefore that like I I would even go get\nthat leash because we got a replacement\none and I would go get it and he would\njust sit down be like nope man anyway so\nhe just become a lazy bum then that's\nemmo always he gets skinny when we take\nhim to Doggy camp and then he comes back\nand loads back up nice it sounds like me\ngoing to\ntr and then it's the opposite the\nopposite effect do you think we should\ntell everyone what we're doing with the\nMonday podcast for the remainder of\nDecember SL beginning of January yeah\ncuz honestly I don't even know so go for\nit so everyone who listened to the last\nMondays heard Taylor Bodin chat who is\ngoing to officially become part of the\nteam in 2025 uh and for people who maybe\ndon't know all of our backstories we\nwill be interviewing each other oh I\ndidn't I actually know we were doing\nthat and Publishing that on Mondays yeah\nbut but that's for do you think we were\ndoing with you is that on the schedule\nfor today it sure is oh what time\nit was on for 1:30 but we can adjust it\nOh I thought that was just the drop in\ngeneral like I thought that was this\nepisode well could be okay could be all\nright cool well man and now I have to\nget my head straight I'm G to ask some\nreally tough ones get ready have to see\nwhat kind of tall tals I can come up\nwith I feel like it'll be okay all right\nit should be fine and then uh I mean\nwe've also got we could give updates on\nour weightlifting now oh cuz I know\npeople are dying is Carl putting up the\nfirst shots right now photos whole body\nthey do not go up until until something\nlooks better yeah seriously did you take\nthe photo Robbie uh I actually did oh\nwow um but it's horrible isn't it yeah\nit's a site for Sor eyes for sure I\nwould wait I think it's the opposite a\nsight for Sor eyes a sight for Sor eyes\nmeans that like oh site for Sor eyes is\na good thing yeah like oh you're a site\nfor Sor eyes yeah what's it sight for un\na sight for health eyes it it like that\nlike mine would be\nblinding I wish I was blind so you have\ncataracts yeah that's what yeah site for\ncataracts site for cataracts um well\nyeah instead of update it's probably\nmore of a Down dat I feel like the first\nweek the first session I was absolutely\ndestroyed I did you never do for the\nrecord I don't do anything I was going\nto say I'm the laziest person out there\noutside of running activated parts of\nyour legs that you don't activate\nnormally yeah I don't think I think they\nwere in hibernation you had me all\nworried like I went and I was like\ntotally freaked out that I was going to\nget crushed no I thought I figured you\nwould be mildly okay yeah I\nam yeah I there's no uh from I've R been\nrunning somewhat healthy so I figured\nI'll just let it ride and see what\nhappens and I well I figured out what\nhappens when you weight lift and I was\ncouldn't run for like 3 days but think\nabout the potential now once you get\ngreat at weightlifting you'll be so\nstrong and then running will just be so\neasy I don't think it will be I think it\nright now I'm just maintaining it's like\nI need this to maintain like it's not\nlike I'm going to weightlift and all of\na sudden become a great Runner I think\nit's just to keep me I see what you're\nsaying keep me running yeah\nI but then we went at the same time the\nother day and can't really th it reminds\nme of when you first started running\nevery time you go for a run there's a\nnew injury do you know what I mean maybe\nnot okay I don't know I was tell Meg\nlike I feel like what they're doing to\nus now is like we're trying to learn how\nto run and they're like do a lap and we\ndo a lap and they're like all right good\njob yeah yeah yeah yeah they're like\nhere's like I don't think they put in\nnegative weights I think they had to cut\nparts of the bar off to make it lighter\nfor\nme I think there's like removable Lego\npieces from the bar and they're just\nlike taking it off here you go here's 20\nlb just give that guy just just the bar\nthey're doing the like less than the bar\nbut they're doing the 5B increments on\nyou right yeah I mean it was a\nbroomstick with uh marshmallows on the\nend but I tried not to look over I just\nI was like I'm just GNA let Robbie do\nthis thing I'm not g to look over yeah\nbut I don't know so we'll see the now\nthe I have like a hip flexor thing going\non so the squats I couldn't do the whole\nway cuz they would pinch it or whatever\ndid they not like for me they're putting\nlike a little bench with a little spacer\nfor me to because I can't go really deep\nin my squats yet oh okay so I go down\nand I touch it with my butt and then\ncome back up yeah do are you not doing I\ndidn't have that no um like what are you\ndoing like is yours just freeballing it\nyeah I feel like that's not the term\nfree butt in it yeah but yeah people do\nI can't even imagine the the absolute\nagony that people who weight lift are\ngoing through right now listening to\nthis yeah by the way I Googled in my\nprayers I Googled what's the opposite of\na sight for sore eyes and there's a lot\nof really good ones but I think my\nfavorite is mon\nmonstrosity oh a monstrosity yeah yeah\ndoes that feel right I mean that's just\na word that's not a saying yeah oh no\nyeah they're all just words oh so it's\njust saying that's a synonym for it it's\nan an antonym oh an antonym iore horror\ngood blemish hidey\ndeformity yeah that's all act descri\nsight that's the one that's the my\nweightlifting journey in a in a nutshell\nyeah but yeah so there is no official\nOpposite of sight for sore eyes I think\nthat's just a saying all right cool I\nmean the the only thing I hate about the\nsquat is that I have to get my shoulders\nback real far and like where they want\nyou to place the bar and it kills my\nshoulders like it's not not the weight\nof the bar it's the flexibility I don't\nhave in my shoulders so I open up my\nchest and the bar is holding it back\nlike that he's like especially\nespecially the shoulder that you blew\nout yeah and didn't ever actually get\nphysical therapy for that's the one he's\nlike it'll loosen up you're like no\ntrust me there's no loosening the\ncartilage is I go back tonight okay yeah\nhave fun I will are you on once a week\ntwice a week how are we doing uh twice\nokay but I think think I'm cutting back\nmy running mileage as far as like I'm\nnot doing marathon training I've\nresigned myself to I'm not doing the\nspring training for a marathon but fall\nmaybe maybe so are you just going to run\na marathon without training yeah I\nthought about CU I do I wouldn't hate\ndoing like a 50k but\nI'm yeah I love that race but the worst\nthing about it is that you still have to\ntrain for\nit isn't that why it always sells out\nand then you can still get in like a few\nweeks before cuz people are like for\nthat yeah it's like I want to do the\nRace part without the training part I\nwant all the glory and the beer after\nthat race isn't that fun that's the\nthing it's not like a great it's not\nlike I'm doing it for a time or for I\njust want to do the race but to do 32\nmiles or whatever 31 miles you still\nhave to do long runs unless you want it\nto really really suck after the third\ntime I did I said I'll never do it again\nand then I ran it five more times cuz\nfriends would sign up and you'd be like\nokay we'll do it cuz we used to have\nlike a a party and and people down for\nit and so I was like well I might as\nwell I don't want to be the only one who\ndidn't run yeah and every time right\naround that second Loop where you're\ngoing back in and you can you know when\nyou can hear the finish line but you\nknow it's like six miles away mhm they\nkind of come close I'm always like why\ndid I do this this is the worst is so\nbad but like you don't have to like when\nyou're trying to race a marathon I feel\nlike you have to incorporate a lot of\nspeed work like for that you just log a\nbunch of Miles no you need health that's\nthe problem though I I don't want to log\na bunch of Miles okay yeah I don't mind\nthe speed work I like the speed work\nthat's fine uh I don't like the it's\njust I just don't have enough time I'll\nbe honest like the to do the long runs\nevery weekend and then 48 mile runs\nduring the week it's just like with\nfamily stuff and everything else and if\nif I'm doing weightlifting I feel like\nthe weightlifting will be more\nadvantageous to My overall physical\nfitness than doing two more Six Mile\nruns or but that's the thing like I run\nin the morning so the weightlifting\ndoesn't interfere like that time isn't\nlike extra time to me CU I don't run in\nthe afternoon yeah so it's like I'm just\nadding no even if I run in the morning\nit's still like I it's just it's just it\njust I end up hating running I'll be\nhonest okay so let's not do that\nyeah\num but anyways so maybe in the fall okay\nI just don't feel like doing it right\nnow be h what about grit you're going to\nhave to get lots of miles in January\nanyway yeah I I mean I just I just fake\nit he's going for B baby seal okay what\nis that 25 no one's checking those grit\nstats I know that\npersonally don't say that um yeah 25\nwe'll do 20 I mean I could do I'll do a\n100 do 100 yeah maybe a little maybe\nmore than that I don't know Rio you're\nyou're finicky you always changed you\ncould get into and be like you know I'm\nreally enjoying running right now yeah\nit's just just\ndepends uh but I felt like even in the\nfall I was juggling I was really like\ntrying to put pieces in like the running\npieces in and it was a little bit\nstressful are you still working with\nyour running coach yeah okay so he's\nbeen cool cuz he's been like knows that\nI'm crazy like mentally like you said\nI'm always just uh trying to figure\nstuff out and so but he's working with\nme to build a plan cuz in my mind when I\nwhen I think about running coaches I\nalways think oh you got to be pushing\nfor this goal you know what I mean\notherwise what the what the hell is the\npoint of having a coach yeah but it's\nalso i' never considered it's\njust meeting you where you're at and\nmaking therapist running in a and making\nrunning what you want it to be you know\nwhat I mean well I mean while\nincorporating some stuff to help you get\nbetter we're you know we we still work\nwith the coach right now and it's not\nwe're in between like training for\nLondon wouldn't start until January yeah\nso I was kind of like well\nwhy you know what do I need a coach for\nit in between but the he's actually been\nworking on our fitness and making sure\nour leg turnover is good and I actually\nhave really enjoyed this part of\ntraining because I've got a training\nplan it's not like totally aggressive\nlike I'm averaging like 40 something\nmiles a week and it's just like the long\nrun is like 12 miles but then I'll have\nlike a 10 mile run the next day or\nsomething like that um but it's not like\nthose long grinding yeah yeah runs and\nso it's just like it's fun and to watch\nkind of like the fitness grow during\nthis time where it's there's no pressure\nMH to kind of for me it takes some of\nthe like stress out of running yeah part\nof it though is that I do need a goal\nalso to call me accountable so it's kind\nof like I don't know how to juggle those\ntwo maybe half marathon goal will be\nnice well you could do that but like my\ngoal right now is just like I want to be\nable to go out and run with people and\nnot be totally out of my depth yeah I\nalso kind of Miss here's the other thing\nthat I told him I kind of miss running\nwith people because when you have work\nprescribed workouts and stuff you you're\njust like well I have to do that workout\nI can't run with a group cuz I have\nthese Paces thrown in and that kind of\ndrives me crazy see I thought I was\ngoing to do that with the faster basses\nand doing the Wednesday night run I was\nlike I've always you know I can do that\nthe health I went a couple times I'm\nlike I don't want to do\nthis I don't like running at night and\nman everybody there is like throwing\ndown yeah hardcore on those Hills Robbie\nthere's 151 spots available and have 50k\njust saying okay\nnice if you wanted to do it let's see\nwhat's the least amount of training I\ncan do to get by it's March 22nd I'll\nask my coach that what's the least\namount of things I can do to run up 50k\nI bet you could do\n10 and 12 Mile runs long runs back to\nback that would probably do it yeah I\nstill don't want to do that okay okay so\nmaybe this is\nout we should do let's see how bad it\ncan hurt by doing just Max 10 mile long\nruns on the weekend yeah that would be\nhorrible I don't know this guy Daniel\nwrote in though with a good idea for\ngrit and I think we could implement it\nnow for winter grit I did see that yeah\nI if we do like a week Challenge and it\ncould be something like uh you know take\na photo of this or or you know just\ndifferent things that we could do like a\nweekly challenge and then have a prize\nfor each\nweek yeah that'd be cool like finding\nrandom things like you do on the ground\nor make us like hit someone in the face\nwith a snowball that's feels less nice\nall right build an but if but if you\nvideo that yes the least run with the\nleast amount of clothing in January\noh tank tops and shorts and 30\u00b0 yeah\nlike it would be least amount of clothes\ncoldest weather make get some nssw stuff\nwhat I was thinking there's some freaks\nout there too many PE too many dudes\nwithout shirts are going to be running\naround and loving it it'll look like a\nchoy choy Winterfest we have to change\nthe name Joy to the World yeah nice yeah\nabsolutely oh man just trying to think\nof other things uh anyways but yeah that\nthat's a that's a good idea I like that\nyeah we'll um we'll brainstorm on it and\nif we can get four really good ideas\ntogether we'll implement it this year in\nJanuary for grit speaking of winter we\nwe got some new tracksmith believe in\nthe Run bright and Basse layers yeah\nbelieve in the Run brandit bright and\nbass layers for sale that's definitely\nmy favorite winter long sleeve I don't\nknow how many we have left we oh really\nyeah no way they they we just did one\nstory and a lot went so I think half of\nare gone already wow yeah so if if\npeople want them we'll put up a thing in\nhere but if people want them they get\nbetter act fast cuz it was limited\nsizing that we are able to do anyway\nthat is the best piece of winter running\ngear you can buy pretty much and I have\nto say the print looks amazing it looks\nnice although tell everyone what you're\ngetting to wear this winter Robbie\nthat's from tracksmith uh oh they have\nthis what is it a jumper onesie a onesie\nonesie bib a bib so it's the is it the\nturnover tights but a bib version yes I\nbelieve so and I'm 100% going to wear\nthose I don't know how it looks\nlike to you know how you got to take\neverything off as a whole ordeal it's\nlike when you wear a jumpsuit as a lady\nsorry it's the N obviously the ndo bib\nyeah and it looks like um sort of a\ncross between your running tight and a\ncycling bib or like or like your ski\ngear yeah like your like isn't that\nisn't a B what you wear when you're\nskiing uh yeah pretty much yeah as\nsomebody who doesn't ski I agree with\nyou 100% I feel like I used to wear\nthose you know I've never gone skiing\never what do you know that I was\nactually on have you been snowboarding\nlike the one sport I've never tried I've\ngone snowboarding like eight nine times\nyeah so I have done okay that feels a\nlittle better I grew up skiing yeah so I\nthat was my it was one of my major\nsports did you see Lindsay Vons coming\nback it well she is out of retire\nuh she's skier yeah oh yeah she was like\nreally good she Olympian yeah very good\nlike the best she's pretty good I get\nher mixed up with peekaboo Street\nremember her yeah what peekaboo I don't\nknow who that is peekaboo street from\nback she's like a 90s yeah she wasn't as\ngood as Lindsay Von\nthough all right first check in this\none's going to be a weird episode for\nyou so buckle up uh I I should say that\nevery week but this one feels\nparticularly weird so hang in there\nwe'll probably get around to something\nyou enjoy listening to at some point\nwe'll see you in a\nminute all right guys let's talk about\nour sponsor Lagoon pillows all right\nlet's do it we've been using them for\nyears now still my favorite pillow ever\nand now's a great time to gift a pillow\ndo you ever remember sleep without a\nlegon pillow under your head I mean when\nwe travel and it's not great yeah I I\nfelt like the last hotel we were at it\nwas almost like someone rolled up some\nsocks and put it in the pillow to give\nit the stuffing socks and rocks yeah\nyeah well if you want a really great\npillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com\nthere is a quiz right on that page just\nhit the button fill out your information\nsay what you like what you don't like\nand it'll populate the perfect pillow\nfor you and if you use the code believe\nat checkout you can also\nsave do the Winter Olympics get you guys\nas excited as the Summer Olympics no\nyeah it's really hard dude when I go\nthrough the channels and you're like\nlooking and there's figure skating or\neven that sport with the curling curling\nMH I mean the only thing that I'll stop\nand watch I really kind of like the the\nloue L is cool and like is it because of\nthat movie cuz only for the yeah the\nJamaicans are you are you hoping for the\nRex like watch I like the Rex but I just\nthe amount of speed and it just looks so\ncool like you know they go they're like\nflying it's like a bullet wait they\nwreck on those oh yeah yeah I wouldn't\nwant to but they do jeez I like that\ndecapitations i' watch\ndownhill downhill skiing I enjoy you\nknow what the uh downhill skiing is\npretty awesome what about like the I\nmean the snowboarding is pretty cool now\nthey have it yeah I mean after a while\nthough I'm like oh cool you did a loop\nyou you did a they did trick\ncool I think the best one to do would be\nthe the biathlon where they have to\nshoot stuff and then ski yeah but you\nwould just like to shoot stuff yeah\nminus the scheme yeah yeah just I'll\njust walk there um they but the the\ncalming your heart rate to you know from\ngoing all out effort to then like\nsettling your heart to get a perfect\nshot that's an incredible skill it is\npretty sick and it's also I like I like\nthe sports that are based on like that\nwas a survival thing it like it was I\nthink we talked about this how track and\nfield the field portion is just War\ntactics yeah that's it and I love that\nkind of stuff I'm surprised they don't\nhave drone flying in track and fuel by\nnow oh jeez just that's that's the\nnewest version of track and field\nspeaking of shooting though we had a guy\nfrom Maryland from talson oh yeah with\nthe Gilman of all places so for those of\nyou listening who don't know Gilman\nwhere this kid Luigi was from this is\nlike one of the most prestigious high\nschools schools in it's it's K through\nhigh oh it is yeah one of the most\nprestigious schools in Maryland yeah\nlike it it used to be like a joke like\nthose guys all there like a fraternity\nonce they left there that like they'd\nall go work at like the financial places\nand stuff like that but I mean that\nschool's been hit a couple times cuz\nthey had a little thing with um little\nlittle problem with a teacher a couple\nyears ago yeah and now now this I this\nisn't yeah their PR needs to step it up\nwe went to the we had a cross country\nrace there for the kids a couple months\nago it's a beautiful campus yeah it's\nridiculous look like nicer way nicer\nthan my college campus yeah right but it\nit was crazy cuz I was Googling remember\nat work that day I was Googling Gilman\ntuition like hours before this guy was\ncaught and before we even knew that he\nwent to Gilman or anything cuz we were\njust talking about private schools yeah\nyeah why would we talk about Gilman we\nknow something cuz I ran into that\nperson that you knew his kid goes there\nand uh I was like oh man I hope they're\nnot connecting the dots on me here 35\nAffiliated $35,000 a year for uh for\nelementary for elementary 38 for upper\nupper yeah is that what they call it\nwhat what are the Richer what are the\nrich people call it Upper School upper\nclass upper School Upper School yeah\nCallison oh college preparatory yeah\nPreparatory Academy it's a beautiful\nCampus A lot of people use that track\nbecause it's a great track in you're\nable if you get there before I think I\nthink it's before 8 a.m. you can run on\nthe track it's a it's fantastic\ncondition and uh a lot of people would\nlike I used when I lived out in the\ncounty I used to it was exactly like I\nthink one or two miles from my house\nokay I would run over there for my\nwarmup do my track workout and run home\nso it's it's just a fantastic campus and\neverything but to it's kind of like it's\nso weird when a big thing happens and\nyou're like I feel like that Meme of um\nLeonardo Caprio where he's pointing at\nthe\nTV there that's us yeah it's like yeah\nof course it that's a thing in Baltimore\nthat's what we're known for that crabs\nand The Wire yeah we're really doing\nthere has it has to be murder involved\nin some way yeah um but yeah that's that\nwas a that was a wild thing to happen uh\nspeaking of wild things Robbie do you\nwant to tell everyone why we're\nrecording on Wednesday instead of\nTuesday oh yeah because I woke up well I\ndidn't wake up I I eventually you\ndid oh yeah I did do that too took my\nkids to school came back my wife was\ngoing to take the car to work someone\nbroke into the car last night or\nwhatever sorry not broke into the car\nshe forgot to lock the doors which wait\nit couple of weeks ago yeah which also\nhappened two weeks ago or a month ago it\nhappens quite often I'll say that how's\nthe relations at home right now what oh\nit's fine here's the thing I do it too\nso I'm like I can't really call out\njudgment but you know if you're getting\nthe kids out of the car and a lot happen\ngrocery whatever I get it and but we\ndon't have any we don't keep anything in\nour car so there's nothing to steal so\nthat's why if somebody gets in our car\nit's not a big deal that we didn't\nunlock except for your manual dude you\ndidn't replace the manual right yeah\nstill haven't gotten that back still\nlooking through the neighborhood for\nthat one um and then so anyways somebody\npopped a steering column and tried to\nguess steal a car but it's not a hondai\nor kia so you can't just like stick a\nscrewdriver in and start it um but\nnevertheless I thought all was good\nbecause I I mean the battery was dead so\nthen I charged it but then the um and it\nran and everything but the locks if you\ntry to lock the doors or whatever it\njust they keep unlocking Non-Stop and\nthe key fop doesn't work cuz I think\nthere's a you know a safety feature on\nthe ignition that disables everything if\nit's tampered with and so now I got to\ngo to the freaking dealer and tomorrow\nmorning at 8:00 a.m. and get that try to\nget that figured out which I'm sure it's\ngoing to cost like four4 or $500\nprobably well you just for someone to\nlook at stuff sometimes you know the\nclock starts going yeah oh yeah I mean\njust putting the wheels in the parking\nlot is going to be 100 bucks ah\nso that's it so that was annoying and\nthen someone was trying to scam me\nthrough text yesterday and then Seafood\ndins no but they were like you do you\nremember you exchanged pictures with\nme and he's like I probably did I was\nlike trying to recall who that was and\nexchanged phot did you engage in in\nconversation oh yeah I kept it going for\nlike dude as soon as I see that I don't\nknow the number no I flipped the script\non them oh cuz let him know that it's a\nworking phone number they sent me like a\nstock photo of some random uh did you\nsend one back no man but\nthey I I was messing with them they're\nlike you need to tell me the truth or\nwhatever and I said I'll tell you the\ntruth if you go get me an Apple gift\ncard for $100 and then give me the code\ndid they do it no but I kept like just\nusing that line of uh and then I just\ncut it off you seen the AI grandma that\nthey built in the UK to handle like\nphone\nscams I think I heard about this like\nkeeps him on the line she's like now you\nwant me to do what it's like he's like\nyou they had recordings of like the\nscammers on the other end just yelling\nat the old lady you know the sad thing\nabout this is that about that is that a\nlot of the scammers are in basically\nslave or slaves in like Myanmar and\nCambodia and stuff so they're in these\ncompound where they got tricked into\nbasically work they thought they were\ngoing to work as a like a real job and\nthey essentially get kidnapped and they\nhave to buy back their freedom by\nraising so much money through these\nscams so if they don't do so much in a\nday or whatever see but why would I let\na good earner\ngo and that's well that's the thing is\nthey don't really they keep telling them\nthat okay but then they drag it out did\nyou see aliens\nRomulus um is that a SC is that about a\nphone scammer no but they you are on\nthis off Planet working on the mines\nthere and when the girl is like I think\nI'm almost filled my credits like\nthey're like no you got to keep going\nyeah so it's pretty much the same thing\nso I always feel bad kind of leading\nthem on because I know it's most likely\njust somebody who's trying to work their\nway out some weird death you're too\nyou're thinking about this too much\nhere's what happens when someone texts\nyou that you just go report junk and\nthen you move on I know I know like I\ndon't I like to pull the thread see what\nhappens yeah but like you're making up a\nwhole story about this young C Cambodian\nfella trapped with a G you don't know um\nbut yeah it's anyways that's a whole\ndifferent thing yeah so that was the oh\nand then I had a sorry last thing there\nwas a contractor doing work on my house\nand you know they subcontract out to\nother their workers and he was\ninstalling this door on basement in the\nback of the patio and I had to correct\nhim like four times on the work and make\nhim redo it because it was bad work and\nI was just so mad because how did you\nknow it's bad work also where did you\nfind this dude well the guy the\ncontracting company is good so they it\nturns out that it was like somebody who\nthey were training and it was like his\nfirst his first day by himself how how\ndid you know he was doing it wrong\nthough oh because it's a simple it's a\npretty easy job just to stalling door\nlike so I mean it wasn't flush with the\nthe wall like all this stuff and I'm\njust like dude I I I could do this by\nmyself if I had the time um and so I\njust had to make him correct it over and\nover again but wait if you had the time\nif you weren't talking to Cambodian\ntelemarketers well I don't do that for\nmy whole Saturday that's only from 8:00\nto 10: a.m. on\nSaturdays yeah um so anyways that was my\nday yesterday wow and by the end of the\nday I was like I'm not even going to go\non a\nrun I feel you man I feel you\nman yeah oh here's the you know what but\nthis was the counterbalance for it I\nfound someone's I found a pair of\nglasses on the ground in a case near\nactually near your oh you're going to\nlike the story actually okay I can't\nwait it was a pair of prescription\nsunlasses okay and are they mine no but\nI posted it to the neighborhood group\nand the guy who glasses they were was\nthe dude the NPC guy for that lives by\nyou oh wow like the it was his brother\nokay but they they lived together and so\nI when I delivered it to the house I was\nlike actually met him so he's a real\nperson right but did you ask him what he\ndoes or how what I I think they're\nretired now but I my guess my story and\nmy head is I don't think they're\nBrothers I think they're ex cops oh\nreally well the guy with the long white\nhair he's he was a former Runner because\nwe started talking about running okay\ncuz I just figured he was a cop I don't\nH I don't think I don't know what it is\nabout those two but they just look like\ncops to me is it because they go out and\ncheck the cars every morning maybe\nthat's it they and his brother though I\nsee him like I wave to him when I'm\nrunning cuz I'll they they they walk\nquite a bit Yeah I think they walk\npretty far yeah I see him everywhere\nthat's why I think they're NPC that's\nthe weird thing you see him you all over\nBaltimore you're like there he is but he\ngave me 20 bucks get out and you took it\nI it was one of those things where D on\nlike a fixed income I was like no no no\nno and he just like for skid in your\nhand like with and you can't deny it it\nwould have made it more weird if I'm\njust like all right it's fine it would\nhave been a good uh I think you should\nreal or think you should leave like just\nkeep pushing him back just like shoving\nthe door closed you take it yeah that\nwas nice I think they're nice guys no\nthey were super nice that was it was\ngreat did you see them both at the same\ntime I did actually okay what were they\ndoing um just standing in the doorway\ntalking to me oh but they both came yeah\nthat's awesome yeah\nI think they're yeah I think it's a\npackage deal okay you get one you get\nthe other yeah okay yeah well did you\nspend the $20 on oh it's uh still in my\npocket but probably some scratch off was\nsay he's going straight to the lottery\nthose are going straight to fixing his\ncar yeah that's actually exactly where\nit's going oh you won $140 some dollars\non a fantasy the other day that's right\nso there you go it all is going towards\nF you realize all that luck the lord\ngiveth and the lord taketh away yeah\nwell I do I consider the Baltimore it's\nkind of like my Baltimore [\u00a0__\u00a0] fund\nlike I because it's cheaper to live in\nBaltimore I just assume I'm going to pay\na tax on some there's a reason it's\ncheaper is because your car is going to\nget broken into your packages are going\nto get stolen you're going to deal with\nother okay let's talk about something\nthough nobody will care about it's the\nwater bill in Baltimore yeah I don't\neven look at it because I don't even\nknow I don't think people I don't I\nthink I want to know the percentage of\npeople who actually pay that oh\nit's not high because I was talking like\nso basically for those of you listening\nto live in Baltimore you pay about 100\nbucks a month for water yeah if if\nthat's whatever the month whatever they\nfeel like you owe that month nobody\nknows how it actually works but I was I\nwas talking to uh Helen and she was\nrenting a place or her sister was\nrenting a place and the landlord hadn't\npaid the water bill for like 5 years so\nhe owed like a few thousand and and he's\nlike whatever no it's true there's\nactually uh I think there's a law or\nsomething where they can't cut off your\nwater unless it's unbelievably egregious\nso you could you can get away with it\nfor years in Baltimore without paying in\nso what happens when you go to sell the\nhouse there's like\na like that has to be reconciled yeah\nI'm not sure if they can put a lean\nagainst it or if it just goes to\ncollections obviously it's not going to\nI mean it's going to hurt your credit if\nit goes to collections but but they\nreally just can't they just ref won't\ncut your water off there's like a law or\nsomething where they can't do it so I\nthink you'll be all right just don't pay\nI mean don't we get I feel like we get\nbills here for people's stuff all the\ntime that are just who even knows yeah\nso when we purchase the headquarters we\nwere still getting bills and checks for\npeople that hadn't been here for years\nyeah that was pretty crazy for the city\nyeah yeah but like they were getting\nchecks too like cashes no I I'm not\ngoing to jail for 20\nI\nmean $20 is\n$20 but also you wouldn't go to jail for\n$20 that's the thing oh that's yeah\nyou're right yes but once you start\ndoing stuff with the deposits and stuff\ndon't you get in trouble I would guess\nfeels like a slippery slope yeah cuz\nthen before you know you're dealing\ncocaine that's that's the next step well\nthat's a that seems to be getting real\npopular again like and I still don't\nknow like where did people get it I've\nseen that too it seems to be what do you\nmean what do you mean you've seen it and\nit's gotten more popular like it people\nare outward I think what's happened is\nnow that weed is legal people are like\nyeah I like doing coke too and talking\nabout it it's just like a step above or\nsomething yeah I think also people were\nreverting to the 90s or 80s or whatever\nso people were smoking sigs people were\ndoing coke did we reach ma max level it\naround the 9s and since then\neverything's going backwards since then\neverything in what way cuz I was like\nwatching they someone posted on\nInstagram these young kids coming out of\na Tower Records in New York oh yeah I've\nseen real like a thousand times and I\nwas like oh I love it it just feels good\nto me it Feels Right like that's a\nmemory and a core and I'm like yeah I\nget it it's Nostalgia for me I live\nthrough that time period yeah you know I\nget it but I do also look at it and be\nlike having kids now they don't have to\nleave the house for anything oh yeah\nit's terrible and like back then you\nmight go to the record store and you\nlike if you were in the teenage years\nyou might start chatting with some a\ngroup of girls if you're you know\nwhatever that's the whole thing that's\nwhy it's awesome yeah and there's\nnothing for the kids these days so\nthey're online chatting with each other\nand you can't have like a that's why\nconversation that's why that's why like\nthe rates of like like the sex rates\nhave been declining like crazy since the\n90s is because hey guys don't know how\nto talk to girls anymore girls have this\ninsane expectation of like what a a like\nfrom just online stuff like what a GU\nshould be so there's this huge gap\nbetween the two plus then I think I\nbelieve guys are going more conservative\nwhile women are going more liberal so\nthat whole Gap is widening too so it's\nlike this really bad recipe for future\nthe future of civilization at least in\nAmerica well it does feel like we're in\na loop now where I'm like uh I like all\nthe music even the stuff Spotify\nrecommends to me is all starting to\nsound the same oh yeah it's get me start\non that like today I put on like I feel\nthis is such an old guy comment to make\nbut I was like I got to put on some\nclassic rock or something and hear\ninstruments and things playing I feel\nthat Megan Megan as as the youngest\nperson here what like do you think that\nwe\npeaked peaked as a society oh I don't\nknow need your opinion\nI don't know I don't I do feel like\nthere's a lot of areas that it's not\ngoing in the right direction but I I\nalso like there's so much more Tech\nthere's so much more advancements in\nareas what areas I want to get into I\nwant to get into using AI in real life\nlike see how I don't know how you're\ntalking about AR no no AI like how it\ncan help me like my friend was telling\nme that he when he if he's going to the\ngrocery store which I know you can get\nlike order online or whatever but if he\nhas just the ingredient lids for dinner\nand he puts in like hair teer Baltimore\nthis it shows them like exactly what row\neverything is in and lines it up so you\ncan just like go and not like have to\nfind anything it's just see and I don't\nlike that like we order our groceries so\nwe're rarely in there but when I go I\nwant to peruse I want to see what I like\nthe perusing yeah that me too I actually\nhate that idea that he told me about I\nlike the perusing how are you going to\nknow if you want spicy pickles if you\ndon't see spicy pickles yeah but it's\nnot fun to peruse the grocery store when\nit's packed with people but we can go at\ntimes we don't have to be at the pack\nTimes by I I picked a b 3m. is the worst\nbaget last night was insane oh what was\nlast night Tuesday at what 600 p.m. yeah\nyeah at Harris teer yeah yeah yeah I\nwent around that same time last week and\nI like when the line's crazy long and\nthen you just take your time let the\nline die down well you know Co hanging\nout for an hour in Harris Teeter when I\nwas there losing my mind I I I was\nbuying baguettes yeah and so I just had\ntwo baguettes and the self checkout line\nwas all the way back to the bread yeah\nhuge but the guy who's like the little\ncash R guy that's there he's like you oh\nand I was like what did I do you were a\nchosen one two items come here you were\nthe chosen one and he pulled me out of\nline rang me up let me go I was like\nwhoa I just saved like 15 20 minutes\ndude that's\ncool all right second check in I warned\nyou I told you it was going to get weird\nand here we are I hope you're enjoying\nit I hope your run is going well if\nyou're not running I hope you're\nthinking about running and that's going\nwell so uh let us know when you get out\nthere and remember build that mileage up\nslowly as you get ready for grit don't\nbe like jumping into high mileage right\non January 1st have some Fitness built\nin all right guys element is still a\nsponsor of this podcast but for a\nlimited time they're offering their\nchocolate medley o that sounds pretty\ndelicious you know it's not like the\nyou're not going to put that in your\nbubbly water no you could could you you\ncould uh you want it heated up I think\nyeah some hot water with either the\nchocolate mint the chocolate chai or the\nchocolate raspberry I've heard it's\npretty good in coffee

see you can't get that kind of\nhide from uh from AI absolutely not and\nyou know what I found uh I was going to\nthe Oreo flavors cuz you know they have\nall kinds of new ones in the grocery\nstore yeah yeah how are you going to see\nnew stuff yeah you you and it's you see\nwith your eyes and instead of online you\nknow so more just a better experience\nand I got uh tiramisu flavored Oreo\nthins how they okay Megan loves terisu\nyeah so they exist so that's like a\ncoffee creamy yeah it's nice but here's\nthe thing I think they're cheaping out\non the thins which is insane but I\nnoticed how could you get any the wafer\nis even more thin than the standard thin\nand the other thing is that it's a\nnormal size cookie pack and they're\nlabeling it family size now oh well\nactually I don't think that's a bad idea\nI mean you're right it is a family size\nfor a normal normal family but but\nbefore a family size is like the big one\nand I noticed they're doing that on\nseral boxes too like everything is\ngetting labeled family size that's just\nslightly more I like it and how's that\nmake you feel though if you don't have a\nfamily uh yeah it could be could be\nintroduce some trauma into your like tra\nor I really want to get those Oreos it\nlooks like a regular size but I ain't\ngot no family\nyeah but I will tell you this speaking\nof AI the grit polar bear that's on the\nback of the sweatshirt mhm I did that\nwith AI oh okay it's not a real polar\nbear that polar bear does not exist no\npolar bears were hurt in the taking of\nthat photo I just said I want a raging\npolar\nbear so it's not made of polar bear fur\nit's made of pixels oh it feels like\nthat was probably just made from a\nphoto that's not how AI works okay gave\nme several options yeah it's probably a\ncomposite of all these different polar\nbears it looks like a polar bear so\nthat's good yeah well I had other\noptions it gave me like three options\nand then I upscaled one of them and I\nwas like this is the one I like the Roar\nand it and it worked out I like the roar\nthat's good yeah um looks\nFierce you hear that my stomach's\ngrowling you think it came through on\nthe microphone I you hungry no he just\nwas talking about talking about Oreo\nthins yeah that's probably what did it\noh the T his Telly was like family size\nme\num oh can you believe that this is some\npeople's podcast I did yeah this is how\nmany people's number one podcast is this\nlike over a thousand it's ridiculous\npeople there's a there's a thousand of\nyou psychos out there no no no the the\nThousand was our top fans yeah that's\nwhat I mean that's how many top fans\nthat's what that meant okay like we\nshowed up as the number one podcast on\ntheir list of podcasts of top five\nthousands of people wow there was like\n5,000 we showed up in their top five wow\nyeah which also insane that is I love\nyou people thank you um\nso uh wait sorry Spotify yeah the crazy\npeople listening to us the\num notes from Robbie I wanted to say we\nwere talking about Christmas movies last\nweek oh we've been we've been doing it\noh je I I have updates but please go\nahead no no that's fine I was just I\nwent to introduce I want to ask you if\nyou've ever seen the movie Just Friends\nyes have you yeah dude that that's like\nthat great wait have I seen this yeah\nhonestly that's my favorite Christmas\nwhich one was that I had forgotten about\nthat one it's with Ryan Reynolds but\nhe's he wears like a fat suit oh yeah\nthat one's good cuz a it has like when\nyou look at it you're like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0]\nthey're still staying this stuff in 2004\nyeah it's very not PC yeah and then B\nit's Ryan Reynolds like Peak Ryan\nReynolds at his best and Anna Ferris is\nhilarious in it and the soundtrack's\namazing Anna Ferris is funny in that one\nit's just like the perfect movie we got\nto watch that one that one is good um\nyeah I we I watched die hard again\ndefinitely Christmas movie no doubt\nabout it uh like I don't even know why\nthere's a debate um okay we watched we\nwatched some really good ones yeah give\nit okay some of these I'm embarrassed to\nsay out loud that we that we watched\nokay um\nwait you want me to go from best to\nworst we've watched enough movies that\nwe could have installed that door for\nyou okay one of the one of my one of my\nfavorite ones is Family\nStone is this a home like a lifetime no\nthat has people in it oh no I remember\nthis okay yeah that's a good one um and\nthen the family man which I we watched\nit we watched that this past weekend too\npretty good yeah I a little sad yeah a\nlittle sad but overall pretty good okay\nnow here's where they get really good oh\nno actually before Christmases we did we\nfinish Wasing that one uh yeah okay um\nthat one was pretty good okay and then\nthis is where the lifetime and really\nbad ones come in Holiday in the wild\nsounds which one was where she goes and\nlives with the elephants oh yeah that\none was uh okay pretty bad it's the\nbrunette from Sex in the City oh yeah\nCharlotte yeah yeah and she how do I\nknow that her husband as soon as the\nkids are leaving and what's his name uh\nwho's the famous actor who's in it oh\nRob low yeah Rob I'm looking it up right\nand his son is in it too and his son\nplays her son which is weird um but the\nuh the premise which was funny about it\nwas that her husband decides as soon as\nthe kids are out he's like I'm done\nlet's get a divorce the opening scene is\nher saying goodbye to her her College\nBound uh son and then she's like I\nplanned this second honeymoon for us and\nhe's like I'm\nout yeah before before we get on the\nplane let me just let you know we're not\ndoing anything together anyway she ends\nup going to live with elephants it's all\nwonderful okay a really bad one our\nlittle secret Lindsay Lohan oh I okay I\ndidn't fresh on Netflix oh that's a new\none that's right yeah yeah um five out\nof 10 Stars I I I actually think that\none's almost so bad that it's good okay\nbut then oh this one's the worst hot\nFrosty an oxymoron if there ever was one\nhot Frosty it's about Jack Frost is oh\nmy gosh to life and he's a ripped dude\nthat for anyone who's seen shitz Creek\nit's the vet from shitz Creek who's hot\nFrosty that has 81% on Rotten Tomatoes\nhead that's way better than the other\nones you okay there's one that there's\none that we didn't finish and it's\nactually quite devastating yeah it's\nhorrible but it's the one it's Christmas\nand Spotlight the one that's based off\nof Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce okay\nyeah it was so bad I couldn't watch it\nwe turned it off after 15 minutes no we\nit was a little long maybe hour so\nsomebody mentioned that the whole reason\nthat's uh a movie is because Hallmark is\nis it a Hallmark movie yeah it's based\nout of Kansas City too so that's like\npart of the whole deal I don't know if\nit's part of the plot but that's\nlike it kind of ties into the whole B is\nit that bad hot Frosty is really really\nbad I don't hate that\ntitle remind me it remind me of Ino\nman you should just watch the beginning\nto look at this dude shredded app as\ninspiration so I go to Megan I go this\ndude like she missed the part where the\nSnowman melted and turned to human flesh\nso I had to go back and rewatch so I was\nlike Megan he's pretty jacked and she's\nlike he looks muscular I'm like no Megan\nthis dude is like 0% fat and so we\nrewatch and she goes what was your\ncomment he's super jacked like the most\nfit human I've ever seen this makes zero\nsense because Frosty has literal sticks\nfor arms not this one if you now this\none this one looked like it was it was\nlike if someone sculpted David yeah and\nshe puts a magic scarf around him okay\nmagic sarf turns him yeah he's he's\nconstantly he's like overheating cuz you\nknow he's Frosty so shirt off so he\nactually does have to remain cold he has\nto remain cold until the end when he\nturns to a real boy oh spoil alert sorry\npeople that's amazing yeah he turns into\na real human at the end cuz he falls in\nlove so is Frosty cold blooded or he's\njust cold cold blooded I don't think\nhe's blooded oh he doesn't have blood so\nthis this guy his temperature his body\ntemperature was like 32\u00b0 oh so he\ndoesn't like if you cut him open there's\nno even veins the hot wasn't a\ntemperature hot it was\nhot good looking dude the sequels of\nthis is going to be hot chocolate and\nyou know where that's\ngoing it's\ngood they're definitely going to do it\nokay I've been foring you um a small\ngentleman that looks just like Jared\nWeissberg yeah I know our wide foot\nreviewer I think I've been ignoring them\nyeah me too I I would like people to\nknow that Instagram handle so they can\nsee our wide foot reviewer no you are so\ncaught up on this guy I dude you're\ntelling me it doesn't look exactly like\nMegan even no I I will not engage with\nthis conversation it looks like it but I\nthink uh he looks jar wife of Jared\nlooks more like David bla I think that's\nthat's what everyone thinks yeah so you\ndon't think that the Littlefoot Jarrett\nlooks like David bla yeah but I mean I\nthink the closer one to one would be\nJared and David bla this one I every\ntime I see it I think I'm watching\nJared's stories he probably thinks\nyou're his biggest fan at this point\nhe's got to I mean I B his stuff to\nJarrett you and Megan every time I see\nthat's insane dude how about satisfy\ncoming out with uh the Jean the Levi\nsatisfy Jeans by the way I didn't see\nthem that was kind of a random offshoot\nthey're climbing climbing jeans so I\nguess the front is like a got an\nabrasion um like layer so that it won't\nmake\nlook yeah did they put a shirt on the\nguy this time I think so so they took uh\nold Levi je Levi 501 jeans from the\nHeritage vintage I don't know I think\nthat just means left in the basement\nyeah you guys got the old 501's laying\naround and uh they basically put panels\nof that\nsatisfy and these are for sale rip stop\nstuff how much are how much do they cost\nI don't know there's only 200 pairs\navailable so you do

um but I was like man\nthat's going to be that's something\nwould you wear them probably right it\njust wait what's today oh they drop\ntomorrow oh okay the December 12th for\nhow much I'm satisfied that it's not\ntelling me I mean I'm guessing like $800\nor something who knows their rain pants\nare $350 so let's say $450 I mean if\nthey're yeah they're going to be more\nthan that how much are their climbing\npants four these\nguys yeah yeah Thomas you're wearing\nthem I think 400 or\nsomething we didn't get paid paid for\ndoing a podcast we just got a piece of\ngear the climbing pants are

going out a little hot I\nwas a little worried about it for him\nmhm and then next thing you know he came\naround he was in second place and he\njust stayed there the whole time and I\nwas just like the one guy who was in the\nfront was like super fast but like they\nwas cruising and I was just like wow he\nended up on a flat 150 M track like with\nno banks no traction just like wood\nfloor thing

I'm going to\nhave his bus comes back to\ntalson where the school is yeah um and\nI'm going to have to drive out there and\npick him up I mean I wouldn't I'm just\nsaying I feel like some parents think\nthat's permiss permissible I I I mean I\nI if I was like if you go to a football\ngame you I would drink a beer yeah if I\nif I was at like um feel like it's\ndifferent with the with the kids yeah\nyeah I went um I've always had this\nproblem I feel like during the craft\nbeer height you know when everyone was\nit was just I guess cool to take your\nkids drinking with you all the time I\nfeel like that's died off but\nthe I feel like parents would come to\nplaygrounds even with uh\ncolster or something of beer and I'm\nlike dude that's weird because if you\nwere somewhere and\nyou I'm just saying if you were some the\nsame parents I know if you were\nsomewhere and you saw someone bring like\na 40 of you know ice house or whatever\nor Cobra yeah you'd be judging the hell\nout of them and I was like it's the same\nthing you're drinking a double IPA like\nit's eight 12% but you're bringing it to\nthe playground I was like you're can't\ndo that I don't know it's to me that's I\ndidn't love living in the suburbs when I\ndid my little stint there and I felt\nlike there's a lot\nof medicating with kids so it's like for\nsure you know let's everybody go in the\nculde saac watch our kids ride bikes\nwhile we get yeah hammered yeah there is\na lot of that yeah honestly that\nprobably happen it does happen here in\nthe city oh for sure but it's yeah I I\nthink there's just a parenting is hard\nsometimes yeah I mean and I'm not\ntotally judging I feel like it I've been\nthere in some\nways um wa whenever you go to a kids\nfirst birthday party you're like Dude\nWhere's the booze well that I do agree\nkids birthday parties yeah definitely\nneed um you definitely like I remember\nwhen they cuz they start dying out like\nthe early ones when they were like 1 two\nthree you know it's going to be a party\ncuz the kid's not really even right they\ndon't even know what's happening I think\nI think when they hit like six and seven\nit starts tapering off a bit yeah I\nwould hope so see that was the thing I\nstopped going to kids birthday parties\naround then well I don't here's the\nthing that's weird nowadays too is that\nthere's almost this expectation that\njust parents still go to the party with\nthe kid no drop off like what is this\nwhen I was a kid I'd never even heard of\na a birthday party where parents\nstayed drop the K off and you go yeah we\nneed to bring that that actually we do\nneed to bring that back that's\nnumber one priority in 2025 on my\nagenda I'm at that I mean I'm at the\nstage where the birthday parties are\nkind of done there's like I dropped\nHenry off at one yeah no parents were\nthere the kids went bowling you know\nyeah it was it it was over um I did want\nto give a shout out to one of our Trail\nreviewers Allison Mercer she\nactually was on the women's um 100K\nnational team W you know how sometimes\nthere things like there's a lot of the\nbut they took third place in the world W\nin the world yeah and I think they were\nin what shoe did she wear I forget where\nit was she wore the Hocus yellow X1 whoa\nthat's not a trail shoe this is a this\nno this is a road race this is for the\nwomen's Road Road 100K\nchampionships and for the but it was a\nteam event you know was like a national\nteam event that would be a good shoe for\nit that shoe was so comfy\nyeah\num 100K\nchampionships I have this on the\nteam I can't remember I saw Camille\nHeron ran recently and did something and\nI was like went straight to the comments\nto\nsee oh yeah what you know what was going\nto be after her debacle but it seemed\nlike most people were being very\npositive yeah\num so okay so it was sorry my bad so it\nis is Trail it was a trail running\nthe I was a little mixed up because but\nI think it's kind of like a ra Crush\ngravel you know very smooth out Trail U\nso it's an international it's the I\nwhich is a International Association of\nultra Runners 100K World Championship\nunder it's a world Athletics event okay\num who was on the team\nso I don't know all these PE I I don't\nknow a lot of athletes so I feel bad\nthat's right Pina\nhonet not going to pronounce that\nperson's\nname Narin ninga what country won I\nthink I know Great Britain I think was\nlike\nsecond um but anyways it's pretty\nawesome yeah that's cool yeah that's\nright so she won't be reviewing for us\nmuch longer and running that's what\nTaylor said yeah uh and running in the C\nX1 so that was nice\ngreat shoot I mean yeah it's good final\ncheckin well the weirdness is almost\nover so congrats for making it this far\nif you made it this far you're a real\nfan and I appreciate it so just cruise\non out for the rest of this episode and\nenjoy your\nrun the only thing the only two other\ntopics I had this is just things that\nwere in my mind\nwere worm\ngrunting I guess that's like calling up\nworms from the soil that I saw on\nInstagram or something\nokay do we want to dive into that one no\nwe talk about that okay and but I will\nso they the these guys I don't know they\nthey harvest worms or whatever earth\nworms this is what's showing up in your\nalgorithm right now yeah okay I think it\nhas to do with maybe fishing okay and\nthey take a stick and put it in the\nground and they rub another stick\nagainst it and make a sound that's like\na loud like humming sound supposedly the\nvibrations that it emits into the ground\ncause the earthworms to just rise up\nlike they might think it's rain or\nwhatever say can you just dump some\nwater on it yeah but it's like the whole\nfloor is just like comes up with\nearthworms crawling out of it that's\nabsolutely did you know earthworms are\nan invasive species I did yeah I did I\nactually wrote about that a little bit\nmay be where I learned about it I think\nit is they they actually don't exist\nthey there's still Parts I think in\nMinnesota in the central part of the\ncontinent where they haven't\nthey don't exist or they haven't like\nreached maybe because there's like\nsomebody with a stick on maybe but yeah\nthey basically are\ndestroying the natural ecosystems within\nthe Northeast like the forest floor and\nstuff because they're so obviously\nthere's so many of them but they're not\nnative to North America it's like kind\nof a big deal but nobody cares because\nthey're earthworms it's not like the\nanacondas in Florida right yeah um\nanyways but I thought that was that was\npretty weird that was a thing that I saw\nand then the other thing was just I\ndon't know why I'm even talking about\nthis\nstuff the other thing the other thing\nwas so you know Nacho Mama yeah the gone\nyeah yeah they're they're closing down\nthis is a restaurant near\nus pretty much built Canton it's been\nhere for so long 30 years yeah no when\nit opened up like I remember going down\nto Canton Square MH and it like it was\nlike a oh this is crazy little part of\ntown and at the time one of my friends\nhis I guess his grandmother lived in\nCanton okay and when she passed away he\nwas like dude I got this house and I\nthink it was worth\n$199,000 that's crazy and now the house\nis in can the median price is probably\nwhat 400 yeah probably yeah and so at\nthe time we're like whoa and he's like\nyeah fix it up and sell it and I think I\nthink he fixed it up and sold it for\nlike 25 or something something something\nnot yeah yeah he put a carpet and fix\nthe windows and and that he was like\nlike totally stoked that he had this uh\nright and I'm like gez man if he'd held\non to it for a little but we all went\ndown to Nacho Mama's and like the hubcap\nMargarita I feel like when I first moved\nhere that was I would go there all the\ntime yeah just seemed like the thing to\ndo you had to go get a hubcap St Patty's\nDay on the Square MH and then late night\nthe\npizzas I I actually still get their\npizzas do you really yeah I actually\nthink it's a pretty good cheap pizza\nyeah sometimes we'll get it dude I've\nnever had that pizza sober so I'm not\nreally sure yeah I mean it's not the\nbest but that was like when the Bars\nwere closing that was I remember sitting\non sidewalks yeah you know pretty the\nbest Sidewalk Pizza end of Night 2 a.m.\nlove that eating pizza on the on the\ncurb yeah it is kind of sad that it's\ngoing\nbut uh yeah I remember this one time I\nsaw some guy who's Hammer drunk trying\nto put um think he was putting garlic on\nhis pizza and just poured a whole ton of\nsalt on it oh nice best did he eat it\nyeah I mean he all right I don't know if\nhe did but he didn't know he didn't know\nit until he bit into it um but yeah I\nwas going to say I was even that that\nwas a pretty successful restaurant right\noh yeah like really did well and are\nthere any s like I don't know how I\ncould ever going into the restaurant\nbusiness of owning a restaurant because\nI don't know of any that actually\nsucceed\nover 25 after 25 years I mean most\nclothes within 5 years it has to go into\nfranchise like you have to really be\nlike like it's really sad cuz we loved\num what was a restaurant that's down\nthat did the seafood in the bottom of\nthe four\nSE oh lock bar lock bar loved it they\nhadn't been there in like a few years\nand we were it was anniversary or\nsomething we go over there it was\nhorrible oh really yeah oh wow and I'm\nlike that those are backed like is that\nan atlas one yeah oh yeah and I'm like\nhow does this go bad\nlike yeah yeah you have the it's in the\nbottom of the Four Seasons it's got\nbacking from A A Restaurant Group\nbeautiful location and then people get\nmad at Atlas but like I feel like if\nAtlas wasn't around Baltimore would have\nno restaurants yeah I mean it's it's a\nlittle bit of a double-edged sword\nbecause yeah they do I mean say what you\nwill but they\ninvest like it sucks cuz they they buy\nup a lot of properties but also if the\npeople were going to sell them like what\nelse were they going to be I don't know\nI don't even think they're buy I think\nthey own the properties or they might\nown because they were part of the H&S\nthey created I think I think part of the\nproblem is they might lease out the\nbusinesses and then eventually just take\nthem just take them yeah I think that's\nwhich I get yeah but but at the same but\nyeah I know what you're saying I don't\nunderstand how I just don't understand\nwhy you would want to be a restaurant\nowner it seems like such a losing battle\nlike and that's always you always see\nathletes and stuff like that opening a\nplace yeah or restaurant you know in\nAustin there was the Vince Young\nSteakhouse or something and um is that\nwas that in business I don't know I\nguess I mean they they have steakhouses\nand barbecue spots remember that that\nguy's golf the golfer who's Jack\nNicholas yeah we went to his thing in\nthe airport Saville that for some reason\nyou looked it up and you're like he\ndoesn't even own this yeah that's true\nit was like some he had I don't know it\nwas a whole thing they used his yeah\nwell the um did you hear how Marky marks\nor Mark W walberg's the wallers the no\nhe opened a new restaurant in Las Vegas\nnot connected to that and the day of the\ngrand opening it burned down it's like\nlast week what yeah just burned down\nyeah like it was a fluke I guess I don't\nknow that feels that feels it might have\nbeen from from his work in The Departed\nor something that might have been why\nyeah I watched that show um what's the\nshow The Bear are you looking\nup the bear yeah they talk about that\nthere wait about what about what they\ntalk about burning down restaurants oh\nyeah I mean it's a good way to I don't\nthink that's true I swear I swear all\nthese headlines say he turns up the\nheat and it's the hottest new restaurant\ndude did I just make yeah he did maybe I\ndreamt that he did um Whatchamacallit\nthough the Mount Washington Tavern that\none burnt down and then they came back\nwith a even better restaurant like all\nthe insurance paid for a better\nrestaurant okay oh no okay look did Mark\nWahlberg's restaurant go up in Flames I\nthink that was a headline oh dude it was\nout in 20 minutes\nyeah there you go and they reopened see\nthis is why oh how the fire incident\nunfolded so there was a fire okay but it\ndid burn down greatly\nexaggerated it burned down a a stack of\nnapkins on the table it's a new Mexican\nrestaurant anyway he's bringing New\nMexican like New Mexico or no new recent\ndo you know what I'm trying to get for\nmaybe that's why Nacho Mama's clothes\nthey were intimidated so for the grit\nparty this this year\nwhich I think will be mid\nJanuary we and if you can come come it's\nso much fun oh yeah great party but um\nwe're going to do it at ministry again I\nbelieve which TBD it's all TBD yeah TBD\nbut we're also I'm having her check with\nthe Taco Guy down the street here and\ninstead of having like a taco truck like\nwe had last year which took a long time\nand had do more of that like catered\nstyle that makes more sense and people\ncan just go up and grab like what they\ndid at the A6 thing in Austin that's\nwhat I was thinking yeah that's exactly\nwhat they should do\nyeah yeah well no the breakfast one\nwhere we did breakfast tacos they were\nwrapped in tinfo you just went up and\ngrabbed one oh you just I didn't even\nthink about that but I was just thinking\nlike you know buffet style but okay the\nrap one might be even better where just\ngrab and go\nyeah I'm grabbing like 10 of them you\nyou can um the party is a lot of fun\nwe'll give you details on that later but\neven if you're not participating great\nyou're welcome to come it's in Baltimore\nwe have a good time we usually have some\nadult beverages and food and just get\nsome miles in before yeah little three\nmile jog what's the date again do we\nhave an off we haven't confirmed it's\nprobably either going to be the January\n11th or I think it's going to be the\n11th okay it's like I talked to Helen\nyesterday and 11th sound like but we\nwill confirm and put all the details out\non social are you here on the 11th as\nfar as I know okay oh wait I don't know\nyou might not be oh where are you going\num might go down to Charleston or you\ncould fly them up and they could come to\nthe grit party what every family wants\nto do fly with little three and a halfy\nold three and a halfy old at the party\nto January in Baltimore yeah sounds fun\nit's so beautiful um speaking of asex\nshould we talk about this new shoe that\nnone of us have actually run in yet yeah\nwe just got him yesterday the Joe Nimbus\n27 mhm now you got you did a thing on\nthis didn't you with well so so a few\nyears ago I guess two years ago um as6\ndid a whole like relaunch of this shoe\nwith the GEL Nimbus 25 and so I was part\nof that wear testing program um it ended\nwith a at the Cherry Blossom but I'm\nsaying race and DC when we were at the\nrunning event is this the sh you talked\nabout with oh yeah with Paul yeah so\ntell us about it um basically they're\nmaking it more max cushy so they added\nsome stack the foam is a new version of\nthe foam so I believe it's a little\nsofter a little\nbouncier and yeah just like an overall\nplus plus it's still technically that\nbut it's a different formulation makeup\nit's blast plus Eco oh Eco which it was\non the last version too is it Eco yeah\nwhich they both were they don't have any\num writing on it normally they throw\nthat on\nthere I don't see uh outsole Remains the\nSame as the previous model as6 grip\noutsole as6 grip is the good one right\nyeah I think so okay it looks solid it's\ngot ahar Plus in this back panel so this\nis the wait I think ahar plus is the\ngood one A Plus back here and then A6\ngrip okay is the rest of this so you\njust get a little on the heel always get\nthem confused yeah you're going to have\nto look that\nup but it looks cushy and yeah it it\nbasically sounded like they just created\nthe just a beefier version of the shoe I\ndidn't love the upper on the last one\nthis one looks like an improvement yeah\nand they still have that knit tongue\nthough which I love yes Megan's favorite\nknit tongue mhm they nailed it and a\nnice pulse I mean honestly just looks\nlike a really nice Cruiser um again it's\nnot going to be a shoe you're going to\nwant to run fast in but get some nice\neasy miles in it's a it's a daily\ntrainer yeah more max cushion what about\nif someone wants the Nova blast though\nwhat would you say i' say the Nova blast\na little quicker yeah I would say that\none's a little bit more versatile\nprobably lighter definitely lighter\nyeah yeah so A6\ngrip um so a plus is the most durable\nand sticky of that's like the top rubber\nthat's yeah and then the as6 grip is the\nrest the thing is that this shoe I think\nis one of those shoes that crosses over\nbetween it's your basic Comfort Max Kush\ndaily trainer but also there seem to be\na lot of people who like this just for\nlike who go in for like a shoe that\nthey'll be comfortable in all day yeah\nyeah for sure I mean I think that's\nexactly what it is yeah and then we have\nthis other metal box here you can open\nit not here not right now we're going to\ndo something special with it Robbie and\nI both got a uh like a attache case yeah\nthey really love the uh the pr people\nreally love to send shoes in a box you\nhave to unlock I I do they we've had\nseveral we've had that from Solomon Nike\nit's cool I like it I like playing a\nlittle game yeah but I think we'll do\nsomething fun with that and uh make Carl\ndo some work I think they do need to at\nsome point they need to start\nincorporating explosives into it so we\nhave to get it unlocked by a certain\ntime if we don't clip the right wires\nwe're done like or this a little bit it\nreleases releases some acid onto the\nshoe so you don't get the Sho yeah\nactually that'd be great yeah something\nthat like dis it's like a mission\nimpossible self-destruction like a paint\npellet goes off letting people know that\nyou didn't do it in time yeah I think\nand then you have a custom pair of\npainted shoes either way yeah but one of\nthem like if you have that if you get it\nout in time and it looks good you could\nbe like yeah I was smart enough to get\nthis out on time and then if a different\nperson unboxing it has one with paint\nall over you dummy yeah big\ndummy um what's are we saying what's in\nthe box Kevin spy Style H let's just\nwait no check the Instagrams to see\nwhat's in the Nike box I'm kind of mad\nthat they put the what it says is on the\nbox I I was like\nwhy that gives it away wait what do you\nwant me to get excited about you know\nwhat we should do is instead of doing\nthe unlocking thing we should just get a\nhammer out just smash it open that's the\ncontest just throw it into Eastern\nAvenue have a semi- truck roll over it\nyeah be like ah I we won't play your\ngame honestly don't hate that idea at\nall same we won't play your game thr in\nthe middle of I95 throw into the bag do\nwe have a circular saw we can just cut\nthe locks\noff I think it uh I do that would be\nfun I mean I was trying to think if I\nhave anything else would be interesting\nI'm trying to think is there something\nshoot it with a shotgun could you yeah\nuh is there anything that you would use\nthis box for after we open\nit uh no I mean I guess I could put my\nChristmas ornaments there once they come\noff the train what about tapes and CDs\ndo you like tapes and CDs\nokay I do like tapes and CDs I really I\nwould like a Walkman for uh okay Megan\nyou know what I'm talking about oh wait\nwhat's that from if you're in the\naudience what's it from it's an it's an\nold um C nuts\nmeme one of the original I should know\nthat I'm better than\nthat Robbie likes\nD\nokay I didn't know that was a thing but\nI forgot I wasn't in high school anymore\nyeah Tom is still there I don't yeah I\nwas thinking about that the other day\ncuz we're doing the weightlifting stuff\nand the running and I'm like\nmentally nothing has changed like I I'm\npretty much yeah the ex I'm like we're\naware everyone knows all right like\ncontinue no continue it's such a weird\nthing I do get\nthat you know Mind Body disconnect of of\nlike yes I'm getting older and stuff\nlike that but like I feel like the\nperson driving this machine is still the\nsame\nperson do you think if mirrors didn't\nexist that it feel you feel better too\ncuz if you if you didn't have mirrors\nyou how scary would it be when you\nwalked up to some water and to get a\ndrink well I still don't think you can\nquite tell you get an idea but I I don't\nthink it'll be that scary CU it's a\nlittle depends what kind of body of\nwater you're looking into but I feel\nlike if you didn't have\nmirrors maybe you'd all feel a little\nbit better about yourself you might feel\nbetter but I also think that like the\nthe ego uh yeah Thomas stop looking at\nno I think that no but I'm saying like\nuh if think about it from an ego\nperspective like from a kid we get sat\nin front of a mirror and they're like\nthat's you and then you kind of are\nfascinated with mirrors\nfor your life growing up you com your ha\nbrush your every morning you look at\nyourself and you're like evaluate what\nyou see yeah\nI mean nobody gets out of the shower and\nwalks past the mirror and doesn't\nlike I would\nguess take take a look um start crying\nyeah but and imagine if you were a clown\nand you really did have a you like you\nlived in a actual fun house and just had\nmirrors everywhere I mean you're a clown\nso at that point yeah you're probably\nokay with it but clown without the\nmakeup even worse yeah that might be\nscary yeah but I I do Wonder like if you\ndidn't have that connection to your\nimage and I I think it's innate in all\nof us we love the photos we love taking\nvideos doing all this stuff it you can\nsee it's ramping on like through\nInstagram Tik Tok all this we are\nfascinated with seeing ourselves in the\nworld and it's like a reaffirmation so\nthe crazy thing that you're talking\nabout is not having a physical identity\nwhat would that do to you mentally I\nthink it would be better\nI think we I'd like to if I could do\nanother life base everything off your\npersonality that's it if I could do\nanother simulation without mirrors I\nkind of want to see what it's like or\nwhat about just living in a universe of\nformlessness I don't know about that\nthing I want form like when you so when\nyou think about and we're go we're going\nto go a little deep here for a bonus\nepisode um when you go into the next\nphase of Life do you feel like you're\ngone like when you when you die in this\nworld are you gone or do you go into a\ndifferent like\nexistence oh I definitely think there's\na different existence\n100% but I don't know what that looks\nlike like would you be Robbie in that or\nare you part of like now a drop back\ninto the I just think it's totally it's\nlike you can't conceive of what it is I\nthink it's just like a totally different\nreality but I've heard enough near-death\nexperiences to think to think there's\nfor sure something\nthing parallel plane or something what\nabout you make I don't know I don't like\nto think about all\nthat oh you have to is for the\npodcast uh sure yeah there's another no\nI don't know I don't know I always think\nof it like\nraindrops like you you're as an\nindividual raindrop you have like that's\nwhere I kind of feel like our existence\nis now you're by yourself and you think\nthat you're individual and then you drop\ninto a stream or an ocean or whatever\nand then you feel like a part of a mass\nand then you evaporate and Float back up\ninto the sky and go through it all over\noh so you're talking about like a\nreincarnation typ I don't think it's\nreincarnation but I I wouldn't like I\ndon't\nthink\nlike a raindrop wouldn't identify as a\ncloud and a cloud wouldn't identify as a\nbody of water no now nowadays it might\nbut yeah but yeah I it's hard to say I\nknow I know what you're saying yeah like\nI'm that's where I'm kind of like okay\nwhere where where would it go yeah what\nwould happen is that well and I'm not\nI'm talking um\nnon-religious it could right have some\nspiritual part to it I just don't I have\nno idea and I guess I'm in the majority\nthere yeah I don't mind talking about it\nit's all right I think there's something\nyou guys can have a separate podcast\nI'm coming up in an hour we get\ntheological with Robbie\nringer uh but on that note maybe we\nshould just close out okay and you tell\nus you write in the comments where\nyou're going after this life yeah or if\nyou're from the great beyond and you\nhear us come back and tell them us now\nshould we be saving our medals from\nmarathons or throwing them away I think\nwe all know the answer to that one

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and I'm here with Drew from Merill\nand Corey Merill athlete and uh we're\ngoing to go over two new shoes that are\num a little bit different than the\nnormal Merl that we've come to know the\nmore the more technical Savvy the lower\nto the ground connected to the trail and\nyou have two new offerings uh this next\nyear that kind of bridge a gap that you\nhaven't had yeah absolutely\nabsolutely um Jump Right In yeah let's\nJump Right In cool uh so first off we\nhave our MTL adapt so this is part of\nour Merill test lab line uh the long Sky\n2 Matrix and Skyfire 2 Matrix are\nexisting models in that line which are\nmuch uh lower stack kind of yeah we have\nthem back here oh yeah low low\nstack um kind of grip it and rip it type\nof category for sure um but yeah keep\ngoing as we looked at uh use case and\nour our roster of athletes there was a\nneed for a higher stack longer distance\nshoe but we still wanted to deliver on\nthe uh Trail connection throughout the\nrest of our line so we came up with the\nMTL adapt which utilizes our full length\nFlex connect so there's internal\ngeometry that allows the shoe to move\nwith the foot but because there's so\nmuch foam here we wanted to take that\ngeometry and extend it around the\nsidewall and into the out soole so you\nsee this decoupled rubber with these\nFlex Groves allows this big platform to\nreally adapt to the terrain do you kind\nof think of it as like kind of like a\npodular midsole in some ways like\nacting yeah yeah pieces of foam think of\nlike a a slinky that each part kind of\nmoves independently yeah okay Cory I\ncan't help it to notice that you have a\npair that looks to have like a ton of\nmiles on it I do so this is my personal\npair uh has over 800 mes on it right now\nand as you can see I mean the lugs I\nmean they've been worn down a bit but\nother than that the shoe is still in\ngreat shape the Matrix upper is holding\nup super well and honestly it's been\ncomfortable the whole time and in what\nkind of terrain are you as an athlete an\nelite level athlete what kind of train\nare you choosing to use this on is it\nyour does it become your daily trainer\ndoes it just become your long racer what\nis it I mean you know this is great\nbecause it do a lot of different things\nit can be something that you're going to\nrace say 100K or 100 miles or even a\nmulti-day event in just one pair or it\ncould be something that you can use on a\nrecovery run a long run just like your\neasier days um anything from dirt road\nsnow covered Road even like\nsemi-technical terrain it performs very\nwell yeah and it seems like this is VRA\nMega grip yeah yep Mega grip 4 mm 4 mm\nokay 4 mm lugs I mean for 800 Mi this\nlooks incredible yeah I mean it's it's\nstill in great shape and honestly it's\nlike I'm still using it just on some of\nmy easier days now yeah and I mean we\ntalk about sustainable Merill has had\nthat sustainable conversation too of\nlike and that's sustainable if you can\nactually get 800 mil out of a pair as an\nelite Runner like that's that's\nsomething to make note of 100% yeah\nanything else about the adapt Matrix\nthat you want to like do you have\noverall stack uh so overall stack is\n4135 so six mil drop yep um everything\nin the marrow lineup is six mil is that\nright uh the long sky is 4 mil okay yep\nyep um midsole is dual density so you\nhave a softer inner layer uh\nencapsulated by a slightly harder outer\nlayer okay and that allows The Rocker to\nreally uh maintain its form throughout\nthe gate uh and then ultimately because\nit's such a high stack platform uh we\nwanted to hold the foot down so the\nMatrix upper and the fit panel really\nlocks you down to the platform a so you\ncan experience it awesome and then is\nthis a fully gusted tongue semi uh it\nhas the wings that come down awesome\nokay thank you and then um what what is\nprice point and when can we see this uh\n170 and this will be first half 25 all\nright so really fair price too for a lot\nwhole lot of foam yeah totally okay what\nelse do we have here uh so this is the\npror um this is a road to Trail offering\nuh it has the same float Pro Plus\nmidsole\ncompound as the adapt so dual density\nsofter inside with a slightly harder\noutside it has the internal Flex connect\ngeometry which you can see referenced or\nor mirrored on the out soole this is the\nbig story though um we're taking Vibram\ninto a crossover space between Road and\ntrail with their excess Trek Evo\ncompound okay great and we've seen this\nkind of compound on just really a couple\nother hiking shoes couple other trail\nshoes in the industry not many have\nutilized this excess so that's awesome\nyeah yeah lots of little biting edges so\num especially in like wet pavement this\nthis really shines is this something\nthat you've been in yet yeah so I've\nactually tested a pair of those as well\nand you know it's a great shoe um with\neverything that we have we have you know\nthe rip it and grip it the fast Trail\nshoe we have the longer stuff this kind\nof fills that void of like going from\none to the other um you know I do a lot\nof road like dirt road work in it and do\na lot of just longer runs in it as well\nokay and uh is there\nany while you're running what kind of\nsensation do you get with this you said\nyou could go faster and it has the\ngeometry you know it has a little bit of\na rock to it so with that it's like you\nyou do feel like you're on your toes a\nbit more but it's just it's a faster\nfeeling shoe but yet still cushioned\nyeah and you and I were talking about\njust a little bit the gravel category is\na pretty new one in our space it again\nit fills a small hole in the road to\nTrail and it's not necessarily just road\nto Trail but it can work in that\napplication um what do you envision this\nbeing if if someone's going to grab this\nas their soul shoe who is that who is\nthat person what are they doing most\nit's the Enthusiast who loves running as\na sport um and isn't necessarily siloed\nto one distance one environment uh you\ncan run in the road you can run on trail\nit's all about democratizing the sport\nso for with one buying occasion you can\ndo your local half marathon on the trail\nyou can do your 5K on the road like it\nit spans um a lot and honestly is a\ngreat daily trainer okay and I can't\nremember if you said stack or not What's\nthe total stack on this uh so this one\nis have to check my numbers this one is\n3226 okay so moderate and Y yep\njust kind of a good for anything kind of\nshoe right yeah okay and price point on\nthis that's 150 okay awesome and this\none's coming out same season or is this\nfall mid year okay\nawesome okay thank you guys for giving\nus the rundown looking out be looking\nout for Merill\n[Music]",

  "text": "[Music]\nall right hi this is Thomas believe in\nthe run this Robby with believe in the\nrun and this is Megan with believe in\nthe run and I don't know why I'm yelling\nbut that was quite aggressive yells at\nClouds this is the last podcast of\n2024 really limping into the end\nhere yeah I feel like wheels are coming\noff everyone's sick everyone's sick I\nthink you know this is like I was been\nlooking forward to this time because we\ntraveled a lot we did a lot of things I\nwas just like we'll get to the holidays\nwe can kind of relax and I think my body\nis gone and said okay yeah let's get\nsick let's everything's broken yeah yeah\nI mean everyone's getting sick around\nthese parts I think it's inevitable when\nit the weather gets cold I mean actually\nI think you two got it at the gym I\nthat's why my theory I was going to go\nwith that as well I don't know\neveryone's that or maybe I don't know my\nkids also get sick so maybe Robbie\nbrought it in yeah Robbie's the real\nproblem yeah I'm the small poox blanket\nof Believe In The Run hey Robie before\nwe get started you got a package from\ntracksmith why don't you rip it open and\nlet's see what's in it oh we're already\nstarting Christmas presents I think I\nknow what's in it I hope I know what's\nin it it's going to be so\ngood tracksmith came out with this new\npiece of apparel it's what it is oh yeah\nit is actually\nthat man yes they're running bibs what\nsize are those dude that does look big\nlooks big no it's a small look I mean\nthey come up to your armpits and you got\npockets in the back like a it's like a\nreverse is it like a reverse that\nactually is kind of cool basically like\nthe same thing you'd wear if you went\nskiing or cycling yeah except for no no\nuh shammy yeah I don't know the pocket I\nthink would be cooler front like a\nsweatshirt like on the bottom that's\nwhat I was trying to figure out do you\nwear what do you mean on the bottom like\nyour do you wear underwear when with\nyour no I think it's just normal tights\nlike you don't wear anything underneath\nI don't wear any do you no man\nokay are you a never nude um\nbut they what's a never nude it's from\nArrested Development Tobias fun uh\nthere's dozens of them but so you're\ngoing to wear a t-shirt under or a long\nsleeve or whatever shirt under that and\nthat's it yeah I think I guess so that's\nkind of weird dude I dare you to run\naround with not a jacket over the top of\nthat just a long sleeve shirt that's how\nthey model\nitas I'll do it on Christmas yeah how\nelse you going to model it like you\ncan't show it with a jacket over cuz\nthen you can't see it and if you wore a\ntop over it would just look like normal\nrunning tights right so you got to wear\nunderneath Farmer John I I will say I\ndon't know I don't understand the\nutility of these versus a normal pair of\nrunning tights it keeps you warmer\nallegedly allegedly I mean so does a\nthicker like or a light jacket yeah but\nthis makes it real challenging if you\never have to go to the bathroom the\nbathroom putting them on oh dude I wish\nit had a flap in the back like old uh\ncartoons where they had the just good\nthe ouse and pull that flap down yeah\nthis is I love tracksmith but this is an\nunnecessary I don't know what's waiting\nsee what Robbie says maybe it's the new\nfavorite thing yeah we got to test it\nout dude you should run with no shirt on\nunderneath it's just the\nbib it's illegal in some countries it\nlook like look like Bor B\nass Carl's and Carl now has switched\nsides he's into it\nyeah he's going to cut the legs off\nit'll just be a banana hammock with the\nstraps\nyeah I like it all right well I'll try\nit out I did actually run in the Fels\nturtleneck this past yesterday actually\nwhen it was very like 15\ndegrees and uh it was like I thought it\nwas 20 was it it was in Pennsylvania you\nwere that was a mistake there was\nactually I just wore that with a light\nMarino layer over top of that it was it\nwas perfect\nmy question though is like you ran in\nthat mauno shoe that we all like which\non my ratings on the you know I'm trying\nto get more accurate with the rating\nsystem for the videos yeah and I felt\nlike I put it almost close to like\nyellow and I think it's a really good\nshoe but because of the way that we rate\nthings now um it'll it'll be interesting\nbecause everybody likes it you like it\nme likes it I like it but I was thinking\nyou were in colder temps did it affect\nthe um I didn't\nI feel like it's such a soft foam that I\ndon't feel like it really did I was a\nlittle nervous because the first there\nwas a couple inches of snow on the\nground so the first couple miles of it's\nlike a you know where we went running\nyeah I recognized your Strava map I was\nlike oh that's where we went yeah for\nRobbie's bachelor party that's not a\nbachelor party yeah midlife grais\nbachelor party didn't it feel like a\nbachelor party Carl it kind of was in a\nway\nuh we had like yeah we had Robbie's mom\nand uh Justine arsing yeah that was it\nyeah my mom wasn't hanging out the whole\ntime she's she helped with the food but\nanyways just a little dancing\nleft she still got it she still got\nit the and my uncle brought his stripper\nraccoons with it was good yeah the\ntassels were amazing yeah how do you\ntrain a raccoon to do that I don't know\nyou can trust me um but they yeah so\nthere's snow on the ground I was running\nat first in straight snow I was like\nthis is a horrible idea um and then you\ngot to the gay snow yeah yeah and it was\nsuper colorful and all all was good no\nit was then the crush gravel was showed\nup and it was fine uh but yeah it was I\nwas wearing those tracksmith ndo tights\nwhich are like those without the\nsuspenders yeah pretty much well they're\nyou know how they're almost like a wet\nsuit yeah I get the worst uh chaing\ngrundle CH from those and I just take a\nwhole handful of snow and shove it down\nwith tights no that would make it worse\nyeah that's not the answer believe it or\nnot it actually helped what all right\nyeah I don't understand that somebody\nwho's a scientists in our audience maybe\ncan help with this I can wear like the\nshort\ntights yeah pretty much guaranteed to\nget grundle chafe uhhuh but I can wear\nregular tights and pretty much be fine\noh weird maybe it's just a certain cut\nany short typ or is it because the\nweather that maybe I'm sweating a little\nmore when you're wearing the shorts I\ndon't know that's probably what it is\nbut I there's nothing rubbing there I\ndon't understand what's causing the\nfriction I don't know some sort of yeah\nmaybe there's it's antimatter or\nsomething dark matter\nyeah uh but I I do like it when it's\nsuper cold out like today this morning\nthat was too cold for me she just as\nlong as after you get past that first\nmile me didn't she came back in her skin\nwas red I don't I don't think I was\nwearing warm enough stuff actually I\nthat's probably why my upper body was\nfine I was wearing the new rabbit jacket\nthey just sent called warm up and go I\nthink that's what it's called yep sorry\nrabbit and that sounds about right and\nit was good so my like upper body was\nfine but yeah my legs felt like I Les I\nhave to say the rabbit tights I think\nTraxx makes a great tight but the rabbit\npocket tight oh is also one of my\nfavorites for the winter that's actually\nprobably my second favorite especially\nwhen it's getting cold yeah is it\nthicker it's thicker yeah which is funny\nbecause they're from California yeah but\nthat is one thing they do really well is\nit the trail tights I\nthink I I I think they mine are just the\npocket tights yeah I don't know I don't\nknow they are though I wear those all\nthe\ntime and trying to think what else\nwas it is sometimes it's hard to dial in\nthose temperatures but when you do is\nit's it's great I don't know but I nice\nI will tell you this we've been\nrecommending those car hard gloves yeah\nand I wore those the other day when it\nwas 20\u00b0 cuz I'm like 20\u00b0 too warm one\nyeah and when I I stopped to change my\nmusic cuz I had like this this new punk\nrock playlist and I was like not vibing\non it so I stopped to change the music\nhad to take the gloves off trying to get\nthem back my hands back in cuz my hands\nwere a little bit like not even that\nsweaty but just a little bit trying to\nget them back in yeah was nearly\nimpossible I felt like it was like two\nthings of rubber trying to go past each\nother it's like I know what you're\ntalking about actually but yeah those\nare for running yeah it's almost has to\nbe below 10\u00b0 today would have been a\ngood day for it I think yeah I had\nmittens on and I was still cold well the\ngood news is I think you got a pair now\nfor Christmas okay Thomas can't really\ngood with the with the surprises really\ncan't\nresist surprise oh man we should have\njust brought them in for the show this\nat that point I think they're probably\nfrom M's mom um just open Amazon package\neven\nbetter um yeah but\notherwise what else has been going on\nwell I wanted to since this is our last\nshow of the Year recap the Year talk\nabout some fun stats hey before we get\ninto that can we talk about a show that\nwe watched uh well we watched another\nChristmas movie but besides that we\nwatch what Christmas movie red\none red one yeah what is red one the one\nwith the rock last night B oh yeah it\nwas I thought it was about a Santa Claus\nit red one oh it really red one is Santa\nClaus okay so by the way it also sounds\nlike a Russian spy movie the dude who\ndoes those State Farm commercials is\nlike Santa Claus in this okay you looked\nup his name JK something yeah uh I\nforgot oh yeah from dude the drumming\nmovie dude is strapped yeah oh really\nripped and apparently he started working\nout when he was like 61 for a movie or\nsomething he's he had he like remember\nhe had to like lose a bunch of weight\nfor this role and then he wanted to gain\nit back so he started this like strength\nroutine oh and he got jacked what was\nthe what was the drumming movie Whiplash\nyeah and I don't know if I is that good\nyeah he's like intimidating in that\nmovie okay so it's a great movie he gets\njacked and he's playing side by side\nwith the rock so you know look like you\ngot any muscles at all next to the rock\nis impressive yeah dude's 69 wow man we\nlooked up everything that's cool we know\nhis background the movie on the other\nhand that was ter it had a lot of Rotten\nTomatoes 30% Rotten Tomatoes\nit earned him yeah I mean hot Froot hot\nFrosty's been the Talk of the Town is it\ndid you watch it I haven't yet but I\nheard I heard people talk about it at\nparties all kinds of stuff oh yeah I\nthink it's so no we haven't out there\nthat it's it's almost so bad it's good\nyeah kind of thing but yeah I think it\nhelps that that guy is also jacked in\nthe movie yeah so man Jack he's shredded\nyeah shredded he's shredded jul Julian\nsalad um soy boys are out jacked and\nshredded is in that is true we also May\nso I started I go on Prime TV to watch\nthe Beast show oh yeah and that's what I\nwanted to talk about and uh I I start\nwatching I'm like I actually think me\nwould like this uhhuh so I me was about\nto go out on a run I was like hey come\nhere check this out cuz I won't watch\nion I won't watch this if you like it\nuhuh I'll wait till we can watch it\ntogether\nMeg was glued to her seat and so we were\nlike all right good I hate how much I I\ncouldn't stop watching it I was like\nthis is so dumb and I was like but I\ncan't stop watching it no it's amazing\nthe psychological game he comes up with\nis so messed up I was telling Thomas I\nwas like does he have a degree in\nPsychology like where does this come\nfrom I'm sure he has Consultants that\nare like this is what will happen if you\ndo this because that they so when I I'm\nPsychology major and throughout\nCollege they like they did all these\ntests after World War II to find out why\nthe German public would go along with\nlike extermination of the Jews and they\ndid all these tests of like obeying\nauthority figures and doing what you're\ntold and we are kind of messed\nup yeah people yeah but like the the\nfact that there was such high emotion so\nearly on was\ncrazy well I think when people have that\nidea that just that seed is planet that\nyou could have $5 million yeah I guess\nwe should tell people who don't know\nwhat we're talking about what the\npremise of the show is so Mr well first\nof all who's Mr Beast I mean if you\ndon't know who Mr Beast is you probably\nshouldn't be listening to this yeah but\nno he's the most he's the biggest\nYouTuber of all time he has like 300\nmillion subscribers just\nridiculous but I don't know I would say\nprobably more kids watch it but teens\nbut at this point I feel like most\npeople know I think I don't know well\nmaybe especially after this show which\nyeah yeah just started what is it even\ncalled Beast games Beast games so he's\ndoing the largest game show in history\nwhich has a $5 million grand prize and\ngiving away tons of more money like\nMillions every day and there's a\nthousand contestants it starts out with\na thousand but it goes down pretty fast\nyeah so you start weeding out uh the\ncontestants pretty quickly but the games\nand everything they're ridiculous the\nthe people who like self-identified to\ndrop out that that part was the craziest\npart for me I think like I yeah that\nwasn't so interesting to me and I was we\nwere waiting for like the people that\nsacrific themselves for this whole other\nteam to win like I was expecting Mr\nBeast to be like yeah here's a or here's\na prize and it was just like bye I\nwonder if they come back later in the\nshow but I wouldn't be surprised if they\ndon't yeah I've only watched the first\nepisode they had to eliminate a thousand\nI mean it's it starts with a thousand\npeople I doubt those people are coming\nback the other thing that I thought was\ncrazy is the people that informatically\nwere like I won't take the deal I won't\ntake the deal I won't take the deal and\nthen they take the deal like and you're\nlike you just screwed everybody everyone\non your team yeah I\nmean like people are inherently selfish\nand terrible people I feel like like\nthat guys falls apart quickly like you\nsaid with the\nwhole self survival is there's two parts\nto it though you feel like when you\nstart cracking you're like if I'm\ncracking then someone else is going to\nthere somebody else will crack and this\nis my opportunity CU like right now they\nended on the second episode with like a\ncliffhanger I haven't seen a second one\nyet I'm waiting to watch with my kids I\nwon't tell you what happens but it's a\ncliffhanger and it's getting to a point\nwhere you\nknow someone's going to fold and it's\ngoing to eliminate an entire team of\npeople I mean the worst one for me was\nwas and we can move on after there is a\nMr be cuz he he does all these kinds of\ngames on his show at other points but he\nhad two people living together for I\nthink several months and they were in\nthe same room I remember you telling us\nabout this yeah and then at the very end\nhe gave him the chance to steal the\nother person's money like right when\nthey were leaving the room like they\nwere each going to get $500,000 or\nsomething and he was like you have 30\nseconds to steal the other person's\nmoney I was like dude that's messed up\ndid of them take it they didn't like but\nyou know they would never see each other\nagain they could it's pretty yeah but\nyou got to live with that for the rest\nof your life I know but and the\n$500,000 I mean your taxes T be taking\nwith taxes but anyway so it that that is\nentertaining that was I was looking\nforward to watching that the thing is\nthat his premises are so simple mhm that\nyou're like why isn't anybody done this\nbut it's the resources he has yeah he\nbuilt a city well what I love about him\nis that the whole rock and too he's been\nH he's just having fun and so he's like\nif he makes money he puts it back into\nhaving more fun that's what I love about\nhim so much is that he he doesn't\nbecause he's definitely had a buyout\noffers from you know networks or\ncompanies but he literally just loves\nwhat he does\nand he doesn't do it for the money at\nall like he just pours everything right\nback into it which is why it's so\nsuccessful and he's partly autistic\nstick I'm pretty sure like I think he's\neven said that they did they did have\nproblems like my son was telling me that\num one of the guys was got in trouble\nfor messaging little boys oh yeah oh\nyeah I remember that he's not he's no\nlonger on the show that makes\nsense um I mean but at this point Mr be\nhas got to be worth a ton he's got\nchocolate brand well just his brand\nvalue the day he's got restaurant stuff\nhave you ever looked it up yeah I did I\ndid when we were watching and I forget\nwhat it said what I thought with genius\nis what he did during um Co where he 500\nmillion put his Burgers into other\npeople's oh yeah restaurants yeah no\nhe's he's smarter whoever his team\nis but anyways uh so yeah that that's\nbeen cool\nand yeah what did I I had too much\ncaffeine yesterday and sometimes I'll\nwake up that's\ndo you know when you you wake up the\nmiddle of night and you can't go back to\nsleep why did you have so much caffeine\nI don't know I was just drinking stuff\nwith caffeine in it like all day and\nnight Monster Energy I had a couple\nthese of coffee and then I had some Diet\nDr Pepper in the afternoon and that\nusually in conjunction I don't do well\nwith caffeine Dr Pepper has his caffeine\nmhm yeah and then so I woke up in the\nmiddle of night and I was thinking about\nyou know all this stuff probably that\nwe're doing now and you just start\nthinking about everything in life yeah\nthat's the ones where I wake up and Mak\nlike why did you get up and I'm like cuz\nI just knew I was up like yeah there's a\ncertain level of alertness I almost I\nalmost was there and then I was managed\nto fall back asleep but I I for some\nreason I think I had this dream about a\ncat like a kitten type cat kitty cat\nyeah and and I had this idea in my head\nthat I couldn't let go of which\nwas if if you found the two biggest\nhouse cats in the world\nokay and started what what size are what\nwould you consider the biggest house cat\nlike a large Tom cat like um like this\nbig right or those cats that you like\nthat are like I one of those that look\nlike leopards yeah no these are just I'm\ntalking like they are domesticated type\ncat talking a big big fat cat like\nGarfield yeah yeah and you started and\nyou bred them could you eventually well\nif they're two Tom Cats you can't or\nwhat's the Tam cat what's the opposite\nof a tom cat I think just a female cat a\nmom cat so if you take those and you\nwould breed them to create bigger Cats\nCould you ever reach the size of a tiger\nno over time I mean you could probably\nget a giant cat yeah like you could\nmanipulate into larger and larger cats\nbut it would probably like have like\nhealth issues you know how humans over\ntime have gotten taller yeah so I'm\ntalking about if you did this over\ncenturies could you take a normal house\ncenturies they reproduce a lot faster\nthan us and if you we ours is naturally\nthrough selection happen we could\nartificially select for them and so so\nit could happen yeah I think you could\nthat's they do that like that's have you\nheard I just want to see if you could\nhave a house cat that was as big as a\ntiger they mix uh Buffalo with Buffalo\nwith regular like bows and and steer oh\nand they got that what is it called like\nthe like a liger it's kind of like that\nit's a it's a very hearty like big bowl\nthing bread with bread for skills and\nMagic yeah okay well anyway sorry that\nwas ridiculous but I I was legitimately\nthinking about that 4:00 a.m. and\nwondering how if that could have be ACH\nI like how that's what you're thinking\nabout when you get up you're like yeah I\nwas thinking about working today and\nmostly it it's spun it's spun out of\ncontrol well I will tell you there's a\nbunch of cats behind the hair's Teeter\nso you could probably start there and a\nbunch of animal food well yeah oh do you\nget so we're driving around there there\nare bags of dog food they must like\nexpire and then they just put it out by\nthe dumpster oh like the Petco yeah bags\nI'm talking like bags no way and I was\njust like like it's like hundreds and\nprobably thousands of dollars worth of\ndog I would dumpster dive that well I\nwas thinking what do you do with expired\ndog food who'd eat it it's a dog I'm\nprettyy sure I I thought you were just\nsaying for yourself like yeah out like\nit could be camping food yeah I mean\nit's kibble dude it's F you think your\ndog is going to put up a fight if you\nthrow down\nthe it's not it's the same the\nexpiration dates are suggestions always\nthat's true we've talked about this\nthat's that's just\nscience all right first check in man\nyear comes after your fast but this is\ngreat because you have the start of 2025\nto make some new habits and maybe go\nafter some new goals so this is a\nperfect time if you you know want to go\nafter a mileage goal or maybe start\nlifting weights to you know help out\nwith your running this is the time to\nset those goals and uh kind of make an\neffort to do\nit all right guys element is still a\nsponsor of this podcast but for a\nlimited time they're offering their\nchocolate medley ooh that SS pretty\ndelicious you know it's not like the\nyou're not going to put that in your\nbubbly water no you could could you\ncould uh you want it heated up I think\nyeah some hot water with either the\nchocolate mint the chocolate chai or the\nchocolate raspberry I've heard it's\npretty good in coffee too you could also\nput it in your coffee okay would you do\nit before your run yeah okay some hot\ncoffee some chocolate medley I do like a\nmocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also\nour offer is still available so you can\ngo to element.com\nthedrop and get a free element sample\npack do you know if the sample pack\nwould have this chocolate in yeah there\nyou go so go get them and\nenjoy are there really that cuz\nsometimes I'll drive back there just see\nthere's anything out there so my whole\ntrick now is like if you drive the\nnormal way you're supposed to drive in\nthat parking lot I always no this has\nalways been my trick I always go behind\nyeah so that we have a shopping center\nnear us and the parking lot is clear\nclearly designed by people who designs\nparking lots it's like the Hunger Game\nparking lot yeah and it's just horrible\nlike we saw somebody hit a boulder in\nthat parking line and rip open the side\nof their car it's a bad design I say so\nyeah so I started driving behind and\npopping up the the back yeah you were\nall ending that oh yeah that's been cuz\nI used to ride my bike kind of back\nthere just checking things out and then\nI realized this is way faster to do this\ngo drive past the Tesla Chargers yeah\nwhich that's a weird scene back there oh\njust people hanging out in their cars I\nthink they're all Uber drivers or\nsomething just charging while they're\nyeah sitting waiting yeah but um you\ncan't look in those dumpsters though\nthere's too many people driving past\nthese are but the dog bags are outside\nof the dumpster that must just stacked\nup man that's crazy I hope someone does\nget those cuz presumably they wouldn't\nbe that out of date I'm wondering if\nlike even the people that like even if\nyou're the garbage guy you like oh bags\nGiant and I'm talking those giant bags\nlike the it's I don't know how many\npounds that' be like 50 lbs yeah 30 lb\nthat seems like too much 30b maybe of\ndog food like in a big\nsack I don't know man I'm sure if you\nlook in the dumpster there's some\nanimals too but oh I hope not but anyway\nthere's cats living back there and so we\ncould try that experiment see if we can\nmake a giant cat yeah the cat\nSituation's out of control in general\ntoo many cats they're they're an\ninvasive invasive species cats yeah\nhouse cats they're they're killing bir\npopulations at unprecedented rates do\nyou have any stats to back this up I I\nyeah I have looked these stats up\nrecently and they're it's it's out of\ncontrol there needs there should be some\nsort of I think Robbie should get a\nranger outfit and just walk\naround City Stun Gun jur Hill and just\nbe like I'm the I'm now the urban Ranger\nI bet you could and no one would stop\nyou no no if you had a if you had just a\nbadge yeah and like all green outfit\neverybody think oh you are give him your\nuh Adidas media vest' be good to go like\nthink about it what what Authority like\nif you saw a dude walking by and he had\nlike oh yeah State Park badge and like a\nright little thing you'd be like oh yeah\nyeah and in Baltimore nobody knows\nwhat's going on in the government anyway\nso they would you could convince them\nprobably seen a lot of anti Baltimore\nInstagrams in my feeds now why like\npeople like filming like they go to like\nthe crappiest areas and film like the\nboarded up houses and stuff and they're\nlike don't visit Baltimore oh\nthat's at first I got mad but like I'm\nlike no maybe our people need to see\nthis that this is what's being projected\nout there and this is what I mean we got\nto fix this stuff I'm pretty sure\npeople's opinions on Baltimore are\nsolidified at this point yeah but like\nat this point we keep I don't want to\nget I mean I agree with you I agree with\nyou there I mean yeah there should be\nsome sort of pressure to change things\nor make things better yeah but there's a\nlot of layers to\nthat\n[Music]\num yeah at least our cars haven't gotten\nstolen this week what a week years\nthat's our that's our no your yours is\nthe one that gets broken into you got to\nstop leaving stuff like owner manuals in\nyour car I know I just got a new license\nplate and I uh I'm like why do I even\nput my registration card in there I know\nit's just going to get taken out at some\npoint but whatever um yeah I'm excited\nfor so Meg let's go over some of these\nyear end stats um not year out stats\nlike do you remember everything we did\nyeah I know I got to go through our\ntrips but okay podcast wise what do you\nguys think was our number one episode\nmaybe you already looked and saw\nactually hav't is it Boston Marathon\nyeah oh the Boston Marathon\nrecap fans who like the drop also like\nThe Joe Rogan Experience Alli on the Run\narmchair expert with Dak Shepard nobody\nasked us with desen Cara and the cious\nmag podcast okay first off we need a\ndifferent list The Joe Rogan Experience\nis skewed because it's literally the\nmost popular podcast just across genres\nso I feel like that's going to be anyone\nwho listens to any podcast almost it's\ngoing to be also the number one or in\nthe top five whereas and it's such a\nhuge podcast it's so much bigger than\nany any other one and then was then did\nwe turn off the heat cuz it's getting\ncold down here dude there's no heat in\nhere\nokay go ahead uh cuz even with the heat\non it was so it's still cold okay um the\nAlli on the run that makes sense yeah I\nmean the rest are well armchair expert\nwith Dak sheer one and then obviously\ncious and do and Cara you know what has\nfallen off that I used to really enjoy\nis the um smart list yeah smart list you\nknow what the smart smart list podcast\nhas become almost unlistenable with the\namount of ads in it is that the problem\nit's unbelievable it's there's so many\nads uh even I think Conan's podcast has\na lot too now but the smartless one for\nsure is just so many that it's I hate\nskipping through it so often and they're\nlong too it's like five minutes of\nads um I don't really listen to that\nmany podcasts but um I don't know what\nhappened I was I might have been in my\ncar and I\nwanted oh I know what happened I was\nlistening to the BBC and they had this\num thing on this like yoga school that\nwas actually trafficking people and so I\nstarted listening to that and when that\nwent off the next podcast that came up\nwas a Joe Rogan podcast and I hadn't\nreally listen to um Joe Rogan uh I was\nlike well you know I'll just check this\nout yeah let it roll and I was like oh\nthis is actually pretty interesting it\nwas the one about um the drones and\nwhat's going on with the oh\nyeah yeah I feel like I've listen I\nlisten to some of that one just CU I'm\ninterested in the Drone stuff but what's\nyour theory what's\nhappening I mean I'd say it's pretty\nmuch it's definitely us\nbut I don't know what the purpose\nis I know this because I I've I've I\nhave a couple friends who have are in\nspace to know and they're just like I\ncan't talk about it so it's like that\nmeans it's a thing but they can't\nthey're like we can't say anything it's\nthat uh I can neither confirm nor deny\nyeah\nso you know I don't know what it is but\nit's maybe a new shoe release that is\nunder embargo yeah that's what it is\nit's a new it's going to be a box from\nNike that you're going to open up and\nhave a shoe inside of it yeah just\nsending them out to influencers in the\nNew Jersey\narea with we can't we can't talk about\nit my parents said they saw one over the\nnear our farm on two separate nights\nexact same location and it wasn't like\nstart like wasn't there the night before\nthe one after like I would miss it cuz\nwe're normally watching hot Frosty stuff\nnight so it would go right by my house\nthey're proba knocking on her window and\nwe're\nlike's barking we're like shut up try to\nwatch Hot\nFrosty what if the Drone was trying to\nwatch Hot Frosty though well maybe\nthey're like hey they figured us out\nwe're the snow aliens yeah give us that\nmagic\nscarf wow um okay so website wise we had\nabout five million visitors which is\ncool top pages five wait you just blew\nright over that this is the stuff that\nblows my mind cuz like I can picture\nlike when we get a few thousand people\nwatching a video or watching this I go\nokay over time I can understand how that\nhappens you know there's interest in a\nparticular issue or something like that\nbut 5 million visits unique visitors to\nthe\nwebsite that's that's\ninsane yeah that's that is that's a lot\nof\nhum um this is what's most insane though\noutside of obviously like the home page\nyou mind if we got a dollar for\neverybody who visited that'd be nice\nyeah maybe we should set up a gofund me\nto open on our page yeah just if you\nvisit pay $1 or yeah to open this page\nyou must submit a dollar like Wikipedia\nI want to punch the screen every time I\nopen Wikipedia and they're begging and\nthey're begging me for money yeah they\ndon't even write that stuff oh and they\nhave and they're like there's a whole\nthing with that's a whole different\nstory\nanyways um but so anyway outside of\nobviously the homepage and stuff the\nmain pages that were visited and this\none's GNA make one person extremely\nhappy is it a person with wide feet yeah\nnumber one is the best wide foot running\nshoes number two was sakon endorphin\nspeed 4 okay then hokok 6 as6 Nova blast\n4 and then best running shoes of 2024 so\nfar okay makes sense what's crazy to me\nabout that is you're going to see one\nTrend kind of go across and it's the\nspeed\nfour like this shoe they must I didn't\nreally how popular thato they're not\nselling this like on a conveyor belt\nyeah they should be because it's across\nthe board on all our stuff and I didn't\nI don't even think of it as like I know\nyou guys love it but to me it's like an\nokay\nshoe yeah yeah that's a good one yeah I\nthink it probably just it works yeah\nit's so versatile okay um so YouTube\nstats 6 million views in 2024 that even\ncrazier 6 million people look at our\nfaces yeah and then feel sorry for them\nthe top videos are always usually like\nour top shoes so race day was one of\nthem 15 most exciting the two shoes that\nstood out though which I wouldn't have\nexpected was the New Balance Rebel V4\nthat was our third most popular video so\nwait give us some numbers cuz like when\nwe were looking at it I was like Blown\nAway by the the best running shoes for\nrace day in 2024 had just under 200k\nviews 200,000 views best running shoes\nfor race day yeah oh wow and then the\nsecond one was the 15 most exciting\nrunning shoes of 2024 that 120k okay New\nBalance Rebel V4\n92k 15 favorite running shoes of 2024\n75k and then the S indorfin speed 4 came\nin at Fifth Place most popular yeah\nthat's impressive so I'm guessing\nthey're selling a lot of\nthose or people are just looking at it\ncould go either way yeah I'm just that\nis that's interesting though I I I\nwouldn't have expected that what I\nthought was interest because you pulled\nup Instagram stuff yeah get into that\nlike there there's two brands that are\ndefinitely hot with our audience and I\nwould say two three years ago it would\nhave been different brands uhhuh yeah so\njust looking at like photos and that\ntype of content the most popular was A6\nacross the board like the top three but\nthen the second top three second three\nwere all New Balance shoes wow yeah A6\nin New Balance on top and at least with\nour audience Thomas loves the most\npopular reels of 2024 I do just the shoe\nthe New Balance shoe yeah pressing which\nit's still for 2024 those are the top\ntwo but here's the crazy thing it's the\noriginal one and then the Remake that's\nridiculous the original has close to 2\nmillion views on it own which is so\nsilly yeah that's insane and then yeah\nsome unboxings and stuff but nothing too\ncrazy um in terms of that yeah I was\nlooking at our our um our trips from the\nyear and it was pretty wild name all the\nplaces that we went\nokay Orlando La that was just me Boston\nVenice nurg Brooklyn back to New York\nLake Tahoe for two\nevents uh slow Nashville Boston Columbus\nSt Petersburg Ridgefield Paris Berlin\nChicago New York Austin\ndude hurts my head We've Been Everywhere\nman yeah worldwide no that's a song I\nwas going Happ oh so yeah it was it was\nquite a year very eventful but what like\nwhat were what were some of your\nfavorites I know we kind of touched on a\non our individual podcast but yeah in\nterms of like favorite work\nevent what do you think it\nwas I mean Olympics has to be up there\nfor sure ah this it's so hard because I\nalways love Boston there's just a\ndifferent vibe there like it's almost\nlike the running event is industry\npeople that you get to see Boston is\nlike running Community it's like you see\neveryone you see the industry people you\nsee the athletes you see it's just like\neven if and I would tell anybody even if\nyou're not running Boston even if you're\nyeah not and maybe you may never run\nBoston who cares come to be part of the\nit's like a celebration of running yeah\njust there's an entire street that is\ndedicated to all your favorite Brands\nthere's uh spectating is just as much\nfun as running it's yeah it's\ndefinitely like a carnival for\nwithout the dunking booth unfortunately\nfor uh for runners we got to get RAB a\ndunking booth I know one one of these\nevents it's going to work out yeah it so\nI really love that but then for me\nvisiting Germany and going to the Adidas\nheadquarters there's two like I when I\nwent to the Nike headquarters I was like\nwow this is what like this is what where\npeople get to work for and it's like\nreally impressive and I felt the same\nway when we went to Adidas that it was\njust so\nmindblowing and seeing the archives and\nthe different stuff and and just being\nin in nurg I thought was such a\nbeautiful city um especially if you're\nnot on trial there yeah it's always a\ngood or thing to just visit probably\nyeah there's a couple times you wouldn't\nwant to be there but uh it was a be\nbeautiful city I mean that was a fun\ntrip yeah I kind of I kind of a little\nbummed uh I mean it was just situation\nat the time but it seemed like it was\ncool for sure like it was so different\nthan Berlin right it's kind of like you\nknow how people would be like New York\nand they think of America I think people\nthink of Berlin and they think of\nGermany yeah but nurg was more like\ngoing to\nlike a German Village I don't know how\nokay it was like it seemed like a\nsmaller town and\nlike Cape Cod or like if you went to\nlike somewhere in New England that was\nyeah nice uh like not New York City you\nknow it it was still a city but it just\nhad\nthis like a charm to it like theur\ncobblestone streets and which that thing\nmust have gotten hammered with I don't\nknow how they rebuilt everything to look\nlike it's been there for centuries but\nalmost looked like probably Deep Creek\nMaryland yeah just like it pretty much\num and then the Olympics were just so\nsurreal it's even hard for me even now\nto wrap my head around the Olympics like\nfor me that was such a\num you know what was my favorite part I\nthink\nwas I thought the whole Olympics We are\nthe world [\u00a0__\u00a0] was like not a thing\nlike I was\nlike thing they do on TV oh the world's\ncome together everyone's in unity but it\nactually felt like that when you were\nthere like everyone was super happy the\neveryone's from all over the world\ndifferent countries but when you're in\nthe stands and like walking about\neveryone's just super positive even I\nthink Paris in general felt like that\nand I was like man that actually was a\nreal thing which is cool and it is it's\na testament to like how much you can't\nget fooled by like the media and just by\npolitics that like when we're all\ntogether as people and it's sport\ninvolved and I think that's why Kip\nchogi is always like if everybody ran\nwe'd all get along just fine except for\nyakob b or britson and Josh kry Josh kry\num yeah but it it is such a like fun\nenvironment of just yeah there's you\ndidn't care if someone was like the you\nknow rooting for Greece over here or you\nknow a different country over here there\nwas no animosity there was no it was\nmore friendly than even like a soccer\nmatch or a um like a football game yeah\nwell because I think it's like these are\nthe best of the best athletes like it's\njust cool to spectate any of them\nbecause these are like the best most\ntalented humans in the world so I think\nit's just exciting to be in that\nenvironment and like yeah I don't know I\nthink I would have liked Venice a little\nbit better if it had been warmer I think\nI was cold the whole time I was and if\nthey didn't lose our luggage yeah yeah\nit was Venice was cool though that and\nthat was the first time I been to Italy\nso yeah I'm just saying I would have\nliked it more like I I liked it for sure\nbut just even\nmore I still can't get over the fact\nthat you can't get hung over on Italian\nwine like I'm not sure that's 100%\naccurate dude it's true it's it's facts\nokay I Googled it too and there's so\nmany things on Reddit and and person but\nyou can buy that wine here I think they\nstill\nadd more soft fights to preserve it if\nthey're shipping it here I don't know\nman they I and but like but that\nexplains why we had prco at every single\nmeal dude I yeah and you don't you feel\nfine the next day like no\nmatter how much you drank I never had if\nI drank that amount of wine or whatever\nin the US it the running\nevent yeah okay that was a little above\nand beyond the call Call of Duty\nthere Robbie became a some remind me\nnever to do a dinner with tasting again\nI think next time we go to Italy we have\nto test out this Theory and see how much\nyou can drink I'm pretty sure we tested\nit out not to that extent but we\ndefinitely had some good nights yeah I\nalso thought California was a really\ngood trip the western states and the um\nBroken Arrow like I thought that was\ngood for\nlike I like the group of people that we\nare with yeah was good no I feel just\nthe pretty much that's why Taylor's\ncoming on fulltime because I was like\nyeah\nyou're yeah you're kind of cool to hang\nout with Carl needs someone to go in the\nhot tub\nwith does he though Western States was\nalso cool cuz I I've never experienced\nit like firsthand and you always see\nit happening on your news feed or\nwhatever but actually being there it was\nit was just totally different and then I\nwas like so hooked and interested in the\npeople running that I was watching the\nYouTube all the way home on our flight\nand so yeah that was that was definitely\ncool what that was one of the craziest\nthings is that our flight left after the\nrace started yeah we got back to home\nlike all the way across the country and\nthen watch the finish and watch people\nfinishing the next day you you saw the\nrace start though like it wasn't like\nyour flight started when you saw this\nrace this guy Carl from the top of a\nmountain uh I'm trying to think of a\nalliteration for not Carl going up the\nmountain camera Carl camera no more like\nI'm trying like more like a billy go\nclimbing Carl climbing Carl uh he was\nthat morning was a long morning we\nclimbed up to the top it was the most\nbeautiful thing I've ever seen I was\nfreezing my ass off but it was worth it\nbecause the photos the photos just were\nI I don't know how you could take a bad\nphoto up\nthere second check in hope you're\nenjoying our recap I'm sure you're\nthinking about your year and kind of\nthinking back on all the good stuff that\nhappened and isn't it funny you tend to\nstart to forget the bad stuff and you\nstart to focus on the good stuff and I\nfound that that's always the way that at\nleast my mind works the further you get\naway from stuff the good stuff remains\nand the bad stuff goes away so if you\nhad a rough year let's hope that 2025 is\neven\nbetter all right guys let's talk about\nour sponsor Lagoon pillows all right\nlet's do it we've been using them for\nyears now still my favorite pillow ever\nand now's a great time to gift a pillow\ndo you ever remember sleep without a\nlagoon pillow under your head I mean\nwhen we travel and it's not great yeah I\nI felt like the last toe we were at it\nwas almost like someone rolled up some\nsocks and put it in the pillow to give\nit the stuffing socks and rocks yeah\nyeah well if you want a really great\npillow you can go to lagoons sleep.com\nbelieve there is a quiz right on that\npage just hit the button fill out your\ninformation say what you like what you\ndon't like and it'll populate the\nperfect pillow for you and if you use\nthe code believe at checkout you can\nalso\nsave um\nbut yeah and then just seeing the\nathletes come through and knowing that\nit was only the beginning of their trip\nhow many miles was that up that was like\nthree right not even three or four and\nthey still so they had 97 miles to go\nthey're all pumped up they're all\nfeeling good they're coming\nthrough it was it was pretty insane and\nthe fact that there was\nprobably 100 spectators at the top of\nthat mountain yeah just like cheering\nthese guys on like it's got to be\nanti-climatic after that because you\nclimb the mountain you get this big\ncheering group at the top of the\nmountain and then you've got 97 miles of\nno more people but they've got Crews and\nyeah it's not the same as like reaching\nthe top of the mountain and having to\nrun through a tunnel of people yeah but\num yeah that was sick that's cool and I\ndo have to give an update because the\npodcast went out uh with me telling you\nwhat I was excited about for 2025 one of\nthe things was something I'm not doing\nthe OC was sold out so we are Carl and I\nare not running the 35 mile race are you\nrelieved or sad\nuh yeah it there's a part of me that's\nlike okay yeah that's that's okay and\nthere's a part of me that's like oh\nthat's kind of like that was going to be\nsomething big we are doing a\n20K version which is also weird because\nI think it's actually only 15K but\nthey're listing as a 20K and they're\ngiving you the extra because they say\nthe vertical climb is so much that it's\nworth a 20K so it's just an arbitrary\nnumber well the other one was a 50k but\nit was 35 miles so I they're just like\nah this is close yeah I think it's like\nthat European thing yeah close enough\nyeah\nyeah\num yeah that's okay that's cool though\nso uh yeah Carl will be doing that\nTaylor myself we're we're all we are all\nsigned up and we'll be running that with\ncraft if you guys not the cheese not\nthis\nsingles I might also have Crafty car\nsingles with me yeah crafty car Carl\nthat's a good one yeah um if you guys\nhad to choose one brand of the year\nwould it be like in terms of\nmaybe overall best running shoes or most\nInnovative h i mean it's tough I would I\nwould\nsay the t uh like if you think of the\ntop I'm trying to think about the shoes\nthat came out trying think brand shoe\nbrands yeah I mean the top shoes that we\npicked out for most of our stuff were\nalways Adidas as6 and Hoka and New\nBalance I would say were our top I think\nHoka did some pretty cool\nstuff uh I mean Brooks honestly yeah I\nthink Brooks next year okay and I\nbrought the Brooks Hyperion\nElite for PB and which we'll talk about\nyeah I ran in that I I also feel like\nasex I would push into 2025 like I don't\nfeel like they did anything amazing this\nyear yeah they have amazing stuff coming\nthey were consistent this year yeah yeah\nI feel like Nike came is starting to\ncreep back from the depths true like\nthey've had some cool stuff especially\ntowards the end of year that's going to\nbe a 2025 yeah\num Adidas had some really good stuff but\nthat's also kind of coming 2025 see and\nI kind of feel weird about this because\nI do like our best of if it if we could\nhave included would have probably\nincluded two Adidas shoes that we didn't\ninclude the pro four which yeah but\ndoesn't come out till that one\ndefinitely doesn't come out till next\nyear so that hasn't even been on\nsale yeah you you have been able to buy\nit at like Expos and stuff just not not\nI mean Mass wait how did uh how did uh\nEric and get it no it has been on sale\nyeah\nwait right I think I was thinking the\nwhite color way um yeah no I guess I\nmean but it came out yeah right so it's\nall after Thanksgiving yeah but yeah if\nthey just released stuff in a month\nbefore they there Adidas's strategy for\nrelease is strange to so originally they\nwhen they came out and yeah you can buy\nthe pro for right now yeah you can but\noriginally it was supposed to be January\n1st yes and then then theel was supposed\nto be March which now it it like they\ndid a drop with dicks or whatever in\nsome running warehouse but this is\nconfusing to me cuz like okay where do\nyou want us to put this shoe yeah and we\nwe could have legitimately given it top\nmarks for 2024 now it's in 2025 plus you\nknow that we're going to see some crazy\nstuff in 2025 so if they just push those\nreleases up a little bit like or just\nhonestly if they would have just told us\noh it's dropping in first week of\nDecember I feel like we could have right\nafter Thanksgiving yeah but we didn't\nknow that before we put out our\nlists yeah what about\nSak uh they had some cool stuff towards\nthe end of the year is the Endorphin\nElite 2 on no that's March I think it's\nall\n2025 uh no not them yeah like they had\nsome okay stuff\nalthough I will say I didn't run in the\nTriumph\nor I did yeah and I've run in the ride\nand I like the ride it's fine but I\nthink that that Solomon shoe is a better\nversion of it the oh what's the Solomon\num Glide Max or no Arrow Glide yeah yeah\nit might be the arrow Glide two or three\nyeah three I thought that was same\nconcept same type of foam better shoe\nspeaking of someone asked me about they\ncan't remember they're a bigger Runner\nor they just needed some stability in a\nrace stoe and they were like what I I I\nI'm looking I'm running my first\nmarathon around four hours or something\nlike that I was like dude just get the\nslab Spectre and they said they took it\nout for 20 mile long run and it was\namazing oh nice like yeah like perfect\nit's made a few people's lists yeah for\nthe end of the year I Solomon's a\nsleeper I don't know how to get more\npeople to try them for their Road\nshoes but there's something weird that\nthey they kind of have this premium feel\nfor the trails and then they kind of it\ndoesn't carry over to the road for them\nyeah yeah like some of their shoes it's\na little Hit or\nMiss\num what about what about mauno is the\ncomeback shoe of the year I think what\nabout New Balance they've had some good\nstuff New Balance had some good stuff I\nmy favorite this year from them is\nprobably the rebel Pacer yeah the Pacer\nI did like the Pacer too I really liked\nthe new SC Trainer I know you guys\ndidn't as much yeah I was meum and I was\nsurprised some people like the ballast\nbut I thought I did it wasn't it was a\ngood shoe just I'm unsure of where it\nfits but I it's one of those ones I felt\nsimilar to the Endorphin trainer that\nit's like a shoe that's like is it worth\nlike oh you did the peba and stuff it\nfeel feels like a premium 1080 yeah but\nnot enough for me to go let me drop\nanother 50 bucks like I'd be like oh\nthis feels like the\n1080 yeah\ntotally\num trying to think what\nelse I like the newcomer we gave to\nmount Coast yeah I like their shoes they\nhave some cool stuff coming in they came\nin hot out of nowhere yeah I I think\num definitely Muno up and coming from\ntraditional brand that's been out of it\nfor a while Nike would also be on that\nlist\nyeah yeah\num I think 2025 might be a pretty fun\nyear for shoes and Brands it's I feel\nlike it's so I feel like some brands are\nin an in between year and then other\nones are turning the page you think like\n2026 is going to be I think so yeah I\ndon't know I think we're going to see a\ncouple fun things from asex this year\nyeah\nI'm I I actually I think we are you got\nto try that racer I I think this is\ngoing to be a big year for A6 yeah\nprobably I uh on the trail the trail\nside is Bonkers though the trail side's\ncoming out crazy like for 2025 just is\nit norta o5 2025 [\u00a0__\u00a0] Mar that's going\nto be ridiculous the people are going to\nlove that even the satisfy shoe looks oh\nyeah The Rocker super legit um when can\nwe post our video on The\nRocker that's until February or\nsomething okay or whenever they yeah\nit's weird cuz they put all the specs\nlike and all the details on their\nInstagram but just haven't shown a full\nphoto of the shoe I'm just put the shoe\nout there yeah um but it's not coming\ntill July oh oh it's not yeah oh that's\na ways away it's a pretty it's a pretty\nshoe yeah um and then\nthe I just so many trail trail shoe\nbrands are out there and coming out\nreally awesome stuff The North Face is\npretty much at the top creating some\ncrazy good shoes so I've seen some of\nthe new arc TK stuff and I don't know we\nknow that one of the designers that we\nreally loved from New Balance is there\nnow yeah but they're kind of getting\naway from what I thought was kind of\ntheir look which was that really\nclean like silhouette and matter of fact\nTaylor he had that slab black boot zip\nup thing I was like that looks to me\nlike I'm surprised that hasn't caught on\nwith like the fashion yeah probably will\nit's it's like a very cool looking uh\nwe're reviewing a couple of the arteric\nshoes right now yeah I saw Taylor posted\nthem and I'm like oh they're I'm\nwondering if these are ones that our guy\nis working on because they it looks\ndifferent than what we've seen in the\npast yeah I'm not sure I have no\nidea but yeah I think the trail scene is\ngoing to see some really cool stuff\nnormal um and there's so many Brands too\ncoming out and making Trail stuff do you\nthink that the trail side is easier than\nthe road side uh like what do you mean I\nfor me the dirt surfaces are more\nforgiving and a lot of times if you can\nmake a good upper that holds your foot\nover a midsole oh you don't have to get\nas crazy with the midsole and then you\njust have to make sure you have like a\nVRA mount soole on it and you're good\nyeah yeah but the problem is that I\nthink a lot of the brands want\nto take advantage of the moment with the\ncarbon plates and super Foams which is\njust very very hard to dial into the\ntrails like so many in the very\nbeginning you know a year or two ago\neveryone was trying to do that and it\nwas just a really crazy some disastrous\nshoes like uh the saky whatever was the\noh the one that fell apart theorin the\nEndorphin Trail the first one that fell\napart but the\nuh this why am I forgetting the the the\nnext version of it basically um and that\nwas just super unstable and crazy to run\nin and so it's very hard to to do I feel\nlike hok has done a good job with the\ntecton do you think it's harder to go\nfrom Trail\nshoe to legitimate Road shoe or is it\ntougher to go from Road shoe to a\nlegitimate Trail shoe oh like are you\ntalking about like Solomon going from\nTrail to Road or or even we're going to\nsee speedland moving into a road shoe\nyeah that one's exciting too we're\nwatching mounted Coast go from road to\nTrail yeah I don't it's weird because\nas6 kind of just slaps uh an outsole on\nsome of their\nshoes and I mean there's some other\nchanges too to some of their Trail stuff\nbut their their trail shoes are really\nsolid and nobody talks about them I\nthink because they don't Market them at\nall I don't think they care about yet\nthey really don't care but people really\nlove their trail shoes that try them out\nthe juko was a great shoe like that one\nwas one that I went out on the trails I\nwas only going to run a certain amount\nof miles and just kept going I was just\nlike oh this feels so good well I also\nfeel like that's kind of what I haven't\nworn the hookas in a long time but when\nI was running trails it was like I loved\nthe Hoka Road shoes and it just felt\nlike they put lugs on them and that was\nthe Challenger was the clip with like\nthat's I love that shoe in that yeah you\nI think you came in second place at hat\n50k in that shoe yeah I always wear\nthose shoes for hat because they work\nfor road too yeah but then that mafat X\nthat we saw at ter that's 50 mm stack\nheight I'm like does that does that\nreally need to be a thing on the trails\nI mean if you don't want to feel the\ntrail yeah I'd wear it\nyeah I don't know 12 something ounces 12\nand a half ounces oh another big\ncomeback brand and and it probably\ndoesn't feel like comeback cuz they're\nalready at the top for most of is Brooks\nI think that they finally yeah have\ndecided to join the party with some of\nthe tip of the spear product and then it\nseems like the rest of the product line\nis getting upgrades that are really nice\nI gave my glycerins to Carl to to review\nI know that you ran in the glycerin yeah\nI did you run it yet Carl yeah it's\nfreaking great shoe I've never say that\nabout a glister before I don't\nand uh I thought it was I loved it it's\nnot the glycerin Max but it's similar\nyeah build it's pretty high stack yeah\nit it just the glycerin Max yeah it's\nkind of ridiculous um but it's it feels\nthe same as the same phone they finally\ndialed in the the DNA flash V3 or\nwhatever to where it's like just really\nnice well it's got the Dual density yeah\nyeah I think that was a huge game\nchanger for but yeah I mean I think and\nespecially since they already have such\na\nbuiltin uh F you know not fan base but\nyou know just runners in general I think\nyeah they're set to wish they weren't a\nprivate company I thought they were uh\nbirkshire hathway I mean they're like\npart of that whole thing you can't you\ncan't I don't I I'm pretty sure they\ndon't have their own stock\nticker can you look that up be weird\nyeah birkshire hathway I'm surprised it\nwouldn't\nhave what do you want to know about them\ndo they have their are they are they\njust part of Brookshire hathway Holdings\nor do they have their own like stock\nticker are they publicly traded as I\nthink he's trying to say I think they I\nthink they might be publicly trated as a\nportf like in the whole portfolio but\nthat includes all of waren Buffett's\nHoldings Coca-Cola Walmart whatever no I\nthink it's just BG hathway it says it's\na holding company run by War yeah so\nit's like a conglomerate of a bunch of\nbunch of\nHoldings but yeah cuz they've like\nyear-over year are ridiculous 715\nbillion yeah it's the sixth largest\npublic company in the world yeah what is\nbshar pathway yeah it's\ninsane um okay if you guys had to choose\ntwo shoes you get one race day one\nWhatever daily trainer or Tempo whatever\nyou want it to be that came out in 2024\nwhat are you\npicking did you say one overall best One\nrace day shoe and one one other daily\ntrainer is\nshoe what are you choosing that came out\nin\n2024 it's so boring but i' I'd have to\ngo super blast to for one of them uh if\nthe evos is considered 24 it would be\nkind of a TP it' be a tough choice\nbetween those two for the daily trainer\nespecially knowing I could have a race\nday shoe if if I know I could have a\nrace day shoe then I'd probably go uh\nEvo and\nthen\num get a race stue but if it's super\nblast dude Adidas is going to sell so\nmany of that shoe it's insane like like\nforever and ever that's it almost might\nbe a problem because it's going to be\nlike you're gonna not want to get the\nshoe because people are going to be\nusing it for like lifestyle yeah and you\nbe like H but it yeah it's great um so\nwhat's your race day\nissue that came out this year\nyeah I know this sounds insane oh wait\nare you going no you can go if you got\nyours I I seriously love the diodora gar\ncarbon I know that came out this year\nyeah okay it's like February okay but I\nknow I only did one actual race was the\nCharles Charles and you know what I'm\ngoing to say about it uh may maybe for\nme I I need a little more topring oh\nyeah I kind of I don't know I just\nreally liked it maybe I just had every\nrun I had was great in it I don't know\nbut I mean that's what it is it's a\ngreat\nshoe where I would knock it is weight\nit's in the middle weight for my size 10\nand a half is like eight\nthree yeah but that's not too far I mean\nthat's you're right yeah it's in the 8.3\naverage I really like even though I\ndidn't race well I did do a a 10K in it\nthe I really like the the pro four the\nAdidas Pro four oh no I would put that\nif yeah I guess it just depends where\nyou put it okay so that we're not\nputting that this year um I would put\nthat I guess you could I mean either way\nif if I had the more room in the toe box\nwhere I could maybe half size up yeah I\nmean cuz I ran br and the turkey chop 5K\nwere I me had a pretty good day I like\nboth those and um I thought the a A6\nParis Edge was a phenomenal shoe yeah\nyeah I thought they did a great job with\nthat shoe and I\nlove so two of\nmy favorite races this year was the\nAnapolis half and then the cherry\nblossom\n10er and I wore The Edge and the uh\nsky for each of those and I love them\nboth I thought they were both great I\nthought the shoes performed really well\nI really like this was the first year I\nkind of stepped away from the\nalphafly where as much as I love it I\nkind of felt\nlike you could line up in some of these\nother shoes I still was getting really\ngood performance out of them without\nfeeling like I was wearing like a\nbazooka\nyeah what about oh yours the alphafly\nright M yeah I'm going to have to say\nAlpha fly 3 for race day and then this\nhas some recency bias to it but I think\nI'd get glycerin Max all\nright yeah I like that is crazy really\nyeah wow queen of kush yeah I like it\ndaily trainer though yeah I mean it\nprobably beat the super blast too but\nit's so hard to beat a shoe with that\nmuch cushioning that light\nthat just\nrolls yeah I will say I've been reaching\nfor the Nike uh was going to say Zoom\nxly six yeah I was going to say that's\nprobably another one and so that's a\ngood like that would be I never thought\nI'd be saying that but yeah the zoomfly\n6 is such a fun shoe Carl did you run in\nthat yet what' you think it was I did on\na treadmill because\noutside it was I mean it's great but I\ncan't actually all right so you can't\nreally hear Carl off but he said he ran\non treadmill cuz it's too cold out I\nagree with him I got on the treadmill\nthis morning I was like I went outside\nand regretted it yeah you came back\nlooking all like like had second degree\nburns all right final checkin man thanks\nfor hanging in there making it all the\nway to the third check in if you're out\nthere running keep hustling and uh we\ncan't wait to see what you do in this\nNew Year maybe we'll see you at one of\nour Events maybe we'll see you at the\ngrit party in January 11th who knows or\nmaybe we'll see you in Chicago or New\nYork or one of the other Majors so keep\nan eye out for us we'll keep an eye out\nfor you and hopefully you're having a\ngreat\n2025 all blistered\nup so we did you give your daily I don't\nuh I was going to say probably super\nBlast 2 but again I like the Adidas SL2\nI thought that was a great shoe but like\nit was also $130 shoe so if I had the\nchoice price not Factor yeah super blast\ntoo I I mean why else you would pick\nanything price is not a factor I like\nthe clo x one for daily training that\nwas that was fun yeah the I 280 $275 is\nwild though and I'd also throw I I\nreally enjoyed I did that extra\nbit of mileage in the rebel to get that\nreview after a bit I enjoyed the rebel\nMH I'm excited for I think the slight\nImprovement that you're making with a\nlittle bit more cushion under the\nforefoot is going to make it a little\nbit nicer um and they're also kind of\nstreamlining their like shoe lineup how\ndo you mean like how Nike just sort of\nredid their whole lineup it seems like\nthey might sort of streamline it in 2025\nokay not to that extreme but a little\nbit I mean do you think we'll see a SE\ntrainer\nfor I think it might turn into something\nelse oh I think I knew that\nbut that poror shoe cuz remember the\noriginal trainer the real squishy one\nyeah that like people loved that shoe\nand it was so unique in the space at the\ntime like we didn't have that yeah\nplated giant stack heavier training shoe\nI've been purging shoes and I can't get\nrid of that qu that one yeah that's one\nthat I can't get rid of I get it it is\nweird that is a weird thing when we so\npeople always ask us what we do with\nthis there's certain shoes that we hold\non to just\nbecause sentimental value or just\nthey're unique in the market or you know\na lot of times it's we keep you know a\npair or two from the previous version so\nwe can see the updates um and there is\nsome that just have why you holding on\nto it you're just like I don't know I\njust don't want to let it go yeah it it\njust seems like there's some shoes\nyou're like that was a shoe that changed\nthings or that was like the first of\nthat kind of shoe I felt like the SC\nTrainer was the first of the super\ntrainers like the that you actually run\nin here's the one that I think we always\nOverlook it but I I believe that the\nfirst super trainer\nto\nme I mean I guess zoomfly was supposed\nto be but the the real one for me was\nthe\ntempo\nyeah that's I never actually ran in that\nshoe I know um I didn't like it I think\nmy\ntrainer went to Jarrett I so I don't\nlike I don't have my\noriginal and that was the RC trainer or\nwhatever but okay yeah I thought you\nmeant you're like a train that you were\nworking with went to Jared the Jeweler\nyeah I was trying to buy engagement like\nalign that in my head there's a whole\nlot to unpack there yeah\num oh what was it oh I forgot I just\nremembering we did shot the Endorphin\ntrainer review which we didn't give it a\ngood review I forgot I didn't even say\nhow much I hated how loud that shoe was\nthat was the other thing I hated about\nthat shoe you know I was always wearing\nheadphones so I didn't really hear oh it\nit's louder than the alpal fly oh jeez\nyou know it was the loudest shoe ever\nwas the first meta speed yeah oh the\noriginal meta speed was just a real\nnoise maker guy the first one oh okay\nnot that he was like clap clap clap clap\nno not the meta\nracer um well wasn't the tempo next\npercent kind of known as one of the\nloudest shoes as well it's pretty loud\nyeah yeah yeah because it had that\nspace I still have a pair of those\nyeah sentimental reasons yeah\nsentimental but it like I felt like that\nwas almost the peak Nike yeah uh age the\nother shoes I just can't get rid of are\nthe Nike Trail shoes because they look\nso good I just can't I can't do it it's\nso hard especially the ones from a\ncouple years back when they're doing\nthose really cool colors with the Kyer\nand stuff like that yeah like the are\nyou talking about the white and pink\nyeah\nyeah just can't do it that was a the\nwhen we saw when we were out at Worlds\nin\nOregon was that Oregon yeah yeah\num and somebody was wearing that new\nNike Trail shoe remember we saw oh yeah\nthe Zama yeah and it looks all so good\nyeah yep yeah um good times anyway you\nwant to get into speed of Ray shoes\nlet's talk about this shoe that you have\nsaid a lot of things about all right so\nif you ever known we kind of slapped\nBrooks with a video last year or in the\nbeginning of this year about the\ndisappointment of what they were using\nfor a foam in the\nshoe and it's funny because we already\nput a video I put a video out with uh\nCarl's help uh on\nYouTube that talks about how they\nupdated the shoe after we kind of said\nhey it sucks that Brooks does doesn't\nhave a viable race stue they're using a\nsuper\ncritical uh foam rather than using Pea\nin their race day Sho so it just doesn't\ncompete with the rest of the shoes it's\nheavy it's clunky it doesn't feel great\nunderfoot\nand you\nknow we had heard when we went to Boston\nlast\nspring you know people think that I know\nthat sometimes our feedback doesn't have\nany effect\non the companies or that because they're\nalready working on Next Generation say\nthey're like two years of shoes ahead\nyeah so a lot of times it doesn't but I\ndid somebody that the rep didn't know\nthe person knew us and the rep told the\nperson that he was talking to in the\nshoe store that believe in the Run\nkilled the sales of the Hyperion Elite\nwhich I don't know if that's we can't\nconfirm if that's true not we can't\ncan't but I'm sure it didn't help yeah\nso you know it's interesting that when\nwe went and talked with them at the\nrunning event they basically said hey\nthey heard our review they listened to\nit and they may have already been\nworking to get PB in the shoes but the\ndifference between that and what we're\nlooking at here is an inline change so\nthis isn't a new shoe it's the exact\nsame tooling exact same you know uh uh\nmolds for the midsole same upper\neverything the only thing they changed\nwas the ingredient was the they put the\npeba midsole on the\nshoe so that's an inline change it's not\nlike a new development so to me this\ncould possibly be basically not maybe\njust our feedback but other people's\nfeedback that they needed to get in line\nwith having a super foam for the super\nshoe and they have it here are there two\nFoams there no it's the same okay same\nfoam it's just the split where the uh\nplate\nis but the point I'm making here is this\nisn't a new developed shoe this is their\ncurrent shoe just with a new ingredient\ninline change I mean it's still called\nthe Hyperion LE 4 yeah yeah so this\ncould potentially be reflective of\npeople's complaints about the\nshoe and I have to say after running in\nit I did 10 miles in it and I was like\nwell welcome to the show like welcome to\nthe this this feels just like it's\ncomparable to like I'd say vaporfly it's\ncomparable to um the Megan said she\nthought it felt like the Nitro Elite\nfrom yeah the most I was trying to think\non the Run of what it felt most similar\nto in terms of race day shoes and I\nthink the Puma Elite shoe is is what it\nfelt like to me but a better\nupper uh yeah I was just thinking more\nof the underfoot feel um I yeah I\nhaven't run I got it on Friday I think\nbut or\nSaturday but I haven't had a chance to r\ni I think you'll love it I put it I put\nit on I was like oh this for sure feels\nway different what's also interesting is\nthe marketing on the box they gave us is\ncompared to the Hyperion Elite 4 mhm\nthey feel like this will take 2 minutes\nand 35 seconds or something 32 or\nsomething like that yeah off proven to\ntake that off your marathon time I'm\nguessing they're basing that\nstrictly off of one person's performance\nI would do my best to prove them wrong\nyeah is be that hard but but that's that\nto me is like they know it their\nathletes have been running in this shoe\nso Dez when she ran trials CJ Albertson\nran the trials with this foam and uh you\nknow when you saw Josh KR on the Fifth\nAvenue mile he was wearing this shoe\nwith the PB gold see alberon ran like 10\nmarathons this year do you think they\nwere all in that or do you think they\ntook his time from the original race he\ndid I know he ran trials and this and\nthey said you know he's leading up until\nmile February so yeah so I'm guessing\nthat this is what he's been using it's a\nreally good shoe I have to\nsay that you know congratulations to\nBrooks to putting together a good shoe\nwith the right ingredients and to make\nit a competitor in the market and I'm\nexcited like the Hyperion Elite 5 I love\nthe design if it feels like this I think\nit'll be great it does not have as much\npop as some of the other ones that are\non our list and you know I actually\nthink of Adidas and their phones aren't\nit's not a pea foam that's in the Pro 4\nso some of the I think it's the super\ncritical\nTP um some of those I'm not sure that\nthat's exactly what it is that's what's\nin the Endorphin Elite too from salony\nthose seem to be um The Next Step yeah\nof of Foams and stuff like that but or\nat least competitive with the the\numbs okay I do we have spec sheets for\nthis I don't know I think um yeah I mean\nit's going to be the exact same as the\nspec sheet for the hyper for just right\nright I\nliked the the brook shoe um I think what\nI'm realizing about myself is I prefer a\nbit of more mechanic\nfeeling shoe like where I can feel the\nplate and feel like I'm getting a lot\nfrom the shoe not just maybe from the\nfoam but like everything working\ntogether yeah we talked about that like\nthat's one of the reasons I used to like\nthe Newton shoes was that you got that\nperception of kind of like that lift\nLevy you know kind of I think that's why\nI liked the original alply so much is\nbecause you there was just like you had\nthe airpod you had the plate you had the\nzoomx and it was like all yeah and when\nyou hit the shoe right it kind of\nrewarded you yeah so it also helped with\nform and stuff I think yeah I got\nyou\num the other shoe that we tried that has\nthe paback in it Robbie which is one of\nyour favorites Topo which I hadn't tried\nlike full peack shoe it's a cyclone 3\nyeah I don't how did I not get this shoe\nI don't know how you didn't get it maybe\nsomeone snatched cuz I got this with the\nother one what's the maybe there's a\ncyclone and what's the other one no it's\ndefinitely maybe it's at my\nhouse uh Cyclone 3 and\nthe the higher stacked one the Spectre\nyeah the Spectre both with peba but the\nSpectre I think the Spectre is the old\none\nthough like not old one but this past\nYear's model so is this meant to be a\nrace day shoe or a training shoe with\nPeck it's yeah a training shoe with peex\nokay so this is this one definitely let\nme know that I've gotten used to more\ncushioning under me feet yeah it's light\nit's fun as a matter of fact it do even\nthough it's got the foot\nshape it doesn't look I I thought I\nthink it looks good I think it's a good-\nlooking\nshoe yeah and I mean for toppo I was G\nto say I think it needs an asterisk yeah\nI would say shoe for toppo I would say\ntheir uh design has has been a limiting\nfactor in their uh perception of the\nshoes but and I think they're privy to\nthat but the that one actually yeah I\nlike the all white it's pretty nice I\ndid too all White's nice but yeah\ndefinitely it feels really light on the\nfeet the packs though like I think I did\neight miles and then a Four Mile Run so\nso in total 12\nmiles the it just it's a little thin for\nme um and it's funny because somebody\nwas asking on one of our video reviews\nare like hey what's a lower than 30\nmillimeter drop or stack or 30 mm stack\nshoe that you guys like does that exist\nI think not for me I mean what's say\nstack on this that's more that has to be\nstill\nmore now this one has 8 mm drop or 5\nmillimet drop or six mm it's five all\ntheir shoes are pretty much five I can't\nthey did that is that five\num five five or four yeah it says five\non the on the side of the ship yeah five\nmillimeter drop okay\num yeah so I don't know why I I was\ntrying to look up some of the specs but\nI don't have it right now well something\nI did like about this though it has a\nnice Arch it's very lightweight was that\nwe on the scale can you put that on\nthere\nyeah um that's what I love about the\nCyclone CU yeah it's not going to be the\nmost forgiving shoe as far as cushion\nbut there you go yeah 7 and2 o\nthat's like a race day light isn't it\nyeah oh like race like lower end of\nrace4 G yeah so you're talking that's a\npretty straightforward Tempo shoe yeah I\nthink is kind of the goal and it did\nfeel like that like I felt light on my\nfeet the only thing that was kind of\nweird though is I did feel like the shoe\npushed me to pronate a little bit like\nit wanted to collapse inwards okay for\nme all right that sounds like a you\nproblem could\nbe I got 99 problems yeah and Megan is\none or not\none be careful with your words she's up\nthere um yeah number\none um by the way if you haven't\nlistened to Thomas's podcast on Monday\nI'm assuming if you're listening to the\ndrop you've listened to Thomas's origin\nstories yeah everyone's everyone's\nloving it I don't know about that course\neverybody's Loving Story they loved your\nstory they're going to love Megan this\none was a little nerve-wracking I I so\nwe did end up there was a part where um\nit we it kind of got edited you can kind\nof see where a [\u00a0__\u00a0] eded but um we\nactually had to stop for a little bit\nduring the podcast and uh start over\num and uh I was a little nervous about\nit so I went and I kind of like listened\nback\nto it and I I think it flows fine um\nyeah with it but it was a it was a tough\nmoment yeah I mean but I think everyone\nappreciates that though that you're\nwilling to share all that and absolutely\nit gives people more insight as to who\nyou are MH yeah man that's what we need\ntoday more people being real yeah I have\na feeling someone's going to use it\nagainst me though no yeah I don't not\nour audience we've got a bunch of good\npeople yeah even the YouTube trolls I\nthink would be too low for for them I\ndon't know Carl was typing away on\nit he\nlike um I do want to thank everyone\nthough for listening to this podcast it\nstill amazes me that you all are still\nlistening to the nonsense that we talk\nabout every week um but you're all the\nreason that we get to do what we do so\nvery grateful for all of you yeah it it\nI think that you know this is one other\nAvenue that we do that helps us continue\nto bring you know content to to you and\nand do it in a way that we talked about\na little bit about the fact that you\nknow we're able to provide free content\nbecause you guys are good about our\nsponsors or participating in things that\nwe do so yep you know we couldn't do\nthis without you we appreciate you and\nuh we want to say have a happy happy New\nYear because we will not yeah just a\nreminder we will not have a Friday\nepisode next week which normally come\nout January 3rd you know what we didn't\neven talk about grit

down and made\nsure that the stitching that's going on\nthe front for the believe run logo on\nthe front chest yeah is kind of matches\nthe hat that uh the beanie that's going\nout so it should all work together quite\nnicely and I hope I don't know do we\nhave a everyone always asks what the\ntimeline is it's it's honestly we can't\nthe timeline for shipping it out yeah\ndid you see that pile that was not all\nof them that in the okay if you watch\nthe re yeah there's after they print\nthem they stacked them up uhhuh and that\npile was like four pallets at about like\nwell they're they're hoodies it's not\nlike they're\nsinglets mean crew but it's not like\nthey're singlets but it was like four\npallets and they were like 4 feet high\nand I was like Scrooge McDuck into those\nyeah we're going to have to Helen and\ncrew is going to be working hard to get\nthem maybe like don't look at me I'm out\nuh is any yeah um but yeah so it's all\nit's all our small little team that\nmakes all this happen and get them\nshipped out so we're always very\ngrateful for your patience as as soon as\nwe get them we'll start shipping them\nbut it's kind of out of our hands and as\na matter of fact this is probably the\nearliest if we're going to get get the\nstuff done so pretty much during the\nduring the uh event you should be\ngetting your stuff yeah which is nice\nyeah so people love that I think I they\nwere saying that they weren't going to\nget the left chest embroidery done until\nthe new year oh wow and then I got an\nemail that they might be starting on it\ntoday okay so Co now it takes a lot\nlonger because they only have a certain\nnumber of uh embroidery machines yeah so\nthe elves are working over time yeah I\nthis is to me this is probably one of\nthe best pieces of Swag that we've ever\ndone oh yeah easily yeah I love the\nprint was nice it's not too high on like\nwhen you feel it it feels soft on the\nthing it's not like a chunky print it\nyeah it looks good all right well cool\num happy holidays to everyone drink that\nelement before your New Year's Eve party\nyeah yeah maybe make you feel better the\nnext day maybe you're running uh git\nmiles right now

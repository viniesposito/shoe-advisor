my dad's\nfirst name was Robert a lot of\ncreativity went into that and no Force\nwhy he put is that why you put an e at\nthe end of your name so it's robbery\nyeah E le yeah it's just to throw people\noff Roberty Lee oh man hopefully it's\njust people from Australia listening to\nthis they have no idea what we're\ntalking about oh I think it's made it\nthat far oh you think so do you know any\nAustralian history though that's a good\nfirst question for you like I couldn't\nname a single politician in the history\nof Australians can you name a city yes\nMelbourne or is that how they s say it\nMelbourne do you know Clive didy do syy\nwhat Clive digy do is that a real person\nyeah no it's not\ndid he is that where's it from name one\nperson who had a crocodile farm down\nthere besides crocodile dundy I was\ngoing to say easy no Steve Berwin oh\nyeah but I don't do he have a farm or\nwas he just he has like a zo Sanctuary\nokay yeah well his son's doing stuff now\ntoo yeah I saw that yeah recently anyway\nthis is supposed to be about\nyou I mean all that is about me in a way\nAustralia um okay let's so let's go to\nthe way back do we start from the\nbeginning beginning where did Robbie\ngrow up and what was childhood like wow\nreally going deep um let's see I was\nborn in Lebon Pennsylvania which\nis small town near kind of outside\nHershey I guess if it was South Central\nPA is it Lebanon or leanon they say\nLebanon Lebanon Lebanon or Le they\nhonestly just take out the a too it's\nlike the easiest thing ever Le\nLebon yeah um there's a lot of stuff\nlike that that doesn't make sense\nLancaster instead of Lancaster that no\nsense it's oh I've been pronouncing it\nthe other way yeah they just they just\npeople make stuff up anyways so I was\nborn there uh lived in pomara\nPennsylvania which we talked about cuz\nthat's where Nick bear is from till I\nwas five and then I moved like how do\nyou not know him that's like it's not\nlike it's huge like you had to have Shar\nhe's he's younger than me he's like\neight years younger than me oh I thought\nmaybe you'd have to be sharing some DNA\nliving in that small town yeah it's\npretty small so and then we moved uh\nnear out more towards the mountains near\nHershey and that's where I lived pretty\nmuch all my life before bouncing around\nplaces um as an adult but so I grew up\nthere and let's see do you want like the\nfor real like the whole history yeah all\nright might as well people I have three\nbrothers I have brother I'm the oldest\nof four\nsiblings uh my youngest brother's my\nbrother is 10 years younger than me and\nthat's like the age range that's big\nyeah um four is a lot 10 yeah what four\nand we lived in this years four kids it\nwas crazy claustrophobic we lived in\nthis tiny brick ranch house and there's\njust one floor until I was 15 or 16 and\nI got they we readed the basement did\nyou share a bedroom yeah with my brother\num who was 10 years younger than you\nyeah so when I was like 12 or 133\nuntil yeah so like 11 until I was 15 or\nsomething like that that's crazy yeah\nthat's you were basically raising an\ninfant I guess I don't crazy I don't\nremember much of it like in that way no\nbaby waking you up in the middle of the\nnight but I I guess I don't really\nremember that it probably happened but\nand then my sister Mrs her [\u00a0__\u00a0] room but\nit was like real tight real small but we\ngrew up in the country so lots of fields\nand like riding my bike to my friend's\nhouse my only friend who lived a mile\naway um and then swimming in cricks yeah\nkind of just fishing bare feet all\nsummer starting fires you know stuff\nlike that like was an exciting trip to\nyou like going to like one of the like\ngas station stores kind of yeah so we we\nwere I grew up I don't know poor but my\ndad worked for Hershey Chocolate Factory\nso\nhe worked there for 40 years and so he\nhe had a it was a pretty stable job like\nit was a union job and see as soon as\nyou say that I think of wily Wonka like\nyour dad has a purple crushed velvet\nsuit that he wore to work did you guys\nget to go to Hershey yeah sometimes but\nnot not too much in the factory like\nthere's like one day of year where you\ncould go inside the actual fact okay\nThomas asked me this earlier today he\nsaid do you think if you worked at\nStarbucks you wouldd start to hate\ncoffee so question\nyeah did your dad hate chocolate Andor\nthe rest of your family pretty much no\none in my family ate chocolate that\nworked at Hershey yeah wow so because of\nexactly because of that reason it's\nweird people who work in Gold minees\nstill like\ngold yeah I mean as a kid I loved it so\nwe\nweren't I don't know I feel like Health\nwas weird back then like we did eat\nstuff from so my\nfamily uh my grandma grandpa and uncles\nthey still had a farm a mile away from\nour house which is where my parents live\nnow\nand so they still raised cattle and pigs\nand chickens and whatnot and so we still\ngot a lot of our food from there and\ncorn and so in that way that was healthy\nbut we\nalso had like our pantry with all the\nsugary cereals all tasty cakes kind no\nno that's still Robbie today like I'll\nsee Robbie and you'll talk to him and\nit'll be like just getting back from\nChick-fil-A yeah and but I know that for\nthe most part you guys are healthy like\nI say even your kids will eat like\nthey're not too picky right I'd say it's\nbalanced out like I don't I definitely\nwill eat terribly from time to time SL\nhalf the week um like did you like pork\nrinds growing up no but my family they\nmade scrapple which I never really liked\nI still don't even like a lot of people\ndon't know what scrapple is if you're\nnot from the delm Marva area I don't\nthink it's that big like I grew up in\nCalifornia and I only learned about it\nwhen I moved here I think it's mostly\nlike New Jersey PA what is it it's\nbasically after you butcher a pig which\nI've that was had to do sometimes with\nmy family which is a crazy experience\nwhen you're 8 years old and you're you\nbutchered it well helped clean it yeah\nlike my uncle like they would he would\nkill it and then you like strip the you\nknow cut it like oh jeez so this is my\nOrin story yours but I'm going to throw\nin here our school bus literally like\none time we we saw saw a cow get\nslaughtered oh like a Napoleon Dynamite\nHapp it was very similar that like I was\nwhen I saw that I was like oh my God\nyeah they they hang him upside down it's\nlike yeah and all the things where\nthey're like oh chicken with a Teta cut\noffs bleeds like a stuck pig there's a\nreason those things are actual\neuphemisms cuz they're all true life\nyeah like as a kid so it's very I'm like\nDwight tro but like a more normal\nversion without as much anger yeah yeah\nthey same anger there sometimes yeah\nyeah for sure um there's some\nvindictiveness but he um sorry so they I\nI kind of grew up that way so we ate\nlike somewhat healthy but I was pretty\nactive like I was um sorry somewhat\nhealthy in some ways terribly in other\nways um but I was really active as a kid\nlike loved to play baseball that was my\nfavorite sport for sure played soccer um\nkind of like rode my like I said rode my\nbike did a lot of stuff like that and\nthen and but we we grew up kind of the\nmiddle of nowhere so I didn't have too\nmany friends and I grew up kind of it\nwas kind of weird situation where my\nparents were super\nconservative Christians so it was like\nthere was a lot especially being the\noldest there was like a lot of rules and\na lot of can't do things so are they\nstill uh conservative yeah but like not\nas I would say like in some ways but\ngenerally not as much like for sure by\nthe time my brother came along was like\nmuch different but I wasn't allowed to\nwatch a lot of movies or music listen to\nmusic or things that were like like it's\nCRA honestly it's actually crazy if you\nthink about what's weird is we have this\nin common for a little while stepmom\nthat we weren't allowed to watch TV or\nanything both of us have discussed it\nmight be where our our hunger for pop\nculture oh 100% yeah so like when you\nwere growing up would kids be talking\nabout movies and stuff and you just\ncouldn't even relate I feel viscerally\nlike even talking about it because you\nwould they talk about Nickelodeon or\nNinja Turtles and Power R you know\nwhatever and you don't you like kind of\npretend like you know what's going on is\nit like in that scene from 40-year-old\nversion where he's like yeah it's like a\nbag of sand yeah pretty much yeah um and\nthat was so that was definitely tough um\nbut for sure that's where my love of\nevery like because once I got older it\nwas music movies\nuh like anything pop culture isn't it\nfunny that's exactly what your parents\nwanted to keep you from yeah and it\ndrove you to it yeah isn't that how it\nalways works pretty much yeah so and\nlike there was no\ndrinking uh young parents inake nothing\nlike that like was very like very strict\nand conservative and this is the 80s cuz\nI do you remember the ' 8S like there's\nthe weird the conservative right was\nlike satanic panic and all this other\nstuff so it was people were spinning\nrecords backwards yeah it was a wild\ntime and so that like even then we watch\nthese movies there's these movies that\nexisted you can still find them on\nYouTube that are basically the dangers\nof rock and roll and it's like and\nwatching those I'm like this is like\nthis looks awesome yeah you kind of like\nthere's that a good advertisement for\nrock and roll\nyeah and um so I grew up like that\nand um didn't have too manys friends and\ndidn't know too many people growing up\nso be before we leave the satanic Rock\nand Roll Part cuz I remember that time\nperiod that you're talking about yeah\nand when you heard music almost some of\nthat music was a little bit scary like\nCU you knew that it was like quote\nunquote evil music like Black Sabbath\nand you know you heard he bit heads off\nof you know bats at thing and Guns and\nRoses ACDC well yeah that's even later\nbut the\nwere you when you listen to that music\ndid it seem scary or did it seem like\ndangerous yeah in a way well I didn't\nreally listen to it when I was a kid\nbecause I had no way of getting a hold\nof it you know uh I didn't really have\nfriends who like I said I didn't have\ntoo many friends so I knew of it and\nthings but I wasn't really able to get\nmy hands on it I always felt bad there's\nthis one kid that would would come of my\nhouse to play baseball sometimes he\nlived down the road and he like for some\nreason he only had\nbant t-shirts he didn't have any other\nclothing and would you make him put it\ninside out yeah my my dad make him turn\ninside out cuz it was the Guns and Roses\nalbum covers with like skeletons and\nyeah and chicks on them and stuff like\nso he wasn't allowed to wear him to my\nhouse which H maybe a little bit I get\nbut yeah I always in hindsight I'm like\nman I always feel bathroom\nbut um yeah and then so that was so this\nis all through high school well that was\npretty much Elementary School and Middle\nSchool in middle school I started um me\nand my friends got really into\nskateboarding that was kind of there's\nlike this kid that just we saw with a\nskateboard and we asked them about it\nand then for some reason we all got into\nit the little circle of friends that I\ndid have and that your mom and dad were\nfine with that yeah yeah they were\npretty much fine with that cuz it was\njust skateboarding it was like a sport\nand in Middle School like we like they\nweren't bad yet like my friend\nweren't that bad yet there's still we\nwere still kind of kids it was 12 13 and\nthen so we skated a lot my mom would\njust card us around to skate parks or\njust whatever we just be we just find a\nparking lot it was awesome we just we\nlived in the middle of nowhere so we\njust find a old railroad tie wax it up\nand just put in the middle of a parking\nlot you could spend four hours there\ndoing that in 90\u00b0 heat and um so that's\nwhat I did most Summers\nin middle school and stuff and that's\nhonestly I think skateboarding helped a\nlot with\nprobably we talked about this any on the\npodcast before I think I've never had\nreally injuries as far as bone stuff or\nanything like that I think it really\nhelped\nstrengthen that from all the repeated\nyou know tricks and stuff on skateboards\nthat's funny cuz I basically hadn't had\nno nobody in my family really broke any\nbones M and like skating you take some\nhard slams I always joke about it now\nlike if I did like just a small fall I\nwould be right yeah yeah there's\nsurprisingly I've never broken a bone\nthat's kind of shocking\num yeah and so I did that for a while in\nmiddle school and that was fun but those\nfriends then high school was weird\nbecause those friends started to like go\noff and kind of get into some a lot of\npartying and drugs and stuff and I was\nstill like a good Christian kid or\nwhatever so I didn't really do too much\nof that um oh and I also forgot to\nmention yeah like I grew up camping a\nlot too going outdoors and my family\nwent like we didn't go on vacations we\njust went uh we had a pop-up camper but\nwe would just go to like a state park or\nwhatever so I never I didn't fly till I\nwas like a senior in high school or\nsomething or junior in high school and\nthen so we never and we didn't like go\nout to eat or anything like that so it\nwas a very weird that's it what do your\nparents think like now with your job now\nyou fly all over the world\nyeah do they what's our take on it I\nmean they think it's cool for sure um\nbut it is weird because a lot of my\nfamily hasn't really been outside of pa\npa yeah I mean I think they've been a\ncouple other places but nothing like\nthey never been to Europe or California\nor anything like that or Texas mostly\njust some place the East\nCoast um do you think well we'll get\ninto your band stuff later but yeah oh\nyeah so then I so then and then High\nSchool\nI um I still play baseball but most of\nthe other and I still skateboard it but\na lot of my friends were like I said\nthey were going the other direction and\nhonestly like it's kind of sad cuz at\nleast two of them two of my best friends\nthey've died of heroin overdoses um\nsince then and and like it's like you\njust see like that whatever started in\nhigh school at that time just kept going\nlike never stopped and\nthen\nwe so when then when I was in high\nschool I started going to this youth\ngroup um that was actually pretty\nawesome like I just I didn't have that\nmany friends I didn't know too many\npeople I was like pretty like I was\nfriends with everyone at school but I\nnever had any friends friends and then\nthat when I started going there I met\nlike there's people who are literally my\nbest friends still today who I still met\nthere in e or 10th grade or whatever nth\nor 10th grade and\nso so like I just met some really cool\npeople who made me gain a lot of\nconfidence and it's really weird I I\nalways think about this with my kids or\neven your kids like when you think when\nyou talk about Theo I think about this\nlike you're just like where did that\ncome from and I think about myself where\nwhen I was younger I had no confidence\ndidn't know anyone like whatever and\nthen I just met these people who were\njust like cool or I thought they were\ncool and then I was like oh I guess I'm\ncool and then I just embraced that and\nkind of just became myself and then\nbecame friends with like a ton of people\nand then I love meeting people and then\nlike so before this would you say you\nwere a shy kid oh yeah for sure like\nabsolutely and and then I just liked\nmeeting people and meeting new friends\nand stuff and have in high school and\ninto\ncollege\nand that was an awesome time for sure\nlike that changed my life pretty much my\nsenior year of high school I guess or\nJunior to senior year of high school um\nand then yeah so I went to college after\nthat in uh oh and I played tennis my\nsenior year high school so that was like\nanother thing I just tried new things\nwas just like I should just try out for\nthe tennis team and I was actually\nreally good and I wish I would have done\nthat earlier because I was actually one\nof my it's probably one of my favorite\nsports um and then we got to college so\nI went to a college called Geneva\nCollege Geneva College it's out near\nlike Pittsburgh\nPennsylvania\nand um it's like a liberal art\nschool but I really liked it it's small\nschool actually I didn't I was like okay\nwith it at the time freshman year kind\nof was rough and I almost transferred to\nPenn State um but I just decided last\nsecond not to and then I yeah and I met\nsome really good friends there and I\nthought I had a pretty good education I\nwent for English education which was I\nwas planning on being an English teacher\nprobably because I watched Dead Poet\nSociety way too many times um because I\nloved writing and reading when I was a\nkid oh that was the other thing I was\nlike obsessed with reading as a kid I\nread like an insane amount of books um\nall the time and I love reading\nnewspaper like I would read the\nnewspaper with my morning bowl of cereal\nand as a kid yeah like you're like in\nMiddle School and High School were you\nwearing a tie no I just like read that\nlike I loved reading everything pretty\nmuch um well because you that was\nprobably like your outlet you didn't\nhave access to movies and yeah pretty\nmuch yeah that is true and so like in\nwhen I was in high school some friends\nlike some of my new friends I met\nintroduced me some cool writers too like\non the road by Jack kowak that was like\na book that changed my life um\nlike I I love CER in the Ry I loved um\nKurt Von give books and stuff like that\nso I just kind of got into all this\nreading and writing and then went to\ncollege for English um and it was a good\nit was a great education in hindsight I\ndidn't think it was at the time you're\nlike a sucks I go to school it's like\n2,000 people um how big were your\nclasses I mean lectures there were some\nlectures that were like you know 100\nkids or something 150 kids but but like\nmy individual classes were like 20 kids\nso they're like maybe even less than\nthat some like 10 so pretty small\nclasses yeah so that was nice CU you\ncould really get like just dropped in\ntheir professor's offices at any time\nand and being a liberal art a liberal\nart school I felt like it gave me a\nreally good education just like to think\nabout things in a different way and you\nknow you got to take art classes and all\nkinds of other stuff so that was cool um\nbut then when once I graduated from\nthere\nI\num\nlike I I did my student teaching my last\nsemester of school and it was at a poor\nsteel industry Town um like the whole\nsteel industry left Wester PA so all\nthose towns out there were just like\nghost towns and to some extent still are\nbut I student taught there and it was\nlike no AP classes no college prep\nclasses it was just like everyone's in\nthe same class so it was for student\nteaching it was pretty rough cuz you had\nto deal with like so many behavioral\nproblems and just I don't know I just\ndidn't like it and I just it's crazy\nbecause I went to school to be an\nEnglish teacher and I did my student\nteaching and I was like dude I don't\nknow this is what I want to\ndo and it's funny because I remember\nthe there's like this class I had in my\nsenior year of college where the\nprofessor asked us if it was\nlike the\nthree if you could have three dream jobs\nor something like what would they be I\nthink I\nsaid I think the number one\nwas journalist for Rolling Stone or\nsomething and then two was a a rock star\nor being a rock band and three\nwas um be a teacher\nso my third one was teacher did that\ndidn't like it so then after I graduated\ncollege I worked for a Small Town\nNewspaper close to home in humblest\nPennsylvania and so that was just like a\nweekly newspaper where I would write\nnews story local news story Sports\nwhatever and a friend of mine this was a\nfull-time job yeah it was a full-time\njob but it paid\nlike $10 an hour or something was\nterrible and I did that for six months\nor so and then a through a friend of a\nfriend someone said oh my my friend is\nlooking for a bass player cuz they have\nthis band and they want to go on tour I\nwas like dude I'm\n22 I I've always wanted to do that I'm\nlike yeah I'm just GNA I'm just going to\ndo it did you know how to play yeah I\nplay\noh oh yeah so I played B since I started\nmention I started playing bass guitar\nwhen I was 15 or 16 you play in the\nchurch right yeah so there friends that\nI met at youth group they bought me a\nbass guitar for my birthday uh the one\nyear I think when I turned 16 or maybe\n15 so I learned it and yeah played for\nchurch why bass guitar over regular\nguitar um I I had a regular guitar but I\nthink it\nwas one of those I don't know it was\njust one of those things that seemed\ninteresting maybe I there was a time\nwhere I felt like the base was like\nespecially with flea from Hot Chili\nPeppers yeah he kind of made it cool and\nthen there's other bands that like were\nbass driven and you're like it's also\neasier to learn like sure it's only one\nnote at a time boom yeah one finger one\nnose still got to have to have rhythm\nyeah which I'm struggling with at the\ngym yeah yeah\num and so yeah I did play start playing\nin high school and play throughout\ncollege and then I was like yeah let's\ndo let's join a band tour because why\nnot and so I remember there was a it was\ncrazy too cuz I had this fork in the\nroad where there was a newspaper that\nasked called me to they went to hire me\nto be a daily sports writer which I\nprobably would have is another path that\nI wouldn't have mind taking cuz I love\nsports um I could have really done well\nin that I liked lot of the Sports\nIllustrated writers like Rick Riley um\nhe would always have the last page in\nSports Illustrated he's kind of he was\nalways one of my favorite writers and\nhonestly who I kind\nof uh formulate the drop email that's\nkind of the basis of that his\nwriting and Mitch album and other people\nlike that were awesome Sports Raiders\nand so I so I had that job offer or was\njoined a band and I was like I'm I'm\njust going to do the band thing which is\ncrazy were you nervous at all about that\ndecision I don't think so I think I am a\nrisk taker in that way where if it just\nfeels right I just do it so for better\nfor worse and I don't know my parents\nprobably thought it was insane but they\nthey I was still living at home at the\ntime cuz I just graduated college and so\nthey were like go get out go on the road\nyeah I guess but they let me stay so\nwhen I came home from the road they\nwould I'd still stay at home home and\njust\nwork whatever job I could get so for the\nfor drop listeners if you ever hear me\ntalk about some job I had in the past\nit's usually in the band days because we\nwere super broke like so basically what\nwe did was we just had a 15 passenger\nvan and a\ntrailer and okay wait back up for a\nsecond okay I'm sorry they someone\nsays you we want we need a bass player\nand you're like oh cool that's me I'll\ndo it do you know anyone in this band uh\nI did I did vaguely know let's see H I\nkind of knew one of the guys and then\nbut I wasn't friends with him did you\nhave to like play for them and they're\nlike oh yeah you're good enough or yeah\nI think I just played and then drank\nsome beers we also have to throw out the\nname of the band yeah so it was called\nfarewell flight we weren't that big if\nyou look at it's still on Spotify though\num\nbut we and was based out of Harrisburg\nPA and we were all DIY so this is a\nweird time for bands because it was\n2005 six and it was right\nafter um like CDs were dying off but the\ninternet was still kind of lagging lime\nwire napck so yeah what we were doing I\nmean there was did you have sharing\nServices Myspace page yeah so was like\nheight of Myspace all right but the\nproblem is that Myspace didn't didn't\nhave great promotional tools it wasn't\nlike today where everything's integrated\nand Instagram and Facebook and whatever\num so it was in it was so difficult to\nfind I mean I would literally just do\nzip code searches\nand like spam people to come out to\nshows like it was crazy it was like DIY\nto the extreme\nand uh or if we were trying to find\nbands to play with in other towns we\njust Hammer different places on MySpace\nbecause there's really no other way to\nfind venues bands anything and so our\ndrummer booked all the tours and we\nwould do three weeks usually three weeks\non the road 3 weeks home or 3 weeks on\nthe road four weeks home just for years\nand so mostly this half the us and we\ndid one six week tour that was like the\nwhole way out to California up to\nSeattle and back um but I mean we played\n750 shows in span of six years so I mean\n25 130 shows a year at least okay how\ndoes a band member get paid so yeah they\ndon't um so when we were first starting\nit was so we were so broke that\neverything we made just went back in the\nvan so was like into the band so it was\nVan repairs merch buying merch\num just general expenses and stuff like\nthat because you only make you know on a\ngood show you might make a hundred bucks\nfor the whole group yeah so like not a\ngood show but just a normal show okay\nthat and sometimes if you get really\nlucky if you have a HomeTown show you\nmight make 500 or something like that so\nyou were just using that money to\nsurvive and travel yeah so it's like\nwhen we came home I was dude I remember\ncoming home from tour R end me my change\nJ just put gas in my car to get to work\nlike I'm not kidding you I had no money\nand we\nwere like hungry a lot because we only\nour first priority was cigarettes and\nbeer and then food so in that order and\ndidn't you have a a hack at Wendy's or\nsome place with a receipt that you could\nget oh we had a ton of hacks I could go\non for another hour about all the food\nhacks cuz there is uh some of the back\nthe receipts would have oh if you fill\nout the survey you get a free whopper or\nwith a purchase of a fries but they\ndidn't say you couldn't buy value fries\nwhich are only a dollar and then you buy\nyou know it was like a drink in a but if\nyou buy the value on it was two bucks\nand basically you get a whole meal so\nthat was like a hack then Arby's had\nthis weird promo was back when they were\ndoing like texting stuff where they're\nlike oh text this text this number and\nyou'll get a code well they didn't limit\nhow many codes you could get so we would\njust uh be texting us Su they had this\npromo going on for like two months where\nwe just hammered these new Arby\nsandwiches that they had coming out it\nwas insane and then another time talk\nTaco Bell had this competition for bands\non the road and we got $500 in Taco Bell\nbucks which were $5 checks and they were\nactually like checks legal tender so if\nyou brought them about a 49 cent Taco\nyeah buy 49 cent Taco they have to give\nyou $4.50 back in cash which we then\njust SP spend on beer and all it all\nworked together like that so it was like\ntrying to find out crazy hacks to just\nsurvive basically of course we're just\ndrinking Keystone Light the whole time\nthere's no like no other options the\nfact that you're still alive is\nimpressive it actually no it's actually\nincredible I mean sometimes I'm like did\nI burn the candle too much at that end\nand it's all going to come crashing down\nin like two years which it may but the\nand then we had a van that ran on\nvegetable oil that was the craziest\nthing cuz it ran on because we were\ntrying to save money so we got this\nwhole system installed where this huge\ntank of vegetable oil sat in the back of\nthe van like 120 gallon tank this this\nreal yeah I know somebody else who did\nthis and it the car smells weird yeah\nyou just like we would go so what the\nidea is you have this tank in the back\nhas two two split with two different\nsides and two different filters and it\nhas a hose so you have to go to\nrestaurant\ndumpsters and pump the grease out of the\ndumpster into your van but the problem\nis it can't just be you can't just roll\nup to McDonald's and just pump it out\nbecause their grease is so bad because\nthey just fry things endlessly and so\nyou actually have to find decent quality\ngrease so like Taco Bell actually has\nvery good\ngrease uh Chick-fil-A actually has great\ngrease cuz they change it regularly but\nthen any other fast food restaurant was\nhorrible so we just had like we had a\nwhole book with like the best\nrestaurants in like the East Coast with\nlike\nthe best grease and we' have to do\nrounds every three days like we'd split\nup into two teams of two and find like\nfind the grease or whatever but the pro\nproblem with these vehicles they also\nrun really dirty like it's hard to keep\nthose how many of you are there and how\nmany are you sleeping in this van four\nfour of us but we'd always have a friend\nor two who would just jump on we had\nthis one friend who is he's now a doctor\nmaking like half million doll a year a\ncancer doctor but he had he was in med\nschool at the time and or prior to med\nschool and so whenever he had a break he\nwould just like fly out and meet us or\njump in a bus and meet us on tour and\njust tour with us for the next two weeks\nand he would he would rack up these\ncrazy bar tabs CU he just put it on his\nmed student loans which was\nawesome and and we had other friends who\nwould just jump in the van for a week\nand just hang out and then go back to\nwhere they were whatever so it was kind\nof a rolling\ncircus and uh but it was awesome it was\nit was the best definitely the few first\nfew years were the best times just I\nmean it and and honestly it taught at\nthe time I was especially as it went on\nI was think it started to feel more like\nfailure than success because we were we\ndid have some interest in labels in the\nbeginning and we had played with some\ncool bands and met a lot of cool friends\nand recorded a couple albums in\nNashville with some good producers and\nstuff like that\nand um and now it's but then it started\nto die off and this is like year two\nthree um three or four okay and then by\nthat time the grind of touring and\nplaying to 10 people at a show like some\ndive bar and what I always thought is\nlike you're playing the same songs over\nand over and over again doesn't that\nstart to yeah that's why band that's why\nradio Hood doesn't play Creep you know\nstuff like that it's like fans love that\nbut I get I understand now why bands\ndon't play certain songs or even go back\nto certain albums so yeah that got old\nbut just the lifestyle it started to get\nmore depressing where we were just\ndrinking not to have fun but just to\ndrink just to stay level just\nto sandwich yeah just to stay warm in\nthe van like when you're in an ice storm\nin Iowa and you're 28 or you know 27\nyears old and all your friends have now\nare starting families or doing have real\njobs with 401ks and you're drinking Evan\nWilliams\nwhiskey like and sleeping in a van with\nthree dudes when it's 30 degrees out\nkind of it's like a little depressing\nand then you had to go home and wait\ntables at the holiday in and like hey\nRobbie how's it going yeah that's what\nyou were doing yeah so when I mostly my\njob was waiting tables at a restaurant\nat the Holiday near where I lived and\nthen but I also like I said I just pick\nup crazy random jobs if I ever needed\nextra money and you're still living at\nhome at this point I lived at home I\nthink until I was\n25 like the first couple years and then\nI moved out um and lived with a a friend\nwho just gave me super cheap rent like\n150 bucks a month for a room\num and so that was in Harrisburg so then\nyeah that was a kind of a grind and then\ntowards the end it got like I said it\ngot pretty depressing but yeah when I\ncame home from tour and people ask you\nthat was the worst because in the\nbeginning you're like oh yeah we went we\nplayed went the whole way down to you\nknow Tallahassee over to Austin up\nthrough Kansas City to Michigan and\nplayed like you know it was a lot of fun\nit's like a good time and people thought\nit was cool and then once you're doing\nthat for so long it's like damn\nlike I don't know it's just I didn't\nwant to talk about it and then so I\nfinally\nuh I Recon so my wife now we had dated\nmy senior year of college and we dated\nfor a year and then broke up for four\nyears and so we kind of\nreconnected when I was 28 or something\n27\nand then I was like okay I need to move\non need to go do something I don't know\njust need to move on and I moved to\nBaltimore\ndude and it was just like on a whim not\ncuz of Kimmy kind of but her so her\nbrother had a boat cleaning\nbusiness and I had just gotten off tour\nand they the I was this is so sounds so\ninsane so I I was working for a I was\nworking for a water meter company\ninstalling water meters throughout like\nthey were upgrading all the water meters\nthis requires no skills I learned them\non the Fly okay Robie you haven't heard\nthese stories it sounded like torture\nyou'd be out in the freezing weather\ntrying to like use tools dude that that\njob was it was so hard but it really\ntaught me a lot uh about independence\nand kind of because you'd be out in the\nfield and things would go wrong and you\ncouldn't call anyone cuz when I was\nyounger I used to I wasn't very\nindependent my mom did do a lot of stuff\nfor me and for us kids you know she's\njust trying to help us but I never was\ntaught resilience or anything like that\nand so then that job honestly that was\nanother thing that changed my life was\nbeing stuck in the middle of nowhere if\nthe water meter breaks or something and\nyou just got to figure it out and it's\nlike at the time the job sucked I\nthought it was such a shitty job but you\ndon't realize like some things just are\ngood in in the long run or in hindsight\nand that was a super\nlike it was hard it was manual labor in\na way or just being out in really bad\nconditions and that a winter in\nPennsylvania and uh but that that really\nhelped a lot so anyways I came I came\nhome from that from a tour and they were\nlike yeah we don't have any more work\nfor you like all the our contracts are\ndried\nup so I didn't have like any money to my\nname and I needed a job\nand my so Kimmy who I was dating she\nlived in Annapolis and I knew her\nbrother had this boat cleaning business\nI was like can I just work for you for\nsummer and I like like I'll figure the\nrest out I just need as long as I have a\njob will figure it out and so I found a\nplace on Craigslist within a couple days\nand thank God it was in Canton cuz I had\nno idea like where anything was in\nBaltimore oh W I was just lucky it's\nlike a block from my kids school and he\nhad a room that didn't even have a full\nwall it was like it was like you know\nthe middle rooms and row homes the tiny\nlittle ones it was one of those where\njust basically the bed fit in and the\nwall didn't even go the whole way up to\nthe ceiling it was like it was crazy but\nhe only charged me like 400 bucks a\nmonth or 450 for everything which in\nCanon is insane yeah and\nso so lucky luckily I moved there work\ndid the boat detailing stuff for a\nyear uh then I did it myself like I ran\nthe business for Year and that was the\nhardest job I ever had like no question\nabout it it was like it was so hard cuz\nyou imagine just a 50ft yacht and you\nhave to wax the whole thing just imagine\nthe whole thing like yourself yeah you\nhad no one else like I had it my friend\nmy one friend uh from home actually like\nthat he came down and did it with me but\nyou have like a power tools like a power\nbuffer and you're waxing the whole thing\nlike underneath\nmy dad used to do that I would do like\none section for four minutes and be done\nyeah it's like dude it sucks thanks for\nthe help and is in July your heat is\nlike radiating off the boat trying not\nto get sweat on it CU then messes\neverything up it's like I mean I was in\ngood shape but that was brutal and\nthat's another job where I'm like dude I\nhope it doesn't come back on me because\nthere's a lot of chemicals and stuff\nlike yeah I don't even know we hardly\never wore masks you were outside and\ndon't forget did medical testing too oh\n[\u00a0__\u00a0] I didn't I didn't talk about the\nmedical testing I did oh yeah so the\nwhole time we were in the band real\nbrief we like me and the other guys in\nthe band we were all broke so there's\nthe Hershey Medical Center would do\nthese medical tests of all kinds of\ncrazy stuff and I mean I did drug\ntesting in college that was a whole\nanother thing that was that was crazy\nsuper crazy but cuz that was clinical\ndrug trials that you would have to stay\nat the place for a whole weekend and\nthen but I I did these at the Hershey\nMedical Center they did these all kinds\nof tests where they would they would\ninject your arm with vitamin C which\nmakes it feel like it's breaking somehow\nI don't even know how it would hurt so\nbad and then they would measure the\nnerve activity in your leg which I still\nfeel like I can\nfeel how many times I got stuck with\nthat and uh the one time they put these\nlike thin like acupuncture needles the\nwhole way straight through your\nlike four of them like one end of the\nother are you sure you weren't in the\nmovie Saw I don't\nknow it was a crazy time but and then\nthen you get like 50 bucks in a lunch\nvoucher and you and everyone in the band\nwould do these yeah like we were their\nmain clients we get the first people to\ncall they just where they be like hey\nfarewell flight is here yeah honestly\nthey would we they'd be like yeah we\njust saw Timmy he's got his crackers and\nlunch vouchers did I meet\nTimmy you might have met it once who's\nthe one who has the Keen Ted too that's\nMark Mark okay yeah you I think you\nmight you might have met him he does\nlive he actually lives in Baltimore now\nbut yeah I thought it was weird that I\nwas I used to listen to the song on\nSpotify that was one of your bandmates\nsongs I still think it's a great song oh\nyeah that's right I forget the name of\nthe song though um I'm trying to\nremember which one you listen to It's\none wor like pretend that you just\npretend that you love me yeah um um\nwhat's the name of it though anyways his\nname's luer r l l u KR check out his\nmusic it's great yeah I his voice is\nreally good yeah no and I I was\nlistening to him and Robbie goes what\nare you listening to yeah and I said\nthat he go I used to be in a band with\nthat guy I like that was my lead singer\num yeah and then so boats was last so\ndid the boats yeah so\nthe uh the other kids or sorry the other\nguys in my band so they when I left the\nband they moved to\nNashville and you left you broke up the\nband uh a drummer once I announced my\ndeparture our drummer was also Mark was\nlike the I think it was the writing was\non the wall I don't think it's that\ncrazy then the other guys moved to\nNashville and they they wrote songs with\na lot of other people and played country\nwith country music artists like I would\nthink that such a hard road unless you\nhave that success yeah and even if you\nhave the success then you got to try to\nrepeat it but it's just everybody wants\nit everybody is trying to do it and if\nyou're out there in a van and you're\nfreezing in the middle of Kentucky or\nwherever you were yeah\neating you know AR sandwiches because\nthat's what you can get yeah the will to\ncontinue going on and to continue\npushing in that direction has to hit a\nlimit at some point yeah yeah no exactly\nwhich it did I mean\nyeah it's it's hard it was hard and\nso I think I was\ndefinitely it it was a\nweird leaving that was tough and then\nmoving to Baltimore because I didn't\nknow anyone in Baltimore besides my wife\nand then but she didn't she lived in\nAnnapolis at the time and time she\nwasn't your wife right and so and so I\ndidn't really have any friends and it's\na huge you don't understand how much of\nit how much of a lifestyle change that\nis because when I was in the band if you\nthink about 3 weeks I've never been as\nclose to people anyone in my whole life\nmost people aren't we would be with each\nother literally 24 hours a day where\nyou're playing together drinking\ntogether sharing the van traveling\ntogether sleeping on the same floors\nnext to each other it's I I it it's\nalmost like being in war not in that way\nbut I understand I never understood why\npeople want to go back to war mean like\ncamaraderie yeah and I never understood\nwhy why would you want to go back to war\nyou're at home why would you sign up\nagain but I totally get it because\nthat's it feels like a whole piece of VI\nis missing when you have that it's not\nthe war aspect it's not the danger it's\nnot the depression it's like that part\nof being close to people like that and\nthen having being completely out of that\nit's like really hard to deal with so\nthat was actually pretty difficult for\nme at the time um because we just stay\nup till 4:00 a.m. talking and drinking\nand hanging out like was it this is\nbefore I mean I think phones were like\niPhones had just come out but it wasn't\nlike it is now like we you wouldn't be\nscrolling Instagram at night right so\nwas like we all just hung out all the\ntime and talked and honestly that's\nwhere it's weird cuz I think some people\ndo like this podcast because we have a\ngood sense of humor and I don't know I\nfeel like I'm pretty good sometimes with\nthinking of things on the fly but all my\nlike anything all my humor or I don't\nknow responses and things like that all\ncame from them or and practicing that\nfor years on end cuz we'd all just riff\noff each other and I'm not saying like\nI'm a professional comedian but I'm\nsaying like I like it's easy it's easy\nto just like flow in conversation and\nlet things like and think of things in\nthe fly because we would always just be\nhanging out and talking and RI riffing\noff each other and all my friends are 10\ntimes funnier than me like I'm not even\nclose to being the like it's like it's\npretty yeah anyways and so we so that\nwas hard getting out of that and then I\nhad to transition to living in\nBaltimore and like when I wasn't when\nBoats were done for the season I I Barb\nbacked at salanta Irish Pub down at Fel\nPoint still there yeah and that was that\njob was actually pretty rough too\nbecause I don't that that one dealing\nwith what you had to deal there yeah I\nremember when Brandon came on board and\nhe was still part timing oh right at rip\ntie at rip tie and I was like what' you\ndo this he's like I clean vomit off the\ntoilet and had to mop out diarrhea all\nover the floor and I'm like dude how\nmuch do you need how how much do we need\nto pay you to so you don't have to go\nback there yeah yeah no that kind of\nstuff and um and that was wild because I\nworked in kitchens my whole life and\nthere was always unsavory characters but\ncoming to Baltimore like the first cook\nI met had murdered someone and was out\nlike and and just got out a couple years\nago or whatever and he was actually cool\nlike we all hung out together and but he\nwas in the black gorilla family which is\none of the most notorious gangs in\nBaltimore and it was just a weird crazy\nmix of people like being in a kitchen in\nBaltimore\nand but that feels like a similar\nlifestyle to the band life where like\nyou're up all night well that's why I\nkind of liked I had no problems living\nworking in a restaurant because I a I\nhad done it my whole life anyways and B\nit's like I kind of of like the pirate\nship mentality of it in a way and so\nthat was uh I did I did that in the\noffseason and stuff and just tried to\nsave up a lot of money that way and and\nthen I ended up the boat detailing thing\nwas like so hard and brutal and wasn't\nworking out too well and a friend told\nme he worked for a military contractor\nfor the Department of Defense and was\nlike hey we have some openings and like\nthe technical writer position or\nsomething and so I I just wanted like a\nnormal job honestly for the first time\nin 12 or my whole life and that was so I\ntook that and what year was that that\nwas like when I was 30 so I was right\nwhen I got married yeah 30 okay and so\nthat was 12 years\nago\nand um and that was the other thing when\nI left the band 2o I\n[Music]\nthought that whole time I I was like oh\nI in my life I thought I was so old like\nI really did I thought I was like oh I'm\ndone I can't even I'm just going to I'm\nI'm bound to isn't it weird when you're\n26 you think that your life is it's over\ninsane and I thought I was bound to just\ndo manual labor garbage jobs my whole\nlife because I had a pretty low self\nworth at the time I was like there's\nno I don't even know what to do I don't\neven know what my skills are I literally\nhad no no idea I was just like I don't\nhave I haven't done anything since\nCollege as far as academically or in the\nreal Workforce what's my resume I lived\nout of a van for five years and weit at\ntables like I don't even know where to\nstart and so I honestly didn't even know\nI was like I'm never going to be able to\nmake money like I have a real job and so\nthen and Kimmy was like yes I do yeah\nyeah and then Kimmy had she had a real\njob so I was like let me get on that you\ngot Healthcare yeah um and yeah I mean\nit was crazy her that I don't know I\nthink your parents were a little what\nare you doing yeah like and that was\npart of why I wanted a normal job\nhonestly just to be proved to them that\nhad it somewhat together I've I've\nalways postulated that men and evolution\nof what we do in this world would have\nnever happened if we were content just\nnot having a spouse or having a partner\nbecause I think that most most of what\nwe do is to I mean think about it if if\nyou weren't trying to impress a woman\nyou would never comb your hair or dress\nor anything like that we'd all be still\nin the caves we'd all be hanging out and\nI think that the motivation is okay I\ngotta do this I got to show that I can\nprovide for a family I got to show that\nI can do this it it makes people\nmotivates people to oh yeah before so\nbefore kimy and I got back together my\nplan was actually me and one of my best\nfriends we were just going to buy a boat\nand just live on it and just kind of bum\naround like that we were actually going\nto do that and because I I didn't know\nwhat else to do I was like might as well\njust kind of check out the world and\nbounce around like and then and then\nobviously yeah when I met her I was like\nokay I should probably get things\ntogether or when we got back together\nand so yeah so then I did that job for a\nwhile and\nthen like uh\nuh that contract ended in six months it\nwas like the shortest contract ever it\ngot cut almost right after I started and\nso then I had to find another job and I\nwas on unemployment and I was like dude\nI hate I hated unemployment that was\nprobably one of the worst times too I\nhate not working and so that was like\nnot that long it was only like six\nmonths but got an offer from the Coast\nGuard uh to work in there technical\ninformation Branch as a contractor so I\ntook that and then so then while I was\nat the Coast Guard this is before I had\nkids\nI\num I started going back to school cuz my\nwife worked at a community college so I\nwas like I got free classes so I figured\nmight as well pick up another either\ndegree or just learn\nmore and again I went\nto basically make money to show her\nparents that wasn't a dead beat and so I\nstarted getting into cyber security or\ncomputer\nnetworking I took like a bunch of\nsemesters of computer networking and I\ndid really well but I hated it it was\njust so mind numbingly boring and then I\nswitched to um web development so I was\nlearning that for a couple more\nsemesters and learn like JavaScript and\na bunch of stuff like that so kind of\ngot way into web\ndevelopment and then which is crazy\nbecause that was I I had a job offer\nfrom another place but then it was kind\nof like the same time as believe in the\nRun uh it was right after I started\nbelieve in the run and that was like\nsome agency that's in the cden yard's\nWarehouse I forget what it is um but so\nthat was like another path I was going\ndown but then running came into my life\nduring the time so then when I was at\nthe Coast Guard this is\n20 about N9 or 10 years ago\num so and I think I have told this story\nbefore on other a reference to but I\nlike the whole reason I started running\nwas because I had that I had uh oh so my\nfriends that that guy the medical doctor\nwho would come on tour with us whenever\nand just party with us he had friends uh\nhe lived in Brooklyn and so when we were\noff tour or going through New York City\nwe just go up to Brooklyn and hang out\nthere and party like everywhere and we\nwere basically doing a crawl through\nManhattan at on a Friday night or\nsomething and and we went past this\nplace where they were doing uh what do\nyou call it bone uh bone marrow donor\nlike matching stuff and he was like\nwe're doing this like everyone get in\nline you're gonna see if you can be a\nbone marrow donor like because we're all\nhammered and he's a doctor and we're\nlike whatever give me the last thing I'm\ndoing like if someone give me give me\nthe lollipop see yeah see you guys\nsomeplace else so we all got swabbed for\nit and then this is probably 2009 and\nthen 4 years later or something they I\ngot an\nemail from this company company that\nsaid you've been matched to be a bone\nmarrow donor like you match with someone\nI was like what the heck like what is\nthis and it like I had to think back\nlike it said the location of where it\nwas where I gave the donation and it\nkind of came back to me and I was like\nholy that's crazy so\nso I like looked into it and it\nseemed uh you know I don't know I guess\nyou save someone's life and doesn't seem\nlike a huge risk it's not like giving\nyour kidney or whatever yeah and I was\nlike whatever yeah I'll do it and so\nthey have to give you a huge physical\nbecause you know so you go they they\nflew people in from around the country\nto George Georgetown medical center\nCenter or whatever and I mean I just\ndrove down\nbut kind of pointless and so they give\nyou like a full scan\nMRI x-rays like\neverything and so the scan came back and\nthey said you have your the lymph nodes\nin your chest are enlarged and they look\nthey look\nabnormal so you need to\nsee um a cancer specialist\nso they recommended me to the University\nof Maryland Cancer Center or\nwhatever and obviously I'm like kind of\nfreaking out cuz I'm like that seems\nweird\nand they so I went there and obviously I\ncouldn't do the bone marrow thing so\nthat was pointless and then I went to\nthe medical center and they did a they\nlooked at the scans and the chest uh\nlike thoracic surgeon or whatever was\nlike oh you have yeah your lymph nodes\nare enlarged but you also have a mass on\nyour pancreas and I was like uh Google\nMass on pancreas oh I'm going to die six\nmonths was that that was that the like U\nPatrick suy Yeah thing yeah well\nwhenever you hear pancreatic cancer\nthat's like you assume it's over yeah or\neven if even if you don't from what I\nrecall even if it's not even if it's\nbenign or something you it's it means it\nsooner or later like it's like doesn't\nin because they can't really remove sure\nit's very hard to remove them so without\nmessing things up and so I don't think\nthat's the case anymore it might not be\nI don't know yeah but I recall at the\ntime it did not seem great so then they\nstart doing more tests on me and running\nme through stuff and it's taken a couple\nmonths so I'm just having I'm like in\nthis limbo spot in life where I'm trying\nto figure things out and so this is an\nfall of 20 I think it was 10 years ago\n2014 and\nthey at the time I Still Smoked and I\nwas like I'm I'm just done like I have\nto quit smoking cuz my wife had wanted\nme to quit forever and I've been trying\nquote unquote trying uh off and on and I\nwas like all right I just got to do it\nso Halloween night actually in Fell's\npoint was the last time well until I had\na cigarette after the brillian marathon\nbut um but that was the last time I\nsmoked for real\nand yeah we just partied hung out F\npoint and then that was yeah so November\n1st\n2014 just quit and uh after that I okay\nso then the scans and everything this\ntook like six months and they went\nthrough they did a endoscopic\nultrasound where they knock you out and\nthen go down put a camera stuff down\nyour throat look around or whatever I\nthink that's what they did is that what\nthey did sounds great\nand they they were like oh you don't\nhave anything\nwrong I was like see that's cool Megan\nmade me go to the doctor a while back\nand I go and he says it looks like\nthere's something wrong on your neck\nhe's like you know it could be a cancer\npup or something yeah so I freak out for\nlike a week because you have to get the\nscan you got to go get the results for\ntwo weeks I'm sitting there\nbasically Sweating Bullets so I know how\nyou feel but your sounds even worse yeah\nsix months in pancreatic cancer sounds a\nlot worse but I I went and they're like\nnow you're fine and I'm like what this\nis why I don't go to the doctor I mean\nyeah I mean\nso\nthe it's still honestly it still angers\nme a because my medical bills are\n$20,000 but because my wife had great\nInsurance she worked for the\nState uh it was pretty much nothing\nright wow so but imagine if I didn't\nhave medical insurance or anything like\nthat all because you decided drunkenly\nto get SW for marrow to help someone\nmoral the story don't help anyone no\nbone marrow and so keep that bone marrow\nto yourself but it really did give me a\nlot of distrust\nin not I'm not saying that they weren't\nwell intention whatever but I'm like\nthat's a big deal like that's a\nlife-changing deal in so many ways to\npeople yeah you could have sold your\nhouse yeah like in so many ways and he\nwas just like oh yeah I guess we read\nthe scan wrong or something like he\nliterally put his hands on my stomach\nand was like yeah I feel it right there\nlike he told me that to my face now do\nyou always feel that spot and like is\nthere something there well that's funny\ncuz when I was doing that I was like oh\nI feel too but it was probably just I\ndon't know a rib one time one time I was\nat the doctor it was a MC rib that I\njust ate and he's like oh you got to be\ncareful you might have a hernia tear at\nsome point now I always feel that area\nlike is it is it is is it happening is\nit\nhappening yeah and um I don't know it's\njust always it still makes me mad at\nthis day and and I mean I just look at\nat the silver line was that I quit\ncigarettes and started being more active\nso I started I was going to say so this\nis your story into running is all from\nstemmed from this yeah because then I\nstarted just finding other things to do\nwell if you think about that even though\nif you'd had to pay that 20 grand it\nwould have been an investment it was\nalmost like college tuition into getting\ninto running this job yeah that's true\nand so I started\nriding the bike I still have I the\nsingle speed I just started riding that\naround doing like all over the city and\nwherever so that started to get me a\nlittle bit more fit and then a couple\nyears later I don't know it was I was\njust looking for a new challenge because\nI had done a lot of bike packing stuff\nand things like that but for some reason\nI just I always like kind of hate it\nRunners and I was nerds every yeah\nthey're all wearing these short shorts\nthey talk about marathons oh I ran a\nmarathon blah blah blah there was a\ndifferent there was a group that was a\nlittle different in Baltimore yeah yeah\nand uh and so at the time I was I I I I\ntold myself I was going to run a\nmarathon I was like I'm just going to do\nit to do it just to check it off say I\nran a marathon be like that's not a big\ndeal whatever and a friend of mine who\ndid run she was like I think you should\nprobably do a half marathon first which\nwas very good advice that was the\nopposite advice I got yeah really and so\nI did uh did a half marathon first and I\nI started I ran with Charm City run to\nstart out for because they did they have\ntraining groups and so I trained for the\nrovus beach half marathon so that was my\nfirst one um um and I finished in just\nover two hours 2011 I\nthink but it felt amazing I was like\nthis is crazy and when I first started\nrunning it was like awful it was so bad\nI couldn't run a half a mile at all I\nremember just running down to the\nWaterfront and then coming back and\nCounting Cars to like mentally get to\nthe next one you know what I mean yeah\nor just were you getting cramps or what\nwas going on just I couldn't it just\nsucked like you know and you're starting\nfrom zero yeah so that's basically from\nyour house that's about a mile yeah and\nit was you know what pace not I mean I\nactually probably was running fine I was\nprobably running harder than I should\nhave been um but it's probably like yeah\nprobably 10minute Pace honestly probably\n9:30 or 10 and yeah I was it was so\nawful but then I just kept sticking to\nit and\nobviously by halfway into the half\nmarathon training I was like all right\nlike actually starting to like this and\nthen yeah first half marathon felt\nawesome finished pretty strong and then\nkind of went from there but then so I\nwas looking for other running groups\nbecause the Charm City run group was\ncool to start out as far as I had no\nidea what to do with running or anything\nuh I still forget my was my first Nike\nshoe my first running shoe is the Nike I\nremember about the arrival but that was\nis it was a Nike it was a gray with the\nlike gray and yellow yellow highlighter\naccents with it wasn't the structure it\nwas uh no I know what you're talking\nabout it was a react not it was pre-\nreact or it's the one I Ran New York in\nI think um yeah yeah I think you told me\nit was a stability shoe though it was\nyeah um it was a cool looking shoe yeah\nbut I remember yeah it's going to drive\nme nuts it had fly Wire yeah yeah I I\nknow exactly what picture of the shoe\nbut I can't remember so that was my\nfirst shoe and I think my second was the\nPegasus 33 or 32 I had both of those at\nthe same time and uh and then my first\nmarathon was the Houston Marathon 2015\n2016 2016 I think and so\nI but yeah so then I was looking for a\ndifferent running group because no\noffense the Charm City run but the vibe\nwas\nit just like wasn't my people it's fine\nlike but I I wanted someone where it\nfelt like I was in a band again because\nthat's the kind of people I hung out\nwith it was like people who may or may\nnot smoke or drink or like it's just RIS\ntake you know different they look\ndifferent than normal Runners well to\nget neon and we were wear we had\ntattoos we enjoyed partying as much as\nrunning yeah so and so found faster\nbasts on Instagram which is crazy\nbecause a there weren't really that many\nrun Crews back then and not really many\non\nInstagram and I didn't know that I just\nthought I was just looking on Instagram\nfound it and I thought oh this is just\nnormal and at the time it was wasn't\nthat many people in the faster bastards\nprobably there was two cycles to faster\nbastards so that in the time when we\ncame down and were running in Baltimore\nwhere you would have joined yeah it was\na steady crew of Megan Gavin probably\nfive to 10 people Steve lewit yeah\nuh uh cats yeah Steve and Adam and that\nwas pretty much the weekly crew and and\nthen it was kind of funny because Eric\nSchulman started coming out but it was\nit was a group of about i' say 10 people\nthat were hardcore there every week and\nother people started looping in but\neverybody that came out at that time\nexcept for Megan and Gavin doesn't have\nany tattoos but everybody else was\npretty much tatted up and wearing all\nblack yeah like yeah and I thought that\nwas cool and so I dm' faster faster\naccount and asked about runs and didn't\nhear back from anyone for like three two\nmonths so that person would be Thomas\nyeah I doubt it was three months I I no\nit was it was probably just like three\nweeks or two or three weeks but yeah um\nI think I had started I think I I think\nI figured out like how to get how to get\nthere anyways so um it was in the bio\nweekly run class yeah I think I were you\npre Wednesdays or were like with\nWednesday is already a thing when you\ncame on no I think I was pre okay\nbecause it it started off as like a\nweekly 10 mile run on Saturdays it was\njust that yeah yeah and so that was in\nyeah I was probably like 2016 or\nsomething like that and so started\nrunning with the faster basts and\nobviously I got into really got into\nrunning that was\nlike most Runners know when you get\nreally into when you first start running\nthere's that first learning curve and\nthen once you're in it then it's oh I\nwant to do every race I want to do this\nI want to do this so that was pretty\nexciting and at the time I only had one\nkid\nso I still had there's some flexibility\nFreedom when I first start I didn't I\nthink my wife was\npregnant yeah she so my first marathon\nhe my kid was 8 months old my first\nmarathon yeah yeah cuz I\nremember I'd known you'd come out to\nlike one or two runs at the time and\nthere was a first Thursday concert and\nit was after we made the one hat and I\nlike looked over and I saw the black one\nyes I saw you at the at the first\nThursday concert wearing the hat and I\ndidn't know you well enough at that time\nto like\neven though we probably run together I\ndidn't I didn't go up and be like hey\nwhat's up oh yeah or anything like that\nlike I just you went you used to go to\nfirst Thursday concerts look at you yeah\nyou used to leave the house that's crazy\num and I think you had a like a baby\nwith you yeah it's probably why I didn't\nsay hello I'm like I'm not getting no\nyeah he would have been he would have\nbeen like one at the time or something\nmaybe less than that but anyways it was\nuh that's when I really started getting\ninto running and then when I was doing\nstuff with the faster basts I would do\nwe I don't I think I don't know how it\ncame about but I would do these runs\ncalled Redline runs I know how it came\nup was it just no he it was very\nspecific okay so you came up to me one\ntime and you're like I'm tired of doing\nthe same run every week you could we do\na different run and I was like yeah\nabsolutely if you want to organize it\nwe'll put it in the email yeah and do it\nand I at the time was like oh his name\nis readinger let's do a red Line run\nyeah and there was a two different\nthings going on there's a red line which\nwas going to be a extension of the light\nrail MH east to west in Baltimore yeah\nwhich people were like all pissed off\nabout which is coming back oh it is\ncoming back okay so people were all mad\nabout that and then I didn't know the\npolitical yeah I didn't either term for\nred line so we put out we're doing this\nRed Line run where a bunch of dudes with\ntattoos and everything like that well\nand redlining like to the Limit yeah\nthat's what we were thinking matter of\nfact would I think it was more Redline\nlike that is what I was thinking yeah um\nso you put it together uh I believe the\nfirst one the f I remember the first one\nthe first one was crazy it start\nbasically started by my house and then\nwe went up\nto basically Herring Run Park but we had\nthis wild route that I was like let's\njust do something real weird I think\npeople were freaked out cu you had to go\nthrough like uh I remember field or\nsomething yeah I was like over railroad\ntracks over these guard rails threw a\nhole in the fence uh I remember somebody\ncomplaining they're like dude we're\nwalking in like it Dave Bush I remember\nit was it he's like it was it was like\nthigh high Thorn\nbushes they weren't happy that was the\neasy part um and there was a bunch of\ncrazy stuff but I was like yeah welcome\nto my world this is what happens and so\nand I ended at the Venice Tavern which\nis great good Afterparty so then I\nstarted doing those every month or two\nand that was a lot of fun we had some\ngood runs in that I wish I need to bring\none of those back maybe sometime I\nremember a horrible one we did that went\non that Park I is that pig town over\nthere yeah oh when it was raining yeah\nand it was like hot rain though it was\nlike steamy yeah and it was a lot of\nhills and I'm just like H but the the\nbar hang out was cool though the bar was\ncool but it was air conditioned so we\ncame in from being like hot and sweat I\nbrought a jack I think I came prepared I\nthink I brought a change of clothes with\nme yeah I I ended up scootering to the\nstart of that one so I I wrote a scooter\nto that one I remember that's when first\nscooters first came out yeah I was like\nyeah so then I basically\ngot uh we were running with the faster\npass but I was still working at the\ncoast guard and doing that full time I\nwas just hat like I was reaching the end\nof my rope there because I was in a I\nwas in one of those jobs that Elon Musk\nis gonna cut on day\n[Music]\none um but no actually it's not going to\nget cut because it's part of the\nhomeland security and they have their\nbudgets tied up but it was frustrating\nbecause I worked in I worked in\ngovernment this is like classic\nbureaucratic government so I'm in\ngovernment work in a cubicle probably\nhad to do four hours of work a week and\nthat wasn't everyone there but just the\nposition that I was in and there was\nnobody cared and nobody was pulling the\nsame on the team so I was just like well\nwho cares and so that was sucking my\nsoul\ndry and I just had to get out of cubicle\nworld or especially government and I\njust remember this one time a friend who\nat work who's was great guy but he's\njust a straight government lifer and he\nhad this spreadsheet like an Excel\nspreadsheet of every one of his GS steps\nand his promotional rates and how that\nwould look like when he turned 62 or\nwhatever or 65 jeez and it was laid out\neach year exactly looks like Severance\nyeah and I that was the moment where I\nwas like I got to get out I can't I\ncan't do this and and it was crazy be\nand so and what happened so I had been\nthinking about this for a while and then\nyou and me and Ryan d one time were\nhanging out at a bar watching a Browns\ngame watching Browns Steelers game I\nthink might have been yeah at uh at a\nbar in Canton and we got to talk in and\nI had been writing for believe in the\nRun yeah\nyou my favorite was uh we got an Epson\nwatch that looked like a looked like a\nhome printer and it was like big and\nbulky and they're like do you want to\nreview this I'm like I don't but Robie\nyou do technical writing he's like yeah\nI'm like you want to review this he's\nlike yeah I'll review it dude I think I\nwrote 3,000 words on Epson GPS watch was\ninsane which was also a piece of yeah it\nwas a horrible watch GPS watch like\nEpson who makes the printers like why\nare you making\nthis um and and I would I also started\nshuffling um like any shoe I didn't want\nto review yeah like hey Robbie thanks\nwell hey that we do it to you it's\nactually I when you especially when you\nfirst start reviewing everyone you want\nany shoe you can get so I don't I got\nyou but it also I think honestly we\nstill do that with our reviewers they're\nnot going to get the like when they like\nto go back to your pig rendering days\nthey're not going to get the good pieces\nthey're going to get the leftovers until\nthey kind of prove themselves and move\nup or oh I never even said what scrapple\nwas so oh yeah scrapple is when you\nafter you butcher the pig and have like\nall the normal cuts off yeah you put\neverything into and they make the\nsausage and everything you put the rest\nof the pieces into and just dry them up\nmeat like anything ears okay so it's\njust the pieces you don't use and then\nthey put cornmeal to bind it let's move\non past that one yeah so that's not\nthat's not like you don't go where I\ngrew up in California yeah not once did\nI ever see scrapple on the menu yeah\nright I don't think it's a West at all\nbut out here people love it there's a\nwhole festival for it on the we just\ngave a bunch to my brother-in-law\nyesterday or Sunday yeah um but anyway\nso that was scrapple but then you're at\nthe bar talk we're hanging out talking\nand I think it came up well like\nbasically I went to leave the job or\nlike find a way to work for believe in\nthe run or big run\nmedia and yeah you were like I think you\njust flat out ass you say hey I want to\nwork there and I was like dude I wish\nyou had said this a week ago we hired\nthis dude oh that's right and he was\nhorrible yeah uh the guy still he stole\nmoney from us yeah and I was like his\nwife was an employment attorney so he\nprobably knew like uh cuz what had\nhappened was we had to let him go and\nthen a check went through afterwards\nlike it was on auto autopay or something\nlike that like hey bud you know that\nthat's not for you could you yeah send\nit back and at that time Big R media was\njust starting out pretty much so the\namount of money that that was was not\ninsignificant to us right and so you\nwould say hey and I was like dang so I\nwent I'm like B we got to fire this\nother guy I said\nI don't know I said maybe to you I said\nlet me talk to me or something yeah I\nthink that is what he said and I and I I\ntalked to me and I was like look he\nhe''s been writing for us I think it\nwould be good you know he can help out\nwith big run\nmedia and him and I can work on some\nbelieve in the Run stuff on the side\nyeah because believe in the run at this\npoint that started in 2009 this is\nprobably how long have you been with us\nnow six years yeah so 6 years ago 2019\nand believe in the run at that time was\nstill like\nnot a h it was more than a hobby but it\nwasn't a business right and so you came\non and make said it's fine as long as we\nfocus on Big Run media right right yeah\nand by the way side and so I\nwas once I got the green light I I told\nthe Coast Guard or my contractor at the\nCoast Guard I was gonna I was gonna quit\nwhich was they had just switched\ncontractors like my contractor lost the\nbid and got passed off to another one\nwhich is pretty normal and that\ncontractor the head of the branch at the\ncoast guard the government guy he really\nloved me and he was like you have to\nkeep them and so they were they were\nbasically willing to offer me whatever I\nwanted to stay there and I turned it\ndown cuz I just like I don't like it was\npretty decent pay uh uh and like it was\ndefinitely a pay and I'm not saying like\nto say it was P like I know what you\nonly had so much money I understand that\nno let's let's we'll be real here when\nwe hired you we didn't have any money to\npay you so when we when we um we gave\nyou like I think we talked about a a\nsalary at the time yeah and so we're\nlike okay Megan we'll we'll just give it\na shot if it doesn't work out well you\ntold me you I think you told me like\nlook we don't have any money I was like\nwell this is I understand and this is\nlike what I can do yeah which is I think\nwhat you said so we were cool with it\nand then we I go back to me I go H I\ndon't know how we're going to pay for\nthis guy but I think we'll be able to\nfigure it out and me me and I were\npretty optimistic at the time we were\nable to pick up clients and stuff like\nthat so we're like we'll we'll we'll\nmake sure it happens and it wasn't I\nwould say just so it doesn't sound like\nI was asking for a ton of money I think\nit was it was normal money but but but\nfor a small business starting it's a the\nbusiness was myself Megan and one other\nemployee Rachel at the time so any money\nmore than that more than zero but here's\nthe thing so we were yeah more than zero\nif if you had said $10 a week we'd been\nlike I don't know where we're got um the\nbut we were at that time kind of like\nsubletting for my brother his office\nright and so we weren't paying rent\neither right we were doing work for him\nto kind of cover that cost so you came\non that week\nmy brother and I had a disagreement or\nmisunderstanding of some sort and now we\nno longer\nhad the office well not only that we\nlost our biggest contract that we had\nthe same week yeah from a from actually\nit's a government contract technically\nthe Navy oh right the Army Navy uh\n10mile right um that we were working on\nso we lost that which we just had a a\nmeeting like two weeks before that\nthey're like we're going to build this\nup we're going to do it you guys did a\ngreat job we love how it went last time\nhow can we spend more money with you and\nthen I then the um their I guess their\nbudget board or whatever was like we're\nnot going to do a 10 mile anymore or\nhalf marathon and and so they just wiped\nit out and they're like sorry we don't\nhave a half we're not and I'm like you\nguys just got rid of the race they're\nlike yeah they will NE they will not be\nthat race anymore wow which is kind of\nodd but that sounds like a government\nthing like oh we'll cut that oh yeah um\nso we were like okay we just lost our\noffice we lost our biggest client and we\njust took somebody on a salary so you\ndon't know behind the scenes Megan and I\nare kind of sweating it out yeah and\nwe're like we'll figure it out there's\nlots of nights where we would go to bed\nand right before bed I'm like we're\ngonna be okay right's like yeah we'll be\nall\nright meanwhile she's probably flipping\nover going we're going down but um and\nso you came on and uh\nI just remember it was\nlike I was torn\nbecause I I wanted Megan to get the help\nshe need on big run me but I also you\nknow I I love right the believe in the\nRun side and you were gravitating\ntowards so poor Megan's over here going\nwhat are you guys doing I mean\nyeah I mean I saw like huge potential\nfor it and I was like I feel like if I\ncan I worked a lot and I feel like in\nthe evenings too and I was like if I can\njustify this making money then I can\nwork I mean the whole goal is like work\nand running you know like do what like\nyou love and I was like but I felt like\nI understood like like the\nlike not it wasn't at the time a\nfruitful Endeavor I remember you and I\ngoing on but I also understood if I\ncould just prove that it'll make money\nyeah but you and I went on meetings with\nlike people who were like Hey how do we\nmake this viable remember that yeah and\nuh I I remember going through and the\nguy's like H maybe I should do more on\nYouTube like yeah and we're like thanks\nthat's helpful yeah\num but yeah I don't know it's it's weird\nbut I\nmean and it was like the groundwork was\nalready there of course cuz you had been\ndoing it and it was and I like I was\njust like if we can all do this like\njust figure this out yeah I think this\nis a thing the best thing that happened\nto us was the pandemic to the business\nyeah I mean it forced us to do exactly\nwhat you wanted to do the whole time\nwhich and it worked out that it was\nprobably good I was like focusing on\nthat like no it definit like the fact\nthat when we were doing stuff like you\nand I were working on uh believe in the\nRun yeah I know it wasn't always making\nyou happy B but like I was like oh I've\ngot someone to work on believe in the\nwrong way yeah\nyeah but it did like it all worked out\nit is weird how well and this is what I\nwas talking about even when I had that\nshitty job and I'm like what's the point\nof this like it's sometime it is weird\nhow that works where sometimes you don't\nunderstand how it can like the Pand like\nin some ways it's I guess well you\nreally because it's believe in the Run\nbasically saved the pan I mean the\npandemic saved it without believe in the\nrun I feel like media because big run\nmedia is all the clients dropped off\nright yeah yeah no they the uh the first\ngrit pretty much saved yeah like the gr\nthat right there was sa believe the run\nand then yeah I I think there was a few\nthings that fell into place that were\nthe huge I honestly starting to do some\nof the the work that we did with some of\nthe brands and the stuff because they\ndidn't know what to do during pandemic\nright so we started doing some of those\nInstagram live things which really uh we\nstarted we started the podcast and even\nthe website where more people started\nrunning so then traffic and then somehow\nwe figured out the ad Marketplace for\nthat which helped well the website is\ncertainly\nlike I I am so proud of this work that\nyou've done on the website like the\nthanks the\nwebsite and I know that even internally\nlike sometimes we'll have like um adjust\na position of how we want to approach\nsomething and I think that the more that\nI've kind of like backed off and let you\nkind of like figure out some of the\nstuff without\ninterjecting as much has been beneficial\nlike I think that your the stuff that\nyou've done to uh really take it from\nbeing sort of like a hobbyist website to\nnow being like a media website yeah and\nthe work um so just behind the scenes\nfor people listening some of the stuff\nthat that Robbie's done uh for us is\nlike we knew that we need to update the\nwebsite Robbie had a friend that you\nwere connected with through I think it\nwas through the kids or something uh oh\nyeah like it was one of Kimmy's best\nfriends yeah yeah so we worked with um\nwork with them to redo the website well\nwas like Kim a friend of Kim's friend\nsorry but anyways yeah I knew them\ntangentially and they were Runner which\nactually I don't even know if I knew\nthey ran at the time but fantastically\ntalented yeah um uh Drexler DX Drexler\num in they're based out in Baltimore\nfantastically talented on the website\nside but like I\nthink the structure and the like\neverybody has different strengths\nin our on our team and I think that your\nability to kind of like structure things\nand look at things from a\nlike skeleton almost like okay here's\nwhat we need and why it makes sense on\nthe website especially um you really\nnailed and worked with the Drexler team\nand I found myself you know I'm more\nconcerned like I'm a visual person and\nso always forever I prided ourselves on\nbelieveing the r i felt was more was\nmore was better looking than anything\nelse out there mhm but maybe\nfunctionally wasn't always right and\nthen you brought that in and kind of\nlike really turned it into what is to\nsomething it is interesting because this\nis it is funny how like I think\nabout this goes for anyone who feels\nlike they're lost in Life or feel like\nwhatever path of taking isn't right\nbecause I do think there are people a\nlot of people more people than like to\nadmit that are um what do you call it\nlike there's a term for but they\nbasically just not job collectors but\ntheir path is very indirect\nso I think a lot of people feel a\npressure when they get out of college to\nbe like ah I got to find my purpose and\njob or even by especially by the time at\n30 like this is everything that I felt\nbut then it just takes some people just\ntakes a different route like it was very\nJagged route\nyeah in a way but it's not but it's not\neven it's everything like the\nDIY punk band ethic of that grinding it\nout doing shitty\nstuff trying to scrape together business\nor fans that was like I didn't realize\nhow much value that provide it then you\njust like I said certain jobs dude\ndealing with waiting table for 10 years\nI don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about YouTube\ncomments like you can any YouTube every\nonce in a while you I mean every once in\na while like I'm sure you some but I let\nit just maybe in the moment but it never\nsits with me like I just there's you\ncan't if you have someone in your face\nin\nperson deriding you for not getting\ntheir food to them two seconds late or\nputting uh cold piece of broccoli in\nyour hand and saying like this [\u00a0__\u00a0]\nsucks like dude nothing you can't beat\nthat like no YouTube comments going to\nand so like that prepares you for stuff\nlike that for the social media side or\njust people criticisms you just let it\nroll over because it doesn't matter and\nthen stuff\nlike\nthe like even boat detailing stuff that\nwas kind of like business-minded\num well it's just like work ethic too\nand like like all of those jobs like you\nsaid like they're not none of them like\nwas the perfect trajectory to come here\nbut a little pie of all of them is like\ngives you all the skills but even the\nweb development stuff that was I know\nhow to talk to all the web developers\nand see like what we need how it looks\non mobile how it you know different\naspects of that work and so it's just\nweird how it all comes together um and\nactually real quick I I just thought of\nthis I didn't want to mention it because\nI do think this is like an super\nintegral part that I don't talk about\ntoo much but I think is was really\nimportant and everything was that when I\ngot out\nof when I got out of the band and I\nstarted trying to get a real job and\nstuff I didn't have any money to my name\nlike for real zero and my wife had\nsome um a little bit of money saved up\nbut we didn't we were renting we didn't\nmake a ton of money and but I had\n$35,000 in student loan debt which isn't\na ton but but you know at the time still\na lot like I deferred my payments\nforever or whatever or made minimum\npayments and\nso\nI\nwas uh financially I decided to we\ndecided to get completely out of debt\nlike just have nothing and so for a\ncouple years straight we just hammered\nthat down till we had no debt and so it\njust made that like a core aspect of our\nfinan lives so we didn't we've and I\nunderstand how you can leverage debt in\ncertain situations whatever whatever and\nlike technically uh you know it's better\nto\nput a car loan like if it's you get a\n2.7% interest rate whatever but it's\njust I don't like have any of that\nhanging over heads besides our mortgage\nnow and so this is that has been such a\nhuge thing for me because not having a\n$400 a month car payment and I'm not\njudging anyone who us but just this is\nmy like how it worked for me for Freedom\nso not yeah so I've always had that like\nfreedom to take risks so if I had so say\nwe were living and our house mortgage is\na very low percentage of our overall\nincome so I felt like like being setting\nmyself up setting ourselves up for that\nwhere we didn't have that hard like any\nbills you know and we we were able to\nsave up money so that gives you like a\nlanding pad to take that risk I feel\nlike that was a huge part of it because\nif I had if we had a ton of debt and a\nhuge mortgage payment and car loans\nthere's no way I would have been able to\nleave the Coast Guard like because it's\nnot like no I I hear that all the time\nfrom people who like there's tons of\npeople who would love to take the risk\nor jump and do something and they just\ncan't yeah because they boxed themselves\nin a corner whether it's because they\nneeded to have a car or wanted to have\nand and it doesn't always have to be\nlike a vanity thing like you know they\nspend too much on their credit card for\nclothing it's sometimes it's just it's\njust life like yeah I I know right now\nif there's a certain wide foot reviewer\nthat if you probably didn't have student\nloans would want to be want to be a\nbelieve in the run all the time yeah and\nI and I understand and honestly and\nsometimes it's just life and it is what\nit is but I we we worked really really\nhard and when we first got married at\nfocusing on that and sacrificing a lot I\nmean like we live pretty minimally and\nhave used cars I mean you guys are you\nhave one car that's like whatever and\nand I try to I don't I feel like you\nlike I don't buy anything really like\nwe'll go out to eat sometimes but\nobviously it's nice we get our shoes and\nrunning clothes and everything my\nbiggest expenses are maintenance for\nthis place right yeah and and that kind\nof thing but I felt like that I feel\nlike I always want to say that and\nmention that because it see it's it's\nnot like I just fell into something like\nI definitely like set myself up to to\ntry and be able to do things that I love\nto do or take risks because that's why I\nwas able to go from the Coast Guard\nwhich did pay like a a pretty high\nsalary for a government contractor\nanyways and then be able to say oh okayy\nlook I'm going to jump over here and\nthen do my best to work my way up you\nknow to build that so I can justify\nhaving you know bring myself back to\nwhere I was which worked out and but I\nthink that's a big deal to know that\nit's not like I'm just drifting around\nme like oh like let me just quit my job\nand just start over here I'm like I set\nthis is like a 10year setup you know\nlike so okay so it's kind of it's it's\nyeah so to to wrap this up yeah the\nlet's get into uh did you ever think in\nany\njob because you I think that your core\nis that you're a writer that you enjoy\nyeah writing and did you ever think\nyou'd be able to get a job where you\nwould get paid to go around the world\nand travel the way that you do yeah I\nthought when I was in a\nband which that's it's funny because\nit's pretty much the\nsame thing that when I was in a band\nthat's what I want to do the only\ndownside is that now I have kids in a\nfamily so like I always think if I was\nsingle in my 20s this would be the per\nlike like that I say that's the drawback\nof having a family and then having this\nin my 40s I'm\nlike why why not in my 20s I would go on\nevery lit like literally every single\ntrip well I think why you K didn't get\nit in your 20s is we like I\nfeel I almost feel like we you know\nwe've had people here that have been\nyounger M\nthat maybe thought this was normal\ncoming out of school and that's true too\nyeah and I don't think people understand\nthat like at that young age like really\nlike\nwhat what we able to do\nhere the fact that I I I can take an\nhour and a half out of my day or an hour\nout of my day we can sit here and talk\non microphone about our our path and\nstuff like that and just have a\nconversation that normally you would\nhave to reserve for a weekend meet up\nwith friends or or a bar thing that this\nis part of like what we do yeah like how\nare you going to appreciate that right\nand no and that's why coming from where\nI came from it's like yeah I I mean I\nknow like I actually know what it was\nlike to be broke and poor and even from\ngrowing up\nand like my whole life I mean just\ngrowing up and not having we didn't have\na lot of stuff growing up we never our\ncars are always breaking down like it\nwas yeah it was it was tough and then um\nand then coming to and then the whole\ntime to to the band and then just yeah\nit's it's been a lot but it's nice\nto\nsomehow even with believe in the run it\nwas like it\nalmost especially with a band that was\nso hard and worked so hard and got\nnothing out of it as far as success from\na out perspective I mean I was super\nvaluable and I loved it and I would\nnever take any of it back but the\nbut it almost seems too easy not easy\nbut I'm just glad it it's it's nice that\nit worked out as opposed to I feel like\nyou have Survivor syndrome yeah I mean\nlike why do I get this now no that's\ntrue I do yeah like uh or impostor\nsyndrome or whatever kind of similar\num and yeah it's it's definit I anytime\nthat I I know this job can get stressful\nand I know that we have our days where\nyou know it's not all sunshine and and\nwhatever yeah I just I just try I think\nback to being stuck at a desk or being\nin a cubicle or in some of the other\njobs I've had and how I felt like I was\ndoing nothing with my life and I had to\nwake up the next day and do it all over\nagain yeah that's the thing it's\nlike I was talking\nto uh friend of mine who\ndoes retirement planning this morning\nand cuz I I just wanted him to look over\nstuff and he they're talking about oh\nwhat about when you reach this age you\ncan retire you can quit I'm like dude\nI'm not going to retire like that's like\nit's a weird thing to me because I'm\njust not I never feel like I have to go\nto work and I'm never\nGNA even if even if I was in a job I\nwould just I'm always going to find a\nway to make I like doing stuff do you\nknow what I mean me and I don't think\nI'm ever well here's the thing I think\nthat most people when they think of\nretirement they think of that's when I\ncan do the things that I want to do\nright I think the difference is you are\nnow living in life where you're doing\nthe things you want to do yeah I guess\nthat's true and I feel very lucky about\nthat because I get it I I remember and I\nremember what it was like dreading\nMondays and dude the Sunday for Fridays\nwhen it used to Sunday night and it\nstarted rolling down you knew you start\nthinking about your what you had to get\ndown on the work and stuff now it's like\nI'm like oh jeez I got to write up that\nthat review for this year yeah like oh\nthis is awesome\nyeah it's crazy and I got to say for\nanyone else listening so aside from the\nsetting it up financially the other\nthing\nwas I I feel personally if how I set\nmyself up for this too and not that it\nwas technically intentional but just\nit's a byproduct is meeting people you\nhave to meet so many people if you\nreally want to set yourself up for\nSuccess you have to just meet everyone\nbecause everything I mentioned in the\nlast hour whatever we've been doing this\nall those things were someone remember I\nknew someone who knew someone in the\nband who were like oh you want a Bas\nplayer I found the water meter job was\nmy friend who worked for me the the boat\ncleaning was my brother the faster\nbastards was you the believe in the Rong\nwas you the Coast Guard but do all those\njobs everything was I knew somebody who\nknew somebody but I will tell you like I\nalso think to to say what you're uh to\nadd on to what you're saying people send\nus emails all the time and if you have\nno connection to us I don't have a face\nwe don't have any emotional connection\nto you we don't have any responsibility\nto your mom your friend or anybody to be\nkind and and actually see what you're\nsending you kind of have to find a\ndifferent hustle angle and I have to say\nthe other day I was getting a FedEx\npackage delivered and the guy was like\nHey I see you're a media company can I\nget a job I was like what do you do and\nhe sent me his stuff and followed up and\nI'm like ah this is hustle and it is to\nyour point he he's out there meeting\npeople he happens to be doing from a\nFedEx truck yeah but he had the nuts to\nbe like hey yeah I see that you're doing\nthis are you looking for anybody yeah\nand I've done that stuff like a lot in\nlife where you just you got to yeah you\ngot to make yourself memorable and and\nwhat do you say to someone that's shy\nand doesn't feel confident going out\nthere and doing that I don't know you\njust have to do it's just like one of\nthose things and I used to be shy I used\nto be non-confrontational I used to hate\nall of that stuff I get it but you don't\nhave to talk to everybody but you should\nbe talking to people in the areas\nlike yeah I mean I don't know you have\nto go to the extent that I go which is\nliterally everybody making friends on\nthe airplane yeah we're on the airplane\nand I'm just trying to put on my noise\ncancelling headphones so I don't have to\ntalk to anybody and Robert is getting a\nlife Story the lady next yeah to him um\nbut that also opens more doors depends\nwhat you're looking for but there's I\nguess I'm not opening doors at this\npoint yeah um I'm closing doors I've met\npeople in all kinds of ways that have\nled to other things just yeah that have\nworked out so it's I think that's a huge\nthing in building connections it's just\nif you have a bigger Network you have so\nmany more options and not saying and I\nand I hate networking things like if you\ngo to a networking thing because\neveryone there is just out to get\nsomething I don't mean that that was\nwhen I talk about jobs I hated I had a\njob where they like made you go to\nnetwork yeah there's nothing worse than\na networking event right cuz everyone\nyou're just everyone it's like being in\nDC everyone there is just to like want\nit leg up on the next thing yeah and\nit's I've run into a couple of those in\nthe running industry lately really those\ndudes that are like uh hey let me get\nyou know they want to exchange car just\nbe cool just like just just be cool just\nhang out like there's so many ways to do\nthat um and just be I guess just be real\nbut I'd say those are like the most\nlooking back it's like that's definitely\nthe most\nsuccessful setting yourself up\nfinancially as best you can uh I would\nsay living below your means especially\nbecause like if you that's the other\nthing it's like I know no matter what\nhappens I can get a job like because if\nI if I don't need a lot of stuff if I\ndon't like keep my material cost slow\nand I can just get a job anywhere and as\nlong as I can cover my rent and stuff\nlike that I I feel like I can make it\nyou know and I understand it's not\nthe especially as you grow up and you\nhave kids you have stuff like this like\nthere are for sure bills and\nresponsibility it might not be the same\nas when you're 21 but I definitely feel\nlike if you can just do those things set\nyourself up financially meet\npeople like kind of go out of your way\nto do that and and\nthen um and just look for ways like the\nI know that's a stupid thing like the\nlaw of attraction or whatever the what's\nthat book the secret secret secret but\nit is true like I have noticed that and\nI've never read the book or bought in\nbut if you were essentially focused on a\ngoal or something I don't know how it\nworks I don't know how it happens but\nthe world does come around to make it\nhappen but you have to be all in on it\num so believe in the Run yeah what's\nbeen your favorite like memory or thing\nthat you've done what's the thing that\nyou're proudest of or just something\nthat like when you think of it you're\nlike this was all worth\nit\n[Music]\nuh that last little tidbit really got\nhim yeah this is all worth it yeah um\nmaybe don't go that far just maybe a\nhighlight from believe in the run a\nhighlight um I mean going to the\nOlympics was insane yeah that's like\njust I mean\nbecause I remember watching the Olympics\nwhen I\nfirst started I believe in the no when I\nfirst started running I remember\nwatching in Rio I remember watching the\nRio Olympics and\nthinking like how would I ever be at the\nOlympics you know I think that was was\nKip chogi uh kipi was there I think that\nwas also thean that's when gayen Ru got\nthird yeah and Dez did kogi win didn't\nhe win in Rio yeah and so I remember\nwatching that and being and I didn't\neven know who a lot of them were at the\ntime and and thinking like that was so I\nmean I remember what was\nit I remember there was times in the be\nvery beginning when there was other\nreviewers who would get invited to\nthings like I think there's an A6 event\nout in the desert or something oh you're\ntalking about that I remember this yeah\nit was the\num Glide ride and it was a red Glide\nride they went out to the Salt Flats and\nthey just said hey just start running\nyeah and like and even just like these\nlittle things where I was like like that\nH like I want that to happen I have no\nidea how to make that happen but\njust like going in that direction um\nthis is what I mean like the law of\nattraction I feel like it's kind of like\nI always think about Indiana Jones in\nthe Last Crusade when he like there's\nthe bridge he has to step across to get\nto the Holy Grail room or whatever and\nit's kind like a leap of faith really\nbut he just walks and thinks like I just\ngot to like go in that direction and\nwhen my foot hits it'll land on\nsomething and that's how I\nfelt it's always been for a while like\nin the beginning and then eventually you\njust like you keep making more steps and\nthen it keeps like the path lays out in\nfront of you in a way\nand I CU remember I I remember like we\nwere trying to like get deals with like\nsock Brands and stuff and koros was the\nfirst company that ever paid for\nanything like first brand company they\npaid for like a Instagram at like post\nor something it's like a th000 bucks and\nand anyways I just felt\nlike I know it's not company you're\nthinking of yeah but I just imagine like\nthere I didn't couldn't imagine how we\nwould ever run Tokyo Marathon\nor\num or even Boston or New York City any\nof those things or go get in even just\ntalk to someone at TR that's the thing\nthat I think was for me is the having\naccess to the people that are actually\nworking on the shoes yeah that was that\nthat felt like something special to me\nthat I I was able\nto like find out what they're thinking\ngive them my opinion and have them be\ninterested in in hearing our opinion\nlike that that that was as like big as\nthe travel to me here's the no this is\nthe craziest thing the craziest thing to\nme is\nthat you can like you can walk around\nprobably now and look at people's shoes\nthat they're wearing and be like\nsomething I wrote or talked about when\nin I know for a fact that things that we\nsaid change the way that that shoe is\nlike like there's certain changes to\nshoes that I know happen because of\nreviews we've written and that's insane\nbecause that's hundreds of thousands of\npairs in the world or whatever Millions\nwe're part of the industry in a yeah and\nthat's a pretty I mean that's I just\nfeel like that's that's crazy honestly\nyou should not be taking our advice yeah\nI also love it when we hear from uh like\nrunning retail people who work in the\nindustry and they're like yeah I I look\nat you guys reviews so that I can like\ntalk intelligently about the shoes that\nare coming in because they don't get a\nchance to try all the shoes so they'll\npull up our reviews and and and read\nwhich blows my mind but they'll come up\nand tell us that and the other thing I\nlove hearing is that people walk into\nthe store with their phone in their hand\nwith one of our reviews up and be like\nyeah can I see this shoe and this\nshoe I'd say and i' I would say the two\nother the two other favorite things\nwere Chicago was awesome that was super\ncool Chicago shoe gazers that was really\ncool and I think\nthe\num I this I don't know if this like it\nwas just like the coolest thing was that\nunderground race I did in Venice yeah\nwhich I wish you would have done but it\nwas like the coolest thing I've ever\ndone like I think that was cooler than\nany of the races in a way but I also I\nmean just in a different way it was\namazing just to be in the on the other\nside of world there's two two ones that\nyou did that I thought think that maybe\nI should have done but I didn't want to\nget up that early for that that one that\nwas ridiculous and the other one I\ndidn't want to get up early for which is\nfunny cuz I'm normally way up before you\nare and I'm a morning Runner but you did\nthe um steps in oh the incline the yeah\nwith Taylor uh in Colorado and I was\nlike yeah maybe I should have done that\nit would have been cool but you should\njust do a different time because it was\nsuper foggy that day so you couldn't\neven see anything yeah so and you'll\nprobably go back there it wasn't that\nbut like when I did the escarpment with\nTaylor and Carl yeah it was it was\nhorrible like the experience was\nhorrible we got up to the top and just\nknowing that I went through it with\nTaylor and Carl yeah there was a special\nfeeling like there was a bonding like\nCarl was so sour but it I felt like it\nwas kind of like a bonding moment\nbecause you did you Stripped Away all\nthe like is this real or not like I got\neverybody was 100% that day yeah that's\npretty cool but yeah so I I do get that\nbut uh yeah Carl ran with you in the\nVenice race that was the what do they\ncall those what's the name of those\nraces um I mean they call it I thought\nit was like a version of taking the\nbridge M the Gap M the Gap that's it\nyeah taking the I get taking the bridge\nand mind the gap confused makes sense\nyeah um yeah and that was so much fun\nand so cool and he basically ran like it\nwas a satisfy ad yeah I mean every it\nwas there all from Milan just decked and\ndripped out and satisfy and it was\ndeodor kind of loosely with Theodora\nwhich was was super cool of them and\njust the like running in Venice when\nit's completely empty like a ghost town\nwas just wild which also weird because\nwe were there later in the day and it's\npacked like shoulder to shoulder almost\nand then you're there when it's\nliterally you saw maybe 10 to 15 people\nthere the whole course of the race and\nuh and such a historic place you know\nlike it's just an amazing James Bond\nTown\nyeah uh anyway that was awesome and then\nyeah basically I don't know just like\neverything it's there's a ton like it's\npretty much every runner's dream I mean\neverything I know we're going can I give\na final yeah what are you looking\nforward\nto like in 2025 just it with believe in\nthe Run what what what are you looking\nforward to\nnext I mean I am excited about the dirt\nthe trail Division I think that's super\ncool\nand Taylor leading that\nand I think we might be going back to\nTokyo so that's pretty cool I think\nTokyo is the coolest place in the world\nthat I've been\nanyways um yeah just generally\nlike moving\nforward getting swole oh yeah getting\nswole for 2025 getting jacked all right\nmy dream is to get stopped by that body\nby Mark guy you know him on Instagram oh\nyeah I do he's like he stops you and ask\nyou how you look the way you do you seen\nit before oh I've only seen one there's\nlike a 50-year-old woman yeah and he's\nlike what do you eat what do you do to\nshe's like I cut out all sugar and\nalcohol I was like next dude all those\npeople on there that I was talking about\nthis in the gym to the trainer he was\nlike yeah they're all full [\u00a0__\u00a0] uh cuz\nall the people in those videos they're\nlike yeah I eat six raw eggs for\nbreakfast and then uh celery and no\ncarbs and yeah just chicken breast and\nthen sweet potato and some more chicken\nfor dinner like dude that sounds\nhorrible sounds like you're living in\nThe Matrix my trainer is uh one of them\nfruit fruit people fruitarian\nfruitarians he eat can you live like\nthat that's I I'm pretty sure he's not\ngoing to live very long no he's he told\nme what he eats for breakfast it's crazy\nit's like two bananas an avocado\npineapple your protein is from nuts like\nyou're just not going to get I don't\neven think he' do the nuts how is that\npossible because you're supposed to get\nprotein you're supposed to get a gram\nper pound right yeah you're not that's\nwhat I'm saying just doesn't does he\njust do a ton of protein powder I'll let\nyou talk to him there I don't even know\nif he does a protein powder he's got to\nno it sounds like he probably from Peas\nI think he's just doing fruit and there\nwas a guy that ran marathons that just\ndid\nfruit that's crazy yeah all right well I\nthink that covers most of it that was\nnearly 2 hours really was it God the\nother ones will be a little shorter was\nit really wow I mean I left out probably\na lot I know that's the crazy\npart all right hope everyone enjoyed\nthis chat with Robbie getting a little\nbit more about his history all right\nthanks for having me on guys fun you're\nwelcome we might have to make this a\ntwo-parter all right bye by\n[Music]\n[Applause]",

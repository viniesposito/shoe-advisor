  "text": "[Music]\nall right Robbie we have a special guest\nthis week we're actually going to do a\nweird thing this month and the guests\nare going to be people that are part of\nour family and uh we're pretty excited\nto announced that Taylor Bodin our lead\nTrail Reviewer is actually coming on\nfull-time this spring\nand is going to be a like dedicated to\ntrail running and growing our trail\nrunning audience and content side of\nthings Taylor Bodin who I called Taylor\nBowden for like a year and a half I mean\nI don't know welcome Taylor thank you\nyeah and you're not the only one I my\nfirst couple years as a teacher my\nprincipal called me Mr Bowden forever\nand I just kind of quietly told\neverybody the right way to say it it's\nFrench apparently so like a\ncinjun yeah maybe cjun from\nMinnesota bod Bodin is I guess you're\ncloser to Canada that would make the\nFrench Connection more likely yeah actor\nthere was an actor bod oh yeah\nget and like uh gold medal\nsnowmobile\nfreestylist oh yeah everybody knows\nabout snow exactly\nyeah freestyl us motans yeah I I've\nnever like met any other Bodin though so\nit's fair so Taylor what did you do\nfulltime\nnow um I am an elementary school teacher\nteach first grade here in the mountains\nofus Park um for a long time that did\ninclude coaching too until this year and\nthen it was my uh year of saying no so\nI'm just teaching just\nreviewing and uh turns out my year of\nsaying no ended up being a year of\nsaying yes with the believe in the Run\nfamily so that's pretty awesome um yeah\nbut yeah that's the gist of it really\nsimple nice yeah so you've been\nreviewing for us for how long now five\nyears I think five years which is just\nwild that's gone quick yeah and through\nthat time you've come the trail expert I\nbelieve the run and you've run in how\nmany shoes do you think you've run in at\nthis point at trail shoes oh my gosh I\ndon't know well I was just making a list\nof all the shoes that we reviewed this\nyear for trail and there's like 60 some\ntrail shoes and I I usually get in most\nof them um right so a lot and then like\nmy first Trail shoe or not even Trail\nshoe the first shoe I reviewed was this\nweird mauno which now I know is probably\none that nobody else wanted but\nyeah so I know I know how that is but\nyeah like a lot of shoes over the years\nand the trail space has just grown so\nlike there's so many more offerings\nevery single year so I don't even know\nRobbie a lot I mean one of the things\nthat I was impressed with um besides\njust the amount of shoes that you've\nreviewed for us which thank you um is it\nyour Comfort on the trails and your\nabilities on the trails like I think\nit's one thing if you can throw down on\nthe road that's like just pure power and\nmuscle and and you know you you got a\nwork ethic or whatever but the trails\nyou kind of need like I don't know uh\ncoordination and power it helps yeah\nboth help for sure um yeah well after I\nwas uh done with college I ran track and\ncross country through high school and in\ncollege colge um and I was pretty much\nready to be done with running at least\nlike Road running and stuff and I was\nthankful that we moved to Estus Park\nwhere we're at now and it had a ton of\ntrails and so it really revitalized\nrunning for me but I did learn quickly\nexactly what you're saying of like it\nrequires a few things skill is one of\nthem and it's like over the years you\njust continue to build some of that\ncomfort and skill but yeah and power\npower is help helpful too when you're\nhere in the mountains for\nsure yeah which but you grew up in\nMinnesota which isn't exactly known for\nelevation or altitude which is wild\nbecause two of the best Ultra Runners of\nall time Courtney de Walter and Scott\njerck are both from Minnesota as well\nyeah uhhuh yeah I don't know I don't\nknow exactly probably just needing an\noutlet I was just back in Minnesota for\nThanksgiving and even my family which\nthey're fairly active like you can just\nend up sitting around a lot of the times\nbecause it's so dang cold during the\nwinter and so I I have a hunch that many\nathletes that have come out of Minnesota\njust like needed something to do and I\nthat's was me too of like I needed to be\nbusy I needed some sort of physical\noutlet and so I'm glad it ended up being\nrunning but some some people ski some\npeople uh you know\njust go out and shovel snow I don't know\nMinnesota for athletes ice ice fishing\noh man yeah I've had a lot of long days\nand nights in in the ice castle trying\nto stay warm\nand yeah that sounds I've never been ice\nfishing but I feel like I need to do it\nat some point in my life I could totally\nsee Robbie sitting freezing his ass off\non a lake with like a a thing of beers\nand a rod in the water sounds pleasant\nyeah quiet just getting away yeah is and\nthat's what it is I mean that's fishing\nanyways right but it's a whole new level\nwhen you can't move around can't like\nnecessarily get comfortable and that was\nmy childhood experience but nowadays\nlike my grandpa and my uncle the the\nfish houses they're basically mobile\nhomes you bring out on the ice oh really\nand they have like bunk beds they have a\nfull kitchen TV and so Wild on yeah I\ndidn't even do that yeah no it's it's a\nwhole new level up there yeah so not to\ndo with snowmobiles and ice fishing I'm\ngoing to bring it back to trail running\na little bit yeah one of the other\nthings I've noticed about you is that\nyou're you're a super fan of the sport\nas well like when we were at Western\nStates in Broken Arrow uh this past\nsummer you know all and it's that's the\nother thing that's weird about tril\nrunning because you're all stuck in the\nvillage together it's it's not like Road\nrunning where yeah Dez is over at this\nhotel this other athlete's over at that\nhotel and you kind of see them maybe\ncrossing the street or something like\nthat when we were staying there you see\nall the athletes in the village or at\nthe coffee shop with them they're very\naccessible and you seem to know\neverybody yeah I mean you guys know how\nit is in the in the running space but\nespecially in like the trail running\nspace uh when it comes down to it uh\nit's a really fairly small world still\neven though it feels big to me and like\nespecially now like opportunities are\nkind of endless in the industry but\nthere's still just like select groups\nselect people it's a bunch of like\nweirdos who like to be outdoors and and\ndo hard things I guess but there that's\nnot a lot of people in the world so when\nit comes to events like western states\nor it was the same at UTMB even even\nthough that was like way next level from\nWestern States even like you end up\nknowing so many people because it's\nreally not that many people in the world\nthat are doing something like this but\nit's growing and that's pretty awesome\nand exciting\ntoo do you feel like the way that it's\ngrowing is uh well two things do you\nthink it's just the beginning and B do\nyou think it's sustainable because it's\ntrail races are different than road\nraces you can't have 40,000 people on a\ntrail you can have a couple thousand\npeople depending on where it is and\nwhich Trails but there's kind of a cap\nalmost totally and especially here in\nthe states it's that way because most of\nthe races are run in National Forest\nService which they have a cap depending\non where you're at and what particular\nForest you're in and so like it is\nlimited in that sense but I I really\nthink it's just the beginning of the the\nbroadening of it like you're probably\ngoing to see more races still about the\nsame size for most races that you would\nsee around today but you're just going\nto see more of them they're going to be\nmore accessible more places uh more\ncompanies are creating more\nopportunities like that and the other\npart of it is a big part that's growing\nis like the adventure tourism side of it\nand so there's a lot of different ways\nit can grow and it is growing already\nbut it it really seems like it's the\nbeginning because of that but you're\nright there's only so many people that\ncan effectively be on a trail without\njust being in a Congo line already um\nwell Scott jerk was talking about like\nwave Starts Now or or like multiple\nDay races where there's different you\nknow I guess just plain old waves yeah\nand you you do see that in like the\nwhole UTMB week is a good one to look at\nbecause it's kind of the Pinnacle of our\nsport it is the Pinnacle of our sport\nbut they have races for 6 days straight\nand they're starting at different\nlocations but they have a common Finish\nLine different distances and so some of\nthat's already happening but in terms of\nlike if you know they wanted to raise\nUTMB to having 10,000 athletes instead\nof 3,000 athletes yeah they're probably\ngoing to have to start in waves like\nthat but also I I feel like that\nsustainable conversation is a little\nmore the Forefront for trail Runners\nbecause we still want it to be an an\noutdoor experience for the most part\nwant to be like a rock and roll concert\nyeah exactly and I'm I'm someone who\nloves competition just as much as\nanybody else who's really competitive um\nand I love the sport but yeah there's\ngoing to be some challenges with the\ngrowth um and there already has been\nthat we I I'm also a race director so we\nhave been trying to manage in that way\nand like you have to get really creative\nwith how you what you offer how you\noffer it and but you still want it to be\nfor everybody and yeah that's hard this\nis that's a good time to shout out your\nrace by the\nway yeah yeah yeah run wild events in\nEstus park lots of great races popping\nup yeah so here I believe in the run\nit's never a linear line of what we end\nup doing and and how we end up working\non stuff we kind of uh follow\nopportunities and stuff like that but as\ncoming on as a full-time Trail review\nwhat do you think like what are the\nthings that you're hoping that you're\ngoing to bring to the table and things\nthat you're hoping that you can grow for\nthe\ncompany I feel like this is the\ninterview right here right yeah I know\nright glad I already agreed to this um\nand you did\ntoo um well I think one thing is like\nbeing present at events you were talking\nabout it at the running event of like\nbelieve in the Run isn't just doing\nreviews anymore it's more of a brand so\nhow is our brand going to be able to fit\ninto the outdoor space that's going to\nbe some problem solving and and really\nfrom my end I'd love to just follow your\nguys's creativity on how you've been\nable to do that so far because there\nhasn't been we want to do and from my\nperspective I as a reviewer we want to\ndo this this and this and that how we\nget to the Pinnacle you're following\nyour creativity and that's part of the\nreason why I believe in the run is uh\nviewed as different from the\nconsumer and I mean always having that\nhonesty as part of it so I think\nfiguring out a way that believe in the\nRun fits into the outdoor space and from\nmy perspective it it's already there\nthat's how it started right mhm\nyeah yeah I mean I feel like laying that\ngroundwork with the Sho reviews of The\nLast Five Years the trail shoe reviews\nand stuff and having you know especially\nlast year doing some stuff out in out in\nthe space has been good um but then\nhaving you especially on the West Coast\nor out in Colorado is great because it's\na lot closer in proximity to a lot of\nthe events that are out there I feel\nlike yeah uh which by the way I feel\nlike the East Coast needs to get some\nsome bigger stuff going on I mean\nthere's some good trail races I felt\nlike Vermont had some stuff but not like\nyou're talking about more like Mountain\nraces and stuff like that and I will\ntellit the the brook and arrow trail\nseries and uh certainly Western States\nreally open our eyes to like like you I\nlooked at you and I was like you feel\nlike a native there you do feel like you\nbelong for us even though I've done\nTrail Races tons of trail races and uh\nUltras and everything like that when I\nwent out there I felt like believe in\nthe run as an entity was uh a guest we\nweren't embedded what what I'm what I'm\nhoping you know what I mean yeah sure\nwhat I'm like we we watch Dylan Bowman\nand those guys and they're definitely\nlike that's the that's the crew and and\nby no means do I feel like we'll be I\nthink if anything we'll be a great\npartner to free Trail on our Trail side\nI don't see us as a competitor or uh or\neven trying to be a competitor with\nDylan on that side I think they're doing\na phenomenal job and like you coming on\nis more just\nbroadening uh and making even for the\npeople that are interested in our road\nreviews more accessible to the trail\nside of things and you know look most of\nthe people that come to us aren't people\nthat are buying one shoe to do all their\nrunning in they want a specific shoe for\na specific reason and they want to know\nokay okay the the trail shoe and I think\nseeing a legitimate you're a legitimate\nMountain Runner you're legitimate racer\nwatching you do the vertical mile was\ninsane uh was that was that just the\nvertical mile that you did or wait what\nwas vertical kilometer what was the one\nthat you did the first day for broken\nera where it like it was just like\npeople were they said cough out the\nblood or spit out the blood\nit yeah Tim Tolson up there yelling that\nthat was the VK and so going up a\nkilometer over the shortest distance\npossible but I think you hit something\nright on the nose of like we're not\ntrying to be in my mind we wouldn't try\nto be a competitor and you've done such\na great job with believe in the run at\nthis of like not necessarily viewing\nanybody as competitor but as we\nall Elevate our own practice it's going\nto elevate everybody else and that's\nlike just a personal philosophy and\nsomething that I teach like try to\ninstill in my athletes of like the idea\nof competing with each other is GNA\nbring out the best in everybody and\nbelieve in the runs always had the lane\nof like the gear it's focused on the\ngear and because of that focus and trust\nthat you've built with a community and I\nI need to start saying us too because\nour Trail team has done a lot too as you\nstart building that trust that's what\norganically um makes these community\nevents so po popular and so desired by\nso many people because there's a built\nTrust on the gear level our expertise\nand it just kind of boils over into the\nother things so just my view of like\nthis next year is like like let's get\ninto some events Let's Make Believe in\nthe run more well known gain that same\ntrust so that we can do some of the\nsimilar things that you guys have been\nable to achieve on the road side because\nit's special right like the community\nthat comes from it is really special and\nwell I feel like TR even\nhas I think tra even has more of a\ncommunity aspect I mean I know there's\nRoad running groups and Crews and\neverything that's clubs that have become\nmore popular over the last few years but\nI feel it uh I think trail running in\ngeneral has a more hit uh history of\ncommunity or this inside I don't know\nrag tag Club of people do you think\nthat's partially because\nwhen you're out like when you're on the\nroad and something goes wrong you can\nstop go to 7-Eleven get a car to come\npick you up or whatever but when you're\non the trails you really are dependent\non the other people out there and the a\nlot of the support comes from\nlike yeah we're in a race and you you're\nmissing a goo and I say hey here you go\nyou need you need some nutrition or\nsomething but like when you're out on\nthe trail like it could be a lot more\nlike everything from first aid to well\nthe aid stations you know uh hanging out\nafter the race the fact that you're most\npeople were walking half the\ntime not Taylor though that's what I\nlove about Taylor not Taylor yeah but\nRobbie and I\nsometimes having long conversations with\npeople whether they want to or not I\nhave to say I was surprised if both\nRobbie and Maya's performance at broken\ntrail uh considering that we were City\nSlickers and not used to altitude I\nthink we we we were respectable on that\ncourse I was happy with it oh you\ntotally were yeah and you guys both know\nyou could have done better in that\nrespect but I think trail running yeah\nwhen it came down to it like the sports\nonly like as a sport 15 years old and so\nlike it's just starting to get into its\nHeyday but since it's so new it's been\nable to maintain some of it its core\nvalue of like it all started races\nliterally started of saying hey I think\nwe could do this quicker and start\nadding people to it start it at a trail\nhead no like all the bells and whistles\nare kind of taken off and that's the\nexperience people wanted it was never\nabout really anything else and so like I\nlike that that even in these massive\nTrail Races that piece is still there\nyeah exactly and so I've always compared\nit\nto uh the difference between kind of\nlike music concerts like a fish concert\nwould be more like a trail run versus a\nTaylor Swift being your you know your uh\nMarathon\nmajor totally yeah it's it's a very\nBluegrass Vibe for sure um but yeah it\nand I think I think with compet the\ncompetition side being so relatively new\nto it there like we're just getting into\nthe days and age where there's getting\nto be significant money at some races um\neven some smaller races like some of our\nraces here in SS Park like we offered $\nthousand dollars for our backyard uh\nthat we just hosted in the fall like\neven smaller RAC does that bring does\nthat bring the does that bring the top\npeople well yeah that was the\nand it did bring more competition like\nour it was our furthest year yet and so\nthere's but that's only a certain\npercentage right so that was like 5% of\nthe athletes there were going for that\nmoney really whereas the rest of them\nwere still looking for that experience\nuh on the trail with some people they're\nthey're just there to be on the trail\nand and so I think I hope that that will\njust continue as the sport grows for\nsure I I mean I think there's an appeal\nto that though like even being at like\nthe broken trail series and seeing these\npeople that are like the top of their\ntheir game and just fantastic athletes I\nmean I think Jim womsley ran the VK\nchallenge with you um yeah you know and\nthen ran the western states but um a\nweek later you know it it's exciting for\nthe average person and I would consider\nmyself an average person to be there\nknowing that those people are there it's\nfun to\nsee like the real the real athletes at\nthese at these\ncourses yeah like everybody's just a\nperson there and I know even just\nLogistics in a major Marathon or\nsomething like that like that just\nwouldn't work out for most athletes that\nare at the tip of the sphere but it\nreally does work for the trail Community\ncuz it's all coming down to people just\nbeing there wanting a trail experience\nand even the elite athletes of like they\nlikely got into it because of that\ntoo all right let's talk about some\npersonal\ngoals yeah so now that you're opened up\nand and right now you review shoes and\nyou teach and your your days are pretty\nstructured and the training you don't\nhave as much flexibility for training\nyou're super talented at running\ntrails is there some personal goal that\nyou think that when your schedule's a\nlittle more flexible working you know\nthe way that we\nwork that you're going to go after some\nsome big\ngoals I I mean that would be pretty\nideal right of like just one just\ngetting into some consistent training\nwhere I feel confident that's where I've\nalways struggled as an athlete so like\nthat would be the first and foremost\njust to feel confident as a runner\nmyself there are some local kts that\nsince I'm in the Boulder area that\nSolomon pro athletes have taken down\nthat I maybe previously H held I would\nlike to go after that some of\nthat and so like that gets me going like\nthose are the things that motivate me\nkind of like home course stuff because I\nlove the training I love to Train racing\nis just kind of it's the\ncelebration um but some other like it\nwould be awesome to do any of the UTMB\nracing is I still I still love getting\ninto Ultra stuff but the sport has grown\nso much that we could go to Broken Arrow\nand I would love to do the premiere\nevent there the 20 was it\n23k like some of that but I'd also love\nto go to Leadville and run the iconic\nLeadville 100 and do well um Robbie said\nhe would Pace you the whole time yeah\nyeah I'll Pace you to the start\nline and then from M from 100K to the\nend\nall right so you got make this happen\nRobbie it's not happening in the time\nthat we've had Trail\nreviewers we've had a few people picked\noff the team and ended up being\nsponsored athletes how many how many\nathletes have you worked with since\nyou've been at believe in the run that\nhave ended up going\npro well what three or four at least\nRobbie definitely a few I guess determin\nPro um yeah but they they've left they\nhad an opportunity with another brand\nyeah yeah yeah I mean we are women which\nis awesome yeah exactly exactly well I I\nthink it's also like if you're like we\nhad some women that were quite talented\nthat maybe it's not as easy to find the\ntalent in trail running if you're a a\ncorporation unless you're going to these\nevents so all of a sudden believeing the\nRun has a reviewer and they start\nfollowing him and going oh jeez This\nWoman's pretty rad at trail running yeah\nchecking out their profile yeah and oh\nyou want to come run for normal you want\nto come run for Hoka we've had Hoka\nnormal um well\ntechnically speed land but that was\nafter we he reviewed for us and then had\nG said da I think we actually set that\nup I yeah did nevertheless still a\nsponsored\nathlete um but yeah and I'm just waiting\nfor someone to send me a contract but\nhaven't seen anything show up you should\nget the mustache gming contact why isn't\nit me yeah yeah yeah but I mean I\nthink well just going to say I think\nthat what we're doing is still fairly\nunique even though like media has blown\nup even the few years that I've been\nwith believe in the run but yeah having\nfemales for one being gear reviewers\nthat's really attractive but also if\nyou're also a very talented athlete you\ngot the you got the pedestal to like\nkind of display yourself and all you're\nrunning from believe in the run the\nwebsite all you have to do is click on\nthe profile and you can tell some of the\nGreat accomplishments and then you're\nsponsored the thing that drives me nuts\nthat's actually crazy to me is that we\nhear companies say or we hear people say\noh there's not a lot of female reviewers\nI'm like there are just whenever we get\none get sponsored you take\nthem yeah um and yeah we're always open\nto Bringing on more Talent if it if it\nif it fits you just need to know how to\ntake a photo that's photo take a photo\nand write those are the two requirements\nabsolutely yep and I guess you should\nrun that's a good one yeah you you\ndefinitely need to run you should\ndefinitely trail run be able to\narticulate your thoughts about shoes\num yeah that's that's also exciting I\nthink that you know we've talked about\none of your responsibilities coming on\nbeing uh someone that's scouting out you\nknow and not just women but reviewers\nfor uh trail of course you know then\nRobbie gets to look at him and go yes or\nno yeah he gets to be the emperor the\nGladiator thumbs up or thumbs down he\njust saw Gladiator a picture taking that\nis the clutch clutch skill that you need\nyeah that's a tough one um it's it's\nit's amazing how many bad photos of\nshoes you can\nsee and everybody thinks that putting\nthe shoe on a fence post or rock is\ngoing to do it we've all we've all been\nthere in the very beginning uh question\nso since you you actually don't have a\nlot of time because you are on your\nlunch break but yep I did want to ask\nyou for people who are looking for shoe\nrecommendations what your favorite trail\nshoes are right now O Okay well this is\nkind of hard because some of the trail\nshoes that we saw at the running event I\nalready have and so like just as a brand\nthe Northface has kind of had my number\nlast year and this year which is crazy\nthey were I know yeah they were trash\nfor a while Megan and I had to do the\nNorth Face 50 mile in California with\ntheir shoes back in the\nday Megan still won't run more than\na a 50k because of that yeah yeah you\ncan blame that on the North Face but if\nyou get into any of their new stuff like\nMH got the soft cushion got the\nresponsiveness like I've just been\nreally impressed with them as a brand\nand that's whenever there's a LW that's\nkind of what I reach for just because\nthey're fun and feel great and they can\napproach a lot of different train um we\nput Brooks catamount three pretty high\non the list on our end of year reviews\nand that's just a great Do-it all shoe\nit's meant for racing but you can use it\nfor anything it's a Tempo shoe it's\nbased off of the Hyperion line\nso a lot of it's just fun on the dirt\nsee I'm my favorite Trail shoe this year\nI I don't know if it even got I haven't\nseen your Trail picks uh yet but they uh\ntekon I absolutely loved that the list\nit was on there and honorable mention it\nwas kind of it was yeah honorable\nmention number two um I think it works\nreally good for some scenarios you\nrunning in the 2.5 2.5 is a better shoe\nthan the three and that's why all the\nelite athletes are that was my guess I\nlike it's a little more opened up but\nthe problem I think that it has and\nwhich I noticed uh when we were out in\nCalifornia 2.5 doesn't have the\nprotection of the foam\nthat the tekon 3 has so I did get some\nlike chunks out on some of the rocky\nterrain that we did but I I just love\nthat\nshoe yeah it it's a great shoe for\ncertain terrain and it's one of the like\nif I could like put that midsole on\npretty much any other upper like it's\njust fun feels good you could go so so\nfar with it without any\ncomplications yeah that's great SHO tell\nme have you run\nin have you run in the norta 05 yet\nbecause we did get it a month ago at or\na couple weeks ago at the running event\nhave you run in it\nyet uh just on our Austin run and spent\na couple days on cement floors in it but\nthat one's super impressive how light it\nis how responsive how good the upper\nfeels like that one's going to be a race\nday pick for sure we wore it all week\nand our feet felt fine sorry about that\nyeah talking over we wore it all week\nand the feet felt fine so I can't\nimagine it wouldn't be great on the\ntrails the only thing I guess would be\nuh my concern or or question more than a\nconcern would be it's got a small lugs\non it so it's not going to be great for\nlike really technical train but like the\nstuff that that we were running on when\nwe were out in uh in Olympic Village or\nor wherever that was um it seemed like\nit would be a great shoe for that kind\nof terrain right yeah but at the same\ntime like I'm not trying to say that I\nam the elite level reviewer and that\neverybody should listen to me in this\nsense but so many people I'm I'm up\nthere I know that um but so many people\ndog any shoe that has a 4 millimeter or\nthree and a half millimeter lug which in\nmost conditions it's going to do fine on\nany terrain I normally would prefer it\nreally yeah exactly if and it's more\nversatile to be able to hit some roads\nor smoother sections and so if you're\npicking a shoe based just off the out\nsole um I would probably refine your\npractice of doing that because it it do\na lot it's not goingon to dig into the\nmud yeah we should note that Matt sidel\nuh norda athlete he wore the o05 for JFK\n50 mile front to back all 50 miles and\nthat's some crazy terrain on the at\nand came in third place third place\noverall yeah without changing yeah I\ndon't know if there's any other top 10\nathletes on either side that stayed in\none pair of shoes so that's just like\nimpressive on its own and he's he's a\ngood he's a really good athlete as well\nbut like if you can run that race in\nparticular with one pair of shoes where\nmany people are switching into Alpha\nflies for the the faster section like I\nheard that was a mistake some people\nlike too harsh for the alpha flies on\nthe um Toth so one guy actually messaged\nme and said that he wore the clo X X1\nbecause he was like you guys always talk\nabout being a great trainer and he's\nlike it had the cushion had the thing he\ngoes I had a Flawless second half where\nhis brother-in-law wore the alpha flies\nand got blisters and stuff W I don't\nknow that i' want to be alphafly is\ngreat for like Road where you're not\ngoing to be shifting around a lot in the\nshoe I don't know how great it would be\non that Toe Path but it's just a uh one\nperson's opinion but no I I wasn't\nquestioning whether or not the lugs\nwould be good I just am curious how it\nwould perform on the trails I prefer a\nsmaller lug just CU I like a smoother\nfeel Under Foot especially if you're\ngoing long distance that having that\ncleat feel I've worn innovates and I've\nworn like smoother trail\nshoes innovat or soccer CLE let's I mean\nit was great the time I warm cuz it was\nmuddy and snow was on the ground so it\nworked out but it wasn't exactly the\nmost\ncomfortable yeah but it but it can work\neven if it has shorter lugs that's a\nthing and do really well like I would\nthink that would be a good shoe for hat\nbecause you have those Road sections oh\nyeah for sure yeah definitely um how\nmuch time we got left\nTaylor time check let's do five minutes\nyeah minutes did you eat your peut\nbutter and jelly sandwich not yet saving\nthat for later I actually do have\nanother question since you are from\nMinnesota and you run in the cold a lot\nand winter is we're just getting into it\nright here in the Mid-Atlantic where it\nstarts to get real cold what's your\nfavorite cold weather running\ntips um mittens are\nmagical the just keeping the fingers\ntogether it makes all the difference\nlike I wear mittens all the time and we\njust got in these new arc TS\nmittens wonderful they're like a gortex\nbasically a gortex\nliner as a mitten and I can wear that\nlike it was 17 degrees this morning and\nI only wore that and it's basically a\nliner and did fine but you can put wait\ngloves in it when you're say it's like a\nshell and then you have gloves inside\nyou can do gloves inside but you don't\nhave to like I didn't wait you just wore\na\nshell over your hand and what was the\ntemperature well\nit has like it doesn't have a micro\nfleece um I don't know the material\nthat's on the inside there is a an\ninternal liner of some sort but it's\nyeah it's it's a gortex yeah what was it\ntemp yeah 17 17 17 I'm complaining over\nhere about\n29 yeah it's probably probably feel like\nsummer yeah and I live a little higher\nthan uh the town here and so it's it's\nit's basically like between 10 and 20\u00b0\nmost of my runs for how how long what\npart of the year is that 5 months more\nthan that yeah yeah our winter is like\nsix months like Colorado seems so cool\nwhen you look at it in the summer or if\nyou're at a ski resort but it sounds\nhorrible to live there Taylor's always\ntrying to get me to he's like dude you\ngot to move to Colorado for The Last 5\nYears I'm like I have the app on my the\nweather app on my phone and I have esta\nspark just to look at it and when it's\nSeptember and there's I see a 10\u00b0\nmorning I'm like absolutely not and by\nthe way Taylor if he moves to uh if if\nyou get him to move to Colorado you're\nboth\nfired dang it okay there's no way well\nthen don't I need I\nneed now yeah especially when Five Hour\nEnergy what I'd like is a campus there\nwe should have like set up a Colorado\ncampus okay we can travel out there for\na week do some trail running with do a a\ncanvas tent out in the\nfield I just remember I always went to\nColorado in the winter to go skiing and\nthen I did the trans Rockies\nrun and I will never go back to Colorado\nexcept for in the in summer it's\nbeautiful it's it's yeah it is amazing\nit really is the the Saving Grace\nespecially if you're not a huge skier\nlike I I enjoy skiing but I SK for the\nuphill action of it if you're a big\nskier you can play in all all seasons\nfor\nsure who skis for the uphill action\nthat's insane is that you mean the lift\nthe ski lift yeah nope you vape on the\nski lift and drink some beers on the way\nup drink Fireball yeah okay I have done\nthat but not typically yeah yeah\nFireball not dude when I was a kid\npeppermint stomach bags oh yeah that was\nthe move\nokay just out of the inside\npocket\nyeah um but for color I'm just going to\ngive it a good wrap I'm looking outside\nand kids are in T-shirts because it's\nlike 50 degrees right now so it could be\n17 in the morning and warm up okay that\nis true it does it's today it's still 30\ndegrees here in the after Mill of the\nafternoon but it's 50 there so it's well\nbeing in Minnesota I was reminded I'm\nnever living there again because any\nsort of in the air just makes it feel so\ncold yeah yeah so never doing that again\nall right I love Minnesota\nbut well that's a good way to wrap it up\nwe're back to\nMinnesota um anything else we forgot to\nsay it all comes back\naround no um but I I am really excited\nfor what we're kind of stepping into for\nbeli in the run I think the next year is\nyeah big exposure getting us out there\nbut there's so much there's so much to\nbe had in the sport and the space and\nwith the people um I'm honored and just\nsuper excited to really get rolling I'm\njust it's so much fun to watch the team\ngrow and to have good people on the team\nand and I think what you'll you've\nalready been with us so you kind of know\nthe culture but once the team is is the\nthe most important part of of this whole\nwhole thing and it makes it all\nworthwhile is is lifting everybody\ntogether it it really does and that's\nlike I've had one offer from a\ncompetitor and one offer from like a\nmore local magazine to do stuff for\noutdoors and but there's nothing quite\nlike beli in their run sense of team and\num I just have always loved the vision\nyou have for the people on your team and\nso I haven't wanted to go anywhere else\nor try this that's cool who's a\ncompetitor cuz have to stomp on the neck\nyeah feminist and Robby out there with a\ngun yeah yeah Robbie's First\nassignment all right well we'll uh we'll\ntalk to you soon have fun the rest of\nyour school day teaching make sure you\neat your lunch thank you thank you and\njust remember if those little guys get\non your nerves

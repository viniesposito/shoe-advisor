you got this yeah what\ndo they people do that what their first\nfirst day uh no like this is the time of\nyear where people start making like and\nlike resolutions and I no we still got\nlike a month for that to happen I think\nyou start I think that one year when I\nstopped drinking for a few months I did\nit in December and it was hard but I\nfeel like you just got to rip the\nBand-Aid off just cuz otherwise if\nyou're like I wait until January then\nall of a sudden January's here and\nyou're like just like yeah or you're\njust it's too almost too easy to wait\ntill January everyone's doing it you\nwant to get it over with yeah like\nRobbie and I are both starting something\nnew this week he's starting tonight yeah\nwait you are you gonna take a before\nphoto oh I I mean I feel like you have\nto do it just do it you don't have to\nshare it just do I have a pair of\ntracksmith briefs do I do I purposely\nslouch and stick my stomach out to make\nit look as fat no I say try to look as\ngood as possible CU you'll be like I\nthought I look good okay and then a year\nfrom now you'll be like damn okay yeah\nthat's assuming I would do this for a\nyear yeah are you not committing no I am\ncommitting in my\nmind don't you have to like sign up for\na year or is it month to month I think\nit's like obviously there's a discount\nif you do it for I think six months is\nprobably will probably be the go-to so\nI'll do six months I'm gonna I'm GNA say\na year like I kind of did that push-ups\nI'm still doing the push-ups yeah but I\nlike I'm going to do a year of 30\npush-ups every day okay and again I\nstarted that in December or something\nbefore yeah the New Year's like once I\ndecide might as well just do it no\nthat's good we're doing a different kind\nof we'll commit to a year we're oh yeah\nwe're doing uh I guess we talked about a\nlittle bit in on past\npodcast we won't it involves weights\nyeah and lifting them and not LIF not\nlifting cans of beer yeah unfortunately\nI don't even like beer i' I've learned\nthat about myself I'm not a beer guy\nyeah it does make you feel kind of\nbloated and stuff and just generally I\nused to I mean I still feel like I\nprefer beer though but\nI guess like we went to Top Golf yeah\nand I had beers there for for\nThanksgiving or the day after the day\nafter Thanksgiving I went with uh my\nbrother-in-law Ryan yeah who plays\ngolf right and you could tell like when\nwe went but you used to play golf a lot\ndude I suck so bad you don't have the\nmuscle\nmemory uh like it's not like here was\nthe crazy thing so it h not really um or\nmaybe I just rode a bike really crappily\nbefore and yes I still did too but uh I\nhave seen you ride a scooter it's often\ninvolves you wrecking it yeah um so it\nwhat was kind of fun was there's games\nat Top Golf so we had all these\ndifferent games yeah and it was myself\nRob James who used to be your neighbor\nuh Ryan Theo and Henry yeah and I was\nable to come in second place on every\nchallenge that they had but I only came\nin second place because the other people\nwe're so bad bad okay I mean that's a\nwin but we did we did beat Ryan in one\ngame yeah this is your brother that he's\nthe brother-in-law Megan's brother who\nwho plays golf on the regular yeah\nthat's good to know well I still think\nwe should do a pram\nwith uh like us and people in the\nrunning industry that golf we've talked\nabout this with Joe Rubio from running\nWarehouse because he always golfs with\nCraig\nEngles he's a the pro at something or\nwas and then we're amateurs at pretty\nmuch everything in life so I feel like\nwe need to make that happen at some\npoint that's pretty much what's\nhappening to me you brought up the\namateur thing yeah I'm hitting the stage\nin my life where I'm like you always\nthought you'd Master something I've\nnever quite mastered anything I'm like\npretty mediocre across the board yeah\nand I'm like okay this is me yeah well I\nmean jack of all trades master of none\nthat's always a compliment I think it's\nnot a compliment that doesn't feel like\none yeah isn't a jack a good job to have\nthough like being Court Jester I don't\nknow the Jack and the jester are the\nsame thing I knew this was going to\nhappen I thought a Jack and the jester\nin the cards was I thought no The Joker\nIs the jester yeah what is a Jack Jack\nis like the guy who's probably sleeping\nwith the queen but they don't oh he's\njust a scoundrel yeah I think he's a\nscoundrel I thought he was like a friend\nof like he was a also worked in the same\nDepartment as the jester but I guess\nthat's not or he could be like the\nprince maybe oh Jack Queen I don't know\nokay Megan is getting pushed out of her\nchair by Ralphie right now I knew this\nwas gonna happen I maybe maybe we should\nstop bringing rfie in on podcast days\nit's a little\nchaotic um so speaking of J speaking of\nJax I didn't really have a transition\nthere but I thought I'd\ndid um you're off the translation didn't\ngo to a casino this weekend but we did\ngamble oh yeah there we go I knew\nthere's some gambling I did this past\nweek so Robbie texts me which he knew he\nwas fishing with dynamite at this point\ncuz it's over the holidays there's\nfootball on the TV he sends me this link\nto DraftKings to play which I didn't\neven really know how it worked there I'm\npretty sure there are rules that's or an\nexplanation I knew I knew that you were\nallotted an amount of money and each\nplayer was yeah so the idea was that you\npick a fantasy team just of the players\nplaying on Thanksgiving Day yeah so\nthere's eight teams playing that day or\nwhatever six teams and you have so much\nM money to spend on a salary or whatever\nyeah and then you can use that for the\nplayers did you not spend all your money\nI did oh did you all of it yeah I at\nleast knew that part okay but I just I\nyou know I kind of just picked whoever I\nfelt like and anyway I was almost dead\nlast in the competition and Robbie won\nof course yeah I mean it was a good day\nI have to say that so it was a nice nice\nlittle come up for 150 bucks on\nThanksgiving Day and then fantasy\nfootball oh I was projected to win the\nentire time yeah like even up until like\nMidway through the Ravens game I was\nstill like 80% chance of winning I was\nat 1 Point 90% chance of winning I was\nplaying Thomas's team this week just so\nyou know and I don't know what happened\nbut like I went from 99% chance of\nwinning to losing to Robbie yeah sorry\nmy team only scored 85 points it was\npretty bad and Robbie's didn't even\nclear 100 no pretty the ugliest yeah all\naround bad poor performances on the\nfantasy front from the newberger SL\nMurray crowd it's okay we all made the\nplayoffs so we're good yeah did we\nfantasy yeah yeah yeah I still have a\nscratch off in my pocket that I bought\non Saturday that I haven't even done yet\nyou could be a millionaire I know we\nwere we were heading up to the Penn\nState game for me and with some friends\nand you know feeling good dude that\nlooked horrible looked very cold it was\nit was cold it was like 24 windy yeah no\nthank you you were out there the whole\ntime oh I went\nfull full winter gear I had three like\nthree layers on plus a winter coaters uh\nI did but I had those car heart mittens\nthat I like the best yeah double socks\nthese\nHoka sleeping bag boots Hoka what I\nforget what they're called but I think\nsleeping bag boots yeah I was I was\nactually feeling pretty nice and those\nnew balance sheet pants remember those\npants yeah I saw I saw you I saw your\ngear the it I'm telling you I went to\none of the Ravens games where it was\ncold like that and the beer you can't\neven drink like it's not enjoyable like\nyeah well what we did I mean we kind of\ntogate for a little bit through the pig\nskin around so that warmed you up and\nthen we uh and then we went into the\nstadium and we sat down for maybe half\nof the first quarter and then we were\njust like let's just walk around so that\nkept the blood flowing but yeah it was\nit was pretty cold the most exciting\npart of the day was we were we were like\non the upper deck too so it was crazy up\nthere but the most exciting part was\nsometimes the napkins will fly away they\nwould they you you would they would go\non forever and you could bet on which\none went the further this was the most\nexciting part of the game I mean it was\na blowout the the game was a blowout 317\nby I got to say if I was at that game I\nprobably would have been all into the\nnapkin Bing you know what I'm talking\nabout if you see napkins flying from the\ntop of the stadium see how far out they\ntravel there's a lot of action to be had\nI would be into that yeah more so than\nPenn State sound like a degenerate\nGambler I don't even yeah\nit's anyways so uh that was but before\nthat you did uh didn't you do a turkey\noh Turkey Trot yeah how that go did you\nguys do one no oh we ran we ran yeah\nokay it was awesome uh for those\nlistening and those who asked Nick bear\ndid not show up I think he's a little\nintimidated gotta say definitely I mean\nI've been talking this up for a while\nand I'm sure somebody floberg relay it\nto him and he's decided to step down\nlast minute uh either that or it was the\nuh the rain it was raining rain here too\nit was really awful so I don't think he\nwanted to go one more I think he went to\ngo\nzero um Ralphie you're crazy and uh\nthe um so it ended up was like 40 and\nrainy there's two waves so I did the\n8:00 wave and my family came to do the\n9:00 did you do both I did yeah so the\nfirst one I went out and honestly it\nfelt pretty good I just\ndidn't like I didn't even look at my\nwatch I was just like I'm just going to\ngo hard keep within range and uh and you\nwore the adios Pro 4 yeah the adios Pro\n4 which turned out to be I love that\nshoe I mean I did too like I know the\ntoe box we've seen a lot of bloody to\nbloody toes I think it's just a little\nshallow and a little short basically\nyeah so it ended up we we got uh I just\nfelt good and even the last mile was\nuphill and it was my fastest mile so I\ndid like splits of basically 634 634 4\n628 and uh been just strong which I\ncan't believe that's still like a 20\nover 20 minute what is it what do you\nhave to run to be sub 20 like\n62 or like\n6 uh well the course was also like a\ntenth of a mile long at least and so\nofficial time was 2055 so it probably it\nwas on point like everyone had that on\ntheir watches like it's 3.2 miles so I\nmean there's NE it's never well I mean a\n5k is usually pretty pretty straight\nlike turkey trots are all over the lot\nyeah the crazy thing is is that the last\npart of it is a straightaway so it's\nlike you just need to move the line up a\nlittle bit um no it's probably measured\ncorrectly I don't know some people have\n3.25 but I feel like it could but if\nyou're weaving in between kids and\nturkeys and yeah turkeys yeah it's a\nturkey trbe anyways but\nthe um\nwhat was I gonna say did you win any\nawards I wasn't I was third in my I\nthink I was third in my age group so one\nof the guys I I met someone who like was\na believe in the Run fan he watched the\nYouTube videos and saw us so I was\ntalking to him he beat me by like 30\nseconds he was crazy fast and so we\nended up talking and then I did a I did\na long run the next day and he came out\nwith me and some other people and he was\na cool dude and he lost he said he used\nto weigh like\n325 and I think he lost like 100 lb so\nhe's like an obber dude like he he was\nTrucking he he crushed me and uh anyway\nso I think that maybe is it possible\nthat if you had all that extra strain on\nyour heart yeah that once you loosen it\nup you have this really strong pumping\nmechanism that's what I was we were\ntalking about cuz I was saying how our\nfriend and reviewer John Uber has his\nheart rate is always so low and he said\nthe same thing he said said his heart\nrate's always crazy low and his resting\nheart rate's like 32 or something so\nmaybe we're doing it wrong maybe we\nshould all get super heavy yeah for and\nthen five years yeah and then lose that\nweight it'd be like elevation training I\nmean in a way you're not wrong but that\ndoesn't sound I don't know if that's\nscientific yeah anyways so that was cool\nand so my brother ran the 9:00 a.m. rais\nand my wife and uh and so we I ran with\nhim just thinking oh cuz he doesn't run\nhe plays soccer in in M soccer whatever\nbut he doesn't um he doesn't run and so\nwe kept first mile was chill and then he\nkept picking it up and I was like I I\ndon't know if you can do this but I\ncan't not run with you so he ended up\nrunning the last mile was a 7 minute\nmile or just under and I was like dude\nthis is right after a hard 5K was not so\nyou did a workout after did another yeah\nit's like a 20 under 25 minute 5K you\ndid a 10 you did a 10K basically yeah um\nbut it felt good I mean I do like I said\nI love that shoe it's it's really nice\nmy favorite was the um Megan and I were\nsupposed to have workouts we both had 12\nmiles on Saturday yeah and both of us\ndecided after being with family and all\nthat stuff that the workout were going\nto the side yeah and that's fair yeah\nand our coach called our rod in we both\nwere like he's like how do it go I was\nlike it didn't go yeah it stopped he\ndidn't even respond to me just I think\nhe's like yeah okay we'll just move on I\nmean yeah it's something to be thankful\nfor I mean I had a a nice uptempo run\nthe next day you were talking about the\nfoam in the um or I don't even know if\nyou're talking about the foam but the\npro four foam yeah the shoe that we're\ngoing to talk about a little bit later\nhas what I would say is the closest\nsensation to the pro four foam okay\nthat's cool yeah I so I was maybe going\nto run in the cloud boom Light Strike or\nlight spray I mean that that shoe that's\nimpossible to get on and I I had a\nTuesday night workout in it and that was\nlike at 5K Paces for like th000 M and I\nI tried so I ran in it but it was like\nso constrictive at in parts that my foot\nmy left foot just like fell asleep M\nasked when you said that she's like is\nthat in a good way well no I was like I\ndidn't I didn't even know what that\nmeans cuz you said the shoe's insane my\nfoot fell asleep and I was like does\nthis mean he oh I see Li it or he hates\nit I see what you're saying I did I was\nlike no it sounds horrible yeah it the\nit also has a really high arch kind of\nlike the alpha fly which I don't do well\nwith and then the The Rocker is pretty\nnice and it feels aggressive and fast\nunderfoot but yeah like I think because\nit tries to lock your foot in so well\nthat part like basically at the top of\nyou're getting pinched in the ankle\njoint I know it just cutting off all the\nblood flow to well I've seen other\npeople are cutting the shoe and and you\nknow trying to you know customize it\nyeah um\nI but I would guess like look that's\nnever it's not a mass production shoe\nit's not like you're going to sit there\nand make you know 2,000 pairs of these\nshoes on on on that thing maybe I mean\nwho knows but I'm thinking that the\nideal situation is if you're one of the\npro athletes for on they have a mold of\nyour foot yeah and they make a last and\nthat she was sprayed on specifically for\nyour foot right which\nwould make sense in a in a custom thing\nlike that where it just needs to spray\nover a\nmold yeah no I mean that's what I\nassumed that the future of it is but it\nwas the ride and everything else felt\npretty cool pretty nice I love that\ncloud boom Echo what two or three three\nyeah yeah I thought it was a fun good\nchew mhm um did that one make you bloody\nthough and it already had that like\ndesign that looked like it was Bloody so\nthat it kind of like Blended in with the\nrest of the shoe I don't know I can't\nrecall if that one did but I I used that\none for a 10K last summer or summer ago\nthat was the white one that had the like\nit looked like bruises on it no I know\nwhat you're talking about that was a\ndifferent one the echo 3 was the one\nwith was just all white what is the one\nI'm talking about that had strike CL\nclom strike that's the one I like yeah\nthat's my favorite a good one too on um\nbut yeah I'm really looking forward to\nthat like um Cloud boom\nMax um yeah yeah some of the stuff want\ntry that pretty good coming out next\nyear all right first check in you know\nwe complain about this weather cuz it's\nreally chilly it's really hard to get\nout but once you get out man this is fun\nrunning weather just you don't get all\nhot and sweaty it just feels good you\nstay pumping for some reason my muscles\ndon't ache as much afterwards it's like\nhaving a cold plunge without having to\nstop and sit in cold water\nall right guys element is still a\nsponsor of this podcast but for a\nlimited time they're offering their\nchocolate medley ooh that sounds pretty\ndelicious you know it's not like the\nyou're not going to put that in your\nbubbly water no you could could you you\ncould uh you want it heated up I think\nyeah some hot water with either the\nchocolate mint the chocolate chai or the\nchocolate raspberry I've heard it's\npretty good in coffee too you could also\nput it in your coffee okay would you do\nit before your run yeah okay some hot\ncoffee some chocolate medley I do like a\nmocha yeah yeah all that good stuff also\nour offer is still available so you can\ngo to element.com\nthedrop and get a free element sample\npack do you know if the sample pack\nwould have this chocolate in yeah oh\nthere you go so go get them and\nenjoy um we have so many shoes right now\nit's like the end of the year and\ndeluged I have been running pretty\ndecent miles so I I have I'm ready to\nwrite up the premium the vomero the\nSolomon uh arog Glide 3 which I would\nsay is a really sweet shoe okay haven't\nrun it yet it you know what it reminds\nme of so it's right in that line of like\nthe Endorphin speed but it doesn't have\na plate but it reminds me of the tier\nshoe um I forget the name of the tier\nshoe tier uh yeah but it's that same\nmidsole it just has a really nice upper\nand it's like medium low weight okay and\nit just felt good I just find it like it\nis like it's a great shoe I've been\nrunning in it too but it's just it's so\nhard to get excited about that style of\nshoe now because we're like at least I'm\nso used to having a carbon plate or I\ndon't know something Jazzy in the mid\nsole yeah I feel you of foam is it is a\nreally good simple shoe what I think it\nmakes it hard for for me is the other\nshoes that are\nlike your basic daily trainers cuz if\nthey're over like if you're using some\nEva compound and the shoe weighs over 10\nounces and you're kind of in this like\nGray Zone of like it's you know a weird\nspot like I I've been enjoying the\nvomero and that's what I've been liking\nabout the heavier\nshoes is when we run in a heavy shoe\nuhhuh and then I throw on a shoe like\nthis one the Endorphin\nElite you feel like you're flying so\nthere may be some logic to maybe\ntraining in a heavier shoe that's well\nprotected and then again weight gain\ntraining yeah I ran in the Vero 18 what\ndo you think last week um it's nice yeah\nit's a if if you're tired it might feel\na little heavy I don't feel like if it's\nas heavy as it when I'm running in it it\ndoesn't feel that heavy as it says on\nthe scale well that's the thing I I\nthink that's the new Foams kind of\nmitigate some of the weight so the\nZoomix the balce and also Megan's\nfinally running in the premium cuz she\nwas like got it when she was inas\npremium and that shoe is heavy but it\nfeels so great Under Foot again like you\nhave a full layer of air under your foot\nso it's like fun yeah like it's it's\nhard to then go put on an arrow Glide\nthree from Solomon which is a great shoe\nbut it's hard to just get excited about\nit cuz it's like feels fine the arog\nGlide was the one you were just talking\nabout or you talking about the ultra\nGlide before we're talking about the\narog Glide three oh okay yeah um it's\nit's real basic like if you look at it\nlooks like the if tier had made it it\nlooks the same like the tiar\nshoe yeah the vomero was pretty nice\nlike I said I did that long run in it\nand I did a couple other just six mile\nruns felt pretty good yeah we should get\nthe review up for that I think it's a\ngood shoe all three of us like it yep\nyeah it's not the lightest I'm actually\nthe the premium and the plus of that\nlike I'm I'm I'm very curious about the\npremium same very curious but the plus\nlooks really nice yeah definitely like I\ndidn't like necessarily the Pegasus 41\nmhm so going up and then we didn't\nreally love the Pegasus plus Fells a\nlittle thin underfoot and so now liking\nthe Pegasus PR premium a lot which I'm\nactually surprised especially because of\nthe weight but it just yeah it feels\nlike the glycerin Max to a certain\ndegree would you agree um in some ways\nin other ways it feels very different\nlike the Max has got this nice wide\nplatform I feel like the premium is more\nnarrow and maybe a little bit higher\nstack maybe in the forefoot I don't know\nokay um so what' you eat for\nThanksgiving we always do two turkeys\none deep fried one roasted oh I like\nthat little column A colum B business\nyeah um thank goodness my mom was in\ntown and I pwned off almost all of the\ncooking to her oh nice yeah but Ryan and\nI do the deep frying of the turkey\nturkey but I\ncan't like if you put them side by side\nI can barely tell the difference between\nthe two huh can you tell the\ndifference um and I also carv both\nturkeys for the first time oh nice after\nwatching a YouTube tutorial I mean I get\nit I I would probably do the same thing\nI would you want to do it right I'm\nsorry my father's dead and I didn't have\nanybody to show me how to car well your\ndad probably wouldn't your dad probably\nwouldn't carve it anyways maybe my mom\ncar my mom carves it up I and like I'm\nsaying I probably don't know how to\ncarve carve a turkey I didn't that's why\nI was I was actually watching the\nYouTube because I thought about doing it\nand then I was like here you go can't\nfigure this out my dad did carve the\nturkey but he had he was like from the\n70s so he had like one of those um\nelectric\nknives I thought I just assumed that's\nwhat people why don't people still use\nthose I feel like I kind of wanted one\nyeah cuz like I'll get you one for\nChristmas yeah it was it was there I\ndon't know if you still can I think oh\nI'll find it someone is making those\nsurely yeah someone's thrifting those\nbut yeah we did all the traditional\nstuffing cranberry mashed potatoes\nroasted potatoes roasted\nveggies nice um we got an apple pie and\na pumpin pie and I have to say the apple\npie yeah was Bonkers I loved it oh was\nthat the one from BJ's nice and the\nPumpkin Pie was trash did the Ice did\nthe ice cream work out the ice cream was\ndelicious okay and then uh no one\nnoticed it wasn't hog andas no one of\ncourse they didn't but I will say I went\nto the store and since now I was like\nwell it doesn't really matter I saw this\nBlue Ribbon ice cream or something oh\nyeah actual trash in a big bucket Blue\nBunny no I don't think it is Blue Bunny\nis it blue bunny I don't know that's\nanother whatever it is it wasn't that\ngood but like so I may or may not have\ndozed off during the Ravens game uhhuh\nand I woke up and I thought it was\nhalftime yeah the game was over and I\nwas like where's the ice\n[Music]\ncream and yeah nice I like\nit uh that's cool though what what good\nfood did you have uh pretty much the\nsame deal\nturkey stuffing do you do any of the\ncooking uh I didn't this year sometimes\nI'll make like a side dish but I didn't\nthis year cuz I does your family like\nhunt the turkey and then eat it like do\nyou have pellets in yours they don't\nthey don't actually it's um it's\nstore-bought but the corn is from the\nfarm so corn sweet\npotatoes uh mashed\npotatoes just kind of the general and\nthen desserts I kind of feel sorry for\npeople in other countries that don't\nhave Thanksgiving because we kind of\nthey do like this meal for Christmas\nyeah we get this meal and then we reup\nin a couple weeks for another fantastic\nmeal Christmas is basically the same\njust substitute ham for turkey well\nMegan and I have done a little tradition\nif if we are uh like if nobody's over\nand the boys aren't there we do a\nsteaking cake so we do a filet like and\nand a crab cake that's a good tradition\nit is it's really nice because you just\nsit down delicious meal bottle of wine I\ndon't hate that at all yeah I don't know\nif that's the case this year or\nnot um but yeah it was good and we did I\nsaw two movies over tell me saw GL or\ntoo the state of Hollywood is just\nabsolute garbage right now let me say\nthat as a preface that's so sad I\nthought that was the name of the movie\nthe state of Hollywood it should be it\nshould be a documentary uh saw Moana 2\nyay why does there even need to be a\nMoana too well I would think the rock\nneeds the money probably it was it was\nthe most\nmediocre just regurgitated Disney trash\nI've ever seen hated all of it there are\nsome parts for The Rock was all right\nhe's funny but apparent according to my\nkids Disney's lost their way oh they did\nthey they just keep recycling the same\ncrap like the music was terrible\napparently the show is supposed to be a\nseries on Disney plus and then they just\nkind of mash it all together into a\nmovie do you know what's crazy have you\nseen the liveaction what's the blue\nalien thing Avatar no oh they're doing a\nliveaction uh dragon that Dragon movie\nuh how to train the dragon and it looks\nit looks like the cartoon like you're\nlike why are we doing this the there's\nnot real dragons pull up the trailer and\nwatch it it no it the dragon is\nobviously CGI but it looks like the CGI\ndragon in the movie so now you just have\na real kid going oh wow they're doing a\nlot oh they're doing human like a movie\nnot I thought you meant like a Broadway\nplay no they're doing that and then\nthere's a live action one of the\nHawaiian blue alien movie oh Lilo and\nStitch yeah Lilo and Stitch and I'm\nagain I'm like wait what again I'm like\nthat kind of just looks like the cartoon\nwith people standing oh my gosh this is\nDisney someone needs to just stop it\nthey needed\nwell is it because rer strike that\nthere's no new like there's got to be\nnew stories are we just done with\nstories it's because they know it's\ngoing to make $200 million in the box\noffice no matter what crap they put out\nand they just keep recycling the same\ngarbage over and over you saw Lilo and\nStitch when you were a kid so now you're\nthe parent you're going to take your kid\nto see it now you have a reason to do it\nbut the thing that I think is crazy is\nthat we sto telling stories and someone\ndid a thing there like it was he was it\nwas actually like why aren't people\nmaking up names like they used to like\nuh like or sayings like um like I don't\nknow come up with any of the saying from\nlike the uh 1940s and stuff oh like you\nmean like you you mean like things they\nsay in the\n[Music]\nSouth not like things like uh that are\nfunny like tallywhacker or scall wag you\nknow these different things that you\nused to like insults that you would call\npeople it's like there's no new nobody's\ncoming up with new like slang like that\nand even I mean if you talk to I mean I\nguess isn't Riz basically that no that's\nthat's a short for short for Charisma\nbut it's still like a I mean skib is\ndefinitely slang no one know skib is I\ndon't think I'll give you skib I don't\nthink that's going to carry on for\nGenerations though yeah that' be insane\nif it in 100 years people are still\nreferencing that yeah I'd have to give\nyou it was it was a funny meme that I\nsaw and the guy went through all these\nwords I see what you're saying he was\nlike what happened there the\nstorytelling aspect is gone because no\none wants to take that risk of building\na new franchise um so it's just they\nknow they can make any Marvel movie is\ngoing to make whatever a few hundred\nmillion dollars they might as well just\nkeep pumping it out but so I did see\nGladiator 2 as well you didn't like that\none either oh no here's the deal I\napproached it from\nthe from like this is a brand new movie\ndon't care about the other one cuz it's\nbeen so long since I've even seen that\nit's my the first one's Kimmy's favorite\nmovie though is a great movie yeah and\nso I was just like I just want an action\nmovie don't really care about the rest\nand I thought it was generally fine in\nthat way if you have any feelings for\nthe first one and want to see a\ncontinuation of that you're going to be\nincredibly disappointed um Denzel\nWashington is just a guy from training\nday he's literally the same person just\nin in another role okay it even ends the\nexact same way as\nsorry spoiler I was surprised he didn't\nsay it\nhonestly actually the guy behind me said\nit okay cuz they were talking the whole\ntime during the movie and interjecting\ntheir comments which sometimes was\nfunny sometimes wasn't when they were\nusing homophobic slurs to describe the\ntwo Emperors like or whatever I was like\nyeah probably cut that out and and uh so\nit\nwas I don't know it I it also follows\nthe plot of the first one like exactly\nit's pretty much the exact same thing\nsee that's what got me upset I you know\nobviously I have an emotional attachment\nto Star Wars it was something that I\ngrew up with loved it new story and then\nthey redid the Star Wars and it was like\nwait the same they're going to blow up a\ndeath star yeah oh they're like it's the\nexact same story and you're like\nwow this is crazy yeah and right there's\nno creativity yeah was it just as like\ngory and bloody cuz we watched Gladiator\nthe original this week it was yeah yeah\nthere and I was like I had forgotten how\nmuch blood and there's a good deal of\nthat well Ryan and I were going to go\nsee it we ran out of time okay it just\nwasn't there wasn't time for it yeah um\ntop golf the aquarium oh yeah we went\nwent to the aquarium we reup our members\nbecause to take eight people what it\ncost the same is like to do a annual\nmembership so if you want to go to the\naquarium Carl you could be my kid we can\ngo and uh we can run around the aquarium\nthat's awesome and of all the things so\nI tell our\nnephew that he can pick out a toy at\nthe like I'm the gift shop I'm Uncle\nThomas yeah I want to be the guy that\nhe's like oh I anything is mine so\nyou're like go into the gift shop you\ncan get any yeah anything you want and\nwhich by the way their gift Shop's\npretty awesome there I have to say what\naquarium themed object do you think he\nwould have gotten from the aquarium oh\nanything that three and a half he wanted\nto get three and a\nhalf like\na not a stuffed animal I'm guessing it\nstarted with I thought he was going to\nbe going home with a snake and I was\nlike really cuz it looked like one of\nthose Carnival snakes you're like I'm\ngoing to spend $35 on yeah you know one\nof those trash snakes was it like a dump\ntruck or something yes sure was was\nit that's the he was he was running\naround the entire gift shop with it just\nlike sprinting and uh apparently he had\ngone to an aquarium in Charleston a year\nbefore and picked out the same toy and\nhe was told no and it was like whole\nthing so that's what we got I don't\nunderstand I thought the same thing when\nmy kids were there I'm like why is all\nthis non aquarium toys in the aquarium\nand that's why also his favorite aspect\nof the aquarium was the revolving doors\nthat we got to go through I mean the\nescalators yeah so that was the best\npart that's we literally could have\ntaken him to a\nmall yeah when my kids went to Disney a\ncouple years ago the favorite part was\nwinning like the carnival game that you\ncan play at literally any Carnival just\nthe one where you just throw try to\nknock a bottle over whatever and uh and\nthe other one was like a ride that was\nlike a fair\nit was like the dumbest rides and then\nwhatever I have only cost\n$300 I love going to the aquarium I like\nthe animals the general smell in there\nis not good can't handle the fish I'm\nnot I don't even know if it's the fish\nsmell I think it's also the people smell\nuh yeah there's a heavy algae presence\nwhether on skin or on land on SE people\ngot to learn not to block the entire\nexhibit people this is the and I I know\nwhat you're saying the more I get older\nthe more I'm just I understand why the\npeople don't want to go out in public\nanymore it's like the things that\nprobably didn't bother me before they\njust added up over the years like silt\nand sediment on the ocean floor of my\nheart and just eventually I don't want\nto when I went to the see Gladiator\nthere's the guy talking behind me the\nwhole time yeah dropping his keys 45\ntimes in the span of 2 and a half hours\nwhy why do I need to do this I could\njust just watch it at home and it'll be\nfine well that's when you went to the\nPenn State game and and my other friend\nhas Ravens tickets and I was like when\nit when it was really cold when the\nRavens were playing\nmhm and you'd probably get an Eagles fan\nnext to you mhm last time I went there\nthey tried to remove a guy for vaping\nand then he ended up yeah making a stand\noh yeah for I'm just like don't blame\nhim you know my couch is nice it's warm\ninside there's food yeah that's not $25\nfor a side of chicken tenders exactly um\nyeah I get\nit all right second checkin as you're\nstarting to build up mileage you're\nprobably doing grit if you're listening\nto this podcast most definitely doing\ngrit if you're doing grit make sure that\nyou're starting to you know slowly\nincrease your mileage now just getting a\nlittle bit extra if you're starting it\neven the low amounts 25 just make make\nsure you're getting out the door and\nkind of getting warmed up before you get\ninto the challenge you want to hit this\nhealthy all right guys let's talk about\nour sponsor Lagoon pillows all right\nlet's do it we've been using them for\nyears now still my favorite pillow ever\nand now's a great time to gift a pillow\ndo you ever remember sleep without a\nlagoon pillow under your head I mean\nwhen we travel and it's not great yeah I\nI felt like the last hotel we were at it\nwas almost like someone rolled up some\nsocks and put it in the pillow to give\nit the stuffing socks and rocks yeah\nyeah well if you want a really great\npillow you can go to lagons sleep.com\nbelieve there is a quiz right on that\npage just hit the button fill out your\ninformation say what you like what you\ndon't like and it'll populate the\nperfect pillow for you and if you use\nthe code believe at checkout you can\nalso\nsave the the aquarium that's why if we\ndo go to the aquarium or try to go like\nright when it opens or on a weird time\nbecause no one wants to deal with that\nwell that's what I used to do with the\nboys uh when they were young we would go\nthere because they' basically just run\nthrough the building and we'd be done\nthey just want to get a piece of pizza\nat the end I I have to say too what\nthey're doing to the Dolphins there I\nhate it it's doesn't make any sense it\ndoesn't make any sense that there are\ndolphins there but and they're playing\nwith them when people aren't watching\nthey refus to do a dolphin show this has\nbeen what 10 years at this point yeah so\nthe Dolphins don't get to play or have\nfun they do though do they so when the\naudience isn't there when the aquarium's\nclose cuz they they need interaction\nthey're in a tank they need to be\ninteracted with they need to have\nchallenges they need to be stimulated so\nwhen the when they humans aren't there\nthey play all the games and have them\njumping through all the stuff and doing\nall the tricks and the whistleblowing\nand all that stuff and they're doing all\nthat stuff it's when we get there that\nthey're like okay just watch them swim\nit doesn't make any sense just the F\nlogic I also feel like the Dolphins want\nto show off a little bit oh of course\nthey're Dolphins they're the coolest\nanimals in the ocean yeah well\napparently they're also pretty bad oh\nlike they like my son Rob liquor stores\nand stuff\nyeah they're they're pretty aggressive\nin a lot of different ways dolphin\nprisons blow holes are getting filled\nokay I got you there's they bully each\nother there's\napparently really\nun what you\nuh non consensual yeah non-consensual\nactivities okay so I\nmean I don't know can you I yeah I guess\nthey can't talk they probably could say\na no is a no underwater they want it to\nwell I think what it is it's it's more\nlike maybe a few\ndudes oh really that kind of stuff gez\nyeah all right well maybe I could this\nbe the third episode that we bring up\nDiddy party maybe there's yeah Diddy and\ndolphins two peas in a pod two pe's in\ndoph you got the idea for the baby oil I\ndon't know um yeah so anyways the the\naquarium's cool what oh yeah\nGladiator just I don't know I don't\nthink it's maybe maybe he w't watch it\nwhen it comes out we watched a really\ngood movie last night oh yeah was it a\nlifetime or Hallmark Christmas yeah it\nwas right up there it was on par yeah it\nwas the new\nLindsay Lohan holiday movie okay what\nwas it called okay uh it was called our\nlittle secret our little secret and\nhere's here's the craziest thing sounds\nso we sit down and I haven't seen the\nmovie I haven't seen anything but the\nopening scene I go oh oh you know what's\ngonna happen yeah I'm like this is\nwhat's GNA me's like no I don't see that\nme what happened I mean yeah it was\npretty no spoilers on the Lindsay Lohan\nChristmas movie\nI spoiled the entire of Gladiator 2\nlet's hold back on that one yeah a\ncouple gets a no one's watching the\nLindsay load movie couple splits up in\nthe beginning of the movie and oddly\nthey're going to be back in each other's\nspace somehow and I I have to say I\ndon't know what it is but I am kind of a\nsucker for the Hallmark Lifetime movies\nreally the Christmas ones I don't\nunderstand why but when they come on\ntrash I absolutely love them I I I think\nit's this like the\nromcoms yeah like I think it's this idea\nof this Christmas Town that doesn't\nexist but that I want to exist like when\nI see a when you go to a train garden it\nhas like those little towns I'm like I\nwant this to be a real thing but I don't\nthink it is anywhere there there is one\nof those like behind the business\npodcast where they talk about the rise\nof the Lifetime movie and why those came\ninto existence and the production all\nthat the weird thing for me was Lindsay\nLohan at one point was gonna be the\nbiggest star in Hollywood right parent\nit' be like Zenia right now yeah she was\nhuge and imagine Zenia in 10 15 years\ndoing a Hallmark\nmovie I mean I don't think we expected\nBritney to be on Instagram Dancing Yeah\nthat's a treat though that was like who\ncould have predicted that greatness yeah\nI watched Herby the Love Bug a couple\nweeks ago and that was pretty good\nLindsay Lohan movie I got to say I was\npretty I don't think I've seen that yeah\nI mean kind of know the premise of it\nokay so a movie we did watch which we\nwatch every year which is really good\nthe\nholiday oh yeah I haven't se I haven't\nseen that is that worth watching it's so\ngood it's the best Christmas\nmovie Thomas's take I disagree I think\nit's I think it's enjoyable and it's\npleasurable to watch but it doesn't\ncompete with um elf elf and what's the\nLove Actually is got to be my if you're\ngoing to talk about a love M\nLife movie that one's the best okay that\nlittle kid drumming at the end yeah for\nthe girl the I've prime minister I've\nactually never seen Love Actually okay\nwatch Love Actually and the holiday and\nthen report back okay all right dude the\nfact that you haven't seen Love Actually\nI know it's just one of those things\nthat I never got around your soul isn't\ncomplete are you going to watch that um\nTailor Swift Travis Kelce Lifetime movie\nthey made is that true is that a real\nthing there's yeah there's a movie\nthat's based off of their he's like a\nfootball player and it's in Kansas City\nit's not wait a dramatization It's a\ndrama yeah it's oh yeah yeah but it's a\nlifetime movie you said you love the\nLifetime movies I would watch it I would\nwatch it do you know that right now at\nMcDonald's you can get the Happy Meal\ntoy is a little piano and they come with\nlittle cards that are Taylor Swift songs\nand you can learn to play the Taylor\nSwift songs on the little piano you\nshould get it for the boys and have them\ntake it in in class though they will get\nstraight AIDS from their teacher oh\nteacher doesn't take everybody to\nMcDonald's and get the key no I don't\nthink they're this round of teachers is\ncty in that way uh We've switched yeah I\nthink they're in between years so that's\nbeen kind of nice I think we saw your\nkid out in the Park yesterday yeah um on\nrecess or something oh\nprobably with through through your\nbinoculars no we were driving down\nEastern a okay and then we're like yeah\nI think that's one of them sounds about\nright um what was I gonna say about the\noh I bought the Home Alone Lego set you\ndid oh you did get it yeah I finally\ncaved in my heart desire another\nChristmas movie I would watch that's the\nbest Christmas movie that one pretty\ngood that's my favorite for sure I could\nwatch that a 100 times we just saw the\nwoman that's in that um what's her name\nmake that was also in uh shitz Creek oh\nwho's the mom yeah any I always forget\nher name do you know it Carl all right\nanyway we we saw her\nshe looks fantastic yeah like she could\nbe doing another and they asked her\nabout Kevin oh nice and uh you know\nMcColly Cookland yeah she had nice\nthings to say and was happy for him and\nhis wife and their children I got to say\nyou really could become a m Catherine\nO'Hara oh yeah sorry he could have\nbecome crazy messed up he's held it\ntogether I think he did get a little\nmessed up for a while for a little bit\nhis brother was fantastic in succession\nyeah I mean time I tried to start liking\nhim he would do something so ridiculous\nthat you're\nlike okay there was a lot of awful\ncharacters in that yeah drama there was\nit was very hard to you would start to\nlike one and start going uh towards that\ncharacter yeah and then you\nUnfortunately they would do something\nthat would be yeah yeah they were all a\nlittle troubled kill it for you yeah I\nnever um ended up watching that oh you\nshould good dude we should just make you\na list you should shut down between now\nand New Year just too much to do he's\ntoo busy watching Moana too oh that was\nI can't believe you got sucked into that\nhow that my brother had bought wanted to\ntake my like the nieces and nephews and\nstuff I could see and so he kind of just\nbought 10 tickets or whatever and I was\nlike might as well go and take a nap\nwhich I did take a nap in it um was it\neven more musical they had this real\nnice seats that Lounge back the whole\nway so I had I had a couple little five\nminutes naps in there that were kind of\nnice yeah so I didn't hate that at all\nand by the way this is a thing now I\nguess people just bring blankets to the\nmovie theater and act like it's their\nhouse no like so many people even the\nnormal theater where I saw Gladiator\npeople that don't have the lean back\nseats people are bringing blankets and\nstuff I'm like what is this see that I\nalso think this is the problem with like\nairplane travel yeah people come like\nit's their living room well they give\nyou blankets on the airplane yeah but\nI'm saying people show up in pajamas\nyeah and are like like we've talked\nabout it ridiculous it's gone too far uh\nanyways but the\num would you like to talk about this\nshoe what's happening no I'm just I'm\njust showing you something I'm noticing\nlook at the heel like it's flat not flat\noh interesting I think this is a\nproblem um any let's see if there's\nanything else we had to\nmention oh the only other thing I wanted\nto mention when we were talking about\nThanksgiving dinner was we had my uncle\nwas over who's my dad's brother wait\nyour uncle is your dad's brother well it\ncould be my mom's brother could\nbe um and he that was a good David Spade\nlaugh by the\nway uh it turns out that he's raising a\nfamily of raccoons basically which\nwhen you said raising a family like I I\nwas getting worried there no he's do you\nmean a gaze of raccoons yeah a whole\ngaze of raccoons because I guess their\nmom\nwas coming up to his back porch and this\nis dude this is out in Pennsylvania\npeople just do weird stuff so don't be\njudging for him feeding are you are you\ngoing to get a baby raccoon feeding the\nraccoon hot dogs but he would make the\nraccoon dance for a hot dog and then he\nI want a video of this I think there is\none I'll find it and then he ended up\nlike the mom got hit by a car but\ndancing she had already had six baby\nraccoons and she's a r she's a rockar\nthey just started coming over to his\nhouse like to the back porch to be to\nstay alive I guess that would be you\nrealize he created a raccoon strip club\nthe mom was coming dancing for hot dogs\nyeah Mom gets killed now the baby babies\nare coming she was a little too a little\ntoo uh putting herself out there too\nmuch Crossing why did the raccoon cross\nthe road to get to the hot dog on the\nother side yeah and uh so I guess now he\njust has this he's spending like 50 or\n$75 a month just on feeding raccoons\nwhat does he feed them raccoon feed yeah\njust whatever he buys trash yeah can't\nhe just leave the trash out like that's\nwhat I thought I leave the off like\ninstead of taking it out our trash this\nmorning there was so much turkey stuff\nand and B and leftovers I was trying to\ntell him this is going to get out of\ncontrol really quickly if you don't six\nraccoons yeah yeah also they're not\ngoing to be able to make it out in the\nworld we're going to see him on the news\na bear is going to come because it's\ngoing to find out from the raccoon that\nthere's a man feeding stuff why would\nthe bear did you bring them to\nThanksgiving no they're not they just Co\nup to the they're not like he doesn't\nkeep inside the house they're just kind\nof he's their primary primary uh\ncaregiver I guess so he's basically\ntheir stepdad it is it is like a little\nstrip club yeah I mean honestly I was\nthinking in my head could I take one\ncould I sneak one down to Baltimore and\nwould it would I be able to keep that a\nsecret yeah from Hill well you wouldn't\nbe able to keep it a secret but you get\nit down here you could live here could I\nkeep it in my house and keep it a secret\nyeah from your kids and wife you could\nput it on the back porch here not from\nmy kids and my wife just from General\nrepu cuz I don't want the government\ncoming and take it from me like that\nthat happened to that one guy with the\nwhat what did they kill a squirrel in\nAAC squirrel yeah wait you're not\nallowed to own them not in Maryland they\neuthanized his squirrel right in front\nof them well it wasn't right in front of\nhim but they did euthanize it speaking\nof squirrels we were at the park they\ndid kidnap it though several times this\nbeds week what's that we were at the\npark several times this week and the\nsquirrels have gotten so fat yeah\nthey're they're ABS there needs to be a\none day of hunting in the park for\nsquirrels no I they're not I like the\nlazy you can approachable squirrels\nthey're yeah they're not even scared of\nyou like they were like walking up to us\nlike looking for food it's unnatural I\nlike the video of the guy who is feeding\na bear and like that thought that was a\ngood idea yeah immediately you could see\nin the Bear's eyes he's like oh if he's\ngot food let me find the rest of it and\nit just mauled the dude oh I haven't\nseen that skipped the food and went\nright after the dude J that's why they\ntell you not to feed those things yeah\nprobably not a good idea I\nthink you I mean you probably could feed\na squirrel but imagine how much if you\nget rid of all the deer in Drew Hill\nPark one day of H one day of Baltimore\nhunting wait deer in Druid Hill\nsquirrels in Patterson Park you probably\nfeed like the whole homeless popul\npopulation in Baltimore for a day you'd\nFe you'd feed unhoused people um\nsquirrel I mean I would I mean it's I\nguess not plenty of people in appalache\neat squirrel and survival and it's\nfine they're do they're doing fine up\nthere yeah but like the deer especially\nin Druid Hill that's out of control I\ndon't think you can use Appalachia as an\nexample of thriving I mean I don't know\nlike think about other stuff that's\ngoing on up there well I mean they're\nalive that is true it is they're\nsurviving on food yeah but whatever I\nmean as let them destroy the deer I\nagree with you the deer for sure no I'm\njust kind of joking on squirrel but I\nhonestly do think the deer I mean if you\nmix if you ground it up mix some\nsquirrel in with the deer nobody gosh\nyeah maybe but the but for real like the\ndeer have you have you ever been in the\nback of drood Hill Park it's crazy yeah\nthere's so many deer and they're getting\nhit by cars and whatever well that's\nthat's the hunting in\nBaltimore it's a cars yeah it's like a\nHonda Civic every once in a while takes\none out yeah but that's sad it's way\nworse F to get smashed by a car did you\nsee there was a Turkey Trot where the\ndeers ran onto the um course and\nactually hit some people and knocked\nthem down really yeah that man that'd be\na wild time just out running your 5K\nyeah I they look cute and stuff but I'll\nbet you when they hit you that's like\ngetting hit pretty hard well it's a\ncouple hundred pounds coming right at\nyou it's got to be like 300 400 lb when\nI was like 200 when I was in high school\nthe lower end two 200 250 one like ran\ninto the side of our car on my side and\nI was in the passenger seat and like I\njust saw saw it coming and like the\nwhole thing like and I like felt the\nwindow come in and like his nothing\nbroke and like the door just popped\nright back out but like his whole like\nthey're so much bigger than you think\nand it it hit the side your car yeah and\nthen just like popped off and ran off\nI've always been amazed I've never hit a\ndeer back in Pennsylvania because I\nwould always drive late at night and\nthere's deer everywhere I mean much\neveryone my put deer whistles on their\ncars what happened to that uh I think\nsome people still do okay what's a deer\nwhistle the these little plastic things\nyou can stick on your car that as you're\ndriving it makes a high pitch noise that\nthe people don't necessarily hear but\nthe deer here that's it's pretty smart I\nhave to say though the deer and\nheadlights thing is real and yeah that's\na craziest thing they just stand there\nyeah\nfreeze wild what is\nthat they're they're probably is that\nsomeone I know that's that's not it\nfinal checkin um we should be cold we\nshould be getting ready for grit we\nshould be slowly building up that\nmileage the other thing to remember is a\ngood pair of gloves a Good Hat good you\nknow I hav been running in regular\nsweatshirts lately it's fun you should\ngive that a try but just stay in cozy\nand getting out the door makes all the\ndifference uh find your temperature it's\ngoing to be a 31 days of January you're\ngoing to want to know how to hit the\ntemperatures that you want out on the\nrun if you have any questions about that\nyou can hit it up in the Facebook group\nor ask people with experience of what\ntemperature requires what clothing you\nmight get some different answers Robbie\ncan go out in a long sleeve t-shirt and\nthat's about it where I'd prefer to have\na little something to break the wind so\nmaybe a light jacket on top of that for\nthose colder days and then yeah gloves\nand a hat you can always pull off your\ngloves if you start getting warm all\nright see you next\nweek okay let's talk about these shoes\nyeah all right yeah it's time so M these\nare the socky Endorphin Elite 2 all\nthree of us the first pair we got we got\nearly pairs of the elite one none of us\nreally liked him you were probably the\nmost closest to like him I liked it I\njust thought the the foam was a little\nfirm and we were the only people who\nthought that yeah and like kzi everybody\nelse was like no it's pretty soft and we\nthought maybe we were crazy Robbie do\nyou remember that yeah and so I retried\nthose and I was like no it's the foam's\nnot right so we were wondering if maybe\nthey did like an inline change or change\nthe foam somehow but it it wasn't\nsquishy this one is extremely squishy\nlike like probably the squishiest foam\nin the game right now for a a trainer\nthat I can think of which I feel like\nsometimes cannot be great for race day\nbut in this case you've worn it now for\nalmost 20 mil so what's I I love it I\nthink this is the closest foam that I\nwould compare it to is the pro four foam\nbut this just feels like a higher stack\neven though I think it's just like 40 mm\nand an 8 mm drop yeah I think that's\ncorrect um so what's that 32 in the in\nthe 4 foot it feels great and it feels\nreally light on the foot the upper looks\nkind of wonky when it's not on like the\nlike I thought oh this heel is not going\nto work uhhuh but the fit of it really\nnice it does have a secondary Loop if\nyou want to do like the lock down lacing\nwhich is kind of unusual in a race stue\nbut I found my 10 and a half fits really\nreally well Megan you tried your pair on\nI was going to run it this morning but\nand I had a pretty thick pair of socks\non cuz it's very cold here and it was\nvery short so I'm going to try again\nwhen I'm wearing uh less cushy socks and\nhope that I can fit my foot in them what\nwhat's kind of neat about it is it has\nyou see the tongue how when you have it\nthrough the one lace down lower it's\nlike folded down uh but if you were\ngoing to do the heel lock you can fold\nthe tongue up and have that protect the\ntop of your ankle which you were\ncomplaining about with right the other\nshoe but yeah like we're in the middle\nof Thanksgiving I'm not exactly in Peak\nFitness after eating and drinking all\nweekend but like Sunday I did an 8 Mile\nrunning these and it just I just felt\nlike it leans you towards picking up the\npace so even though I wasn't like\npushing hard I was running about a\nminute and a half faster than normal\nokay in the shoe and then I was like but\nyou said it doesn't feel as great\nrunning easy like it feels much better\nwhen you're running faster I think\nthat's part of it is like it's a because\nof foam squishy the heel feels a little\nunstable like when you're walking in it\nthe heel definitely feels like it's\nmushing all\naround and and everything like that but\nwhen you get up and you start going\nthrough your stride the foam actually\nfirms up a little bit but still bouncy\nwhen you're going a little bit faster\nand then I I wanted to you know just see\nif like I liked it um so I I put it back\non today and again just felt like it was\neasy to kind of like I wasn't trying to\nlike run hard yeah but it was easy to do\nlike faster Paces just kind of moving\nalong all right I haven't thrown on the\nscale you want to throw it on the scale\nthere Robbie yeah see this is a men's 10\nand a\nhalf yeah all right so\nounces\n7.75 it's not bad\nyeah 220 gram yeah not bad and I not bad\nI think the price point is staying the\nsame right 275 so this is like their\npremium race St shoe just slightly above\nthe pro four and what I thought was\ninteresting we were like okay is this\ngoing to be you know for somebody\nrunning like I think we even mentioned\nlike yeah is this meant for like the 230\nMarathon or is this for anyone and um\nthe team there said that this shoe was\ndesigned for anyone from the 2hour\nmarathon to the 5-Hour marathon it's\njust if you want the quote premium\nexperience and I do think that they are\ncorrect in the fact that there's\nelements of this that remind me of like\nthe New Balance uh SC Elite where it has\nit it feels like it has that wider\nplatform it's definitely not stable\npeople were asking if it was stable I\nwouldn't call it stable I also it didn't\nseem particularly wide like I didn't\nhave to cinch up the laces too much it\nit's funny because it looks wide it does\nbut I guess that's maybe the base\nplatform that's that's so wide which\nshould help with stability a little bit\nand it looks like off foot like look at\nit this looks all walk you know the top\nof your hand with the c Elite Wade yeah\nit's like 8.5 okay so about an ounce\nheavier that feels insanely soft right I\nwas almost worried like did like you can\nsquish these down so that when you're\nwalking in it I will say it feels\nunstable when you're walking in it and\nalso Al felt like around corners it's\nokay but it's\nnot the most stable okay and the trainer\nthe new film is called incred run which\nmakes no sense why it's incredible\nrunning experience worst name for a shoe\nfilm I've ever heard uh I mean they're\nrunning out of names at this point um\nyeah doesn't mean it doesn't make sense\nit's like if it would rhyme with\nIncredible it would make sense but\nincred run doesn't need even it's\n[Laughter]\njust D think about think about all the\nlegal people involved with the naming of\nthat they probably had to just settle\nwith something it's called Power run Pro\nor something it was the other one was\npower run plus right yeah but this got\nconfusing because then it was power run\nHG power run\nPB yeah oh I mean you're already pot\ncommitted might as well just keep going\nwith it yeah but this is the quote Next\nGeneration foam so they got to\ndistinguish it well yeah they're really\nI mean we look at as6 and they flight\nfoam plus flight foam turbo flight foam\nblast plus it's just yeah it just keeps\ngoing Max yeah I mean that's fine cred\nrun what what are you where do you go\nfrom that what's the next version in\ncredit run Plus in credit run blast\nincred a Sprint credit dumb all right so\nthe doesn't that heel remind you of the\nold school new bals like 1080s look at\nthe heel though this one there seems to\nbe a defect in these see how that one's\nflat and this one is not wait what\nsee the heel um how this one's smooth\ncircular and that one goes PL oh this\nhas a yeah it just looks like it got\nlike I don't know increda smashed\nyeah yeah\nmaybe a this is\nweird yeah I have to say though like\nbetween this and the Pro\n4 Adidas Pro four these are probably my\ntwo favorite all right uh right now and\nI would like I know we probably haven't\nupdated our uh home page for our site I\nguess we'll have to wait till you and\nMegan get some miles in these um but I\nthink that you guys are going to agree I\nthink that this one defitely takes a\nspot deserves a spot I ran in the cuz I\nwas going to run in this shoe this\nmorning but my neighbor has the box cuz\nit got delivered when I wasn't home and\nso I just grabbed the deodora gar carbon\ncuz I dude I I love that shoe it's a\ngreat shoe is heavier though it's is it\nthat much he it's not that much heavier\nthough it's eight something for yours\nfor your 10 and a half yeah so it's\nabout an ounce heavier than this okay\nyeah I don't know\nI the fit of the upper or what it is but\nit's a great shoe what I kind of wish on\nthat one though is it had a little more\nto Spring like this one definitely has a\nlittle more aggressive toe probably\ntrue um but yeah I do love it it's\ndefinitely I'm wearing the nucleo 2\nright now so the one guy who always runs\nat 5K that I run in and I gave he his\nname is Scott He coaches cross country\nat my where I went to high school and uh\nso I gave him a bunch of like our old\nrunning shoes like more of like the\nfaster stuff that aren't walking shoes\nor whatever so but I was talking to him\nand he works part-time at a running\nstore near there uh I think it's called\nlike inside track or something and he\nsaid that the the diodora nucleo is like\none of their top selling shoes and\nthey're not even a fleet Fe like they're\nnot a fleet feed either why did he did\nyou ask him why like I don't I should\nhave I could find out but yeah he said\nthat the nucleo and the V like they all\ndo really well that's one of their top\nsellers this the nucleo is it's good I\nlike a lot about it I think that some of\nthe other color ways that I've seen are\na little more interesting than this\nblackon black yeah um the foam is\npretty simple and\nlike this is one of those ones like when\nMegan was talking about it's hard to get\ntoo excited like I feel like this one's\nit's definitely a doable running shoe\nyeah the one knock against this one I'd\nhave is the rubber on the bottom just\ndoesn't feel it doesn't have the right\nfeel like stickiness it's not sticky\nit's more waxy okay and it just doesn't\nit doesn't add to the overall feel of\nthe of the shoe all right so that would\nbe my knock on it other than that the\nfit is good good and even though the\nfoam's pretty basic it's it feels good\nthis one's not made in Italy but it's\nit's a pretty decent shoe I think it's\nit's right there with anything else that\nyou'd put out like in yeah in that\nmiddle area that's like the it's better\nthan the Pegasus 41 yeah yeah but nice\nyeah\num I think that was all I had to say\nabout that what we didn't say CU for\nsome reason we always forget winter grid\nuh that was pretty awesome yeah we only\nhave a few spots left for Smalls and\nextra small so if you know some people\nthat don't want large yeah uh\nsweatshirts but I mean we much we pretty\nmuch sold out in four hours but the\nSmalls and extra Smalls it's all unisex\nso like if you're a lady or a smaller\nguy you can still get in yeah and you\nshould I mean uh or you could give the\nsweatshirt to a friend yeah it's going\nto be so embroidered front and then it's\na screen printed back and I think it's\ngoing to I think it's going to be a\nbanger yeah and the and the the\ncap I can't wait the cap people are\nexcited about it as they should be so\nlots of action in the Facebook group and\nother stuff uh people are stoked M's\nbeen wearing the old green knit cap this\nweekend okay and I have to say she looks\npretty cute is it nice it's a good cat\nthat's a good endorsement are do you\nhave are you going to run a certain\namount of mileage you have any I mean\nI'm real excited so over this year uh\nI've run more miles than I did last year\noh even with some of the injuries that I\nhad this year okay I've already passed\nthe 2000 Mark wow so now I'm just uh\npicking up I think I'll probably end up\naround 2,200 for the year really yeah\nman that's I I don't think I'm anywhere\nclose to that and I think that my\nJanuary training should probably be\naround\n250 so I put in I want to do the 200\nmiles 200 okay how do you find out how\nmuch you run go to your yeah and then\nwhere you have the oh I only run like,\n1400 miles you better catch up what I\ndon't you got to run 600 between now and\n2025 I'll do it yeah no big deal yeah\nyou could do\nthat double grit this month I think\nthat's pretty accurate Sometimes some of\nmy runs don't get up loaded to straa but\nthat's got to be pretty\nclose yeah I mean let's see 1400 that\nsounds about\nright man you\nrun 50% more mileage than me I run a lot\nhow do you like running that\nmuch sometimes I do sometimes I don't\nright now I do I don't know about you\nbut this these these temps and this\nweather makes running feel easier yeah\nit's hard to get out the door except for\nthe wind the wind is the only oh yeah\nthe wind but otherwise great yeah cool\nCHS are nice but like this morning it\nwas 23 there wasn't any wind and when I\nfirst got out there it was a little\nshocking yeah and then you know you\nstart rolling and I was like it actually\nmakes me run faster cuz I want to heat\nup that's the thing I'm always it's the\nfirst mile is supposed to be a warmup\nI'm like dude I'm like this is my Fast\nPace cuz I'm trying to just warm up like\nactually warm up actually I think I did\na really good agression this morning\nlike it went I it should look\npretty like good I will say I was\nwearing like all black with\na you know like a neck warmer on my no\nacross my face you're the neck warmer\nguy and uh yeah I'm 100% it's like the\nbest thing ever I'm do you not wear one\nI do when it's when it gets really cold\nI I start to wear it even for your face\nyour face gets face gets so cold put it\nover my face I usually just use it like\nwhere the jacket to like insulate where\nthe jacket and the neck meet yeah make\nthrough one on the other day I did I saw\none in the laundry room oh I used it as\na headband okay I to me I'm just like\nthe nice it keeps your face warm for the\nfirst mile or two and then I take it off\nyou know or put it on my neck but it's\nnice especially on Windy days but all I\nthat to say I was running with that on\nand had like a like a hoodie Style over\nmy head and people thought I was coming\nup to Rob them left and right there's\ndefinitely comments in the Facebook\ngroups about some random dude in all\nblack there's a kid well there's a I was\nI was running behind are you kidding\nyeah I don't know okay no there probably\nis I was running behind a kid who was on\nhis way to school like uh over by\nPatterson high school and he definitely\nlike got off the sidewalk and went the\nother direction like completely out of\nhis way to avoid me cuz I knew cuz it\nlooked he didn't know looks like you're\nit looks like everybody who jumps people\nin Baltimore yeah which kind of is cool\nI forgot to say the shoe behind us is\nthe Endorphin trainer which was the\nconvar pro but now it's called the\nEndorphin trainer I did get I do have\nthat in my house they didn't s me yet oh\nyou know what wait I don't even have the\nI don't know why I did end up getting my\nshoes after the run I didn't get the\nEndorphin leite you were the only two\nthat have it what did you get the\ntrainer they only had they only had like\ntwo pairs of the Endorphin to send or\nsomething oh man so I got to shove my\nfeet in them you got to do it man cuz\nthe cushioning is right in your house um\nyeah so the convar well not now it's the\num used was the Karo Pro yeah now the\nEndorphin trainer I mean if this new\nFoams in it maybe it'll work I wasn't a\nhuge fan of that shoe but we'll see I\nyeah I stepped I just put it on my foot\nit's feels a lot different than the pro\nso I think did you get that one that is\nmine oh okay I didn't oh yeah obviously\nyeah it's not Megan's yeah I got the\nguide did you get that you got the guide\nyeah okay are you sure it's yours no but\nit's my size that makes no sense I have\nto do\nlike we have like several videos to\ncatch up on we don't need to talk about\nit here we'll do it we'll be okay yeah\nwe're having our weekly meeting on the\npodcast like an avalanche of shoes all\nof a sudden I think we've tapped out of\nthis episode yeah all right let's do it\nall right hi Ma\n[Music]\n[Applause]",

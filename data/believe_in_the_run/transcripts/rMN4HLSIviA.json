  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and I'm here with my first thoughts\non the Northface Summit Series effective\nPro\n3 now the second version of this shoe\nthe the predecessor to this one is still\nmy current favorite allaround race day\ntrail shoe especially if it's that light\nto moderate Trails whether you're going\nshort or long it just one of those shoes\nthat really feels special you really\nfeel confident in it it gives you that\nZing the cushion pretty much everything\nyou want super highly technical super\nfun to run in and this vective Pro 3\ntakes everything that that is and brings\nit to a new level I've just had a couple\nof runs in it both of them have been\nlike one was 11 miles one was 14 miles\nabout the same amount of gain they both\nhad um right between 1,600 and 2,000 ft\nof gain um it was on the light to\nmoderate Trails where this thing is\nlikely going to shine I I still want to\nget this out on some more technical\nstuff but man I'm just having so much\nfun in this shoe so far um a couple of\nthings that are different and it's not\nall that different between this model\nfrom a material standpoint but it's how\nthey use those materials that's going to\nbe different it still has that dream\nfoam that is probably my favorite foam\non the market now for trail running it's\na blend of peba and Eva so you get the\nresilience\nand the moldability that comes with Eva\nand you also get the fun um high energy\nhighly cushioned feel that you would get\nwith peba and they blend it together\ninstead of putting it in layers which\nmany uh trail running shoes are doing\nright now they're putting it in layers\num which is a great option but I felt\nthat this just feels so seamless and you\nget all of those aspects in one that's\nwhat I've Loved about it in the vactive\nPro Series I've loved it in the Ala Mesa\nand in 2025 you're going to see it\nthrough a lot of their lines and this is\ntheir Marquee Ultra distant shoe that\nhas a lot of it it has four more millim\nof it overall um I can't remember the\nstack off my head but it it's up there\nit's one of the highest stack shoes\navailable they counteract that with a\nreally wide profile on the bottom so\nstability um in the terrain that I've\nrun on so far it's been equally stable\nmaybe a little less stable than the\nvactive Pro 2 that's why I want to take\nit on some more technical terrain to\nreally test that um but overall\nstability hasn't been too much of an\nissue so far um the upper you can see is\nvery similar to that second version\nreally tenacious really highly technical\nfibers um the lock down is really nice\nup top this is really well mapped got\nsome structure and good padding in the\nheel which a lot of Trail Racing shoes\nlack I love that they kept that this\nthinner tongue racer style tongue um has\nreally hugged my foot nicely and I've\nbeen able to really cinch down these um\nbraided cords these Lacy style laces\nmade famous by something like the alpha\nfly um it's the racing it holds really\nnice um the most exciting thing about\nthis besides four more Mill millimeters\nof foam is that this shoe has two plates\nand now that might not be legal in a\nroad running sense this is the trails\nwe're talking about where where these\ncarbon plates uh don't quite matter as\nmuch from a propulsion standpoint but\nthey we have to get creative in this\nworld to be able to be more stable and\nget the propulsively\num and that's going to be lower down\nit's embedded now for those of you that\nhave tried the vective pros in the past\nyou might have gotten some rubbing on\nthat 4 foot so that was just because of\nthat plate was so much further up right\nbelow the sock liner and so they've\nembedded that now and you can see that\nthere's even some foam in between that\nplate which is down here and this upper\nplate which is a recycled carbon fiber\num so it's going to be a little more\nflexible little lighter and that's where\nthe stability comes from it wraps up\nright here in the midfoot also has those\nre structured Wings to to have that more\nDynamic stability so they split the\nplates apart and for the most part I'm\nfeeling that the stability has um been\npretty much the same maybe a little less\nbecause there's a higher stack foam but\noverall on the terrain that I've been on\nthat uh lower to moderate terrain really\nroll have some good climbs good some\ngood descents but the the terain that\nyou can really let loose let your legs\ngo uh this has been such a fun shoe and\nI'm so excited to get some miles in it\nmore miles in it so far on my runs I've\nhad a little bit of that that bite right\non the U medial side right underneath\nthat uh big toe where a lot of people\nhave been getting that uh bite and\nblisters I had that in the first version\nof the vective pro not in the second but\nI'm getting it again a little bit in the\nthird\num it really could be because I I ran in\na a trail shoe last weekend that gave me\nsome blisters in the forefoot uh really\nbit down on that part and I might not be\nfully healed from that so I'm going to\nlet this one sit on the shelf for a\nlittle bit and take it off uh and put\nsome big miles in it again I've already\ngot plenty of miles in this shoe to do a\nfull review but I really want to see if\nthat 4 foot bite can be relieved and\nmaybe maybe it's not that maybe that's\nthe Kryptonite of the the vective pro\nseries and it still will be a a\nchallenge to solve I don't know but\noverall man this is fun this is fast I'm\nexcited to get more miles in it check\nout our our full review on believe\ninther run.com",

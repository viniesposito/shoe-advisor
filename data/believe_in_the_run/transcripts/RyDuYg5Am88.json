  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and I'm here with Brett Rivers\nsenior product manager of the North Face\nand they have a ton of updates for this\nthis next year right away in the spring\nright um and like couldn't be more\nexcited these shoes um many of these\nshoes have made our year- end Awards uh\nand they're just getting better like the\nNorth Face is really you it feels like\nyou're becoming a marble in a Groove and\nyou are going like we are building we're\nnot starting from zero each time you\nknow going from Z to one is hard but now\nwe're going from 1 to two to three\nyou're chisel chiseling away that rock\nand becoming exactly you're ready to go\nso what what do we have the new Summit\nvective Pro 3 so this is that Pinnacle\nyou know athlete tested race proven\nSummit Series style within the line This\nthe concept here is is really Revolution\nversus Evolution it really starts you\nknow from the bottom up on this style\ndoes this ask if I want the highest\nperforming and I need the highest\nperforming Trail shoe on the market that\nlargest competitive advantage and so uh\nThe Innovation team at all triangles and\nan ay really got to work for that spring\n25 season of how do we develop a system\nthat enhances both that that performance\nrebound that propulsion as well as that\nstability and so we designed a\ncompletely uh new and really Innovative\num platform in the summ effective Pro 3\nwe increased the total stack height four\nmillimeters overall from the pro two you\nstill have that amazing um proprietary\npeba Eva super foam um midsole here yep\nwith then and that's the dream foam same\nyou're going to find in Alesa the vecta\nPro 2 um it it really is dreamy I mean\nwe've loved it so far great for trail\napplication what what makes it so dreamy\nlike what about it that's the secret\nsauce yeah come I mean I really it's how\neffctive is a system so we think of it\njust plates but it's geometry plates and\nhow that entire system works so here we\nnow put a carbon fiber propulsion plate\ndown in that midsole and then a 10 mm\ndream foam drop in above that and what\nthat's going to do really build in that\nlong ultra distance Comfort um and\nreally still continue to enhance that\npropulsion that you have below the foot\nand for for those in the past that have\nhad some of that rubbing of the plate\nsome athletes do some athletes don't\nthis is completely embedded it's all hid\nunder there and so correct it's peeking\nout of the window some cutouts in the\nmidfoot but it's down in there and then\nas you go up in stack height and you do\nthese these newer softer Foams you still\nreally need to stabilize that foam for\ntrail application and again this is\nabout Ultra racing um you know winning\nthe big ones as we say exactly so what\nwe've done is we've taken this recycled\ncarbon fiber injected stability plate\nand the idea here is really carving that\nout shaping it you glue that in it's\ngiving you a lot of that lateral\nstability building in more of that\nalmost independent suspension um around\nthe foot you know so really embedding\nthat down as well what this does is\nreally accentuate and improve that midot\nto 4ft stability transition which you\nknow again if you're running for 20\nhours 25 hours um you know really gives\nyou an advantage stability wise saving\nyour legs with this entire system so\nthat's all what goes into to you know\nthat Pro yeah and so like you're taking\nthe the stability mechanism we know we\nneed that and you're taking the\npropulsive mechanisms and and spreading\nthem out through and separating them and\nI mean we can't necessarily see this in\nsomething like a road shoe where there's\nthis layered this isn't necessarily a\nplate but in the trail there's some\nserious application to absolutely yeah\nthis is Performance Tuned for the trail\nit's not just taking Pinnacle Elite\nmarathoning shoe and putting more\ntraction on the out so yep it's and I\nlike I like that idea of like a full\nsystem it really is this layered system\nyeah so what about up top cuz I know\nthat that upper is pretty special too\nyeah so uh an improved version of that\nthat TPU reinforced um uh TPU yarn upper\nhydrophobic uh very breathable drains\nincredibly well an improved race lace um\nuh with that as well um and you know\nhere it's like we still really needed to\nstay under 300 G this is racing product\nwe come in at 294 G on a men's nine um\nso as we go up in stack height and\nreally you know do this dual plate stack\nPlate System you know you're really not\npaying a weight uh having any\nsignificant weight tradeoff with all of\nthat as well yeah and and for Elite\nPerformance we know that's one of the\nthings that Runners look for lighter\nweight but they want all these other\nbenefits what what is the total stack\nfor this so it's 37 mm in the heel uh\nplate midsole and outs sole um and\neverything we do in the trail run side\nis a 6 mm offset so it's a\n3731 stack height awesome and and weight\ndo you know that weight after the top of\nyour head 294 g94 and price uh $250 of\nmaintaining price which is huge yeah go\nso in lot like what you'll really see is\nus really striving to maintain price as\nmuch as possible you know this this\nElite uh segment of Footwear is growing\nbut we still want to be hyper\ncompetitive in that while at the same\ntime really delivering something that's\nunique to the market yeah and I and I\ndon't want to put too many spoilers out\nthere but I've been in this and it it's\nspecial it's a special shoe um let's go\nto like it's training\ncompanion right was that what you would\nabsolutely so the vective endurus is\nreally going to be I would say that that\nmore consumer uh relevant style from an\neveryday perspective in this we want to\nreally uh bridge the gap from that\neveryday you know training shoe to race\nday you know for the person who has a\none shoe quiver this is the perfect you\nknow single shoe for them if they're\nwanting want you to do everything at the\nsame time you can directly see a lot of\nthe Innovation that started in the prob\nthat's really cascading down into the\nendurus um and what's neat here is we're\ncoming in at $160 with a lot of\nimprovements that are going on in this\nstyle overall and in the endurus the\npast couple models have really almost\nhave created a cult following a little\nbit people love the endurus so what are\nwhat are they going to see that familiar\nin that line and what's going to be\ndifferent again it's problem solving\nbased off of athlete and consumer\nfeedback so what we want to do overall\nis really continue to accelerate that\nunderfoot performance so now you have a\nful length nitrogen TPU dream Foam\nmidsole High rebound lightweight that\nrebound really stays throughout the life\nof the shoe um we've increased the lug\ndepth to 4 mm and completely redesigned\nthat outsole again to really enhance the\naction uh underfoot uh and then a lot of\njust smaller improvements really\nfocusing on that InStep fit a bit more\nwhere in the endurus 3 if you had a\nnarrower lower volume fit or lower inep\ncould be yeah there's more room so this\nnew dual warp upper that you're seeing\num in several of the new shoes um really\nuh wraps the foot incredibly well so\nsome pattern improvements that we did\nthere um but at the same time a\nmaterialization that you're not going to\nhave very much mechanical stretch at all\nreally secures and holds the foot still\nbreathable still very drainable um so\nyeah overall a package that we're super\nexcited about and and it seems that it's\npretty similar in terms like if you just\nlooked at this on paper compared to the\nUla Mesa uh which has been so popular\nlike what is something that what\nconsumer would look toward this as\nopposed to the ultim itself if you want\nto if you want that enhanced stability\nthat VCA provides you still have that\nthat full length TPU plate it's forked\nand we're doing some carve outs with it\nto get your foot a little closer to the\nfoam certain areas but that vective\nsystem really provides that enhanced\nstability again for the demands of trail\nrunning um yeah and uh uh you're coming\nin uh at a 32 mil stack height in the\nheel so 2 mm more than the prior version\nwe're really aligning that to the stack\nheight of the the pro one and the pro\ntwo yeah so really having this tiered\nsystem of not only performance but also\nyou're filling a lot of holes of Stack\nas well exactly and uh next which one do\nyou want talk about next let's talk\nabout the sky next CU then that brings\nyou into the infinite as well so uh we\ntalked about the pro that would be that\nhigh stack ultra distance long distance\nmaximum cushion maximum propulsion Trail\nshoe the counterpart of that is the\nathletes are still saying hey I still\nneed that lighter weight shoe I'm on\ntechnical terrain uh I need that that\nagile closer to the ground um shoe even\nif it's not my ultra distance ra Sho you\nknow per se um so that position for us\nis the summit VC of sky this is now the\nsummit effective Sky 2 and the athlete\nneed here was I just need the shoe to be\nlighter and more traction um and I was\nlike all right we we uh there's a way to\ndo that exactly we have we have the goal\nuh we cut uh over 34 G out of this shoe\ncompared to the first version exactly\nyeah so now we come in at uh 238 G um\nlight uh it has a ful length nitrogen\nTPU dream midsole um so enhanced\nunderfoot experience even though we cut\nso much weight out of it we also\nincreased lug depth to 5 mm and you have\nmuch more rubber coverage in the areas\nthat you need ITT um so again wanting\nthis shoe to really excel in technical\ntrain uphill train or you know areas\nwhere you're going to be much more in a\na vertical application of this style is\nthis the same surface control rubber\nthat we would have seen in the past\ncorrect yep exactly yeah and we're\ncontinuing to to to work on um some more\ninnovation in that space that we'll be\ntalking about uh in future season right\nnot yeah but uh yeah overall here is\nreally improved traction lighter weight\nand an enhanced underfoot experience a\nnew dual warp upper again really\nbreathable really drainable similar we\nhave going on uh in the uras but in an\neven lighter weight application awesome\nawesome so with that it then brings us\ninto the infinite and how we want to\nhave that that race day shoe um but\nreally still bring in that consumer\nrelevant shoe with the infinite 3 right\nso we actually able to lower the price\non this to 160 wow so the infinite and\nthe endurus are both coming in at 160\nnow um the main difference is a 3 mm\ndifference in stack height between the\nendurus and the infinite um but also\nthis has a 5mm lug out soole ripping off\nof the design of what's going on with\nthe sky even those Silhouettes I know\nthere's more foam here but the\nSilhouettes these are likely to be a\npair if you're enjoying one of those and\nthe other two are likely to be say hey\nlike I'm a a runner who gravitates\ntowards higher stack shoes or hey I'm a\nrunner who gravitates more towards low\nto mid stack shoes and we have two\ndifferent kind of sublines within\nvective that are really going to appeal\nto those different consumer which is\nunique within the market for sure I I\nmean maybe you're not comfortable saying\nthis but this might be the true dream\nteam right this is this is the Dream\nTeam I love your pun absolutely um so\nseem like it there's something for\neverybody but yeah keep absolutely yeah\num ful length uh uh injected TPU plate\nwhere you have that carbon fiber on the\nsky little softer and a little more\nstability focused on the infinite um and\nagain a complete upper overhaul too\nreally wanted to improve uh some of the\nfit especially on the infinite when we\ntalk about the infinite 2 versus the\ninfinite 3 so again yeah enhancing the\nunderfoot experience on all of these\nshoes it's really exciting I mean and\nI've been in most of these shoes and the\ngoal every year is to innovate and\nenhance The Experience like you said and\nI'm already feeling like these are truly\ndoing that like you guys are the team to\nbeat right now in terms of like best\nlineup for next year and something for\neverybody I think that's what North\nFace's goal is there's something for\neverybody every terrain yeah and here we\nhave that Ultima line for kind of\neveryday training and an even broader\nRunner that off Trail line for the most\nkind of rugged applications and then the\nvective line is really more of that that\nrace point of view but how we continue\nto expand that again based off of the\nathlete need of building a true quiver\nof Footwear uh for what they need yeah\nawesome thank you Brett all right thank\nyou",

Megan with believe in the\nrun and this is Megan with Featherstone\nnutrition okay do I even have to say it\nanymore we've been doing this now for a\ncouple years let's see your news yeah\nlet's see the we even got new brand on\nit's shiny there you can kind of see it\nbetter so for those of you who are\nlistening who can't see it feathers\nmarked herself for life with a new\ntattoo that looks like sort of it's I\nwould say it looks like Arrow but it's\nnot because it's more like almost like\num what do you call those things that\nyou can measure like straight down like\nyou hold and it it it's like a plum or\nsomething they call it it's supposed to\nbe an arrow with a feather on the end so\nI don't know what you're saying I okay\nit looks like that but it's with one\nfeather it doesn't look like your\ntraditional Arrow yeah right no no no\nit's you know got some artistic Liberty\nI like it because you can point it the\ndirection you want to go yeah and when\nyou do this way yeah and if you did the\nUsain Bolt thing where he shoot like\nshoots an arrow you're you have it back\nthere already yeah you're going to have\nto think of some new like um Mid race\nphoto moves you can get and like Finish\nLine yeah you're going to have to work\non that so think about it yeah I also\nthink that you should do a feather to\nnutrition T-shirt with long sleeve with\nit printed on the on the sleeve that\nwould be cool we on the sleeve on the\nsame place so like everyone can have the\nsame tattoo everybody can have it yeah\nit's not V\nanything I love it I\nthink who wants to be like\n[Laughter]\nme oh my goodness no I do still like\nthat I like that idea I do too um okay\nyou are listening to fuel for the soul\nthe podcast where we chat all things\nhydration and nutrition and how it\naffects performance and today we're\ngoing to talk all about injuries and how\nto come back from them and prevent them\nand all that good stuff but before we do\nwe want to chat about our sponsor Runway\nwho is not only sponsoring this episode\nbut all of our episodes in\n2025 we're pretty excited about this\nyeah right I mean they are in it to win\nit I mean I I I do want to tell people\nlike when we take on a sponsor like this\nit's not lightly and we I've been using\nthe product I know that feathers has\nbeen using the product quite a bit for I\nmean I guess it's it's I mean been over\na year it's been over a year started\nwith a collagen drink mix mhm and then\num yeah cuz when we went to Orlando I\nthink it's when the first time I met cam\nin person yeah and i' been using it for\na while um that was last February and\nnow I've been using the protein with the\nCrea te yeah so you know we talk a lot\non this podcast about the importance of\ncarbs and how we need to scale up carbs\nfor our performance and I think you know\nwe make that pretty clear but we also\nknow that our friends over at oneway\nhave a product for us that Thomas was\njust talking about which is their\ncomplete protein so it has 23 grams of\nprotein per serving so you can scale\nthat up if you need to and it contains\ncreatine which we have a full episode on\nas well um and we're realizing that that\nmight actually be something that we need\nas Runners as well well yeah and we've\nadded in and I think a lot of Runners\nare doing this now are adding in a\nweight routine or some strength training\nto their efforts uh you know to stay\nhealthy we're going to talk about injury\nand I really feel like that's a a big\nplus is having having that uh creatine\nin there for workouts and that protein\nfor muscle building so it's not just for\nrunning but you can use it if you're\ndoing other activities as well and I\nactually didn't know this this is in\ntheir notes to us but this is a vegan\nProtein that's made from fermented\nnutritional yeast um which is derived\nfrom a byproduct of the beer industry so\nthat's\ninteresting and so it uses less land and\nless water and Whey than the usual vegan\nprotein and in studies it's been shown\nto be just as effective as way based\nprotein for building muscle so but\nthat's with an additive right the Lucine\nor something isn't it that's the cool\nthing right that's the cool thing about\nthis vegan protein is most vegan protein\npowders are deficient Lucine which is\nour trigger to actually stimulate our\nmuscles to recover and grow and rebuild\nbut this fermented nutritional yeast is\njust naturally higher in Lucine and to\nmy knowledge this is the only vegan\nprotein powder that's made from this\nfermented nutritional yeast um and don't\nworry it doesn't taste like beer and it\ndoesn't taste fermented by any means I\nthink it's actually quite delicious yeah\num if you guys haven't yet and you want\nto go try it you can go to runway. lifee\nso that's\nrnw dolie and then use the code feathers\n15 for 15% off your first order good\nWorld folks here we are to talk about\nnot the most fun topic but a very\nimportant topic as almost everyone I I\nmean maybe I can say everyone who is a\nrunner and has been a runner for years\nhas experienced some sort of injury in\ntheir in their running so Megan this is\nvery fresh in your mind um talk to us\nabout what's happening and and what\nwe're going to go over today so first\nand foremost I was curious like is there\nresearch on how often Runners get\ninjured and it looks like over 50% of\nRunners get injured on a yearly basis\nlike out of the whole pool of Runners\nlike half of us have something that side\nside lines our training at some point\nwhether it's just a week or two or\nwhether it's like a big injury like it\nwasn't differentiated but I mean we know\nrunning is a tough sport on our body and\nwhat what constitutes an injury what\nwhat like when we talk about injury\nbecause like I think all of us get like\nniggles yeah there's you know you wake\nup like I woke up this morning and I was\nlike ah my body feels a little beat up\nand then you start running you feel fine\nbut like I think that there's that fine\nline between hey you can can continue\nyour training and hey you should maybe\npull back or see get an x-ray or\nsomething well and I think that's the\nhardest part is like when do you know\nwhen to push and when do you actually\npull back when it comes to pain or\ndiscomfort or and I think a lot of us\nare kind of in that boat because like\nyou said when you're in a training block\nlike things don't feel wonderful like\nthings feel creaky things hurt when you\nget out of bed in the morning like you\nsaid sometimes things feel better as you\nstart to run sometimes things feel worse\nand it's like what do you react to What\ndo you go seek help for what do you shut\nit down for I think that's something\nthat we would all love to have like the\nperfect answer for um and I'm not sure\nthat we actually know this and it was\nreally interesting this morning so this\nwas like what four hours ago I put a\npoll on my Instagram stories just asking\nlike hey how many of you have been\ninjured you know in the past five years\n92% of people have said yes so far so I\nmean that was like I think 1500 people\nhad answered it when I logged on here so\nI mean like that's nuts right like I\nthink we've done one or two podcasts on\ninjuries but I'm not sure we've actually\ngiven them quite their due due diligence\non here yeah um because I don't think\nany of us really want to talk about\ninjuries we don't want to talk about the\nfact do what we love to do myself\nincluded segue yeah right before we get\ninto that is there any when people talk\nabout there's kind of different injuries\nand I I always get this one confused\nit's kind of like feet fever cold\nwhatever yeah I forget which one you're\nsupposed to do when you have a cold but\nwhen we talk about uh I remember I had\nmy coach one time told me if while\nyou're running it doesn't hurt then you\ncan continue running but if you if it\nhurts while you're running you should\nstop is that is that right I I think\nit's so like you can't even say that\nstatement like that blank statement just\nbecause there's so many factors involved\num it and it depends on if it's like a\ntendon or a bone or a like it's just\nthere's so many I don't think you can\nsay hey if it's like this do this yeah\nit's so hard it's so so hard I'm looking\nfor the cheat code right I think we all\nare and I think that's why you know it's\nso hard to try to figure out what this\nlooks like so you know after Berlin I\nran a great race there and I felt better\nthan I've ever felt after any race I\ndidn't feel beat up I felt great I was\nlike super stoked to get back to\ntraining and run New York city so\nstarted back I don't know maybe five\ndays off and I was like me I feel great\nlet's train you know got back to it and\nstill felt good and I was having some\nback pain that I started to go see my\nsports chiropractor for he thought it\nwas like a dis issue and same thing he\ntold me he's like if your pain is a four\nout of 10 or less\nrun right so I mean like I guess that's\nsomething out there in the you know the\ncommunity so I was like oh well it hurts\na little bit but as Thomas said I'm like\nit feels better when I keep running and\nit kind of hurts when I get up it kind\nof hurts when I do certain things but\nlike to our point you know I think as\nRunners we learned to run through pain\nwhich is probably not a great thing when\nwe need to shut things down for injury\nbecause I I don't know about you guys\nbut I feel like my pain threshold\nspecifically when I'm running is\nprobably higher than it should be\nbecause we've learned to push our bodies\nlike crazy through marathons and also I\nprobably I can always speak for myself\nbut I have like crazy endorphins when I\nrun so I think it kind of minimizes the\npain and then after you stop you're like\noh my gosh wait something actually hurts\nright so it's like I think it's really\nhard to have that judgment call like in\nthe middle of a run in the middle of a\nrace of like do I stop do I keep going\nso that was kind of the situation I was\nin building back to New York City um you\nknow and he kept saying oh I think it's\njust a disc I think it's just a disc it\nwas just like some low back pain really\ndidn't think anything of it honestly um\nand it the last long run I did it was I\nwent to stand up off my front porch when\nI was done and I was like oh something\ndoesn't feel good there you know like\nthis doesn't feel quite right so I\ndidn't run at all until our ShakeOut in\nNew York City and I was with Meg and I\nwas like ready to cry I was like\nsomething's wrong like this really\nreally hurts you know so as you all know\ndidn't run New York City kind of shut it\ndown at that point still had no clue\nwhat was going on you know was being\ntold that it was a dis issue and those\nthings can resolve pretty quickly on\ntheir own so like you may just wake up\none day and be okay was what I was told\nso I kind of was just like okay you know\nmaybe I'll be okay but again like\nlimping around New York City for the\nwhole weekend um so then when I got back\nI have a really good friend who's a\nphysiatrist that works specifically with\nRunners she's a runner her husband's a\nrunner so I texted and I was like Hey\nlike this is what's going on she's like\nyou need to come see me so I immediately\nwent in and saw her and she had did some\ntests on me and she immediately said I\nthink this is a sacral stress fracture\nshe said this is exactly how they\npresent and I wasn't quite ready to hear\nanything about a bone injury because\nI've never had a bone injury and I feel\nlike I understand how bone injuries\nhappen and I felt like I was doing\neverything appropriately you know some\nof the risks for like a bone stress\ninjury is like increasing running\nduration or intensity quickly I mean you\nknow I've just kind of been hanging in\nthe high 50s maybe low 60 miles for like\ntwo years now with a little bit of time\noff in between so like no no big changes\nthere um you know other things like\namenorrhea not getting your period\nincreases your risk of a bone injury\nthat is never something I've ever had I\nget a very regular cycle like hormones\nare totally fine um not eating enough\ncan be another sign of a bone injury and\nI'm like you know kind of pride myself\non the fact that I scale up nutrition\nand really make sure I'm supporting\nthings things from a timing perspective\nso I'm clicking away all these things in\nmy head and I'm like this can't be a\nbone injury like I know what the risk\nfactors are for it and I don't think I\nhave any of them right so you know how\nit goes to wait for an MRI and it was\ngoodness three weeks maybe more before I\ncould actually even get an MRI and then\nForever Until the results were back um\nsure enough unfortunately she was\ncorrect so um been sidelined a little a\nlittle bit here in case you're wondering\nwhy I haven't been taking my front porch\nselfies Thomas told me I should do them\nanyways but um\n[Laughter]\nyeah so just kind of disappeared yeah\nrewinding real quick to your last long\nrun when you stood up and you realized\nthat there was an issue there was\nnothing out on the run that like you\nheard a pop or something and like all\nsudden it hurt it was just like a\ngradual MH I think that's the crazy\nthing with bone injuries cuz I went\nthrough I went I it takes a little bit\nof experience almost I think like now I\nkind of know after having a metatarsal\nbreak I was running and I kept running\non my foot and the foot hurt and I would\nmassage it I would go get massages I was\ndoing you know needle something like why\nis my foot hurt so much and I just kept\nrunning on it and running on it\nuntil during the Charleston marathon in\nthe last quarter mile a lightning bolt\nhit me and a white flash went off and I\nwas like you said with the endorphins I\ncrossed the finish line but as soon as I\nstepped over the Finish Line I like\nblacked out and fell to the ground\nbecause of the pain in my foot and I do\nthink that as Runners when you have\nthese goals and yours was to run New\nYork and to you know coming off of\nBerlin and you know oh a little I'm a\nlittle fatigued I'm a little worked up I\ncan run through this but now you know\nlike if this was to happen again or if\nyou were to feel this thing I think\nyou'd be able to diagnose it a little\nbit faster now mine was defitely due to\nincreasing\nintensity quickly and also at that time\nit was during the minimalist shoe craze\nand I was wearing all these shoes\nwithout any cushioning so I was putting\na tremendous amount of stress on my on\nmy foot but I I can totally understand\nhow you\nwould like\ndelay taking care of something and\nthinking that it might just go away\nespecially cuz the way that I at least\nmy bone presented as an aching more than\na like like a pain it was just like a\nconstant ache mhm yeah yeah I mean now\nthat like I said I've never broken a\nbone in my life so like I didn't really\nunderstand like bone pain versus soft\ntissue pain versus like you know like I\nthink now maybe I can decipher it a\nlittle bit but you know of course you\nknow me I buried myself in any research\nthere are on sacral stress fractures and\nRunners and there's not a ton of\nresearch in any research studies it's\nlike four or five people because what\nI'm learning is they're very under\nreported because the pain is never where\nthe injury was like I've never had pain\nin my sacrum like it's always referred\neither up to the lower back or out to\nthe hip so it's possible that like more\npeople have these as Runners and we just\ndon't realize it um just because the\npresentation of this injury isn't quite\nas clear as maybe a foot stress fracture\nor a FAL fracture or something like that\nis it just not nerves in that areaa I\nhave no clue no clue and you know like\nyou were saying the weirdest thing what\nlike I said like I felt amazing at\nBerlin like no pain so this happened in\nlike four or five weeks between Berlin\nand New York City and I've talked to\ndoctors about that and it's just wild to\nme that you can go from and so they were\nthinking like okay it's probably just a\nstress reaction it's like a full-on\nstress fracture right like we got some\nhealing to do here um but it's just wild\nto me that our bodies can break down\nthat quickly um and you know like for\nthose of yeah for those of us who don't\nknow where sacrum is\nMHM can you describe that is it's like\nthe very bottom of your spine so I guess\nyou could say it's part of your spine or\nsome people might think it's part of\nyour pelvis so like our spine you know\ngoes yeah yeah yeah the tailbone is the\nbottom of the sacrum absolutely so it's\nalmost a little bit like a heart-shaped\nbone that's at the very end of our spine\nyou know I think it's still part of our\nspine but don't quote me on that so it's\nlike how do you get a fracture in that\nthing so that's the thing like that's\nwhat it takes a lot of force right from\nthere so you know I wish I had the\nanswer of why do you get a fracture in\nthere because I'm searching for that\nanswer and in searching for that answer\nlike I want to share with everybody\nlistening like if you are in this\nsituation like what are some of the\nthings at least for me as a sports\ndietician like we need to make sure that\nwe're checking the boxes of like why did\nthis happen how do we prevent this from\nhappening again are there things we need\nto be doing or changing and what do\nthose look like so um because I I think\nit can kind of drive us mad to be like\nwhy did this happen you know it's it's\nnot like I understand the foot you're\npounding it against the ground I could\nunderstand you know even a a thigh bone\nor you know the hip on the side or\nsomething like that your tail like like\nwhat Sloan's running around telling all\nher friends my mom's butt's broken don't\nbother my mom her butt's broken like\nthank you Sloan is this the spot and\nshe'll like smack my butt I'm like could\nyou\nnot she ruthless ruthless outside of\noutside of obviously rest did they tell\nyou here's what you need to do X Y and Z\nin order to make in order to speed up\nrecovery as fast as possible that's a\ngreat question so fast forwarding and\nthen we'll rewind at some point but all\nSid's always trying to get as fast as\npossible Right get me back working oh I\nget it yeah so you know saving the the\nAllure you know that end point I've met\nwith four different doctors now and this\nis an overuse injury plain and simple I\ncan't we can't find any other reason why\nthis would have happened 100% overuse\nright and that's what most of running\ninjuries are yes we were smart about\nvolume and consistency and shoe wear and\nall those types of things but at the end\nof the day the things I've asked my body\nto do over the last three years both in\nrunning and outside of running being a\nmom of two young kids running a business\nwith myself and a part-time employee you\nknow running all these marathons going\nto four different countries this year\nyou know like all of those things it was\njust too much for my body and something\nhad to give and because my mind doesn't\nlike to not do what my mind wants to do\nI was pushing my body to do things that\nI probably shouldn't have continued to\npush it to and I should have listened\nmore and taking more downtime and taking\nmore rest and that's exactly how overuse\ninjuries happen right is when our mind\ndrives our body to do things and our\nbody is really trying to tell us we need\nto slow down and we're just not\nlistening um so you know that that's to\nanswer you know Thomas's question is\nit's just overuse my body needed a break\nit was too much jarring on that specific\narea um and at some point something's\ngot to give one of the to get to Megan's\nquestion about having it heal faster and\nwhat are the things I know that they\ntold you and this is crazy to me because\nevery once in a while when I'm having\nlike a little bit of pain during like\njust general fatigue or whatever I'll\npop a couple avils and then the next day\nI feel like whatever it was is gone yeah\nand I feel fine um but you've been told\nand I'm seeing I actually forwarded you\na story on Instagram about nids which is\nAdvil um and\nthey're they're they block some of the\nhealing in some of the things and I\ndidn't understand why so I sent it to\nyou and you told me that they said don't\ntake Advil you want your bon they told\nme any type of nids will inhibit bone\nhealing so it slow down the healing of\nthe bone regrowth so that's the biggest\nthing with any type of bone injury is\nour bone is broken right and we every\nday we're kind of building up and\nbreaking down muscle mass and obviously\nwe want to or I'm sorry bone mass we\nwant to build up and make new bone cells\nfaster than we're breaking anything down\nright so it's like how do we to answer\nMeg's question how do we maximize that\nbuilding of new bone to repair that\nmuscle and make it or bone and make it\nstronger um without\nprolonging the injury right so it's like\nwhat is that sweet spot so very\ninterestingly enough you know as soon as\nI saw my good friend who was the one who\nactually was able to diagnose this and\ntruthfully I think she diagnosed it\nquicker than most people could have I\nthink most people probably would have\ntold me to take some time off and get\nback and I wonder if I wouldn't have\nfigured out what was going on till well\ninto the new year you know so I'm very\nthankful that she was able to help me\nfigure this out so quickly um but she\nimmediately said Megan she looked me\ndead in the eyes and she was like you\nneed to rest like you need to shut this\ndown right like do not walk too much do\nnot run even before we knew what it was\njust because she suspected it so I got\nimmediately very scared of like what can\nI do I shouldn't do anything I need to\nbe like completely immobile so then I\nwas talking to you know a different\nphysician and he actually told me being\ncompletely immobile and doing nothing is\nas bad for bone healing as doing too\nmuch so you want to find that sweet spot\nin the Middle where you're getting good\nblood flow to that area\nwithout um stressing that bone injury\nanymore so I was told like as long as\nyou're not in pain swimming biking any\ntype of just kind of moderate activity\nso not trying to maintain Fitness while\nI'm off or anything like that but just\ntrying to stay active from mental health\nfor bone health all that kind of stuff\nso it was super helpful for me to hear\nthat to be like okay this is okay that\nI'm still swimming and biking and moving\nas long as I'm not having pain and that\nin my mind that's actually helping with\nthe healing process um but then is a\nreally tricky spot to be in you know\nlike I can't do what I love running\nwhich is completely okay I know my body\nneeds that time to heal but it's like\nwhat do I do without doing too much like\nit it leaves you kind of in this like\nlittle bit of a strange spot why does an\nN said why is it bad why is it bad for\nbone healing so I mean it blocks our I\nmean it blocks different Pathways in our\nbody that would promote inflammation and\nand that inflammation actually does help\nheal right so like we're blocking some\nof our body's natural response to try to\nheal an area I'm sure there's a much\nbetter explanation for that but I think\nthat's a good just kind of basic one um\nand you don't necessarily want to block\nthat right and I'm sure there's\nsomething that specifically interacts\nwith actual the bone process of\nrebuilding that um as well so you're\ndoing this like Balancing Act of\nmovement\nand not overdoing it and stressing out\nmore which I'm sure itself is probably a\nchallenge but what else can you do\noutside of like physical activities\nwhether it's nutrition or otherwise what\nelse can you do so that was an\ninteresting conversation I had with a\nphysician recently and he said there's\nthings we can do to speed up bone\nhealing but it doesn't necessarily\nimprove the Integrity of that bone so he\nsaid like right now with our research\nlike you could do shock wave therapy\nwhich will help you like lay down some\nbone and like you speed up that healing\nbut he said like bone needs time to heal\nso by speeding that up it doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's like stronger\nright it just means that it still has\nwork to do and maybe we might jump back\ntoo soon right so he was a little bossy\nwith me and very much um I said\nsomething about doing a summer half Iron\nMan and he's like I'll tell you if you\ncan do a summer F man I was like whoa\nokay thank you I mean I he was great\nlike I'm making that sound dramatic but\npart of me was like good I need somebody\nto tell me not to do something like do\nyou know what I mean like I need\nsomebody to be like do not run a spring\nrace do not try to get back you know\nbecause I think we're all like but I\ncould do this or I could do that and\nthat's just part of\nour me the medical profession in my\nexperience has been a little\nconservative especially when it comes to\nexercis and there are their answer is\nalways\nto to pull back yeah so I think it is\ntough you do kind of have to this is\nwhere I think really getting a good idea\nand understanding your body and and the\nmessages is sending you is really\nimportant and it is like our brain is\ngoing to be like yeah I want I know that\nif Meg takes a week off I'm not going to\nhave a good time around the house like\nit's not going to be a good place for me\nto be so even even though she's going to\nwant to start back exercising I'm also\nlike yeah give it a shot see that works\nyeah yeah and I think you know the I've\nhad some time to reflect on this and you\nknow I'm so thankful for what my body\nhas accomplished over for the last three\nyears like the things that it's\naccomplished I honestly cannot believe I\nI look at some of these things I've done\nI'm like how did you do that like I'm so\nthankful for everything that it did that\nat this point like I'm going to try not\nto cry the fact that it broke I'm like I\nneed to respect that like I need to\nrespect the fact that like this body has\ndone a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton for me and it needs a\nbreak you know and it like told you\nclear right loud and clear that it\nneeded a break so I am 100% in on\nwhatever this body needs to heal if\nthat's three months four months six\nmonths if it's a full year like I'll be\nback I'll be back and I'll be back\nstronger but you know I just I don't I'm\nnot going to be one of those people\nwho's like on the elliptical for three\nhours maintaining Fitness so that I can\nhop back and run like that's just not\ngoing to be I'm I just I respect the\nhell out of my body enough that this\nscared the crap out of me right that\nsomething went this wrong with something\nthat I love to do so much um that I just\nI want to respect it I want to respect\nthe healing process and you know do what\nI have get back you bring up a good\npoint though here um there's two parts\nto an injury there's the physical aspect\nand there's the mental aspect and I\nthink that our bodies are going to heal\nand they'll take care of themselves if\nyou take care of them right but the\nmental thing I think is so much harder\nin what we do and to a certain degree\nour professions rely on us to to be\nactive so right now with the mental side\nprobably being really big\nand like await I know that you talked to\nour friend Emily Saul M how are you how\nare you working through the mental stuff\nand can you kind of give like a time\nframe of first second and like kind of\nlike you know how they have the\nacceptance and denial where am I all\nthat stuff yeah did you go through all\nthose things and probably where are you\nnow I mean total denial thinking this\nwas a disc and I've been told it's\nactually better that it's not a disc I\ndon't know if I'm if I'm on that train\nquite yet but um yeah um um um yeah I\nmean total denial like this I was going\nto wake up one morning my disc was G to\nbe fine I was going to keep running like\ntotal denial right you know um and I\nthink it's our love of the sport and our\nlove to continue to do what makes us\nfeel great that like puts us in that\ndenial um but you know I guess to be\ncompletely transparent like I don't\nespecially at the beginning like I\ndidn't feel like myself without running\nand I think we can all relate to that\nlike running makes us feel a certain way\nit starts our day a certain way like\nwhen we are truly ingrained in a routine\nwith running like things just feel off\nwithout it right so that was probably\nthe initial thing that I felt is just\nlike that this was off but like I said\nI've been very um I don't know what the\nright word is\num I I think maybe because I am older\nlike if this would have happened 5 years\nago I would have been in a very\ndifferent space mentally but like I said\nlike I think I'm just so thankful for\neverything that I've accomplished and I\nI truly believe I will continue to\naccomplish more but I just need a break\nright now so having that consistent\nthought in my head of like Megan you\nneed to respect your body you know to\nyour point like you guys' running is\nprobably a little more ingrained in what\nyou do in your career like I can still\ndo my career without running I don't\nwant to but like I can still work with\nRunners I have the experience even if I\nnever ran another step I think I I still\ncould do what I do that won't happen but\nyou know so like having that and\nunderstanding that and then two I think\nI'm learning a lot through this process\nI have a ton of athletes that come with\nto me with bone stress injuries because\nthere's a huge connection of nutrition\nto Bone stress injuries so I've worked\nwith so many people most some of the\npeople I'm working with right now don't\neven realize this is going on in the\nbackground because I don't want to make\nit about me you know but I'm hopeful\nthat I'm going to learn some things\nthrough here so I can help other people\nmore and two I think every time we\nexperience something in life we have a\ngreater appreciation of how to support\nothers going through that type of\nexperience so I'm trying to like be like\nokay we're growing here as a human from\nthis really shitty thing that happened\num and you know I think you mentioned\nEmily sa the biggest thing you know that\nwas hard for me with this injury is like\nI said and we'll talk through you know\nsome of the things that I checked the\nboxes on to make sure that that wasn't a\npiece of why I got this injury um and as\nwe check those boxes and we're like no\noh like none of this is adding up you\nknow my good friend that diagnosed this\nyou know was\nlike there's too much stress in your\nlife there's too there's excess stress\nsomewhere Megan that is like coming out\nas this injury right like I said you\nknow being a mom running this business\ntraveling a lot all this stuff so I\nthink for me talking to Emily Saul was\nlike okay this is my life and I I like\nto be busy I like to have a lot on my\nplate I don't like I've perceived this\ntype of stress as good stress you know\nbut obviously my body doesn't so kind of\nworking through that with Emily to try\nto figure out like how do I either\nperceive stress in a different way or do\nI need to decrease certain stressors or\nyou know and I don't have the answers\nfor those yet but I do truly believe\nthat this was more less about running\nstress and more about total life stress\nright that kind of culminated in just\nthe running being too much um so yeah I\nguess I don't have an answer for that\nbut you know anybody who is going\nthrough this I just really encourage\nthem to go and find somebody to talk to\nthat was the first thing that you know\nAllison said to me when she gave me this\ndiagnosis was like do you have someone\nto talk to about this like I think all\nof us know as Runners that like it takes\na huge mental hit when we can't have\nthat running hit you know so you know I\nreally appreciated that she understood\nthe importance of that yeah yeah for me\nthe the running on a daily basis it kind\nof squeezes the evil out like there's\nlike fog or something that's inside of\nme in the morning and when I go for a\nrun I come back the other day I was like\nannoyed and I left I was like I just\nneed to run so I went out and I ran I\ncame back and I was fine but yeah so\nthat outlet is is huge and finding\nanother place for it now you talk a lot\nabout you work with people that are\nhaving bone issues due to nutrition and\nyou pride yourself in Understanding\nNutrition and having that were you\nafraid or was there any thought in your\nhead that you had somehow failed\nyourself and then sort of like how would\nyour the people that you're working with\nperceive you when you're having a a\nissue with bone I hadn't had that\nthought until someone told me that\nsomeone told me the Optics of a sports\ndietician having a bone injury is not\ngood for your business I had someone\nspecifically say that to me and I\nhonestly had not gone there until I\nheard that and I was like oh crap well\nnow that's in my head but was that\nperson a professional\nuh in the space but not a nutrition\nprofessional no no okay yeah um so of\ncourse I I probably take to heart what\nothers say more than you would notice\nfrom the outside um you know so like\nthat kind of stuck in my head and\nresonated for a while especially when\nyou can't run and can't like have your\nstress relief you know um so you know I\ndo I and and two I don't want to be\nnegligent like if there was something I\nwas doing with my nutrition and I didn't\nrealize\nthat I was under cutting or short\nchanging myself somewhere I would be the\nfirst one to be like okay I think I\nactually need to change X Y or Z I even\nsat down with another professional to\ntalk through my nutrition to see like do\nyou see any glaring pieces like this is\nhow I did like especially now not\nexercising as much and seeing how my\nnutrition has changed I'm like Megan you\nwere eating plenty like there you know\nthe timing was there the scale the\nscalability was there the fueling you\nknow during runs was there so you know\nin my heart I truly don't believe that\nnutrition was a piece of it and like I\nsaid you know I've sat down and kind of\nhashed that through with other people so\nI think I'm at peace with if someone\nwants to perceive this situation that\nway then that's something I can't change\nyou know um but it is funny like how\nmany people because we get to spend a\nlot of time with you in the public you\nknow certainly when we've been in New\nYork or or something how many people are\ncome up and are appreciative of the\nadvice and they tell you how you change\ntheir running change their life through\nnutrition and how it it improved\neverything you hear that you know when\nI'm with you I hear that maybe you know\n50 times a day uh you know as people\ncome up and want to meet you take a\nselfie whatever um who who are followers\non Instagram or wherever you are and\nthen you get one comment right that and\nthat's the one somebody saying hey\nyou're a piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] and you're like\nyeah know that's the one I'm going to\npay attention\nlike what like when you're dealing with\nlike um you talking to Emily and we\ndidn't really say Emily Saul is a um a\nsports therapist so you know somebody\nthat I've I've used when I've been\ninjured when 200 um 23 I was going\nthrough an injury and it was just\ndestroying my head um and so a couple\nbad races and stuff like that but she's\nshe's fantastic um when have you talked\nto her any about about that like that\nyou get so much praise and so many\npeople you've helped and what you've\ndone for the community and all the free\nthings that you do for the community um\nbut then somebody can say something kind\nof off-handed or you read a post where\nsomebody questions your integrity or\nyour\nprofessionalism did have you talked to\nher at all about that she actually said\nand it stuck with me she was like do you\npause to appreciate all that appr all\nthe folks that appreciate you like do\nyou pause to like take in those moments\nlike you were saying like when we go\nplaces and people are like excited to be\nlike how much the PRS or how much things\nhave changed and how you've changed my\nmentality about nutrition and all that\nkind of stuff and you know I was like\nsometimes question mark AKA I don't\nenough you know like I I probably don't\nlike allow myself to take that back seat\nand just sit there and kind of soak it\nin I feel like I such a go go go person\nlike point A to point B to point C you\nknow so yeah I mean she was talking\nabout that and not necessarily like to\ndrown out the negative stuff we were\njust talking about like just being more\nappreciative of you know all the good\nthat comes in these circumstances just\nas a way to like decrease that stress\nresponse right like I was just talking\nabout like you know being a little more\nappreciative and in the moment you know\nto kind of help things not appear\nstressful yeah and and you know I\nnoticed it as being a father yeah that\nwhen I see a good thing happening to my\nchild\nI I glow about it I'm excited about it\nI'm proud of them I'm you know it it's\namazing if anybody said anything\nnegative about him I wouldn't even\nregister it because I know him I'm like\nthat's a good kid and he's doing good\nstuff I've I I noticed that about myself\nand I said why am I why do I do the\nopposite for myself MH you know it's\nhard not to but you know I don't know\nabout you guys but like I've always\nwanted to help others and I've always\nwanted to do that through nutrition I\nthink that's very obvious from all the\nresources we give for free from here to\nthe website to anywhere to in person all\nthat kind of stuff but I never actually\nwanted to\nbe Megan an influencer right like that\nwas nothing I ever I wanted my knowledge\nto help people right so all of a sudden\nwe're in this position where we kind of\nare like people are kind of also\nintrigued by us and then something like\nthis happens and I just want to just go\ninto a cave and not talk about it which\nis why it is now eight weeks past the\nstress fracture and I'm just talking\nabout it like that's justo right like\nI'm just like I don't want to talk about\nit but I realize that because of what\nwe've built here that like yes it needs\nto be discussed and quite frankly like\nthat's probably a shortcoming of mine to\nnot reach out to people to want to talk\nabout things to get help you know what I\nmean like yes I'm reaching out think\ngoing to help people too I do too I do\ntoo it's just how I am Megan it's not\nlike you curled into a cave and you're\nlike I'm not talking to anyone like\nyou've been seeing all these Specialists\nto make sure you when you did talk about\nthis injury you had all of the specifics\nand all the answers so that you could\nsay very eloquently this is what it was\nthis is what it wasn't right look at M\ndropping it eloquently well no she's\nright cuz you guys were like hey you\nwant to talk about this and I was like I\nneed I have a few more tests that need\ndone like I want to make sure I have\nlike all my ducks in a row which is\nagain just kind of how I how I function\nbut I do if anyone I know like I said I\ntook this poll on Instagram and I\nactually was fairly defeated by the\nnumber of people that were like why\ndon't you have a both button I've had a\nbone injury and a soft tissue injury\nthis year and I'm like oh like it's just\nheartbreaking because I know how hard it\nis to be injured and even before this\nI've had like Achilles stuff so I've had\nlike s so you know it's not like this is\nthe first time I've been s used to wear\ncat sleeves all the time I know it's\nbeen a while but you know I guess I just\nI want to make sure we do diligence to\nlike make sure that people feel\nsupported if they are injured um and\nknow that you know like you can reach\nout if you have a similar injury or you\nneed something but but then also like if\nyou are diagnosed we'll specifically\ntalk about a bone injury first like if\nyou find out you have a bone injury\nwhether it's a stress reaction a full-\nbone stress fracture or even if it's\nlike an accident you break something and\nyou want to get back to running right\nlike any of those three circumstances\nthe first thing we want to do is take a\nget blood work so immediately got my\ninside tracker done to see like is\nanything off and the main thing that\nwe're looking for is vitamin D because\nif vitamin D is low we don't absorb as\nmuch calcium through our diet which that\nlow serum vitamin D less calcium\nabsorption in our diet is going to delay\nbone healing like there's just concrete\nliterature to show like if our vitamin D\nisn't where it's supposed to be it's\ngoing to take longer to heal a bone\ninjury also if our vitamin D is\nchronically low it's going to increase\nour risk of getting a bone injury or\nanother bone injury so that was the\nfirst thing I did is get blood work done\nwe want our vitamin D well over 30 if\nit's under 30 that's when our risk is\nincreased or we're not healing as well\nmine was 34 so I started 5,000 I use a\nvitamin D a day you know not in the\ndanger zone but definitely could be\nbetter right especially looking at how\nto heal I don't think that was a a\nreason that this happened I don't think\nit was that low but definitely you know\nneeded to increase that a little bit so\nstarted on that vitamin D um the other\ncalcium as well so yeah there's research\nto show we need adequate calcium so what\nI did was I mean getting calcium through\ndiet is actually better for bone healing\nthan supplements so rather than just\nimmediately throwing a supplement at it\nwhich if someone has like a dairy\nintolerance or just doesn't consume much\ncalcium then yes by any means let's add\na calcium supplement in there um but I\neat a ton of dairy a ton so I actually\nsat down the first two days after you\nknow I was looking into all this and\ncalculated like how many gram or\nmilligrams of calcium am I getting a day\nand I was like way over like the\nrecommendation so I in my where you\nwhere do you get your calcium from give\nme when you say you those Fair life 30\ngr protein shakes that I drink every\nmorning are fortified with calcium so\ntechnically I guess it's kind of almost\nlike a supplement but um those had like\n700 some milligrams and then I always\neat at least one Greek yogurt maybe two\nand I have like two cheese sticks most\ndays as a snack and then you know\nsomething like tofu at dinner or you\nknow obviously that changes a little bit\nbut um a tofu has calcium yeah yeah yeah\nso you know there's all sorts of place\nbut yeah I so I did buy like the victive\ncalcium chew because I was like maybe\nI'm going to need it and then as I\nreally looked at it I like sometimes at\nthe end of the day I'm like oh you\ndidn't quite get enough Dairy so I'll\nlike take one but most of the time I'm\njust getting it through diet but that's\na good thing to assess as well is just\nmaking sure that you're getting that\ncalcium because we can't really store\ncalcium in our body so if we're not\ngetting enough to restore that bone\nhealth we're going to be taking it from\nsomewhere else which is a bone right so\nyou know it's definitely important to\nmake sure we're getting enough um the\nother thing was interesting was um the\ntwo actually three and a physical\ntherapist that I've been to were looking\nat like the physical assessment right so\nsometimes stress fractures could have\nnothing to do with anything but like\ngate or one of your legs is longer or\nyou changed shoes or something like that\nright so looking at like how does your\nbody move so one of the guys was like\ntotally assessing me and for whatever\nreason my right calf and my right quad\nare significantly SW smaller than my\nleft but it's stronger it's been like\nthis since I had kids no one can seem to\nfigure it out so he assessed me and was\nexpecting it to be wonky like my angles\nand he was like I I'm shock shocked but\nhe's like everything's fine with you\nlike your symmetry is fine he was like I\nI I didn't think this is what so he was\nbasically saying and then my PT said the\nsame thing like your body is moving fine\nlike I'm not sure sure it could be like\na gate because obviously I can't run and\nhave a gate analysis now so it could be\nsomething with that but you know down\nthe line we'll look at that too um but\nnothing you know blaring there now my\nphysical therapist did say my glute\nneeds were very weak which I already\nknew that which is like that muscle that\nruns from your sacrum down around like\non top of your butt from your sacrum\ndown around to almost like the sides of\nyour hips femur type area if you will so\nI said I'm like if those were this weak\nand I was running this much could that\nhave put undue force or stress on the\nsacrum he's like sure yeah it might so\nagain who knows if that was it but\ncertainly certainly strengthening the\ngluten needs at this point so I say all\nof that make sure you've got a team of\npeople to assess your body how it moves\nwhere the weaknesses are just making\nsure that you know in down I can do\nthings to strengthen that right now\nright like it's not like I can't do\nanything in that area like I can work on\nsome things so mentally it's nice to be\nlike okay I'm strengthening these\nmuscles so when I come back you know\nthis will be better so make sure you\nhave that team um we talked about\npsychological assessment right making\nsure like I for me personally it's those\nstressors the stressors in my life and\nhow I perceive them and how I let them\nruminate in my mind in my body and all\nthat kind of stuff so you know obviously\nthat's going to be different for\neverybody but just making sure you have\nsomebody to to talk through anything it\ncould have been a piece of this injury\num the next thing was uh bone bone\nhealth so my one of my doctors said you\nget one bone stress injury for free and\nthen the second one you have to get a\nbone scan to see if your bone density is\nokay so I was like okay all right she\ndoesn't want me to get one quite yet\nwell over Thanksgiving I'm talking and\nlike both sides of my family have\nterrible histories of premature\nosteopenia which means in women their\nbones start to get lose density before\nmenopause so that's like a big concern\nfor this right so I got a DEA ordered\nwhich will look at like the Integrity of\nyour bone to see if it's as strong as it\nshould be for your age right um so two\nof my doctors were expecting this to be\nreally bad given my family history even\nthough I'm a runner and it came back and\nit's phenomenal so that's wonderful to\nsee that you know I don't have like\nanything that could potentially cause\nthis to happen again you know or things\nthat I need to be concerned about\nbecause there are like medications you\ncan on to help with bone density if you\nhave like early bone loss things so\nthat's not an issue but for a lot of the\npeople I work with that come to me with\nrecurrent stress fractures that is a\nproblem and usually bone density is is\nlow in people who've had a history of an\nEdy Disorder so like if in those Peak\nyears of bone development we weren't\neating enough we were under fueling\nwe're gonna I see a lot of that in\nsomeone's history that does have low\nbone density at a young age um so if\nthat's you know people listening that\nmaybe you're in a similar situation\nthat's definitely something to push for\nI did have to push a little bit to get\nmy insurance company to approve it but I\ndon't know about anybody else but I\ndon't want I don't want this to happen\nagain so like if I can figure out\neverything I need to know now um you\nknow I would also just for your for your\nmental sakes you can again like check\nthat box and make sure you know that's\nfine so if someone if someone did suffer\nfrom disordered eating of some kind and\nearlier in their life and they're fine\nnow but their bone density is low can\nthey fix it at this point yeah yeah so\nthere's a lot we can do obviously\nrunning improves it strength training\nimproves it a ton eating enough getting\nvitamin D up eating enough calcium all\nthose things I've seen bone density\nimprove for women it's really cool to to\nsee what good nutrition you know solid\ntraining all that kind of stuff can do\nto help um for sure so you know that's\ndefinitely something to look at you know\nwhen we really look at the research\nthere's a huge connection as I said with\nlike low energy availability or red s\nand these bone injuries like I said sat\ndown I really don't think that was a\npiece specifically for me but that is a\npiece for a lot of people right you know\njust inadvertently maybe we're not\neating enough um or maybe it is like an\nintentional thing and we need to pay\nattention to some disordered eating\nhabits um but that's certainly not\nsomething we want to overlook with any\nbone stress injury I have a ton of\npeople who come to me with the diagnosis\nof a bone stress injury no matter where\nit is in their body to assess is my\nnutrition okay right and sometimes it is\nsometimes it's not so you know it's just\nI think that's a good thing to check\nthat box as well and just make sure that\nwe're you know doing everything we need\nto do there um you know from that\nperspective so those are kind of some of\nthe things that I specifically worked\nthrough that hopefully will help\nsomebody else if unfortunately they're\nin you know a similar\nspot yeah I think that's all super\nhelpful to someone and I'm hoping cuz I\ncan see someone being recently diagnosed\nwith an injury and not and you know like\njust not wanting to think about it or\ndeal with it or or even like listen to a\npodcast like this I'm hoping that that\nit reaches those people because I feel\nlike this is I think it's the opposite I\nthink when have an injury I'm like I\nwant anything that will help me to fix\nit okay that's what I'm hoping I won't\nlisten to it if I don't have an injury\ncuz I don't want to hear about it it's\nlike a that Juju yeah I don't know I\nmean even though like just knowing how\nto prevent an injury right like all of\nthese things like like I said a huge\nrisk for bone injuries in females is a\nManara where they're not getting their\nperiod right so like if somebody's\nlistening and they're like I've never\nbeen injured but I haven't had a period\nin six months let's do something about\nit before we get injuried well injuried\nThomas um but you know that type of\nstuff right like you know let's not wait\ntill something breaks to fix it yeah\nokay I don't even think we're going get\nto any questions here because we're\nalready at an hour mark here but I feel\nlike this was super helpful for\nsomeone who may be going be going\nthrough an injury right now um what\nwould you say are your takeaways like\nwhat are you the most grateful that you\ndid in order to like you know figure\nthis out and check all the boxes and\nthen like what are you doing right now\nto just kind of help with your your\nmental health yeah I think finding the\npeople that can help you get the answers\nyou need or if you don't know the\nanswers you need like luckily with the\nspace in I knew exactly what I needed to\nfigure out to make sure I knew what was\nhappening here make sure you reach out\nto somebody that can help you right and\nyou don't have to do it all alone you\nknow the doctor that diagnosed me is\nphenomenal but there's also another\nphenomenal doctor that I wanted to talk\nto too you know so like get multiple\nopinions if you want to um find a good\nphysical therapist push for that dexa\nscan get your blood work you know do the\nthings so that you can feel like you\nhave like an ounce of control in this\nsituation and so that you can understand\nif there were fact factors that are\nactionable for what might have caused\nthis right for me I just need to rest\nmore and not be quite so crazy with all\nmy running um and life well also find a\nway to get rid of some of your stress\nyeah right right and and two you know\nmaybe it's just how I perceive it maybe\nit's not even that it's too much stress\nmaybe it's how my body deals with it\nright so like even like the whole me\nEmily saw stuff you know like the mental\npiece of this all is just as important\nas the physical um and you know I didn't\ntalk talk a ton\nabout life without running which I think\nis the scariest thing for most people\nand maybe it's because I've had eight\nweeks to process this and come to a spot\nwhere it gets easier I guess is what I\nwant to say like if running was taken\naway for you for some reason in your\nlife like the hardest part is the\nbeginning you know the hardest part is\nwhen it's immediately taken away and\nit's almost like that withdrawal if you\nwill um and I would you know talk to\nyour your team your doctors about what\nis okay from a movement perspective\nbecause as I learned in this which was\nactually kind of shocked like not moving\nis not helpful right so it's finding\nwhat type of movement your body can do I\nhate swimming but I'm starting to like\nit because that's what I can do you know\nand that's how I can move my body and my\ncore is getting stronger my arms are\ngetting stronger so it's like focusing\non some of the positives from this and\nthe things that you could potentially\ngain by taking a step back from the\nrunning focus and get stronger right get\na stronger butt heal my broken butt you\nknow like all that kind of stuff so um\nit sucks I don't want you know my\npositive outlook right now to you know\nminimize anyone's feelings if they're\nfeeling very like this is a really\nshitty situation because it is it sucks\nwhen running is taken away from us but\nit doesn't mean it's gone forever and\nyeah you know there's a lot we can do in\nthe meantime not to draw this out longer\nbut that that I think another part of\nrunning isn't just the emotional like\nyour daily routine but what was hard for\nme when I was injured is I want to be\nrunning with with Megan or I want to be\nrunning with the faster bastards or I\nwant to be running with my friends and\nyou see everybody else especially with\nInstagram and stuff you see people doing\nstuff and you're like I can't\nparticipate and you're all of a sudden\nshut out of like a life that you've\nbuilt like for me yeah there's a lot of\nmy life that revolves around friendships\nand everything where when you're not\nrunning you're just you're out yeah and\nthat's why I feel honestly very very\nlucky like if I could pick a time for\nthis to happen it would have been now I\nhad an amazing Berlin I felt amazing in\nBerlin it sucks that I couldn't run New\nYork but no one wants to run in this 30\u00b0\nsleet and snow in Ohio like Now's the\nTime to get\nbetter I have to tell you Megan I have\nbeen so unmotivated to run recently and\nI'm not doing any like hard workouts I'm\njust doing some base mileage to keep\nlike a normal amount of running in my\nlife and every time where I'm like I\ndon't want to get out door cuz it's cold\nor something I'm like I can I have I am\nnot injured I can go out and run and so\nyour injury while it sucks has also made\nme rethink about running in general in a\npositive way so yeah yeah and this is\nthe hard time posi to all of it there is\nthere is yeah and I'll be back and thank\nyou for those who gave me space and\ndidn't uh what's going on what's going\non why is just drive a blank you know\nlike thank you for people who gave me\nsome space through there but as you all\nknow I'm ready to talk about it so if\nanybody needs to chat now I'm\nhere all right yeah and thank you for\nsharing all of that because I know like\nyou said it's not what you want to be\ntalking about but it is what we're\ntalking about so we appreciate it yeah\ndefinitely we'll do some more on\ninjuries we have some questions to\nanswer so we'll chat a little more about\nit here in this new year I'm sure we'll\nget more questions after this episode\nyeah is it time do it peas and carrots\n[Music]\nbye okay\n[Laughter]\nit's fine I added these you know it's\nfine get this\ntogether my brain is not firing on all\ncylinders um yeah you know what you you\ndon't want to snap bones but you know\nwhat you do want to snap what\npeas oh\nwow really bringing that back yeah and\ncarrots",

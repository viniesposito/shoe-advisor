  "text": "hi this is Thomas with believeing the\nrun I'm back here with gon who we've\nspent a lot of time with over the years\nnow this is probably at least our second\ntime doing this at the running event\neven more even more and today we're\ntalking about the aeroglide 3 and right\noff the bat you handed it to me and I\nnotice that this foam feels a little bit\ndifferent feels like a nitrogen infused\nfoam it is a TPU but yeah I mean it's\nit's a new super foam that we have uh in\nthe in the range uh called energy from\nEvo so it's going to be a game changer\nfor for for us on the on the full range\nand yeah like we're about to talk about\nit is it is it nitrogen infused or is it\njust regular it is it is the it's\nanother process we have steam water uh\nand TPU and we reached a super critical\nState oh so it's similar but just a\ndifferent technique all right great it\nfeels nice and light all right the upper\neven looks completely different can you\nkind of walk me through the shoe\ndefinitely so versus the arog 2 we\nimprove pretty much all the different\ncomponents on this shoes so first and\nforemost the the form of course we have\na better form and more of it so from 37\nmm stack height we go up to 40 now drop\n8 mm so 40 32 uh and then massive work\non all the geometry to make it more\nenjoyable to run from Easy recovery\ndistance but also to Tempo because I'm\ngoing to talk about it this shoe is\ninsane the the concept is called Dynamic\ncomfort so Comfort we have a softer\nmaterial under your foot and we also\ntake that box thanks to genuine uh upper\nConstruction and you know what like this\nshoe is the first one featuring a full\nInside Out concept so pretty much all\nthe the components that are supposed to\nbe inside or now outside meaning like\nfor example uh the toe the toe box there\nis no toe box in this one it's this TPU\nplace a piece outside of the shoe that\nis going to play that role so like\noverlay of the old days exactly but but\nthe interior is completely seamless okay\nand this that's Comfort it is Comfort\nabsolutely and inspiration was a Formula\n1 glove where all the stitches are\nplaced outside of the shoe so that the\ninterior is completely seamless and\ncomfortable so that the driver can be as\none with the steer wheel yeah all right\nso this shoe like you said was\noriginally built off of the Comfort\nfeeling for daily miles training still\nmaintains it sounds like it's maybe a\nlittle faster a little more energetic\nyeah so this is I I talked a lot about\nthe Comfort part because most people\nwant Comfort I guess but dynamism this\nis the way how we're going to\ndifferentiate and through the weight\nmainly this shoe is only 245 Gam this is\n8.6 o considering the sty heite I think\nthat might be the lightest shoe in this\ncategory and this is really something we\nwanted to reach yet we don't sacrifice\nan ounce of durability the shoe is\nextremely durable and what's the price\non this so $ 160 $160 I think yeah Val\nfor Price across the board euros and\ndollars that's nice all right so is this\nI remember last time we had some\ncomplimentary shoes in the trail as well\nfor the AOG Glide I know Taylor is going\nto cover some of the trail shoes but is\nthis transfer over to the trail side as\nwell it is so the the the technology yes\non Pulsar we we're going to have the\nsame form platform but uh most\ninteresting is that we transfer that to\ngravel a new segment for us you will you\nwill have an AOG grade three gravel\ncoming in March uh sorry in May 25 and\nwhen does this one come out so this one\nwill be launched in May 20 uh sorry I\ncan do that again so you going to have\nthe road version launched in March 25 so\nArrow 3 and then in may we we will come\nwith very interesting product which is\naade 3 gravel using the same super super\ncritical foil and yeah a new experience\nOffroad as well awesome I noticed that\nyou're doing gravel shoes now what was\nthe demand for that was it like a road\nto Trail like why are we going into\ngravel yeah exactly I think gravel we we\nsee many small signals coming from the\nthe cycling industry for example that is\nI think very ahead and with people that\nare very picky when it comes to to all\nthe gears and uh a lot of people I mean\nwe are tra company we we are raising and\nand we we live in the Alps very\nprivileged environment from my point of\nview but not everyone lives in such\nenvironments and you can be looking\nforward to run on on Offroad uh if you\nlive in Paris in in New York or\nsomewhere else in the world and gravel\nis very interesting uh answer to those\npeople who want to run afro for many\nreasons uh and they want the same\ncomfort and the same field and their\nRoad running shoe but just some extended\nfeatures to tackle this slightly more\nchallenging terrain and this is where we\ncome with gravel\nuh it's going to we started the story in\n24 and then 25 is the moment where we\ndeploy the full range with two new\nmodels Arrow GL three gravel and the\nblaze that is the little sister lowest\nstack height but still like very full\nperformance package yeah all right\nawesome thanks so much cool thanks",

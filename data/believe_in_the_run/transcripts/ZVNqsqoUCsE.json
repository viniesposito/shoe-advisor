gear\nAwards yeah big Awards best in gear get\nit yeah all right and before we get\ngoing let's give a little shout out to\nour sponsor element yeah so we love\nelement we use it all through the summer\nit's great for getting an extra\nelectrolytes and that sodium that you\nneed and now in the winter they have a\nhot version a chocolate medley if you\nwill there's chocolate raspberry\nchocolate mint and chocolate chai and I\nhave to say I was a little skeptical but\nlast night right before went to bed I\nwanted something sweet and stuff and I\nwas like oh you know I'll give it a try\nso I did the chocolate chai with 14 o of\nwater and 2 oz of milk and I have to say\nit was a nice little tddy before hitting\nthe pillows there yeah and they actually\nhave all sorts of recipes you can make\nwith these you can put them in your\ncoffee your hot cocoa whatever kind of\nBeverage you want and if if you want to\ntry some go to drink element.com\nthedrop and you can get a free sample\n[Music]\npack all right so we're going to start\nwith the best of the best race day shoes\nwe're going to start with our runner up\nand then go to our number one pick\nrunner up this year\nwas the A6 meta speed Sky Sledge Paris\nyes and I have to say I ran in both of\nthem and I like them both for different\nreasons but this was a phenomenal race\nstue I don't know I might have actually\nlike this one more than our top pick\nyeah so I feel like the updates from the\nprevious version were really great in\nthis shoe they kept it so light they\nsoftened up this foam a little bit and I\njust feel like the updates were really\nreally nice yeah I had some good es in\nthese shoes so let's move on to the top\npick me for those of you who know me\nwon't be much of a surprise the Nike\nalphafly\n3 what brought this shoe back for you B\nso I was in love with the original\nalphafly one version two was pretty much\na big flop for me it just they took the\nfun the bounce out of it and then this\nversion came back and it felt like they\nmesh together the vaporfly and the\noriginal alphafly one and it's just a\nreally fun light shoe the fun is what I\nreally get out of the shoe when I had\nworkouts or was doing faster Pace stuff\nthrowing on the shoe gave you that\nlittle bit of extra confidence when you\ngot out there you felt that pop some\npeople still miss that like decoupled\nfeeling but I think this is a pretty\ngood evolution of the shoe I'm excited\nto see how this line continues in the\nfuture hopefully we won't do any back\nsteps like we did with the alphafly 2\nyeah I'm hoping it's all positive from\nhere but again this shoe it's just it's\ncomfortable it's light it's bouncy\nyou've got an air pood in the forefoot\nto give you some extra pop and it just\nfeels really good especially in those\nlater miles of a marathon when you need\nthat little extra oomph yeah the big\nsurprise for me was this was actually\nlighter than the original and gets down\nfor my size 10 and a half under 8 O so\nit in the sevens for a size 10 and 1 12\nwhich is pretty incredible with all this\nTech the plate the air bubbles\neverything going into this shoe they\nreally kept it light yeah so for every\nrace in 2024 that I had the any option\nof Sho I wanted to wear this one was on\nmy feet all\nright all right M so there's kind of a\nnew category that's like I don't want to\ncall it the slower marathoners Marathon\nsh but it's certainly tamed like down a\nlittle bit from those tip of the spear\nElite running racing shoes and we're\ncalling them beginner Racing shoes yeah\nI think these are shoes that for someone\nwho is new to running or new to carbon\nplated shoes these feel very friendly to\nyour foot I would agree with that they\ndon't feel as foreign as maybe the race\nshoes are a little more accessible so\nlet's start with the runner up what do\nwe got here that is the Solomon slab\nSpectre yeah we all love this shoe and\nas a matter of fact for us this was\nsomething that we liked using for like\ndaily miles just cuz it has that nice\nSnappy feel with the premium foam carbon\nfiber plate it just felt great has a\nvery stable heel and that's one of the\nthings that they talk about about for\nsomebody who's going to be out there for\nlonger than 3 hours and 30 minutes or 4\nhours this is one of those shoes that's\ngoing to have a little more structure so\nthat while you're out there for a long\ntime it helps keep your form together\nyeah and Solomon even said in designing\nthe shoe it was exactly for that it was\nfor the person who's going to be out\nthere longer than 3 hours and 30 minutes\nand so you just get a comfortable shoe\nbut you also get those properties of a\nrace St shoe so you do get that nice\nbounce but in a more structure\nsupportive build so what's the shoe that\nwe always recommend to people right now\nfor a race day if they're like you know\nI'm not sure what I want I need\nsomething that kind of is familiar and\nkind of like not so aggressive maybe a\nlittle more stable yeah always the New\nBalance SC Elite V4 this shoe I ran the\nNew York City marathon in this year\nactually this exact pair it seems pretty\nclean for that maybe it wasn't this\nexact pair okay um and it's just it's so\nnice because you do get that carbon\nfiber plate and you do get that really\nnice bounce but the foam this fuel cell\nfoam that they're using is soft and and\nresponsive but it gives and so you feel\nlike in those later miles you still have\na really comfortable shoe on yeah and\nthis shoe having a wider platform kind\nof made it feel a little bit more\nforgiving especially when your form was\nbreaking down towards the end of that\nMarathon or or something like that it\njust felt a little more I don't know\njust forgiving is the word I would use\nforgiving is a good word and then also\nthis upper while it does feel race like\nit also provides some decent structure\nand support so you feel like you get a\nnice lock down and just more of the\ndaily trainer Vibes that I think someone\ngoing out for their first marathon will\nfeel very comfortable\nwith all right the next one is one of my\nfavorites it's kind of newish as of last\nyear these are the top Super trainers\nall right our first pick might be a\nlittle controversial our runner up and\nthat's why it's our runner up and not in\nfirst first place cuz it's really\nintended to be a race day shoe we all\nloved it for a super trainer and what we\nmean by super trainer is a shoe that you\ncan use for daily training miles but has\nall the components that you love in the\nnew shoes like plates Foams all the top\nlike technology but in a shoe you can\nwear every day all right so the shoe\nyou're talking about is the Hoka coo X1\nyeah we were kind of like kind of\nweirded out by this shoe when we first\ngot it cuz they were like this is our\npremium race day shoe and we tried it\nand we're like no it was a little heavy\nthe upper was a little bizarre and the\nlacing on it was nuts yeah so all of\nthose things kind of took it out of the\nrace day category for us and put it into\nthat daily trainer super trainer just\nbecause while it does have these amazing\nqualities and feels really fun out on\nthe roads it's a little heavy it just it\nit's a little um not racy and so we just\nfound it was more fun just to go out and\ndo daily training in it as a matter of\nfact it's probably my favorite shoe to\nget miles in this past year I just used\nit for just about everything for a while\nI I spent so much time in this shoe\naround what was that February or when we\ngot it trials yeah it was hard to get\nthis off my feet to go on to review the\nnext shoe it just felt great my legs\nfelt great afterwards it's fun when you\ndid want to pick it up it could pick it\nup it did not feel that bad when you\nwere doing easy slower miles so it I\njust loved this shoe and the rocker in\nit was I just thought great yeah so for\nus really great super trainer one of the\ndrawbacks to it being considered a super\ntrainer is the price tag it was 275\nwhich it's pretty high up there but I\nfelt like I ran a lot of miles in this\nshoe and it held up really well yeah I\nthink unlike a lot of race day shoes\nthis is very durable you get tons of\nrubber on the outsole so you probably\ncan get hundreds and hundreds of miles\nout of it yeah we're looking forward to\nthe next version of this which drops\nsome weight and might move it up into\nthe race day category all right our top\nsuper trainer Cay in hot real late the\nNike zoomfly 6 what was really\nsurprising about this one is I've hated\nevery other version of the zoom uh Zoom\nfly yeah but they made a bunch of\nupdates to this one you have some zoomx\nunderfoot you've got a carbon fiber\nplate and it's just a really nice update\nyeah it fits nice and the immediate\nthing I noticed this feels like like a\ntraining companion to the alphafly so it\nwas like really familiar on your foot if\nyou've run in the alphafly 3 you put\nthis on and I was running it I was like\noh this is what you should be using on\nthe daily basis so that when you go to\nrace in the alpal fly you have that\nfamiliar feel now the other thing I\nliked about this shoe with the carbon\nplate and a little bit of zoomx in here\nwas that you probably could use this for\na race day shoe as well and a lot of the\nshoes that are super trainers you can\nyeah and so while it does have those\ndaily trainer quality so the upper is\nnice and structured you have a lot of\npadding around the collar it does have\nsome of those race day feels underfoot\num it is a little heavier and it's\ndefinitely very durable so I I do think\nit sticks into that super trainer\ncategory but again if you did want to\ntake it on race day you probably\ncould all right M so we're moving into\ndaily trainers and our first runner up\nis the New Balance Rebel V4 this is a\nlittle controversial too because really\nthis is sort of an uptempo trainer they\nwould call\nbut for us we use it more like a daily\ntrainer and one of the reasons we love\nit is you can pick up the pace in it\nyeah so it is really nice and light you\nhave this version of fuel cell that's\nbouncy um but it also feels great for\neasy miles so while yes you can use this\nfor workouts because it is so light and\nNimble I found it was really nice for\njust getting out on the road and doing\nsome easy miles I love the look of it as\nwell I I think it was one of the best\nlooking shoes of this year the other\nthing that I'm really excited about is\nwe've seen the V5 coming out next year\nand some of the things that we critiqued\nabout the shoe being a little bit thin\non the forefoot is going to be remedied\nI think it's going to even move more\ninto that daily training space but still\nbe fun and quick under the feet our top\npick of daily trainers of 2024 is the\nPuma DV8 Nitro 3 all right May what do\nwe love about this shoe so I think what\nI loved about this shoe was it's great\nfor everything so yes great for daily\nmileage just going out and having a nice\nbut also there's a plate in here you can\npick it up the foam is nice and\nresponsive it just it's a comfortable\nshoe uh and can do pretty much\neverything what I love about it it's\nsort of that traditional trainer like a\nit doesn't feel far out there or like\nwild like new but all the components and\nthe ingredients in the shoe make it\nsuper fun so you have this uh Nitro foam\nthat they've got on the bottom that's\nbouncy and responsive and really holds\nup really well you were talking about\nthe power plate gives it that Snappy\nfeeling it's not so aggressive that you\ncan't use it every day so it still has\nsome Flex in it and then you've got that\nPuma grip that we've love for keeping\ngreat traction out on the street and\nthis upper I thought it looked nice it\nfit well it we were running in this in\nthe summer it breathed well it's just a\nwell executed shoe and I felt like when\nsomeone came to me and they're like hey\nI want to try something a little spicier\nthan like your average daily trainer\nthis was the one I was like you said get\nthe one with Nitro written on the side\nget this one spicy and it is spicy it's\na little spicier than say like your\nstandard daily trainer with just an EVA\nfoam or something like that yeah and I\nlove a daily trainer that if you're\nhaving a good day and you're feeling\ngood and you want to pick it up this the\nshoe works so I think that's a that's a\ntop pick that's the\nspice Puma got the top pick for daily\ntrainer we're into the max this is\nreally your specialty I don't know\nanybody who loves Max cushioning more\nthan you so these are your picks yeah so\nrunner up is the Puma mag Max this is\nPuma's latest Max cushion shoe we didn't\neven know it was coming out when it was\ncoming out this year so it surprise\nshowed up in our front door and it was a\nvery exciting one it's got tons of Stack\nbut it's this nice Nitro foam so not\nonly do you get this giant slab of foam\nunderfoot but it's actually quite\nresponsive and really fun to run in what\nI really like about the Puma shoes this\nyear they really nailed the uppers it's\na big improvement over the past years\nthey've got much better fitting ERS the\nknit tongue the knit Tong stret but over\nthis much stack I felt your foot was\nreally locked in nicely it's actually\nthe sidewalls actually come up over the\nside so you're actually in kind of a\nGroove so even though you're higher and\nit's really cushioned it's not unstable\nthe shoe felt really nice well on top of\nthat you have this very very wide base\nof the shoe so you get plenty of\nstability just from all the ground\ncontact um so while you are sitting on a\non a giant slab of foam it does feel\nvery stable and again this goes back to\njust being really fun to run in we have\nthis amazing Puma grip so that all of\nour miles are very tractiony and fun\nagain we got this shoe in some warmer\nweather yeah how how the upper breathe\nthe upper was fine it was you know it it\nis pretty substantial and that you have\na lot of support but it it breathed just\nfine plus you got to love the hidden\ndetails bouncy AF a lot of controversy\nabout what the AF what AF stands for\nokay all right moving on to our top pick\nof Max cushion shoes this one shocked me\nshocked me to the core give me that side\nBrooks Glycerin Max okay this foam was\nthe trick yeah it has a dual density\nsuper critical foam all blown up at once\nwe got to see it in like Puck form\nbefore they explode it yeah and it turns\ninto this and it's really neat there's\nno glue there's no adhesive it's all all\nchemically bonded together and the\nfeeling was different yeah it's a very\nsoft comfortable yet bouncy ride and it\njust feels great and they've paired it\nwith this this pretty simple mesh upper\nbut there's lots of padding around the\ntongue and collar so it's very\ncomfortable on steep in and it's just a\nlovely Max cushion shoe and I can't\nbelieve I'm saying this like Brooks\ntypically their designs aren't my\nfavorite it's a good looking shoe this\nis a great looking shoe and I've seen\nsome of the stuff that's coming out for\n2025 they're continuing that look I\nfeeling it could be brookser next year\nnot 100% certain yet but the look\nthey're going up with some new Foams\nit's going to be a good one but about\nthis shoe what I really loved about this\nMax cushion was that dual density foam I\nkind of felt like when you land you get\nthat squish down that you're looking for\nin a Max cush shoe but then the rebound\nthe bounce and the stability of this uh\ncore foam really did a great job the\nrubber on the bottom provided tons of\ntraction and it's another one where you\nsit down in the foam a little bit and\nthe stability was fine yeah and again\nyou have that very wide platform that\nyou're landing on so it's just even with\nall that stack underfoot very stable\nvery fun to run in and yeah this is the\ntop pick of Max Kush and I'd say even\nthough it's not the lightest turnover\nwas easy and you could kind of pick up\nthe Pac and I'm not saying you're going\nto go run your best 5K in it but it's it\ncan it can move yeah again it's like if\nyou're going out on a easy run and\nyou're feeling good one day you could\ndefinitely pick up the pace in this it's\nthe\nbounce all right we're bringing Robbie\nin for this next category for the next\nlike six categories okay cool till the\nend of the I think well I'm saying I got\nyou it's not Megan anymore and it's a\nnew category and this category is uh fit\nand function what yeah so this kind of\ncombines I don't know it's it's a\ncategory that combines in a way overall\nbut especially the fit of the upper that\nthat really supplements the mile and the\nride so uh runner up first in this\ncategory is the Mount Coast\nR1 this was a surprising shoe a cuz\nMount the coast is a brand new company\nuh and B we just weren't sure what it\nwas all about yeah what I like about\nthis shoe is a smooth transition you\ntalk about some of the things here so it\nhas\nthis technology that they're calling\ngolow yeah so it's kind of like a little\nbit of a frame to harness the foot give\nyou that a little bit of stability over\nlonger miles it I don't know how much it\nmatters but what I love about this shoe\nespecially is the fit of the upper has\nthis interesting uh zonal lacing system\nwhere you have a toggle in the front\npart of the foot regular lacing at the\ntop so the idea here being if you're on\nlonger distance runs you can open up the\nforefoot to give you some more room to\naccommodate a swelling in your feet or\nwhatever yeah mount Coast is kind of\npositioning themselves as the road Ultra\nShoe here and we get it with zero sag\nmeaning the foot won't like collapse\nunder the foref foot as you put in those\nextra miles as your foot expands Robbie\nis talking about that zonal lacing that\nyou can loosen up and keep it tighter on\nthe top Robbie I never got past maybe 10\nmiles in this shoe you did a long run\nwith that's one of the times we did like\na 20 M run where you were this year I\ndid a couple in this year it was great I\nlove this it was a really surprise hit\nfor me uh I'm excited to see what they\nhave coming in 2025 a couple Trail\nmodels so let's see what happens yeah\nit's light it rolls through your foot\nstride really nice I think it's a good\none so what beat it out all right number\none in that category is the hyperium\nBrooks Hyperion Max 2 this is just one\nof those shoes that again we liked the\nfirst version of it but I felt like it\nreally came together for the second\nversion this upper and pretty much all\nthe uppers in the Hyperion lineup this\ntime just bangers yeah I think it's\nprobably the best upper of the year of\nany shoe that we tried It just fits the\nfoot so perfectly and has these Sawtooth\nlaces that you find a lot of race shoes\nRobbie do you like Sawtooth laces I\nalways will give them my appreciation so\nheartfelt thanks to every shoe brand\nthat uses them and I feel like the fit\nof this especially is important to\nharnessing the ride in this shoe which\nisn't great at slower Paces but when you\npick it up and that Tempo range it's\nreally just nice yeah that's where this\nshoe kind of missed the mark for me a\nlittle bit was that for like a daily\nTrainer allpurpose shoe like a super\ntrainer the ride of it when you just\ndidn't feel like pushing the pace was a\nlittle bit harsh and a little bit firm\nfor my taste Robie you seem to love it\nyeah I guess that's the part that I\nliked about it is that it just feels\nit's not super super soft it just feels\nlike you can harness that ground feel\nand energy especially with the nylon\nplate in the middle of the midsole there\nand I think it's just the best version\nof DNA flash foam that Brooks has used\nto dat I like that you said harnessing\nmhm gy\nup all right Robbie everybody needs some\nstability in their life yeah especially\nus we're not stability reviewers nor do\nwe have stability in our lives absolute\ntrain wreck over here but we do have a\nstability review team and they pick\ntheir favorite shoes of the year so\nwe'll give them to you runner up is the\nMount the coast P1 the P1 is interesting\nit uses kind of what a lot of shoe\nbrands are used in these days which is\nlight stability or certain pieces so\nthey have this 3D AR Trail in here for a\nlittle bit of extra stability they have\na molded insole two piece insole that\ngives you support in certain areas uh\nand then they have this pea blend\nmidsole that provides a nice bounce and\nresponse to uh to your run and they do\nit all in a pretty nice looking package\nyeah I think their shoes came out really\nclean this year and even though I'm not\na stability guy I mean if I was going to\nwear stability yeah this is the one I\nget stability reviewers put a ton of\nmiles on the shoe really enjoyed it so\ngood job all right Robbie and so the top\nspot goes to drum roll the A6 Joe Kyo 31\nprobably no surprise there it seems\nthat's stability that's the definition\nof stability shoe it seems to be at the\ntop of the list for many years in a row\nor somewhere in the mix all right so\nwhat makes the Kayo 31 so great and\nyou'll even see some of the pro athletes\nrunning in it when they're doing\ntraining runs is the wide platform and\nnow they kind of have done geometry to\nkind of give you that stability so done\naway with that hard posting on the\nmedial side and kind of just use the\nshape of the shoe and the width of the\nshoe to give you that nice stable ride\nand glide through your run and they did\na great job updating the shoe it looks\nfantastic and uh pretty lightweight yeah\nfor for stability shoe and really has\nbecome the industry standard for\nstability trainers yeah all\nright you know what it's like when\npeople don't give you your du um yeah\nevery day every dang day yep it's the\nmost underrated category or overrated\nreally depending on the Outlook um no\nthis is the most underrated shoes though\nand I'm going to start we're going to go\nwith the honorable mention the runner up\nwith the Muno Neo Vista and I don't know\nmaybe this should be a different\ncategory but it should cuz this shoe was\ngreat I do feel like there wasn't enough\ntalk about it among people do you think\nit's because it just didn't get out\nthere enough maybe um I think the people\nwho loved it really loved it though I\nreally loved it I thought it was a great\nshoe it was a surprise we were a little\nnervous about the knit upper knit upper\nworked great the bottom side the cush MH\nthe little bit of a pla down here it all\nworked yeah it's a little soft on\nunderfoot but I'm not usually not a huge\nhuge fan ofof soft shoes I don't know it\njust felt good to me especially with the\nplate it rolls along really nicely I\nthink that fit of the upper really\nchanged it for me it just locks in\nreally well like you said knit uppers\nare super hit or miss this one was a hit\nhit um and I felt like it's the the also\nthe not the return of mauno but it's\nlike mauno like doing something new and\ninteresting yeah refh the refresh of\nmauno exactly and the great thing about\nthis was there wasn't one person on our\nteam who didn't love running in the shoe\nyou me Megan everyone even Aubrey who\nran the Amsterdam Marathon or half\nmarathon in the shoe uh we even had Ryan\nHaynes our assistant editor he was a fan\nof this shoe yeah there's nobody that\ntried this shoe who didn't like it\nexactly so good job all right so the\nnext one is and the winner of our most\nunrated shoe is the toppo athletic\nSpectre 2 which this is not the Spectre\n2 it's a cyclone 2 but it looks very\nsimilar and the image you're seeing\nright now probably is spect we it's at\nhome so we do have Cy 2 in the office it\nlooks very similar in fact at first\nglance you might even get the two shoes\nconfused but the difference is that the\nSpectre 2 has a higher stack height 37\nmm in the heel so it offers this really\nnice comfortable ride from a 100% paback\nmsle which is you know as you know\npaback is the good stuff and not this is\nlike the paback the real packs not just\nthe generic peba and the Spectre is a\nvery simple shoe and that the upper just\nkind of nice gives you that that wider\ntoe box it kind of wraps around the foot\nwell like all too shoes do and then it's\njust a slab of paback Under Foot that\ngives you a really bouncy fun ride\ncomfortable can kind of do everything\nand 5mm drop so it's not zero drop but\nhas that natural toe box that I think a\nlot of ultra fans are coming over to\ntoppo for that reason and uh it's a\npretty good deal\n[Music]\nboo hey was that the biggest surprise oh\nI mean I knew you were there so not\nquite all right so what was the biggest\nsurprise to us this year after I did\nthat Dad joke runner up would be the\nHoka Skyward X this was crazy I think\nthis was a surprise because we didn't\neven know this was coming no so and then\nall of a sudden was like oh this is for\nsale well what was interesting about\nthis one too is I had just been like hey\nthe C X1 is a great daily trainer you\nget that nice cush the plated Rock\neverything it's like a daily trainer and\nthis came out and I'm like well yeah\nthis is pretty similar to the C X1 at a\nmuch better price yeah so you do get\nthat huge stack of foam underfoot you\nget a pretty comfortable upper and you\nget a wild kind of carbon fiber not\nplate but design it's crazy you've got\nlike a double like H plate with\nindependent suspension on each side\nwings here on the back the upper fits\ngreat so the CLX one we were CRA weren't\ncrazy about the upper or the laces this\none fits more like a traditional shoe\nit's got a really nice heel counter just\nreally is one of those shoes that rolls\nthrough your stride and gives you all\nthat cushion when you're done running\nyour legs feel fresh all right let's go\nto the winner all right cow Chow this\none boom dude I love the shoe the\ndiodora gar carbon this is this was a\nsurprise because because deodor has done\nokay with there's some really nice\nmodels some really okay models in the\nracing Department didn't really have\nanything great and then they came out\nwith a gar carbon which is $300 caveat\nbut there's a lot of real premium\nelements in this shoe we've said before\nthe price though is different like\nthey're not making the amount of shoes\nas like a Nike or something like that so\nyou're buying a more limited edition\nshoe and Rob you mentioned some of the\nfeatures like this Matrix upper yeah the\nMatrix upper real premium durable great\nfitting upper you got the PBX midsole\nwith the Ana PBX you have a carbon fiber\nplate fairly lightweight package I just\nran in this shoe again this morning I'm\nactually surprised how much I love this\nshoe and keep coming back to it I think\nit's a great shoe it wasn't the same for\nyou but well no I do think it's a great\nshoe I just think for me there's a\ncouple things I'd tweak to make it a\nperfect raser needs to drop a little bit\nof weight and I would have liked a\nlittle more aggressive toes spring\nthat's fair that's fair but the reason\nit was such a surprise for me is when\nthe fit was really dialed in the style\nis beautiful which I expect from deodor\nso that wasn't a surprise but the phones\nand diodore are kind of like they're\nstill playing with them and tweaking\nthem and they're getting better and\nbetter but there isn't anything that I\nfelt like was like banging and this one\nthey really nailed it this pea midsole\nreally feels bouncy and energetic\nunderfoot and it it just it it's right\nin there with all the other Super Shoes\nif they could drop a ounce to a half\nounce off of this then you're really\ngetting into the rocket science yeah but\npretty pretty great\noverall sometimes you know we're not\nrunning all the time you would be\nsurprised you know well I also think\nwe're kind of a professionals here yeah\nwe are actually I would say if you check\nour stravis you'll find out don't check\nmy stra you can check\nmine anyway a lot of times when you're\nbuying a running shoe it's not all about\nrunning you want something that can\ntransition into just a lifestyle shoe\nyou want something that you could run in\nand maybe wear with your casual clothes\nand so the line is getting a little\nhazier in some of these shoes on what\nyou can do with them and our first\nrunner up in this category for lifestyle\nshoes shoes that we'd say okay this is a\ncool shoe to run in maybe not do you\nknow your 20 mile ear but maybe do you\nknow if you're going to do 20 miles a\nweek or five mile runs or you go to the\ngym and you want to do a run or even a\ntravel shoe that you want to get three\nmiles in while you're while you're you\nknow having a run through the city or\nwhatever uh the first up for me runner\nup was the VHA Condor 3 VHA makes some\nreally great uh I would say they're the\nonly company that's actually making\nsustainable shoes from top to bottom\nlike it's you got to kind of I know we\nalways try to explain it but it's\ndifferent because it's not like hey our\nmaterials are recycled or this and that\nand yeah they Source all their materials\nfrom the same country that they're made\nin I think it's in Brazil they pay their\nworkers a fair wage even have housing\nand transportation everything else it's\npretty pretty great company overall and\nthe Condor 3 which the first two\nversions were honestly horrible really\nrebounded a nice ride it's not the best\nride of any running shoe it's not the\nlightest it's not the best bounce in the\nfoam but it is i' would say good enough\nyeah and I as a lifestyle shoe I wore\nthat shoe probably more than any other\nshoe this year just destroyed the white\nversion of it but I think it's a great\nshoe they're coming out with a new\nversion in 2025 so should be even better\nokay now the winner yeah is one that I\nactually feel like you can do a lot of\nrunning in and looks great this could\nalmost be the most surprising shoe of\n2025 as well it could so this is the\nAdidas Ultra boost 5x not the five which\nhas the cage on it uh man the ultra\nboost maybe thought it was dead in the\nwater kind of uh or Dua Dead on arrival\nthis is a real running shoe like a legit\nrunning shoe it's a real running shoe\nand I got to test even the next version\nof it which even better okay and what I\nlove about this shoe is the foam got a\nlittle bit lighter so it's still not the\nlightest shoe but it is it's actually\nlighter than the Joe Nimbus which is a\npretty standard Dilly trainer so it is\ncrazy and the upper I do like their knit\nuppers again we talked about whether or\nnot knit uppers work this one works for\nme yeah I look not maybe not you you\ndon't want to wear it on a 95 degree day\nin Florida but especially for this time\nof year when we're recording this in\nDecember really nice shoe like you said\nthe upper fit's great solid ride kind of\nfor any distance um Al together great\nshoe yeah the only thing I kind of wish\nthat this had was a little bit of more\nflexibility in the midsole like a little\ndecoupling a little bit because it can\nfeel a little blocky Under Foot true but\noverall for a shoe that looks good is\neasy to run in I would definitely like\nif I was only concerned with like going\nto the gym and putting a couple miles on\nthe treadmill or doing that this year\nwould be more than enough for\nyou all right Robbie we have some\nfriends that have brick-like feet yeah\nyou might know of them Jarrett the wide\nfoot the wide foot guy yeah I was it's\nthe nicest way I can put it um no great\nfriend great our best friend Jared and\nhe has his best wi foot running shoes\nposted on the website there's even some\nvideos on our YouTube but since he can't\nbe here today we're going to stand in\nfor him as best as we can hopefully my\nfeet take up we'll have to put both our\nfeet together to be equal to his foot\nbut we're here and the honorable mention\nfor his best wife a shoe of the Year\nsurprisingly the on cloud Runner 2 and\nyou know what we actually ran in this\nshoe too and I thought it was probably\none of the best on trainers right now\nit's a really simple daily trainer and I\nthink it it did do its job as far as fit\nfeel it's a nice shoe yeah personally I\nthought there's is a little bit of room\nin the shoe of course that's going to do\nwell for the wide foot Runners and so he\nreally liked that uh it's a really nice\nluxurious kind of feeling upper the you\ncan the cloudtech in the midsole has\nsort of seen a little less cloudy as\ntime goes on but overall pretty nice\nride and fit overall so Megan's kind of\nin between wide foot and regular foot\nand this was also a shoe that she used a\nlot and it kind of went into our last\ncategory that lifestyle crossover shoe\nyeah she I see her wearing this all the\ntime and the winner for best wide foot\nrunning shoe 2024 is the New Balance SC\nElite V4 this is New Balance has kind of\nbeen known to cater to wide foot Runners\nbut you can see like look at the lacing\nhere this is my pair yeah and you can\nsee that I've laced it up pretty tight\nthere so there's a lot of room to like\nopen up that throat and I guess enough\nfor for Jarrett but one of the areas\nthat he has a lot of difficulty is in\nthat part of the foot right here where\nit comes in so a lot of shoes will have\na toes shaped or open wide box for the\ntoes but then come back in narrow and it\npinches his foot so I think one of the\nthings that he liked about this shoe is\nit while it had enough room for his\nforef foot it also didn't like cut into\nhis midfoot yeah and this is also one of\nthe shoes that is kind of good for\nobviously the marathon or just even a\ntraining like a faster training run so\nyeah all right this for you\nwifey all right Thomas so we're going to\ncover also our favorite shoes from our\nbig guy reviewers here at believe in the\nrun so funny that we're doing the big\nguys but we got the little shoes yeah\nright we got the the smallest versions\nof the big guy shoes but this is for\nrunners who obviously are a lot heavier\nthan us so it's there's a big difference\nbetween somebody who's me 5' 6 140 lb\nand then someone who's taller and\nheavier he's over 6 feet he's over 200\nsomething pounds yeah so he's putting a\nlot of work on the cushioning yeah so\nhis two favorite shoes for the for 2025\nRunner they're basically tied so we'll\njust put them as both in the same bucket\nis the let's go for S endorphin speed 4\nuh I mean the S endorphin speed always a\ngreat shoe I feel he feels like we feel\nlike as you'll see further in this video\nthat the four is kind of a combination\nof the three and the two gives you that\nnice balce A little bit of\naggressiveness but also just works great\nas a daily trainer um the power on PB\nfoam mix with the uh nylon plate in the\nmiddle is just a really nice combination\nthat I it's just gives you comfort but\nperform performance in the same bucket\ngot a quick question PR we were just at\nthe running event we saw that they're\ngoing back to the mutant colorway for\nthe fifth year anniversary I did what do\nyou think of that uh I mean I feel it's\na little too early to go to go Heritage\nfive years five years is not a long time\nI know that's a fan favorite colorway\nbut do you like it I'm not I'm not even\nsure I liked it I do I love that I did\nlove that color way I was a sucker for\nit I think we still have all I I know\nback at the house I have all three of\nThe\nOriginals yeah there you go there's\nthat's the Endorphin speed speed speed W\nOG beautiful shoe one of the really one\nof the best shoes in the last I don't\nknow 5 10 years but the uh the four is\nkind of a combination of all those and\nit's a great shoe all right what I don't\neven need to introduce you to this if\nyou watch this Channel or if you're\nlooking at shoes at all super Blast 2 is\nalmost big big guy everybody everybody\nright so it's a flight fil turbo plus\nmidsole just gives it that super bouncy\nride uh but just just I don't know it's\nhard to explain everything in this shoe\nworks together the upper the midsole\nit's this works it's as good as the\nfirst version of the shoe um and it's\nversatile for pretty much any distance\nany Pace I this this is my Island shoe\nif I could take one shoe and it was only\ngoing to have one shoe there this is\nprobably the shoe I'd take yeah and for\nbig guy Runners like you said offers\nthat nice better of cushion really\ncomfortable but even if you're smashing\nit down you know responds well bounces\nback to life smashing it\ndown we're going into another category\nthis time we've been giving you two a\nrunner up and a top pick why are we\ndoing three in this one I mean it's so\nhard to I don't know pick your favorit\nin this category this is the best Do-it\nall shoe which honestly is almost the\nbest overall shoe as far as like just\nour favorite shoe yep cuz we have still\nin the video coming out our best overall\nshoe which is almost like best value\nshoe it get the lines get blurred yeah\nwe'll explain that when we get there but\nthis is doit all so you can use it for\nsome people call it does it all does it\nall yeah that's the thing so you could\nuse this for fast days for Recovery days\nfor long runs for everyday daily\ntraining all your running needs all of\nthem are there let's start off with the\nshould we just covered with the big eye\nRunners the soc endorphin speed 4 we\nalready just C we already just talked\nabout this shoe it's a great shoe it's\ncombination of the three and the two and\nyou're going to love it all right next\nup is the Hoka MOX 6 so this is the Hoka\nthe mack has always been a lightweight\ndaily\ntrainer really I mean really lightweight\nhonestly I've always loved it I thought\nit was that combination of kind of like\nthe perfect amount of cushioning\nlightweight package the upper always\nfits well it's just one of those shoes\nthat I feel like you can do at all yeah\nand it's a relatively nice price point\nand pretty simple shoe overall but\nthat's sometimes all you want is\nSimplicity yeah it seems like it's\nsometimes hard to make a simple shoe\nyeah right as shocking as that sounds\nyou would think it would be a lot easier\nfor some reason we know some brands that\ncan most brands just cannot do it uh but\nthis is that one of those shoes so again\nmock great shoe great pick let's move on\nyeah all right top do it all of 2024\nthis should be no surprise to Anyone who\nreads our reviews or has run in it yeah\nit's just such a banger it's the it's a\ngreat shoe and what shoe is this I\nforget I think it's the A6 super blast\nyeah the A6 super Blast 2 uh Paris\ncolorway the they've come out with a few\ncolorways since then there's a black on\nblack they always seem to be in very\ndifficult their the inventory for some\nreason seems to be non-existent most of\nthe time you know I've talked to as and\nthey get all these complaints and people\nthink they're doing it on purpose to\ndrive demand believe me they're not\ndoing it on purpose they would love to\nsell you as many pairs of these shoes as\nthey possibly can their financial\nbackers and investors would also like\nthem to sell as many of these shoes as\nthey possibly can so they are not\nholding back inventory they're trying to\nget them out to you uh they ordered I\nwas talking to them they ordered so many\nmore pairs of these in the first version\nknowing that people like the first\nversion\nstill the demand was crazy yeah and I\nthink there's more drops coming in\nDecember so keep an eye out for that uh\nbut again this is just a great shoe\nfront to back top to bottom you can\nreally use it for anything didn't win\nthe shoe of the Year this year cuz that\nwould have been kind of boring I mean\nwe've been talking about super blast for\nyears now yeah two years ago won their\nshoe of the Year award last year we\nweren't didn't do a best overall but\nanyways so it's a great shoe that's all\nto say you should buy it it's 200 bucks\nit's worth every mile you'll get out of\nit it is cuz it lasts a long time and\nlike we said it can do it all\nyeah sometimes everything isn't perfect\nbut it's really close yeah and this is\nour almost best shoe of the year it's a\nreal award category trust me yeah the\nHoka Mach X2 this was one of my favorite\nshoes to run in it worked for me it hurt\na lot of other people yeah so I actually\ndid not run in this shoe but every one\nof our reviewers absolutely love this\nshoe to death except for one thing and\nthat's the heel collar yeah I don't see\nany blood on this one but other shoes\ndid have the blood yeah we did see a lot\nof photos of it the upper is actually\nreally nice it's like a race style upper\nso they tried to keep it minimal and\nthey may have gone too minimal on the\nheel counter it kind of has a little bit\nof a rough Edge there you can feel it\nRobbie if you just push down on it oh\nyeah it's a little scary razor raon\nRazor's Edge right there but man you had\nthis really great foam really soft foam\non right underneath your foot that had a\nlot of Bounce and rebound you had a\nnylon plate underneath of it and then\nsome of their standard phone that gave\nthe shoe stability it's light it felt\nfast it bounced like this could almost\nbe a raoe it was really a phenomenal fun\nshoe to run in again it hurt people but\nit fixed it for 2025 and kept everything\nelse the same so hopefully maybe this\nwill be at the top of the list next year\nI'm hoping it will be the upper looks\nmore like a daily trainer it's probably\ngoing to add some weight to it but Man\nthe ride of the shoe it might be worth a\nlittle extra weight to fix this for\npeople I love this shoe it could have\nbeen my top shoe of the\nyear we had a discussion we said we\ncan't hurt people so hurt people hurt\npeople man\nyeah all right Robbie ain't nothing to\nit but to do it y who got our top pick\nthis year all right so this is the this\nthis is controversial pick within the\noffice mainly because me hasn't run the\nshoe uh but which is fair I use the\nheavy-handed uh weight of my influence\nto to convince you guys no but you you\nlove this shoe too I do love this shoe\nmy problem with this shoe being pick\nnumber one is there's another Adidas\nshoe that I like even better than this\nthat I would pick over this but we were\ndetermining whether it got released this\nyear or it's getting released next year\nit's having trickle out this year I'm\ngoing to have to put like a big stamp to\nremember it next year CU it's really\nhard when a shoe comes out like we've\nbeen running in it since November and\nthe general public hasn't been able to\nget a hold of it I'm talking about the\nevos which would be my favorite shoe of\nthe year but for this shoe we're talking\nabout the Adidas AI zero\nSL2 and we both love this shoe we got it\nthere's a couple reasons why we really\nlike this shoe yeah I mean this for one\nthing it's\n$130 you I promise you you won't find a\nbetter value at that price point than\nthis shoe and actually at a lot of\nhigher price points but this shoe kind\nof harnesses like the SL in the past was\nokay but they really knocked out of the\npark with this I mean you have a full\nbed of Light Strike Pro full length kind\nof wrapped in this Light Strike 2.0\nmidsole which is much improved over what\nwhatever they were doing Light Strike\nsince its beginning it's one of those\nlike I said it's a simple shoe in some\nways it's great and others like the\nLight Strike Pro that's what's used in\nthe racay shoes and you have a pretty\ngood piece before it used to just be a\npuck in the for fooot remember and I\nlike the previous version but I I think\nwhat you're getting at is the ride feels\na lot more premium with that full bed of\nit and you really get that nice rebound\nfeel for a shoe that I wasn't expecting\nit from like you're not looking at a ton\nof Stack here yeah and you get the the\nupper fits really nice one of the things\nwe talked about was when you look at\nthis shoe you look down when you're\nwearing it it looks like a fun shoe a\nfast shoe it looks like something you\nfeel proud wearing I know that sounds\nweird but I feel like that's that\nmatters when I'm wearing a running shoe\nso for me it's the shape of the shoe I\nlike something that looks fast and this\ndefinitely has that fast look it is\nsometimes the reason I get you know a\nlittle bit hung up on foot-shaped shoes\ncuz I'm like it just doesn't look like\nfast and energetic to me where these\nAdidas addz shoes always look like\nthey're ready to go fast yeah and it and\nthat's the thing you can pick it up in\nthis shoe it's light enough that you can\npretty much do again mostly everything\nin this shoe and I think what I loved so\nmuch about this is that it feels just\nlike a running shoe like sometimes I\nfeel like yeah it's cool all these super\ntrainers everything else but it gets\njust a little bit too compli licated\nsometimes and this feels like a pure\nrunning shoe but in 2024 terms yeah the\nonly area where I felt like they had to\nbring it down to that 130 price point\nand where you might skimp on that a\nlittle bit was the outsole it's not the\nkti outsole the Continental Rubber\noutsole and you can tell the difference\nyeah there's a little bit of a\ndifference there I think you'll get more\ndurability out of this maybe not as good\nof grip though and then the upper it's\ncan if you don't not a hugee fan of\nnarrow toe boxes it might be a little\nbit constrictive I didn't particularly\nhave a problem with it but it's a low\nvolume toe box it's going to be a little\nbit shallow over the toes and it does\ncome in on the sides so if you do have a\nwide foot or something like that you're\nprobably not going to enjoy the way that\nthis shoe Cuts in but if you like what\nRobbie was talking about that\ntraditional racing running feel yeah\nthis shoe has it so there it is I feel\nlike if you also light it is light so I\nfeel like you you're looking for that\nvalue where you know maybe you don't\nwant to spend the $200 on the Superglass\n2 which we would probably pick over any\nother shoe in this entire list to wear\nor buy maybe you just want to spend 130\nbucks on a shoe that's in your budget I\nfeel like you really can't go wrong with\nthis you can honestly only go right yeah\nI would even recommend this to like your\nhigh school Runner your college Runner\nsomeone who's on a budget or you know\nisn't sure about how committed they are\nto running this shoe will get get them\nexcited about it yeah all right Thomas\nso I think that's our list hopefully we\ndidn't miss anything if you want to read\nall the full details and hopefully we\ndidn't mess anything up if we did most\nof the corrections are on the website we\nhave the full list of all our best road\nrunning shoes for 2024 we also have our\nbest trail running shoes for 2024 from\nour lead Trail reviewer Taylor and the\nentire Trail team that's all on the\nwebsite I don't know if we'll get the\nvideo out for the trail shoes this year\nand I'm sure we have plenty more good\nstuff coming for 2025 we're going to do\na Roundup on the website again and\nactually we'll do a video a YouTube\nvideo of what we find exciting coming in\n2025 so stay tuned

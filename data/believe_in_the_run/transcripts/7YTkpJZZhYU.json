  "text": "what's going on everyone this is Chad\nwith believe in the run the end of the\nyear is upon us so that being said I am\nhere in Baltimore at the newly renovated\nheadquarters to bring you what I believe\nare the best shoes for bigger runners in\n[Music]\n2024 now my assignment was to come up\nwith the top five list of the shoes that\nI ran in in 2024 when I started to\nwhittle down down uh the shoes that I\nhad tested for believe in the run and\nshoes that I had actually acquired on my\nown I got to a certain point where I was\ncoming up with my list and and the first\nfew were fairly easy but then I got to\nthe back end of my list and I had two\nshoes that I just could not decide\nbetween so I actually have the top six\nshoes with a tie for fifth cuz it's my\nlist and I get to make the\nrules let's get into the list number\nfive in a tie is the Hoka Skyward X and\nthe Brooks Glycerin Max now one of the\nreasons I had such a hard time deciding\nbetween these two shoes is they are very\nvery similar they both have that super\nhigh stack a very high quality premium\nfoam and they both have a very similar\nride to me both in terms of geometry um\nas you can see they both have pretty\nsignificant tow Springs and at the same\ntime I mean overall I feel like they had\nthe same use case that long run Cruiser\nthat's going to be able to take you long\ndistances I tended to lean a little bit\nmore towards the glycerin Max simply\nbecause it was such a great surprise\ncoming out of the Brooks company that\nwe've kind of knocked them on Innovation\nfor a long time this DNA tuned foam that\nhas different densities in the same\nblock uh of foam from the heel to the\nforefoot something that I can actually\nfeel the softer heel and the slightly\nfirmer more resilient and responsive\nforefoot Hoka has uh the plate in it so\nit provides a little bit more uh\nrigidity but at the same time provides a\nnice comfortable ride I mean if you're\nsomeone who likes ground field don't\neven bother trying these shoes on cuz\nthey're not going to be for you that\nsaid I could not decide between these\ntwo shoes for my number five so they are\ntied number five best shoe of 2024 hokus\nSkyward X and Brooks Glycerin\nMax now moving on to number four number\nfour actually uh is a daily trainer for\nme uh the number four is the New Balance\n1080\nv14 um if you follow me if you followed\nmy reviews for the past few years you\nknow I actually was able to test the\n1080 v13 as well and it was one of the\nfew shoes that I've run in that really\njust didn't work for me I overall liked\nthe feel of the shoe but the fresh Fox\nwas just a little too soft a little too\nsquishy um when I ran I got a lot of\nroll into my medial side um of my right\nfoot it really kind of had my post TI\ntendon acting up the 1080 v14 changed\nthe game for me when it comes to New\nBalance and uh their daily trainers this\nis a real premium daily trainer they\nfirmed up the Fresh Foam x a little bit\nit still has great pop to it it is a\nlittle firmer\nthey also change the geometry of the\nshoe um widening the base a little bit\num and and the heel it is a far more\nstable shoe it has great outsole\ncoverage rubber you're going to be able\nto get a lot of miles in these it's just\na real premium daily trainer one of my\nfavorite daily trainers I think for all\nof\n2024 um and overall I think it's just a\ngreat shoe I think they really improved\nfrom the v13 and I think it's uh one\nthat's going to be a great uh part of my\nrotation moving on to my third shoe I\nreally don't know what category to put\nthis shoe in uh and that is the Puma\ndeviate Nitro 3 if you read my dedicated\ncolumn on the website you would see that\nthe two was one of my favorite Tempo in\nspeedwork shoes um I feel like the Nitro\n3 takes a little bit of a step back in\nterms of the tempo and speedwork you\ncould absolutely use it for that it is\nlight it does have some of their more\nElite great foam uh and it also does\nhave their power plate but to me it just\nhas more of a feel of a real premium\ndaily trainer something that you could\ndo for a lot of different um types of\nruns you could take it out on a on a\ndaily run where you're going to maybe do\nsome strides you're going to have some\nfarli or other workout uh aspects in\nyour run um overall uh this shoe is\ngreat Puma grip cannot be beat um the\noutso traction on this is phenomenal um\noverall I feel like the DV8 Nitro 3 is\njust a great allaround shoe um it's\nreally going to handle anything you can\nkind of throw at it um if you're looking\nfor something that you can maybe even\nuse as a budget racer with the fact that\nit comes in around $160 you really can't\nbeat that\n[Music]\nvalue now my second shoe shouldn't be\nmuch of a surprise cuz I did highlight\nthis earlier in my video before where I\ntalked about the best shoes of 2020 4\nthus far and I have not been shy in\nsinging the Praises of the sakon\nEndorphin speed 4 this shoe to me\nepitomizes what it means to be of a doit\nall shoe it is light it is Snappy the\nfoam is very very responsive the power\nrun PB is slightly firmer than what\nwe've seen in Prior models like the\nversion 2 um but it has more stability\nwhich is what we saw in version three\nversion 4 is really the perfect marriage\nbetween the the speed two and the speed\nthree um overall this shoe can do\neverything you can take it out for daily\nmiles you can take it out on your Tempo\nspeedworks you could race in the shoe um\nI think to be honest this would be a\nreally great shoe to race um reasonable\ndistances I do really think this could\num be a great once again budget racing\nshoe I'm going to put that in quotes cuz\nit comes in at the I believe 170 Mark at\nat the end of the day this shoe is great\nI do think saky also improved the\ncompound that they use for the rubber\noutso in the shoe one of the big things\nabout the prior models is they didn't\nnecessarily have the greatest traction I\nthink that was improved in the V4 this\nshoe not only looks good runs good and\nuh you can't beat\nthat now we have come to number one on\nmy list and once again for people who\nfollow me follow all my content uh this\nshould not be a surprise and that is the\nas6 super Blast\n2 if it ain't broke don't fix it and\nthat is a motto that as6 stood by when\ncreating the uh super Blast 2 the super\nblast one was my favorite shoe of all\ntime but that was until I was able to\nlace up the super Blast 2 which has now\ntaken its place I ran my Marathon\nearlier this year in the version one and\nhad a great time my legs felt great\nafterwards I've put a good chunk of\nmiles in the V2 um as I've been training\nsince I got it I actually think they\nimproved the upper it feels just a\nlittle bit more put together and a\nlittle bit more um cohesive with the\noverall shoe it does run a little bit\nshorter everyone always said the super\nblast V1 ran a little long I wore an 11\nand A2 in the super blast one I normally\nwear um 12 in uh as6 um I got this in 11\nand a half and my toes are a little bit\ncrammed in here uh on the run so a 12\nprobably would have been fine they did\nkind of shrink it back down but overall\nthis shoe just is everything I would\nwant in a shoe it is lightweight it is\nsturdy it is stable ground feel on it\nyou can't really feel the ground but it\ndoesn't feel mushy or or to the point\nwhere you feel like you have to work\nextra the shoe gives you back everything\nyou need yes it's $200 but it's a shoe\nthat you could basically buy this pair\nand run all your miles in it you could\nrace in it which I actually probably\nwill do uh next year when I run the\nChicago marathon um I'll probably run in\nthis or potentially a newer pair cuz I\nmight run through this one by then that\nsaid this shoe is great this shoe can do\nanything you need and more and so that's\nwhy the super Blast 2 is my number\nnumber one shoe for bigger runners in\n2024 what's coming up in 2025 the crew\nwent out to tr and shot tons and tons of\ncontent on shoes that are going to be\ncoming out in 2025 now I've watched a\nlot of that coverage it's all great you\nshould watch it too um but I'm going to\ngive you highlights of a couple things\nthat I'm looking forward to most in 2025\nnumber one um surprisingly\nSketchers the sketch lineup I think they\ncall it their Arrow lineup um a e r o um\nthere's three shoes in that line that\nall looked like they're going to be\nactually really good training and\npotentially race day shoes for Sketchers\num I was able to run recently in the gun\nRazer 5 and I was a real big fan of that\nit reminded me of the Hoka MOX 6 overall\nI think Sketchers is really turning a\ncorner um I know Robbie uh would\ndisagree about the turning a corner\nbecause I know Max road is one of his\nfavorites uh ever um but overall I think\nSketchers is really starting to put\ntogether some real quality shoes uh and\nI'm excited to see potentially what\nthose are like obviously considering I\njust raved about the sock in the\nEndorphin speed 4 um I'm somewhat\nexcited to see about what they do uh\nwith the V5 can they build on the\nsuccess of the V4 continue it along in\nthat path of being somewhat of a great\ndoit all shoe whether it be for Tempo\nracing or or even daily miles I think\nthe thing I am excited about most HST\nwas the on cloud boom Max which on is\ntouting as a marathon racer designed\nwith the uh runner who's going to spend\nfour plus hours on the road out there um\nit's designed with us in mind um I'm\nreally excited to give that a try um if\nI do um it just looks like something\nthat's really going to be accommodating\nit's going to take into account the\nextra time that we're going to spend on\nour feet uh and everything about about\nhow we run um and overall I think um\nit's just going to be very interesting\nto see what that's like if you like this\nvideo I would ask you to hit the\nSubscribe button hit the like button on\nthis video uh follow believe in the run\non all the socials Instagram Tik Tok\nFacebook you name it they got it uh\nfollow me on Instagram at the Cale\nRunner you can also find me on threads\num uh and at this point we're done with\n2024 excited to come back in 2025 and\nbring you more bigger Runner content uh\nit's December now January's coming up I\nhope you all get out uh get registered\nfor grit and uh can log some great grit\nmiles hopefully in some of these shoes\nthat I've highlighted is the best ones\nfor 2024\n[Music]",

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and I'm here with Connor with normal\nand he's going to walk us through\nnormal's updates we don't see updates a\nwhole lot in terms of every season or\nanything from normal so this is really\nexciting uh updating some of the the\nHeritage stuff the stuff you guys\nstarted out with um what kind of updates\ncan we expect in this next year\nabsolutely yeah so a couple of big\nupdates in Fall 25 I think you know the\nBrand's mission is to make super\nsustainable product so that's why we're\nnot necessarily updating every year for\nthe sake of adding a new number to the\nshoe right but we had you know some some\npretty critical uh feedback across the\nlifespan of these shoes and we're ready\nto to get some updates in the mix uh to\nmake the product better functionally\nright so we have the two shoe franchises\nthe jarag and the toir um and they both\nsee uh updates of some kind for a fall\nwin 25 yeah yeah and I I mean in our\nexperience in the shoe it's just one of\nthose kind of you built it to be\ntimeless and it kind of feels that way\nwhen as Trail Runners we for the most\npart we want to be really connected to\nthe trail and that's what the shck has\nbeen based off of and so what kind of\nupdate can we expect from that yeah so\nyeah we've got the jarro one here this\nis uh live through spring 25 and then\nthe update is my jarag 2 right so that\nwill be uh July 15th launch so certainly\na lot of kind of similar design cues\nright you're not looking at it and\nwondering if they're related or not um\num but we made yeah some some subtle\nupdates it's a lot of under the hood\nupdates I would say so from the bottom\nup vbr light base Mega grip this is the\nexact same outsole material pattern it's\ncrazy light very sticky and uh longl\nlasting tried and true perfect uh the\nfoam is actually all new so though it\nlooks similar this is an updated foam\nwe're calling it uh xure plus it's a new\ncompound we found that it was lighter it\nhad better bounce and it was more\ndurable durability is a big deal for us\nso easy upgrade there um being and how\ndoes xper plus compared to like xper\nthat was in the toir right and as well\nas in theer yes um yeah so uh better\ndurability testing and kind of a more\nresponsive foot feel uh at a lighter\nweight it it feels mod better yeah kind\nof better in all ways right um so really\nhappy to have that what you'll see you\ncan probably notice if you look at the\ntwo shoes um we added 22 Mill M of Stack\nright so here we're at a 2620 stack\nheight uh with that new foam so there's\na little bit more material and keeping\nthe shoe with the overall same we again\nbecause it is a lighter product we also\nadded a bit more rocker to the shoe as\nwe added some stack we wanted it to\ncontinue to have that you know really\nquick Toof kind of launch ability it is\nyou know a light and fast troll racer\nfor sure yeah totally and so it's I\nwouldn't say it's moderating the\nperformance at all but it's expanding\nexactly that the idea is that we're\ngoing to\nyou know we're going to accommodate more\nfoot types and more Runners with the\nupdate to the jar too we feel really\ngood about what's the upper material\nsame upper material yeah so we're\nworking with Matrix as before however we\nuh we've got a single layer uh jard knit\nMatrix which is a less material overall\nMatrix of course being so durable so\ngreat at foothold we were able to\nessentially minimize material there and\nget the same performance we're really\nhappy with that uh for again\naccommodating movement and Dynam\ndynamism in the foot um and then the\ntongue uh is probably the most visible\ndifference right we're going to a knit\nstretch 3D tongue fully gusseted fully\ngusseted yeah for a little bit more\nComfort um in the shield that is awesome\nyeah yeah couple nice updates stays at\n195 retail so okay and when will we be\nable to get this again July 15th 2025\nokay hopefully earlier that's a lot of\nSummer I want summer in this Sho that's\nright right okay what else do we got\nwhat else we got so here we've got the\njar brute so this is a uh spring 25\nlaunch um Q2 uh forgive me the exact\ndate probably sometime there in April\nthere but this shares a lot of traits\nwith the jarag one being that 6 mm drop\num the primary difference of course is\nthat traction story it's a very\naggressive um 6 mm lug deep lugs widely\nspaced so you're getting grip where\notherwise you know you'd be slipping\naround um you know best inclass grip in\nworst possible condition conditions with\nthe\njute uh and then on the upper we're\nagain we're using Matrix we love the\ndurability and the fo hold provided by\nmatrix but it's a different material and\nnotably there's much less like foam and\npadding on the upper this is meant to be\na hydrophobic upper on the shoe so we're\nnot adding water weight when we're in\nthose sloppy conditions that necessitate\nthis level of grip yeah that's awesome\nso this is like this is everyday this is\nBig Adventures maybe more um yeah above\ntree line loose footing whether that's\nmud scree snow you know places where you\nneed that extra bite that's where the\njar Brew comes in that's awesome that's\nawesome okay and and what else I know we\nhave one more shoe right yeah we've got\none more shoe so here is the to toir 2\nand gortex so the toir updated to the\nsecond version in Spring 24 y um and\nthat's been cruising along we love great\nupdate I love it too I'm wearing it now\nit's uh I just keep putting miles on it\nwaiting for it to break down haven't got\nthere yet yeah exactly um yeah super\nsoaked about the toare 2 adding a gortex\nmodel uh really critical you know in\ncertain regions of the country going\ninto the fall winter season in the\nOutdoor Channel we know outdoor you know\nthey sell a lot of trail shoes to Trail\nRunners and other outdoor sports right\nyeah so the gortex is super valuable in\nthat context um but it's the same\ntooling as far as outsole midsole go the\nupper is an invisible fit gortex\nmembrane which we like invisible fit\nbecause it takes up less space there's\nless taping so it breathes better um and\nit kind of moves better than maybe your\ntypical booty construction does in that\nin that case uh to go with it you'll see\nkind of renewed refreshed branding and\nwe went from a curved tongue and eyes\ndays to a straightened out which we\nfound is a better uses the width of the\nmaterial in the last to kind of fit\nbetter around the for foot of the shoe\nand accommodate wider feet better\nawesome yeah so like a little kind of a\nlittle tweak Midstream um by adding the\ngortex to the to 2 thing that Runners\ndeal with is like if I am going to go\ngortex typically it's heavier but how\nwhat this doesn't seem to be much of a\nweight difference yeah so you you are\nadding material right you don't get to\nswap the gortex in for something else so\nat what um you know was about an 8 and\n1/2 o shoe we're just under 9 o um so\nyeah minimal amount is this one Gator\ncompatible yeah yeah for sure Gator\ncompatible all the way\num definitely yeah maximum izing kind of\nyour gortex by adding a g what was the\nprice on this one again 205 no 200\nforgive me 200 200 for kind of typical\nwhat you see in most you know gortex\nbreathable models plus 20 to get that\ngortex yeah exactly cuz cuz what is the\nnormal or the to 2 is 180 okay awesome\nawesome and I don't think we got uh\nthat's the one that's 205 that's one yep\nokay awesome thank you for the rundown\nof course thank you guys mean it's\nexciting from a it is it is it's like a\ntight line but really good a lot a lot\nof uh kind of runners needs covered so\nabsolutely happy to happy to serve thank\nyou Conor of course thank you guys",

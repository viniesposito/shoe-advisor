  "text": "hi this Thomas with believe in the run\nthis is Robbie with believe in the r\nRobbie you having an incred day\nincred\nincred you'll see why this is confusing\nin a\n[Music]\nsecond so we're taking a look here at\nthe Endorphin trainer which looks a lot\nlike the uh Kara Pro so in fact it's\npretty much the replacement for the\nsakon Kara Pro shoe that came out in\n2023 that\nwas an interesting shoe I didn't like it\nyeah it seemed to fall a little bit flat\nwith us a lot of bit flat it was like\nthis trying to do a bunch of things in a\nshoe that was maybe a super trainer but\nmaybe not it kind of replaces the shift\nright so then there is the Endorphin\nshift no more so that SHO gone this is\nthis one is now here that kind of\ncombines both the cavar pro and endorfin\nshift into this allnew model there's\nkind of a lot to talk about and then and\nyet there isn't in a way let's start\nwhat we normally do let's let's break\ndown the upper right yeah so the upper\non the shoe is an engineered mesh upper\nit's kind of not that I don't know not\nInnova it's an it's an upper yeah yeah\nit's pretty standard is what Robbie's\ntrying to get at there's not a lot of\noverlays the mesh itself is what's going\nto make that structure to this upper you\nget in it has a nice puffy tongue that\nis paded enough but not overly paded\nit's gusseted you've got your basic\nlaces on here Robbie I'm I'm getting\nspoiled with laces though are you I I\nguess so these are these floppy style\nlaces like ribbon laces it's like\nannoying to tie I know it's a petty\nthing to say but I'm just there's\ncertain laces that drive me crazy and I\nfeel like these are one of those yeah\nall right Robbie so the ER for me fits\nfairly nicely true to size size 10 and 1\nhalf no issues with the fit it's not the\nmost exciting the padding in the collar\nworks there's no heel lift but there's\nsomething about it maybe it's cuz it's\nwhite when I tow down look at this kind\nof looks like a nurse shoe yeah I could\nsee that um I mine was I feel like I'm\nalways floating between two different\nsizes these days I felt like there was a\nlittle I mean this is a size I always\nwear in salony I felt like it was a\nlittle roomy for me um did you\nexperience that at all no my felt true\nto size I didn't have any issues with\nthat it reminded me of the Endor fit\nspeed fit so whatever if you have the\nEndor speed if you've experience that\nreminds me very similar to that the\nnewer one anyways um yeah it has that I\nguess that's the PB power on PB midsole\nmaterial that I do like that Sak has\nbeen putting this in as their uh foot\ninsole yeah like you do get some nice\nbounce off of this it does feel good it\nadds a little extra Comfort but the real\nsecret to this thing is is moving down a\nstep yeah so you have the incred Run top\nlayer foam this is an all new foam from\nsakon that uh it's their high\nperformance soft bouncy\nenergetic peba style foam if you will I\nlove it in the elite it feels amazing\nit's bouncy it kind of tunes up as you\npick up the pace it kind of firms it\nchanges characteristics depending on how\nyou're running on it and in this case it\nmight get killed a little bit yeah and\nthis is I don't know if he said the name\nthis is called incred run mhm which is\nuh incredibly maybe the worst foone name\nI've ever heard in my entire existence\nas a shoe riewer I it might be out there\nthere's there's bound to be some worse\nworse ones but it doesn't make sense cuz\nyou would think in credit run maybe that\nrhymes with something or it's a play on\nwords but it's just a combination of two\nwords that don't incredible run doesn't\neven but saying it doesn't go together\nthere's no\nI don't know anyways um it's English\nmajor over here yeah it's just it's\nphonetically farce far vericle vericle\nvericle foam so it is soft though for\nsure it is and it is an improvement over\nthe kimara pro of the last one this\nfeeling does have a nice step bounce to\nit initially and if anything I feel like\nyou're going to find out the plates in\nhere but what really kills the shoe is\nthis power run there is a 3/4 length\ncarbon fiber plate inside the shoe uh it\nutilizes their what they call you got it\nuh speedroll speedroll technology which\nyou know is to make your foot roll\nthrough the stride 8 mm drop uh yeah 42\nmm in the heel 34 in the 4 foot so\npretty pretty high stack shoe so you\nwould think okay High stack shoe it's\ngoing to feel like a maybe Max cushion\nshoe or something like the super blast\nin that vein and then you get down to\nthis bottom layer power on foam which is\nbasically the same thing as the convar\npro in fact this shoe is almost\neverything's almost exactly the same as\nthe canar pro except they swapped out\nthey swapped out the power on PB with a\nlayer of inceton the result is pretty\nmuch the same this is a case where I\nfeel like the juice isn't worth the\nsqueeze you have all these components in\nthere you have this incred Ron foam you\nhave a three4 plate you have this power\nrun underneath of it they're trying to\nmake this a super trainer and what it\nends up feeling like is a basic trainer\nlike I I've been running in the sakon\nride and honestly I think it actually\nhas a better underfoot feel than this\nyear and what's interesting about this\nis that the\nS markets this or places this as an\nuptempo shoe and I don't know where\nthat's coming from at least in the bar\nprod it I think it weigh under 10 oz\nthis one weighs 11 oz for your for size\n10 and 12 which is\npretty 310 gram for those of you on the\nmetric system yeah so that's in a lot of\ndaily even just for a daily trainers on\nthe heav side so I'm not sure where\nthey're getting the uptempo part of this\nbecause the other thing about the power\nrun is it's super dense like you can't\nsqueeze that at all this reminds me like\nwhen I pull up old shoes and I'm like I\ncan't believe we ran in this and then I\nfeel this foam I'm like I can't believe\nthey're still making a foam like this\nright so it's clearly uh different\ndrometer than a lot of the power own\nwe've seen in past shoes like the ride\nor the guide things like that and I will\nsay it does feel on Landing a little bit\nsofter because of the syred run as\nopposed to the power run PB from last\nyear's from the kar Pro but it's not\nenough to mitigate the thick slab of\npower run underneath it just starts to\nfeel kind of clunky Under Foot and any I\nthink when I first started going out the\ndoor you get that incred run feel and\nyou're like okay this could this could\nbe a nice Improvement by mile three or\nfour that's kind of worn off that's\nexactly and then you just feel like\nyou're running in a regular yeah almost\nfirm trainer and this to me if you're\ngoing to be at the price point they're\nat which is what 160 180 180 even higher\nthan I was thinking then you're up\nagainst other super trainers and while\nthis has super trainer features like the\nplate two different Foams the sandwich\nsituation going on down there you're\nlike okay but for 180 mm- they're trying\nto throw in all these ingredients from\ndifferent shoes that they're trying to\nstreamline and it comes together in this\nshoe that has no real purpose like I\nfeel like there's a lot of super\ntrainers that do take the premium top\nlayer of foam and then the more standard\nEva layer and do it right I mean we\ntalked about the Mach X2 the Boston 12\num what was the from aidos verbero just\ndid it yeah you got there's a bunch of\nshoes that combine Foams to give you\nstability underneath a really soft foam\nand light in a lighter package in a\nlighter well not always the vomo is a\nlittle bit heavier but this one it it is\nit's baffling to me because you have in\nthis line the Endorphin speed is what\npeople are using what I think the shoes\nintended to be right so that I don't\nknow how and it's $10 cheaper so I'm not\nsure how you can W it's $10 cheaper than\nthis yeah so I'm not sure how you could\npick this over the speed I know this is\nsupposed to be more uptempo than the\nspeed because the speed kind of over the\nlast couple years has gotten more of\ndaily trainer is but I would take the\nspeed over this for sure any day as6 has\nsomething like the magic speed 4 which\nis a PL it Tempo shoe and it's not the\nbest shoe like the ride is a little bit\nfirm underneath some people love it some\npeople don't I actually kind of liked it\nand that's not the best shoe but it fits\nright where it's supposed to like it\ndoes what it's supposed to do it's a\nbudget like racer and then I don't know\nI just don't even know where to put this\nshoe well it feels like they're trying\nto wedge this in they had the convar\nthey were calling it kvar pro but the\nkar was a low stack fast uptempo shoe\nwhen they made the kar Pro it's like all\nof a sudden it's got this High stack\nit's got a plate in it it's like why is\nthat a Kar I think they were like heard\nthe feedback from reviewers and from\nother people testing it like how is this\neven related to a convar so now they're\nlike okay we'll drop it into the\nEndorphin line which makes sense and\nkeep it going but this shoe could have\nbeen something I think yeah I mean\nthat's what it's hard for me to figure\nout because socony does have all the\ningredients to make a really nice super\ntrainer this power run isn't one of the\ningredients incred run incred run is\ngreat and in the elite it sings Yeah and\nmaybe maybe that's something coming next\nyear I don't know where it's something\nlike this super blast that has a that\npremium foam in it where it's you know\nmaybe it's even plateless but it still\nhas that nice light ride to it I don't\nknow maybe that's coming but I don't\nreally know I just don't know what to do\nwith this what's crazy is that I can't\nbelieve this is being made after the kar\nPro it wasn't like that was a popular\nSho but they probably already had this\nin production when when that guy started\nthere is something about this shoe that\nI feel like you know when there's like a\nyou feel a shoe and you're like I bet I\ncould like this like I bet if I I could\nlike find I like this shoe and there is\nsomething about it where I do I felt\nthat about the kar Pro even but it's not\nenough to get me like past the the down\nthe negatives of it okay I kind of get\nwhat you're saying last year I did the\nkar Pro and then I saw some other\nreviewers review it and they're like oh\nno they liked it and I was like well\nmaybe I you know maybe I just need to\ntry it on this was like months after the\nreview I'll try it on again to see maybe\nif I got it wrong or something yeah and\nI put it on I went for a run I was like\nnah I shouldn't have put I shouldn't\nhave put it back on this shoe just isn't\nworking right now with what they have\ngoing my biggest complaint is going to\nbe this power run foam is just dense\nthere's no life to it it sucks the life\nout of the incred run it's just not a\nfun shoe to really run in it becomes\nwhat I would expect from your 130 120\ndaily trainer feel underfoot and then\neven the out soole it has they added\nsome bits of rubber here uh Max track I\nthink it was Max track to the outsole to\ngive it some a little bit of grip that\nthe last one didn't have but it's still\nmost exposed carbon rubber which I mean\nI don't know it's probably fine but it's\nnot you're not getting a ton of\nrubberized Eva there yeah you're not\ngetting a ton of grip out of it um so\nyeah I guess we can get to the should we\nshall we score oh and by the way this\ncomes out March uh 1st\n2025 shall we get to we've given it a GL\nreview I bet you can't wait to pick it\nup so yeah I guess we can get to our\nscoring of this for form I'm going to\ngive it a two I think the especially for\nthe price for 180 the upper seems kind\nof\npedestrian this power run if you\ncouldn't tell already through the review\njust sucks the life out of the shoe for\nme so I'm going to on that also didn't\nlike the laces um same thing going to\ngive it to too uh let's go to the fit so\nhow the shoe fit overall on the foot\neverything else for me it fits fine true\nto size I didn't have any issues so I'm\ngoing to give it a little step up there\nwith a three yeah I'm going to give it a\ntwo I thought it was a little roomy\ndidn't didn't love the overall fit of it\num it was okay and that's a two so and\nthen we'll go for last one functions so\nthat's the overall ride performance if\nthis was a 120 shoe in the $120 price\nrange shoe I would say oh it's pretty\ndecent for a daily trainer kind of feel\nbut knowing this supposed to go in the\nsuper trainer category up against shoes\nthat we really love up in in those like\nyou're getting close to super blast\nprice you're getting close to a lot of\nthe shoes that have the high-tech that\nthey're using in their race day shoes\nthis one just Falls flat for me on that\nso I'm I'm going to give it a one yeah\nsame thing going to give it a one I just\ndon't think that this shoe needs to\nexist U that's kind of harsh but I don't\nI know I just saw tear roll out of it in\nthe world of the Endorphin speed which\ndoes probably pretty much what this is\nsupposed to do in most scenarios and\nthen you have the ride and I mean I\ndon't know that you really need this\nshoe so I didn't love it thought was\nblocky and bricky so for the score I\nmean Carl Sal with put it up there so\nred mine would be red your yours would\nbe barely yellow so is it even barely\nyellow six six is technically yellow\nstill if you were them and clearly they\nwant three shoes in the Endorphin line\nMH you've got well actually you've got\nfour now because you have the elite you\nhave the pro you have the\nspeed what's your fores shoe what what\nwould you put there I mean I'm\nwondering it's it's interesting that\nthey just did away with the power on PB\naltogether I wonder if you did the power\non PB with that plate to stabilize it a\nlittle bit full length plate maybe and\nthen the incred run on top so you still\nget fully bouncy don't you think that\nwould be the speed though pretty much\nlike you're tuning the speed that's the\npower that's still is the new the new\nspeed's getting all I I think the pro\nand the speed are going to still be on\nthe um Power on PB yeah here's what I'm\nthinking if I had the fores shoe in\nthere let's do one without a plate let's\nput a really nice foam in there maybe it\nis a tuned up sandwich of incred run top\nlayer and like you were going for power\nrun PB underneath of it to kind of give\nit a little more stability and you could\ntune that power run PB to be a little F\nI mean even if you just use a different\ndrometer for the power run because I\nknow the past versions of shoes did not\nhave this dense of power run like the\nride and some some of the other models\nso if you could like I said there are\nother brands who have done the Eva\nbottom layer fine and it actually\ncreates a great ride so I don't think\nyou have to necessarily uh go away from\nthat but in the same way in a year from\nnow you might we might have moved on\nfrom the Eva since hardly anyone's using\nit anyways so yeah check out all the\nrest of our sing videos make sure you\nsubscribe and like this video If you\ndisagree feel free to leave a comment\nand make sure you will you read it yeah\nthat we're going to make Carl read back\nto us yeah and uh check us out on\nInstagram sign up for the weekly email\nanything else I'm forgetting no you\npretty much nailed\nmerry happy holidays yep see\n[Music]\nyou yours will be barely yellow so is it\neven barely yellow six six is\ntechnically yellow still yeah okay well\nI'll take it down it's all\nright anyway found it down yellow",

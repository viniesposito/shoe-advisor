the third time I\nmean we're pavlovian response dogs me\nand Thomas but she I mean it's the third\ntime so she's had practice Yeah it's\ntrue think she knows what's going on\nwe're here with the today's guest Megan\nMurray Megan Murray also married to\nThomas newberger I never actually know\nwhat your last name is it's like my wife\nwhen we got married she like she had two\nmiddle names and she dropped one and I\nnever I I don't even know what her name\nis wait she started out with two middle\nnames yeah oh and then she like dropped\none and picked up I don't know she added\nyour name some I had to ask her every\ntime she hat she's going to hate me\ncheers anyways I I'm making this somehow\nabout myself which I\napologize Megan welcome to the show\nthanks guys thanks for having me I'm\nexcited to hear your life story I feel\nlike I know it's bits and pieces but but\nnot the whole thing so what are we are\nwe starting from the beginning I we\nstarted with the beginning with everyone\nelse I think we have to all right so\nweren't you born in a car uh no wasn't a\nsnowstorm I was born in a snowstorm nice\num which I think my parents love that\nstory for whatever reason I love that\nstory I was the second kid so I feel\nlike the first one they were like you\nknow panicked got to get ready for you\nknow the first one to be born and then I\nkind of was they were like ah she'll be\nborn when she's born and then middle of\na snowstorm I decided it was time why\ndid I have the thought that your dad\ndelivered you in the back seat of that\ncar during the snowstorm well so because\nthere was a snowstorm they couldn't get\nthe doctors to the hospital is my\nunderstanding so I don't think like the\nproper people were in the hospital nice\nso but did your dad I was not born in a\ncar I was born in a hospital but did\nyour dad deliver you or something uh\nmaybe he had something to do with it\nyeah oh okay so the way here's the how I\npictur it the comic book version the car\nis on the side of the road the hazards\nare blinking in the snowstorm here Dad\nhas got the back door open he's you know\nover Robin with her screaming through uh\nyou know know pain and Megan is born I\ndo know it was so sudden that um they\ndidn't have time to give my mom any\ndrugs so I was born like like a little\nhouse in the prairie style yeah so I\nthink it's probably pretty memorable so\nbasically the security guard at the\nhospital and your dad were just\ndelivering you that's amazing yeah yeah\nso that was the\nstart um where were you born what\nAnnapolis oh really yeah see that never\nknew that so I was born in Annapolis and\nwe we had a home there and I lived there\nI want to say until I was like three or\nfour I don't have many memories of the\nanisis is in Maryland for those of you\nwho don't know yes capital capital\ncapital\ncity um so I lived there when I was very\nyoung and then we moved to Phoenix\nMaryland which is 45 minutes north of\nBaltimore city where we all are now\nthat's kind of in the middle of nowhere\nright it is but I lived in a\nneighborhood where I didn't feel like\nlike some of my friends lived like what\nI called like cowland like where their\nhome would be on like 15 acres and they\nwould probably call Horseland up there\nbut yeah yeah Horseland cowland whatever\nyou want to call it it beautiful but\nwhere I lived I felt like we were\nslightly closer to civilization okay\nlike I could walk to the Blockbuster on\na Friday night oh really do you know\nwhere the Four Corners is I I actually\ndon't think I do okay so if you go up to\nthe county it's it's she's basically on\nthe edge of Oblivion so it's like you go\nup there there's this place called for\nCorners it's like\nJacksonville uh what I like how they\njust name their cities after not all all\nother Jacksonville Phoenix yeah um so\nit's like San Francisco's up there so\nlike if you need to go to the grocery\nstore and stuff yeah I could walk right\nokay but after that you're like in like\nrural so all the rural people come to\nfor Corners to do the shopping and okay\nso I feel like I had the best of both\nworlds cuz it was like we were kind of\nout and had some little land like our\nhouse was on an acre I think and then\nbut I could walk to all the cool places\nthat I wanted to I mean walking to a\nblockbuster that's almost a that's a\nprivilege that most people would never\nget to that was experience like Pinnacle\nFriday night order Domino's Pizza walk\nto Blockbuster go get the new release\nmovie if it wasn't there you'd go to the\nuh checkout and be like did anyone just\nreturn one recently nice you smell weird\npopcorn in there yeah I'm surprised you\ndidn't get a job\nthere so it I think it closed down by\nthe time I was ready to get a job yeah\nas Blockbuster did man you could talk\nabout that with the record stores is a\nexperience that I mean Blockbuster was\nkind of a pain in the butt because it\nwas a responsibility you had the tape\nyou had to get it back but going there\nand picking out the\nmovie that was fun why are we why are we\nso nostalgic for something that was such\na frustrating experience most of the\ntime because when it worked out it was\nso good yeah it when it it was kind of\nlike now you surf TV to see what's on\nand you can go through thousand you're\nlike there's nothing you used to go to\nBlockbuster thousands of movies and\nyou'd be like there's nothing here MH\nvers the the fact of the matter is\nthough I think what we're nostalgic\nabout is you used to have to be around\npeople it was an experience yeah the\nsmell as soon as you open that door oh\nyeah it had that like almost like the\nmovie theater carpet popcorn smell the\nbeaded curtain what's going on back\nthere that that thing I also grew up in\na house that was like very health\nconscious I would say and so Friday\nnights we would get like maybe it was\nlike $5 maybe it was $10 I don't even\nknow we would get a little bit of money\nwe were allowed to go rent a movie and\nget candy ni so that was like a big to\ndo and have pizza so so you were born I\ndon't even know what year were you you\nwere born oh okay yeah so 88 so you did\nget the experience you were still in the\ntransition period between 90s were pre-\ninternet and post yeah I feel like I\nlived like the perfect scenario of when\nthe internet was introduced to my life\nif it was any earlier I think it would\nhave been catastrophic yeah um but it it\ncame into my life I feel like at a time\nthat was okay because I grew up are you\nallowed to say tomboy anymore is that a\nbad word no you can say that okay I\ndon't know anymore but so that's how I\nwas growing up like we spent all of our\ntime outside I was crawling in sewers\nmost of the time there was a pond in our\nneighborhood where we would go fishing\nall the time we'd catch salamanders and\nfrogs dude how did I ever know never\nknow this you're closer to my DNA than I\never thought yeah like we used to catch\nall the tadpoles and then bring them\nhome and then watch them turn into frogs\nand then like play with them jumping\naround everywhere like loved that would\ncatch snakes yeah like never never\nscared of any reptiles loved reptiles\nreally um yeah like very very much not a\ngirly girl did you ever trick uh like\nscare your parents or anything like that\nno and also you couldn't scare my father\nhe was ex-military so none of that was\nhappening and no my mom wasn't she\nwasn't scared of animals either in any\nway H so yeah it wasn't even a\npossibility and I grew up with an older\nbrother so you know right right he's\nwhat it is and so your parent so your\nmom\nis from the United States right is\njersey she's from Jersey okay that's in\nthe United States\nyeah there's a debate whether it should\nor shouldn't be but the drones are\nflying over right now yeah yeah those\nare weird maybe they'll secede and\nthat's everything will be all right no\num yeah if the drones if the drones took\nout the toll roads in New Jersey that\nwould be awesome maybe we could make\nthat happen just the toll boo that's it\nare is it is that a big concern for you\nyeah dude if you D have you ever\ndriv to New York the turnpike but you\nend up paying a mortgage just to get\nthere no you take the train and skip it\nall yeah but if you drive if you have to\ndrive there don't um and so anyway so\nyou uh so and your dad's from England\nright yes he grew up outside of London\num ended up coming over to the state to\nmy parents you sound like you're from\nLondon okay so funny thing about that is\nobviously my dad had an accent and\ngrowing up none of my friends understood\nwhat he was saying and I never\nunderstood why he his accent was\ndifferent than I've heard people with\nBritish accent also he was he he kind of\nmumbled and he was like older and so I\nfeel like all my friends were like what\nis he saying but I I never understood\nthat he had an accent growing up that's\nlike not until later in life where I was\nlike oh yeah he does sound different I\nguess it makes sense if you grew up\nthere then if you grew up in the house\nthen it's just how it sounds yeah and so\nI will tell you this uh when I met Ian\nhe was\nprobably 7s 60s 7s late\n6070s 70s okay and it took me a while to\nto understand what he was saying I I\nwould translate for most people I me he\nhe was very good at yelling sometimes\nand those words you understood quite\nwell yeah you could pick those up pretty\nquick and he would call me the the p p\nword all the time yeah if I didn't smoke\na cigar with him or drink rotten Scotch\nI mean Fair really bad Scotch yeah no I\ndon't yeah I would I don't know if I\nwould do that either um yeah so they\nthey met over here obviously they met\nactually on the west coast and lived\nthere for a while and then ended up over\non the east coast for business\nand I thought that everyone's parents\nowned businesses together and that's\njust how life worked like that's you\nwould own a business together and then\nget married cuz that's how my parents\nworked so I just assumed that was what\neveryone did worked out for\nme um it's pretty funny that that's not\nat all how normal people function I love\nyour perception of reality yeah that\nyour dad didn't have an ACC people don't\nhave\naccents just living in my own world and\nbut your dad was also in the Royal Air\nForce is that what it's called no the s\nSAS okay um is is that part of the is\nthatal is that Under the Umbrella of the\nAir Force or is that you know how like\nthe N seals are under the Navy I don't\nknow anyways but that's like a special\nlike a legit yeah in fact after I wrote\nmy post about how he was part of that so\nmany people reached out that they were\nlike oh my gosh that's like an insane\nposition to be in and live through and\nlike I think he lived more lives than\nI'll ever know oh for sure but yeah and\nhe would always be the Storyteller\nanytime we were at a party like people\nwould be up until 3:00 a.m. just\nlistening to my dad tell insane stories\ndamn I missed out yeah\nah um that's because he how long was he\nin the military for a really well I want\nto say I don't know 10 15 years would be\nmy guess okay and then and then he left\nuh or retired I guess from and then okay\nand then so my parents were in the\northopedic field um my dad actually\nended up designing hip and knee\nReplacements he actually had patents on\nseveral different versions of them um\nit's funny cuz I was telling Thomas we\nwere randomly talking about jobs this\nmorning and when I was in elementary\nschool um like during some of the\nSummers when my brother and I weren't in\ncamper doing anything we would go to my\nparents office and they had us work and\none of the things we did is they used to\nmake these wax molds of these hip and\nknee Replacements and the wax would like\nget outside of the mold and so you'd\nhave to take an X-Acto Knife and like\nSmooth it all out and so we spent like\nhours in this Warehouse doing that while\nwe were younger and I remember thinking\nit was like so like monotonous and\nboring but we were with these men who\nwere working back in this Factory that\nwere so fun and funny and just wonderful\nto be around and so like it was just a\nfun experience that's cool and that was\nin Maryland yeah they they had a um\noffice building in Hunt Valley whoa so\nwere you basically creating for us like\nyou were you were molding people's knees\nno so it was a it was like a a mold we\nwere just we were just taking the scrap\nlike the excess wax still that was like\ngoing in someone's leg right well so\nyou'd have to put the material in the\nmold create the oh I feel you okay I got\nyou I got you and also like we would\nhand it over to someone else who would\nlike also inspect and before it went to\nanother person who so yeah we were not\nthey're like this one has uh someone's\ninitials in the year written in I'm\npicturing like Tommy Boy when he like\ntries the the buffer for the filter and\nit shoots up flies on the window yeah\nand I'm also thinking like you know how\nthe boys have helped like come and done\nlike some grit packing before they did\nit like for maybe 10 minutes and they\nhelped out I'm wondering how\nmuch actual work like no we would stay\nfor if not a half day like a full day\nsometimes um that's a good work ethic\nright there but I remember there was a\ncafeteria in this office building that\nthat was like the Highlight we were\nallowed to go get something out of the\nvending machine at lunchtime so like a\ncandy bar or something and that was like\nepic what was it about cafeterias when\nyou're a kid like in any workplace it's\nlike a magic if you go to a break room\nin like the worst break room in any\noffice or you think it's like the\ncoolest place in smells like bad coffee\nright but that I I remember doing that\nwhen I went to visit my mom would go to\nlike a vending machine and the vending\nmachine like being able to pick out\nanything in a vending machine was like\nyeah pretty exciting they also so my\nparents worked a lot and traveled a lot\num but so and so every once in a while\nwe'd have to go into their office on a\nweekend but and so they owned this\nbuilding and the front half of it was\nlike office building like offices and\nthen the back half was a factory and but\nit you could obviously get through the\nwhole thing and so they would let us\nbring our roller blades and there was\nalso a um like a a conferencing system\nthroughout or speaker system yeah and so\nwe were allowed to rollerblade from the\nfront office Parts all the way around to\nthe factory and so my brother and I\nwould like race each other and then we\nget on the loudspeaker and be like and\nso like that was super fun yeah in a\npotentially not fun environment when my\nparents had to go into an office on a\nweekend oh that's pretty cool I like\nthat they were all good memories so they\nhave did they work a lot doing that then\nyeah um yeah my parents worked a lot\nokay but somehow my mom still managed to\nlike come to all of my sports games and\nlike pick me up from school and yeah I\nhonestly and your school wasn't close by\nwell so um growing up I went to a little\nprivate school called St James Academy\nin monton Maryland okay and so their\noffices were only 10 minutes from there\num so that that drive wasn't bad um when\nyou switched it's when I went to high\nschool that I had quite a trek okay yeah\num\nand then so were your parents well what\nsports so what sports were you playing\nwhen you were younger then um I\nprimarily played soccer so like all year\nlong indoor outdoor um growing up and\nthen when I went to middle school that's\nwhen I did lacrosse field hockey and\nsoccer now funny thing is she went to\nthe soccer\ncamp and you got to tell this story um\nshe went to a soccer camp that I ended\nup sending the boys to okay saying same\nsoccer camp dude's still there really\nyeah he was probably how old was he when\nhe went there I don't know like he just\nretired from the Blast Soccer yeah he\nwas a professional who was retired and\nwhen my boys went this dude looked like\nyou know is like the [\u00a0__\u00a0] keeper no if\nthe [\u00a0__\u00a0] keeper had like a giant belly\nlike you know he he he was on a diet of\nbut I remember thinking he was super\ncool um yeah but tell him about the\nfield trips that you would take\num so we would this Camp was you would\nplay soccer all day in these fields but\nthen also like no shade by the way one\nday a week or maybe half of a day you\nwould go somewhere to like a a lake or a\nquarry and go swimming or a pool or\nsomething like that and I'll never\nforget this one time he was driving us\nin like this weird van like this creepy\nvan um and he had like rigged a TV in\nthe center console yeah and was driv\nDing and watching this like very violent\nmovie did you say he was also cracked a\nbeer or something he opened\nsomething um and I just remember being\nlike what why is he watching TV while\nwe're driving to this place and so D he\nwas ahead of his time yeah and so we go\nto this this Quarry and we're all like\nswimming or whatever and we get back in\nthe car and we head back home um where\nall of our parents are there to pick us\nup and he realized he left one of the\nkids at the Quarry and everyone was like\nfreaking out and I was like Mom I don't\nthink this guy's very responsible like\nand I think I was telling her about the\nTV and then we never went back oh man\nand he's so meanwhile I send the kids\nthere so my youngest is is kind of\nfinicky anyway and he there's no shade\nlike they're just in this field in the\nmiddle of Maryland summer which you know\nis like at best 80\u00b0 and 100% humidity\nyeah and I would get them home and they\nwould just be covered in like dust and\ndirt and just wet and sweaty uh and he\nwas like I can't go back he's like what\nI'm like what'd you do today he goes I\nsat under a tree for like three hours\nyeah that's I mean yeah that's kind of\nhow it was I guess I mean back then it\nwas like if you didn't get secondhand\nsmokes something they weren't a good\ncoach yeah that was kind of the deal at\nleast in baseball I felt like if if you\ndidn't step in tobacco spit on your way\nto the Batters box then you were on the\nwrong you weren't getting coached well\nI'm like thinking of all my coaches as\nyou're saying that and yeah checks out\nespecially when I was younger I don't\nfeel like there's like athletes back\nthen were really focused on nutrition\nyeah like being anything outside of\nplaying the sport that was when athletes\nwere just naturally good at stuff like\nyou'd have a dude who was you know 20\nlike who's a golfer that is is really\nJohn yeah John like the John Daly\nathlete was every athlete like they just\nplayed until they got fat and then they\nstopped playing yeah theying they didn't\neven have weight rooms in Major League\nclubhouses till like the late 80s like\nthey didn't work out they just kind of\nshowed up yeah awesome I wish that's how\neverything was um but yeah anyway so you\nso that was a kind of your you played\nsoccer a lot yeah and then did you did\nyou do travel soccer or or was it just\nlike indoor like whatever season was did\nthey even have that yeah they had that\nright they did I don't think I ever\njoined a travel soccer team I did do\nsome travel across stuff for a little\nbit um but yeah I think especially\nhaving two kids in with like owning a\ncompany and yeah having two kids in\nsports I don't know how we would travel\nright so then did your parents have to\ntravel for work and stuff yeah okay they\ntraveled quite a bit in fact I had a\nreally good relationship with my\ngrandparents because um that's where we\nwould go and stay like when they would\ngo to Japan or okay wherever um for for\na week or so my mom would always try to\nstay with us so that it was only my dad\ntraveling but there was just several\ntimes where they both had to go and so\num I was very much a mama's girl growing\nup so those trips would devastate me um\nbut when you were growing\nup well I still am so how did you deal\nwith how did you deal with that when\nthat happened uh uh I cry a lot and then\nmy grandmother would tell me not to cry\nin front of my mom because then my mom\nwould get upset and then she would be\nupset leaving and it would be a whole\nthing so I used to try really hard not\nto cry until she would leave oh\nman that um yeah I mean eventually I\njust got used to it and especially as\nyou get older it's like you realize that\nthey're coming back and it's not the end\nof the world and right it's just hard to\nimagine that when you're younger and\nit's the first few trips\nyeah yeah but also it helped that I had\namazing grandparents who were like they\nthey lived in Annapolis and they had a\npool in their backyard so it was like a\nHaven and their basement had a pool\ntable and so so far Robbie whose\nchildhood is the best childhood out of\nthese uh these epod yeah that's awesome\nI'm I'm really glad I did I I had a\nreally good childhood I feel pretty\nlucky that's awesome and that it's I\nmean it's great because your parents you\nknow they they still worked a lot but\nthey were there for you which you I mean\nthat's it's how every kid should have it\nyeah yeah I mean I think they I mean\nthat's where my work ethic came from for\nsure was just watching them and it's I\nhad this like Mom who was so loving and\nthen this dad who was like very high\nexpectations and I feel like that\ncombination was yeah pretty good did you\never when your if your when your dad was\nlike that did you ever feel like it was\nlike did you ever hate did you hate it\nbut then later in life you're like I'm\nglad that happened yeah in the moment I\nwas like you know you don't you never\nwant to be yelled at or you never want\nto be like I don't know told you can't\nor can do something or you're not\nworking hard enough or something like\nthat like no one wants to hear that in\nthe moment yeah but I feel like that's\nyou like you need that you need someone\nthat's disciplinary you need someone\nwho's going to challenge you know\notherwise you're going to just Coast I\nfeel like that's like 99% of people\nthese days or parents even and myself\nincluded in a way you know oh I feel\nlike you want to be you want your kids\nto be it's like a weird you know I don't\nknow I feel like there's a more of an\nemphasis now on not do you know what I\nmean yeah not not push not being too\nhard in a way 100% is Megan obviously\ndoesn't like yelling yeah uh for you\nknow from childhood and stuff like that\nbut when I am a little bit of a yeller\nwhen it comes to the boys yeah and as\nthey grow up I've\nmellowed but there's still like if if I\nraise my voice I still see like the\nFlinch of of [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah and like even\nwhen I'm even when I raise my voice you\nrecoil yeah I don't like yelling at all\nin general I mean I'm I feel you I I\nthere's definitely a balance though like\nI feel like we've gone too far the other\nway where it's like everything's okay\nand everything you can do whatever you\nwant and it's wonderful where like I\nobviously back in the day when people\nwere like hitting kids and like that's\nthat was not right but there's\ndefinitely something in the Middle where\nlike if I see the boys doing something\ndumb like flat out dumb like trying to\nget into the toaster with a knife kind\nof dumb I'm going to yell like my\ninstinct is stop what you're doing and I\nmight throw in an an exploitive yeah and\nthey freeze but that's the whole point I\nthink that when they were growing up if\nthey started riding their bike into the\nstreet yeah same thing yeah you yell and\nthey freeze and you get the result you\nwant you they need to remember something\nlike or else you're just going to end up\nhaving a kid pancak out in the street\nsorry that probably too much but yeah um\nbut but for real like I was like you\nneed to know that I this is a serious\nbusiness but anyways but in the same way\nalso yeah pushing your kids like you\ndon't want to I I feel like it did swing\ntoo far where especially in the club\nsoccer travel team this kind of business\nwhere parents are like throwing their\nmaking their kids try to be professional\nathletes of\nthe that doesn't help either that's yeah\nthat's a little bit too crazy too and I\nfeel like that's more of like a parent\ntrying to live out some dream that they\ndidn't there were your parents like that\nwith\nsports uh no although so my dad um\ncoached me for indoor soccer for a few\nyears no one know how to play there\neveryone's like I don't know what he's\nsaying yeah he made he made him practice\nwith a tennis ball so the way that um\nthey picked they did he did uh the way\nthey picked soccer teams um in indoor is\nyou would go to like these tryy outs and\nthey'd like Mark you as a one two or\nthree like in terms of skills and they\ntry to even it out and how much like\nit's sounds like a code but if you're a\nkid in the three Zone like do you you\nself identify as a three or you like\nthey tell you too like you know they\nprobably don't do that anymore\nbut so they wouldn't let multiple ones\nbe on the same team okay and my friend\nmy best friend of the time um she and I\nwould always be ones and so we got our\ndads to coach together okay so that we\ncould be on the same team oh it's like\nThe Parent Trap for the coaching trap I\nlike it yeah yeah um it it only worked\nfor one year this was Carrie okay um but\nanyway I know Carrie was athletic yeah\nshe was very very talented um sorry\nCarrie for listening she's not she's not\num but so my dad coached us this this\none year and we ended up with like the\nmost rag tag team in the world like\ngirls who could like this one girl I\ndon't know where she came from she could\nbarely speak English like this one girl\nwas just like had never hadit a\nsoccerball in her life like it was the\nmost insane group of girls you've ever\nseen in your life and I was like what\nare we going to do and so my dad was\nlike we're going to start with tennis\nballs if you can kick a tennis ball you\ncan kick a regular soccer ball you can\ndodge a wrench I'm telling you he took\nthis team of girls that I was like were\nthere's no chance of anything happening\ninto we like won the tournament that's\nawesome it was insane but my point of\nthat story was he was very into yelling\nfrom the sidelines he got kicked out of\nmultiple games but it wasn't like as the\ncoach you got did the girls who didn't\nknow your dad before they started did\ndid they warm up to him or were they\nafraid of them uh probably a little bit\nof both also you have to understand a\ndetail she's leaving out this is\nbecoming the story Ian but his his hands\nhis hands were the biggest hands you've\never seen and I don't mean size\nlengthwise I mean like each finger yeah\nI recall I actually do remember this\nyeah you could put a regular like a 32\nin waist belt around his fingers I think\nI recall shaking his hand and being like\nI don't want to be on the receiving end\nof anything military wise I just always\npicture him grabbing someone's skull and\njust crushing it yeah oh yeah there's\nsome craniums lying around\nyeah anyways sorry\num I don't know what we talking about\nindoor soccer he coached it anyway yeah\nhe was but he like he would get very\ninto the games and be like yelling at\nlike a ref not not like us not like and\nnot me like I never felt pressure from\neither of my parents to like oh you got\nto practice more you got to do more it\nwas like that all came from within okay\nokay interesting somewhat like you're\nrunning yeah yeah uh but but here's\nhere's how I picture it it Ian went\nreally quickly to Hot\nZone and I can imagine a ref not seeing\noh yeah something that should have been\nseen 12-year-old kid reing the game yeah\nand yeah probably like a 16-year-old and\nI can't like Ian I like I never his\nvocabulary for um curse words was\nextensive and I can't imagine he would\nbe able to hold himself back so I I\nwould love to have some he he he really\ndid a lot but there was a few times\nwhere it just went by the wayside that's\namazing all right so that's cool so then\nyou in high school you went to I went to\nGarrison Forest um which I went from a\nschool\nwhere I academically I did really well\num and I worked hard but it it just\nwasn't that hard for me to go into a\nhigh school that it was very\nacademically challenging and so that was\ntough for me yeah okay um it was it was\ndefinitely an adjustment period and now\nI was driving 45 minutes to school so I\nwould be leaving the house at 7:00 a.m.\nand then I would have practice after\nschool so I would get home around 6:45 7\nhave dinner do homework for two hours go\nto bed and do it all over again what was\nso academically tough about garon cuz\nwe've talked about in the past and\nyou've said that mhm your high school\nexperience was was\ntougher and was tough enough that when\nyou went to college College seemed easy\nyeah um it\nwas it was just a really great like\nschool so there was I think 38 girls in\nmy graduating class so my classes some\nof them were seven people wow so the\nattention you got from the teacher was\nextensive and then the curriculum we\nwere learning you can't take a nap in\nthose classes no and the curriculum we\nwere learning was just it seemed very\nAdvanced um from what I was used to and\na lot of the girls they were on academic\nscholarships I was not um and so it just\nand I think especially at that age like\nI was very interested in going to\nparties and stuff and so I like having\nto juggle that just it was really hard\num but it was it like I I've told you\nbefore it's it's the best education I\ngot in all of my life so wow so why U\nwhy there not were closer my parents\nreally wanted me to go there um none of\nthe private schools in Baltimore were\nvery close to my house um but this one\nwas 10 minutes further out than most of\nthem um okay but they it just it had a\nreally good reputation and they wanted\nme to go there oh yeah I mean even if\nit's called Garrison Forest I think I\nfeel like that's somewhere where maybe\nRobin Hood would have went through or\nsomething it sounds it sounds like a\nBritish of Sherwood Force yeah yeah it\nsounds like a fancy like\nI just feel like anything with the word\nforest in in a school name I'm like that\nhas to be a good school like Hogwarts\nyeah yeah Hogwarts is yeah they need to\nwork Hogwarts Forest would have been a\nlittle bit better well it had a forest\nnear it Forbidden Forest yeah did have\nthat so um that'd be good name for\nschool for bidden Forest yeah I'd go\nthere but um and then that\nwas so during high school did you you\nsaid you played lacrosse and things like\nthat yep I stayed playing soccer\nlacrosse field hockey um I was just I\nwas in a sport for every part of the\nYear pretty much um just always staying\nactive but yeah and your parents didn't\nuh like slide into a deep depression\nfrom having to watch field hockey games\nover and over again no and that was that\none faded out early in high school and\nit's literally the worst game ever to\nwatch yeah I that's fair I don't know\nwomen's lacrosse they need to just let\nthem put pads on and hit each other cuz\nI I went to go watch one of those and\nbasically whoever picked up the ball was\ngoing to run to the uh oh there's no\nhitting or whatever no they're not\nthey're only allowed to check the stick\nso a girl will pick up the ball run\ntowards the goal shoot the ball if she\nmisses the other team gets in runs back\nit's basically is that different than\nmen's lacr yeah Men's Wear padding and\nhelmets and you and crack each other why\nis that though seems a little sexist if\nyou ask me well I think it is that\nthat's why I'm saying they should just\nlet them play but so in men's you wear\npads like I had shoulder pads and a\nhelmet and a helmet and gloves to\nprotect your hands right the women have\ngloves I believe and they make them wear\neye goggles that that was only\nimplemented in my like last year of\nLacrosse so and then the contact isn't\nthat hard like I think at this point\nmake it full contact like the men but\nyeah equal rights so I have a question\nfor you so when I'm met your brother I\ninstantly fell in love with him like you\nremember the first night confessions\nyeah the first night that I met him we\nhim and I hit it off really well we had\na great time and to this day we're still\nmost people that meet love\nhim you have what I would consider a\nvery tight relationship with your\nbrother more so than I think the average\nperson why do you think that you guys\nare so um connected like did CU I would\nthink that some sort of almost a trauma\nwould bring two siblings together this\ntight but you know why are you so tight\nwith Ryan well for starters we're 15\nmonths apart so age-wise really close um\ngrowing up I mean he was like he and I\nwere always together so he was like\nalways there like I said I was a tomboy\nso I feel like we could hang out and go\nplay in the yard and do like run around\nkick the soccer ball and we had like\nsimilar interests so I think that helped\num and yeah he was just kind of like a\nbuilt-in best friend that's interesting\nthat's but that's interesting because I\nfeel like that's not a lot of times it's\ncomplete opposite where it's they're\nlike get like they don't yeah I mean\ndude my sister is not that much younger\nthan me she's like two years and D\ncouldn't stand like I think we were too\nmuch alike too maybe but I just cannot I\nmean\nRyan are similar we we convinced uh we\nto this later cuz when college but Ryan\nand I used to convince everyone we were\ntwins when we go out at places just as a\njoke cuz we thought that was funny um\njokes on you yeah but like I would play\nlike7 like shooting games like when I\nlike nice like I was I fit in with the\nboys and I think that was also probably\nit is like his friends became my friends\nmy friends became his friends like we\nwere in the same circles especially\nthroughout high school did you ever date\nany of his friends I did is that was\nthat weird it wasn't okay at the time um\nI ended up dating one of his friends um\nwho was like my first like real\nboyfriend for a couple years um but he\nwas like just the sweetest nicest guy in\nthe world I think if I had dated maybe\nany of the other friends that he had it\nwould have been a problem but I picked\nthe really nice one so it was it was\nokay so the very first time I met Ryan\nwe were out at we were working at social\ntoaster and uh we went to a happy hour\nand Ryan came to drop off a car for\nMegan cuz her car was dying and so they\ngot her a car that ended up being a\nnightmare I'm not allowed to buy cars\nbecause I buy lemons and that is the end\nof it this car they couldn't find the\nelectrical promp so the battery would\ndie oh that's the every every two days\nhad a car like that before so Ryan comes\nup and he drops off the car but he comes\nto the happy hour when I meet him um I\nstart you know we're we're having fun so\nlittle game I'm like we start daring\neach other to do different things okay\nthe next girl that comes in here you've\ngot to exchange clothing with her and\ncome out like the next girl that walks\ninto this bar you have to convince her\nto take off her clothes and put on your\nclothes and you have to put on her\nclothes okay I was like this is never\ngoing to happen uhhuh this girl walks in\nwith her boyfriend what Ryan goes up to\nher convinces her and did he tell her\nthis is a bet no this is just like okay\nI don't know that he didn't he didn't\nokay um but he 10 minutes later he comes\nout of the bathroom wearing her clothes\nshe comes out wearing his clothes oh\nlike the whole thing yeah I thought you\nmeant just like a glove no Michael\nJackson dropped outfits yeah oh no way\ndude that's unbelievable yeah Ryan's\nthat kind of guy though yeah he's a yeah\nhe's just like he's like lovable and\noutgoing and yeah like people just they\njust\nI don't know that's cool go towards him\nbut he and I did get in quite a bit of\ntrouble in high school I mean I've heard\nyou talk about these parties that you\nused to have at your house and they seem\npretty pretty epic I know I feel like\nreally bad for my parents and I'm sorry\nMom because I know you're probably\nlistening to this um you can yeah air it\nall out just you don't have to say it\nanymore after this like like I said my\nparents were working so hard and they\nwould be taking like important doctors\nout to dinner right and that's when Ryan\nand I would be like oh let's throw this\nrager right now while they're gone for\ntwo hours oh oh they weren't gone for\nthe weekend\nno and like it's just none of it makes\nsense kids are dumb but to but to to our\ndefense we would try to have a party\nthat was like 10 to 15 friends coming\nover but the word still substantial the\nword would get out yeah and 300 people\nwould show up how do how how in\n1990 wait no\n2004 um when I was in high school I\ngraduated guess people had cell phones\nat that point yeah we did we had cell\nphones okay so that makes more sense\nSidekicks were awesome yeah AOL\nMessenger was was lit yeah and uh the\nrazors um yeah they so it would be like\nhow's that possible it would be like it\nwould just be like a Snowball Effect\nlike it would be like oh can this person\nbring this person be like okay yeah sure\nand then literally every private schools\nclass was at our house so were you\nLegends we for not good reasons yeah we\nwe the Murray house was known as The\nParty House in in every County north of\nBaltimore at every private school in\nBaltimore I mean that's something I\nguess you built your brand yeah real\nearly um and I have like yeah there's\njust a million stories I could even tell\nfrom all those but the last party we\nhad the cops not only showed up but they\nbrought dogs oh like to sniff out all\nthe kids or whatever\nuh wait kids sniffing dogs is what\nyou're describing trained by Joe Biden\nand I'll I'll never forget this that was\nthe last party we had by the way but\nI'll never forget some of the stories\nthat came out of there it was like a\nfreezing cold night and the cops show up\nand no one wants to get in trouble so\neveryone just like scatters and runs out\nof the house and runs to the front or\nwhatever but there's dogs chasing people\nway so some of my friends were climbing\nup trees and hanging up like just\nstanding in these trees huddled like\nfreezing cold for hours waiting for the\ndogs to go away like M like Mountain\nlike uh raccoons stuck in the trees with\nhunting dogs just at the base and like\nno one had jackets on cuz everyone just\nlike sprinted out of the house and like\nyeah what a disaster dude there might be\nkids just is still up there that you\nnever even knew about I remember when we\nmoved out of the house and we were\ncleaning out the basement and I was like\noh my gosh and I cuz like for years we\nwere just like shoving beer cans into\ntrash cans and putting them under the\nstairs in the basement cuz no one would\ngo there and I remember just seeing like\nhundreds of trash bags with beer cans in\nthem still like in like underneath the\nstairs of the basement and I was like oh\nwow it's like Harry Potters uh he was an\nalcoholic that's crazy yeah so we\ndefinitely got into some trouble in high\nschool which I feel really bad about for\nmy parents so this is interesting to me\nbecause you can\nhave so like when I was talking about I\nlike my parents didn't it was like\nliterally the complete opposite where\nthere is nothing like I feel like my\nsister did have a couple parties then\nwhen later on but\nuh but you had like ragers everyone's\ndrinking everyone's hanging out and then\nyou turned out totally normal like no\nproblems but then there's other kids who\nwill gr just like it's interesting not\nall of our friends made it out that's\ntrue I guess it just doesn't you never\nknow no but the thing is like when I\nwhen I think about the story she tells\nor Ryan tells I literally think of like\na National Lampoon Style movie like\nthese guys were just nuts accurate and\nthe fact is that I I I I almost feel bad\nfor her parents because they're having\nthis meeting and they're getting called\nby the cops during a a dinner out with\nwith clients can you imagine like right\nnow if you were say that we up at New\nYork doing work right and you get a call\nthat Ry and and Jonas were throwing a\nrager at your house and the cops were\nthere yeah no I be lose my mind so what\nbut you sound it sound like your dad was\nkind of so how did they respond to it\nlike were you did you get in trouble or\nyeah okay um like grounded in fact I'll\nnever forget one I think it was probably\nthe same party with the dogs came um my\nbrother had just gotten a snowboard for\nChristmas I love this one and um so the\ncops called and they asked my parents\nspecifically do you want us to legally\nreprimand your kids or do you want to\nhandle it my parents are like we handle\nit like thank you to those cops for\nallowing that um\nbut my dad came home and like he didn't\neven say words to us mhm like was just\nit's that disappointment which is worse\nthan yelling right but he takes my\nbrother's snowboard that he had just\ngotten and he walks down into the\nbasement and you hear the electric saw\ngo on and then he cuts a piece of\nplywood in half but it in up upstairs\nwhere it sounds like he just cut the\nsnowboard in half and my brother just\nhis like whole body just\nlike like just W like was so devastated\nand so upset and my dad just walks back\nupstairs and goes to bed and doesn't\neven say a word and we found out later\nthat it was just a piece of plywood the\nsnowboard was fine how long I think he\nlet like let him think that for like a\nweek okay but like here's here's the\ninteresting thing though because Ian was\nuh from Europe\ndrinking and being a minor wasn't\nexactly the same right like he didn't\nview it the same way no like they would\nbe completely comfortable with us having\na glass of wine at dinner yeah when we\nwere 17 18 I think there's something to\nthat in a way well I do I my thought on\nthat is you look at like these people go\noff to college and like Megan kind of\nhad her college parties early so like\nright she's in high schol contined\nthrough college yeah but well I guess\nyeah my point isn't going to make sense\nbecause I was going to say you learned\nhow to manage alcohol without being like\ncrazy about it um yes which I was yeah\nwrong about CU I forg about your\nblackout day I think I continued the the\npartying in college for sure um but so\nand but in my case I didn't drink until\nI really didn't drink until till I was\n21 I was like uh really like in that way\nI didn't do it at all you know cuz I was\nscared of getting trouble and just I\nmean my friends didn't really either so\nbut then afterwards I I like yeah I had\nlive those days in my 20s you know where\nI you were already normal had a normal\nlife I think it also helped for me being\nin nework New York like I was telling\nyou that I was drinking at clubs and\nbars in New York City from 16 at 16\nyears old so that when I went to college\nit wasn't like oh wow I can\nget like liquor so I wasn't like yeah\nout of control it wasn't a forbidden for\nyou didn't go to the Forbidden Forest to\nget your yeah so so when you went you\nwent to University of Charleston then\nCollege of Charleston or college yeah um\nand then what's the difference between a\nuniversity and college uh a price tag\nis that what it is well College of\nCharleston's a public school okay yeah\nbut I think University of Talon's public\nyes it was we need to we need to\ninvestigate that not right now I think\nyou have to have certain certain uh\ncurriculum to be University College so\nMegan you you were playing sports you\nwere good at sports you a natural\nathlete both you and Ryan are a pretty\ndecent athletes although I've beaten him\nat several Sports\num including two triathlons\nand cornhole cornhole too or no uh I\ndon't know I don't know I I\nknow yeah I don't I don't know if we've\ngone down that we have to have a\ncornhole tournament but definitely\nminiature golf and uh stuff like that\nyeah so you were an athlete you get to\nCharleston so I'm guessing you signed up\nfor all the sports no that's when I\ndecided I would just focus on academics\nand not play any sports cuzz in my mind\nyou either had to like be a professional\nor you didn't play sports I don't think\nI realized that there was like a club\naspect in college like inter murals or\nwhatever okay um so I didn't join any\nand I but that's weird cuz you hung out\nwith one of the clubs down there quite a\nbit I mean like soccer or the sports\nthat I was interested in I did think the\nrugby team yeah I know what you're\nreferring to um so my brother went to\ncollege on the west coast for a year and\nreally didn't like it at all and I went\nto college with Charleston and I was\nlike this is the coolest this is the\nmost amazing place in the whole world\nand so he ended up transferring to col\nof Charleston as well and we ended up\nbeing roommates um oh wow so yeah we're\njust we've lived together for you guys\nreally were best friends yeah um there\nwas a year where I was living with just\nme and I think three rugby guys um okay\nand the weird thing was you know how Ian\nscared people with his yelling mhm\napparently Megan was the scary person in\nthat house from the stories that I've\nheard like they were all afraid of Megan\nwell well when I got to a point where I\nwas like the partying is fun to an\nextent and then when it's like 3:00 a.m.\nand you have class the next day it's\nlike it's not fun like it's different on\nthe weekends but yeah but there so there\nwas times where they would have like a\nrugby game on a Sunday and then be\npartying and I would have class the next\nday and so I would say in strong words\nyeah get your life together I have to\nget up at 6:00 a.m. um\nbut no we yeah College was some of the\nmost fun years ever and at that that was\na period of time so you weren't playing\norganized sport no but you started using\nrunning as a way to just stay active\nyeah so my the roommate who I was paired\nup with um for my freshman year in the\ndorm was a runner like she ran and so I\nwas like oh that's kind of cool um and\nshe would always invite me on like these\nthree mile runs and I was like\nabsolutely not but I was like I'll go\naround the block so I started doing that\nevery once in a while and then I think I\ngot up to like a mile and that felt like\nan accomplishment so then I just got\ninto a habit of doing like a mile every\nday or every other day and that was like\nmy workout my like gym fitness stuff and\nI would feel good about myself for doing\nthat right um but that was primarily all\nI did in terms of Athletics all through\ncollege so what was your major at uh\nCollege of Charleston I started out as a\nComm major and then I switched to\nbusiness with the concentration and\nmarketing um I actually did the hard the\nhardest classes of communications public\nspeaking\nwhich I think were probably some of the\nbest courses I ever took because I was\nso nervous and so uncomfortable that I\nwould spend like hours preparing and I\nremember my last speech I had to give I\nended up doing it on um sharks because\nthey said pick a topic that you're like\nreally interested in and so it started\nout with like this giant great white\nshark behind me and like the teacher was\nlike that was the best presentation from\nthe entire class that's awesome and so\nthen I had like a bunch of confidence\nbut at the same time I was like this is\nalso I don't know that what I'm going to\ndo with this afterwards so I was like\nbecome a shark expert so and and the\nactually weirdly Finance was one of my\nfavorite classes and so I was like I'm\njust going to go business but I also\nthink marketing is important I didn't\nknow what I wanted to do and I was like\nI feel like these are two skill sets\nthat I can do anything with yeah so I\nthat's that's what I ended up finishing\nwith with a ba and okay so let's let's\ndive into running a little bit so when\ndid like explain to cuz I know that even\nmoving to Baltimore you ran when you got\nhere yeah um not like what people would\nconsider like what like running like you\ndo now but I think I started running\njust maybe a little bit more\nafter I graduated maybe like I was up to\nlike 2 miles maybe I did like a three\nmile run at one point um and I really\ndidn't want to leave Charleston but the\nwhen I graduated in 2010 there was like\nno businesses outside of hospitality in\nthe city Boeing had just gotten there\nbut outside of that there was there was\nno big corporations and so um I had\ngotten an internship during college um\nat the spa at Charleston Place which is\nbasically like the Ritz it was amazing\nand they weren't allowed to pay us but\nshe would give me um like free massages\nbecause she was allowed to do that\nanyway that's where I like fell in love\nwith social media and that side of the\nmarketing and I learned so much from\nthis woman who worked there and I was\nlike this is what I want to do like this\nis a Avenue of marketing where I feel\nlike it's going to explode yeah and\nthere was no there was no jobs like that\nin Charleston and what what year what\nyear was that 2009 okay so yeah that was\nlike right when like Twitter was\nstarting to be\nbelieve in the r was starting to become\nthing I know of this website I feel like\nit's going to really do stuff um but and\nthen was Instagram a thing yet or is\nthat 2010 or Instagram was 2012 12 okay\nbut so um I ended up the person who I\nwas dating at the time wanted to move\nback to New Jersey where he lived and we\ncompromised on like DC area um and so I\nstarted applying for a bunch of jobs up\nhere in in DC Baltimore more\nand I remember I I flew to DC to\ninterview I had like six interviews\nlined up okay and I stayed at Rob James\nwho was like living there at the time\nhis like little house and I think I\nborrowed his car and the traffic was so\nbad that I made two out of the six\ninterviews man and I remember being\ndevastated cuz I like planned all this\nstuff and and so I flew back\npresentation\nand I was like um DC is crazy I don't\nthink I can do it um and then this\nopportunity came up at Social toaster\nthat a friend of a friend sent to me\nokay and I flew up I think I stayed at\noh was that car's Dad yeah okay all\nright um my best friend Carrie who I\nmentioned earlier who played soccer with\nher dad was working with this company\nsocial toaster so he did this\nintroduction okay and I flew up to do an\ninterview and I remember I was staying\nat the I think it's a hill that\noverlooked the orial stadium yeah mhm\nand I got up in the morning to go for a\nrun on the treadmill and that's I was\njust like looking at orial Stadium while\nI was running in the morning and I was\nlike this is cool like what a cool way\nto start my day and then I went into the\ninterview and I loved the people and I\nwas like man like I really hope this\nworks out and I flew back home and like\na week later they offered me the job and\nI was like okay this is I got to go um\nand that's how I ended up back here and\nI was running\nstill like every morning I think just\nyou know because I wanted to and then at\nSocial toaster is when I met Thomas and\nhe had convinced me to run the 10mile\none of my favorite things and I think we\nskipped this though is Megan you know\nlike here I was I was doing leaving the\nRun admin for at this point tell the Sho\nstory yeah um so we we're working\ntogether and I see that she has like a\nwebsite up on her looking at shoes and\nI'm like oh you you don't want to get\nthose and and they were pair of under\narmoured trail shoes they looked great\nand I said uh no you you don't want to\nget those for running and she goes no\nthese look red or whatever you said yeah\nhe's like no no he's like that's not for\nthe road that's for trail you don't want\nthose and I was like what do you mean I\nwas like it doesn't matter if there's\nextra rubber on the bottom I was like\nI'm going to get these they look great\nso I was like Megan no don't do it I\nremember they even had like they were\nkind of outlandish for you like like now\nthat I look back and I'm like how did\nshe ever I need to see if I can find a\nphoto of them we do it they almost had\nlike leopard spots on them or something\nI forget what it was but so she's she's\nGNA get I'm trying to talk her out of it\nI think I have talked her out but she\ndid that thing where she let me think\nthat I had done it so that I would go\naway and she got him and I remember her\ngetting him I was like really\ndisappointed she went for a run and this\nwas one of my happiest moments she came\nback she's like they gave me blisters\neverywhere my feet are all messed up and\nI'm like yeah s them right back at this\ntime she was doing like three mile run\nso this shoe chewed her up like within\nthree miles and just destroyed her feet\nand then uh I I convinced her at that\ntime to go get fit properly for uh\nrunning shoes MH and she came back with\na pair that was like not greatl looking\nbut they they put me in like the ghost\nor something or\nthat's that's what's going to happen or\nthe launch what I don't think it was a\nlaunch I think you the ghost you either\ngot the ghost or the glycerin yeah might\nhave been the glycerin and you weren't\necstatic about it but then you're like\noh these actually work the Pure Flow\nremember those yeah that was I think the\nfirst time when I went to Charm City run\nit was like the Brooks Pure Flow I'm\npretty sure they were just trying to get\nrid of inventory probably but those that\nactually was one of Brooks I they had\nsome fun stuff come out of that project\nyeah because they had these guy it was\nlike a dude from Apple came and helped\nthem design okay those ones but anyways\nI also just realized I skipped over you\nknow you said you had some crazy jobs um\nwhen I first graduated and I didn't want\nto leave Charleston but there was no\njobs that I wanted\num I so I was super Lucky in that my\nparents paid for my um School MH but as\nsoon as it was over I was like okay I\nneed to be financially independent like\nI just need to find a job where I can\nlive here and pay for everything that I\nneed and so I basically took the first\njob that I could get that would check\nthat box\nwhich said it was a customer service\nposition and I had worked at um a\njewelry store throughout College it was\nkind of a customer service yeah um and\nthis was another jewelry store customer\nservice position they the way that they\ntalked about it was like it would be a\ngrowing position you could you know get\nto the top top fast whatever right the\ntop wasn't that high I should have the\nfirst red flag was I was getting paid\nunder the table\nnice but so it ended up that it was a do\nyou know what Pandora Jewelry is like\nthe charms it was a\nknockoff basically company of Pandora\nfandora yeah yeah I forget what it's\ncalled do you know what's actually\ninteresting about charms that I just\nfound out in Charm City and why we're\ncalled Charm City it was a marketing\ncampaign uhhuh where you for Pandora no\nyou basically they get a charm bracelet\nand if you went to certain places in the\ncity you could collect the little charm\nfor the charm bracelet oh really and it\nand it was funded by the city and of\ncourse after a few months they decided\nto not do it right but the name stuck so\nit's not just because it's Charming\nno yeah I saw that's saw a whole thing\nsounds like a Baltimore thing anyway I\nknow if you hear the whole story like\nthat they cut funding for it and it just\ndied out and they're like nobody will\never call a Charm\nCity anyway so back to your shop yeah um\nso I take this job and they give me the\naddress to go to the office for the\nfirst day and I realized it's This\nWoman's\nhouse and they put me in this room that\nis like how we have shoes lined up all\nup and down the Walls it's just beads\nand there's little numbers on all of\nthem and I have to fulfill these orders\nand find the beads like and put them\ninto packaging and send them off all day\nlong\nlike drawers with beads in them\nbasically okay yeah and so like an order\nwould come in it would be like A2 and\nthen you'd go find a12 and then put that\nbead with this bead and then put the\nwhole thing together into an order okay\nand then while I was doing that all day\nI was also the customer service person\nso people would call but the people that\nwere calling were like 85-year-old women\nwho were so angry that it wasn't real\nPandora and then I had to be like no\nit's it's um like real silver and all\nthis and like talk about the most insane\nconversations ever so then at the end of\nthe day I'd take all these packages it's\nironic now that we have grit I take all\nthese packages haul them into my car\ndrive to USPS up to the back and toss\nthem all into this big barrel and then\ndo it all over again the next day and\nwas this um did they just like how did\nthe old ladies find this stuff was it\ndid they advertise they had a website\nokay um and then just post it on\nCraigslist or something yeah I think\nFacebook was like pretty big then like\nthe social media marketing was happening\num all right and so yeah I think people\nwere just finding it organically like if\nyou would I think maybe they had I mean\nthis company is no longer in existence\nit went bankrupt like three years later\nbut um I think they were probably doing\nlike the paid um SEO where if you were\nsearching for pendora show up so you\nknow all these ladies are okay so they\nhad some some skills maybe yeah and and\nthen so that's where you basically got\nyour customer service chops so yeah it's\nreally funny if you looked at my resume\ncuz I was trying to find another job\nwhile I was at this job realizing this\nwas not at all what I wanted and like if\nyou looked at my resume it was like\ncustomer support for you know you make\nit look all and like I was packing beads\nall day\nbut you're like you're like managing\ninventory for a fortune 1000 company\nyeah\nexactly um fulfillment fulfillment\nServices yeah yeah this this is the\nAmazon before Amazon all right I decided\nI decided to stop looking at like the\ncustomer support and maybe there was\nmore like business because I couldn't\nfind anything in marketing so I was like\nlooking at like business opportunities\nlike I don't even know what that means\nbut this position at a um Construction\nCompany okay came up and I just like\napplied and then they were like can you\ncome in and I was like well I have to be\nat my job at 9:00 a.m. and they're like\nwell can you come in at at 600 like we\nopen at 5 or whatever and I was like\nokay and so I get there and they're like\ncan you create they like gave me a\nspreadsheet and they gave me a scenario\nand they were like can you create a\nformula to figure out how to efficiently\nget these trucks to this place at this\ntime or whatever I'm out yeah so I'm\nalready dead I'm like I'm like super\nnervous I'm like I don't I don't know\nwhat I'm doing and so I like I just fill\nout as much as I can figure out or\nwhatever and I leave and I go to my job\nand I get a call later that afternoon\nand they were like you're the only\nperson who's come in here and has been\nable to figure this out in under 3 hours\nreally yeah and I was like they're like\nwe want to hire you and I was like\nokay and they're like how much do you\nwant and I was like I don't I don't know\nuh I was like I'm right now I'm making I\nthink I was making like is $12 under the\ntable does that seem like a lot or a\nlittle sounds that sounds like a little\nbut back then it probably was maybe it\nwas $20 under the table I mean I\nprobably would have Tak $12 an hour at\nthe time all I know is I asked for a\ncertain amount and the the woman who was\nthe HR our director was like um you need\nto ask for more I was like okay uh\nwhatever you suggest and so I ended up\ngoing to work for this construction\ncompany and my whole job was to create\nlike the most efficient process for\nthese trucks to lay asphalt which sounds\nso weird but it was actually like kind\nof fun in the beginning and then it got\nreally boring um but you got a flying\nprivate\njet okay my whole life I don't know how\nbut I have had the best bosses in the\nwhole world like I just I I don't know I\nluck out on bosses and you the bead\nlady she was nice so it was fine okay\nall right um and this guy who was my\nultimate boss at this construction\ncompany was just like like a super fun\ndude to hang out with and my third week\nor fourth week of being at the\nconstruction company they had this giant\nconference and he should have\ntaken someone who had been there for\nyears but instead he took me to this\ntruck conference in um New Orleans New\nOrleans and they had a private jet so I\njust flew with them on this private jet\nto New Orleans to sit into this like\n2hour meeting and then we like went out\nto fancy dinners and H out and there was\nnothing like extra terrest I not\nterrestrial but like that's the first\nthing I thought there's no eping going\non no okay I and and it was like me and\na bunch of dudes but I I promise you\nlike he was like a father figure there\nwas like nothing weird so there are good\nguys yeah although okay although I did a\ncouple weeks before I left there um\nbefore I told them I was uh\nquitting he I walked into the office and\nthe CFO walked straight up to me and he\nsaid can you come into my office and I\nwas like oh\ngosh and he said we've let my boss and\nthe HR girl\ngo and they were like we're not going to\ntalk anymore about it but I just wanted\nto let you know and he's like you will\nnow be reporting to me and I was like uh\nand I'm\nout so I thought you were going to say\nhe asked you to like uh cook the books\nor something maybe do a little bit of\npivot tabling or something something\nlike that I don't even know what pivot\ntables are I've heard the term before\nbut there's other places that we've\nworked that where there was some funny\nbook stuff going on but yeah yeah I'm\nsure that happens a lot I I guess I'm\nnaive like I always think that people\nare on the up and up and so when we we\ncatch somebody doing something like that\nor or see that it really is\ndisheartening it's yeah I think it's way\nmore common than you would probably\nthink yeah I mean the one time when I\nwas working in the restaurant the\nhostess tried to steal the cash drop\nlike I was like she like faked putting\nit in the the safe and everything like\ncuz there is a camera back there and it\nwas like like obviously you took it like\nyou're the only one with access to the\ncash I don't know what happened to it\n$22,000 like yeah but yeah people are\ncrazy all right so you get this trip to\nNew Orleans you've now it's social\ntoaster yeah you start\nrunning start running highly influenced\nby you yeah but you start running and\nand well the reason\nlook bean I started I I don't know why\nwere you on straa or was it were you\nneed to straa but straa didn't exist\nthen so after I don't know oh daily mile\nmaybe aink so\num Meg's like you know now got her shoes\nsorted\nout and I'm like just looking at her\nlike her daily run and she's running\nbasically the perimeter of uh Patterson\nPark okay right I I like had no concept\nof Hills I guess I was just like running\ncircles around there and Thomas was like\noh that's really hilly and I was like\nwhat and she was running it at a pretty\ngood Pace right I was like you should\nyou should sign up for a race or\nsomething mhm and then you said the\nBaltimore 10 m was super fun and have\nyou ever done RAC before which was a lie\nI did won 5K what about the bridge thing\nin Charleston I never did that oh you\ndidn't no oh wow I ran that bridge all\nthe time never once did the race that's\nweird um I did one 5K with that the\nconstruction company I worked with cuz\nthere was a guy there who was like a\ntriathlon okay and he would convince\neveryone in the office like go do this\nrace so we all did gotcha um but it was\nlike it was like a local race you know\nlike it's there's a little start line\nand people are jogging like like they\njust have a streamer or whatever like\nthere was no medals there was no someone\nwith a stopwatch yeah now when when M\nsays I convinced her to do the Baltimore\nTim Island I said it was fun I think at\nthe time I meant fun like The Vibes yeah\nlike not it's not a fun race but yeah no\nit's like the both oppos The Vibes are\nthe best the race opposite of whatever\nthat is but I think because I had been\nrunning around p Park and not aware of\nHills that the hills didn't bother me so\nmuch and the 10 Mile which is a very\nhilly course yeah and so I ended up just\nhaving a really good time okay and I've\nsaid this I've said this before but I\nwas like I couldn't believe that I was\ndrinking a beer at like 9:30 a.m. and\nhad run 10 miles and I was like this is\nthe coolest thing in the world it was it\nwas a a fun event and yeah\num it like that I\nfelt kicked off like you're like some\nsomewhat similar to when I did my first\n5k and I was like this all these people\nthis is really cool I think you saw\nsomething in the event and thing and so\nimmediately the next Monday we're at\nwork and what did you what did you do\nwell Thomas was like you should sign up\nfor the half now because you did the 10\nMile so you can do the half um I don't\nknow if this was immediately because\npart of the reason I signed up for the\nmarathon is because I had just gone\nthrough a breakup and I was like I can\ndo whatever\num girl\npower uh and so when I went to go sign\nup for the half obviously there's a drop\ndown there on the Baltimore marathon\nwebsite that's like half 10 gay\nBaltimore Marathon relay I guess it\nwould have had to been a little bit\nafter because the time period you didn't\nyou only had three weeks or something\nbefore it yeah so what happened between\nthe Baltimore 10 Myer and the half were\nyou just waiting to sign up for it um no\nI don't know that I was like eager to\nsign up for anything um and the person\nwho I was living with like really didn't\nlike that I was spending Saturday\nmornings running so that was a real\nproblem did you have priorities like\nbrunch yeah um like not going out on a\nFriday night is was like real tragic\nyeah um so anyway I think that was\nprobably all unfolding and then by the\ntime I went to go sign up and I went to\nthat page and it said the Baltimore\nMarathon or the Baltimore half is\n$110 and the Baltimore marathon is $120\nand I was like you can run twice as far\nfor1 more dollar what is wrong with\npeople why wouldn't you do the full\nMarathon\nnaturally so I I'm working with a guy at\nthis time I'm also like 24 and like the\nconcept of money is different then I\ndon't know oh yeah no I get I I\nunderstand the value proposition that\nyou're laying out it it makes sense\nlogically so I have a coach\nand I was like you makes like hey I can\nI sign up for the\nfull and I was like like let me let me\nask my coach what he thinks and at that\ntime he already knew her a little bit\ncuz he had I think did he help with the\n10mile training at all no no I didn't no\ntraining she was just she was already a\nlegend in Baltimore he like yeah I know\nI\nknow um no he like he said like she did\nthis 10 Mile she hasn't run more than\nthis many is it is it even feasible\nright for her to finish a marathon and\nhe was like yeah she's got to do I think\nit was 14 16 18 and then the marathon\nthat okay I mean yeah I felt like we did\na 20 mile together before that maybe I\ngot two miles before R I ran by myself\nfor was the one that we did the stadium\nand and that's way later okay with um\nStein I did all of my these long runs on\nthe NCR Trail so I would drive from\ndowntown to the NCR why I that's where I\nneeded to run long I have no idea um and\nI brought like Swedish fish with me I\ndon't think she had a GPS watch or\nanything either so it was like running\non the NCR you could clock you know when\nto turn around whatever I don't even\nknow how were you doing probably I just\ndid out back um no I remember I left my\nphone in my car CU I would get back from\nthese long runs and I'd be so excited I\nwould like call my mom and I was like\nMom I just ran 16 miles she was like\nwow um but it and it was that whole that\nwhole process was so anti-climatic for\nme because I literally drive to the NCR\nby myself do this run by myself get back\nin my car go back home and do that again\nlike 3 weeks in a row and even the the\nmarathon morning like at at this time of\nmy life I had no friends that ran I had\nno family that understood what a\nmarathon was yeah and so like I drove\nmyself to the start line I like\nnervously sat there by myself waiting\nfor the gun to go off ran the race like\ncrossed the finish line and was like\nokay did got back in my car and drove\nhome like just such a different\nexperience then but then they I picked\nyou up then later you picked me up and\nwe went to a the office party whatever\nthing the bll and bourbon thing or\nwhatever which was horrible yeah I mean\nit was after running marathon you know\nhow you get like a little bit of a chill\nyeah I I couldn't shake my chill so you\nran it too yeah I I ran you did the Rel\nbut you ended up doing like almost all\nof it so I did I did a relay with uh\nfour four people but I started off the\nfirst guy he wasn't that experienced so\nI was like I'll just run the first leg\nwith you okay and then so I ran the\nfirst leg with him and then I had my\nsecond leg and then I was like with the\nthird guy I was like I'll run with you\nokay got so I ended up doing like 20\nmiles and then um I was like drinking\nwith my brother afterwards at pickles um\nand then may called and I was like I\nyeah I'll I'll take you to the thing so\nI was even like in still like sweaty\ngear I think when we went to the bourbon\nthing I don't recall classy yeah yeah uh\nokay so then how chill could get rid of\ndid you think it was a good race I I did\nso Thomas told me he said a really good\ngoal for a lot of marathoners is sub\nfour yeah like coming out yeah I ran a\n356\nhigh so I was like oh I did it that was\nmy co probably no nutrition that was my\nfirst marathon too exactly the same nice\nyeah but probably Zero nutrition um I\ndidn't I don't think I ate anything\nbeforehand I took like maybe a couple\ngummies out there I didn't eat a meal\nafterwards I just started drinking\nbourbon um well it it was supposed to\nhave food too right but it was like I I\ndon't know if we got there late or\nsomething but it seemed like a pain in\nthe ass the lines were really long yeah\nso I think we all just drank and then\nwent I\nthink after that though you kind of had\na little bit of the bug for the marathon\nyeah then I was like okay I know I can\ndo One MH can I do one faster I don't\neven remember what my second one\nwas it wasn't OBX no I think it was a\nfull year before I ran another one\nthough um and then it got to was it\nBaltimore again cuz your parents came\nspectated right no that one was much\nlater um but I I know that my second one\nor my third one I ran 10 or 15 minutes\nfaster and then it was like all of a\nsudden I knew that Thomas had been\ntalking about the like AQ like it was\nlike this Holy Grail and so so I was\nlike oh man like that's that seems like\nit's almost plausible now uhuh and so\nthat's when I started talking to\nThomas's coach at the time Caleb and he\nagreed to help coach me for a while and\nthen that's when it just like all took\noff and I got my first BQ and then I was\nlike how much faster can I get and it\nwas just like a\nsnowball man and then so I'm trying to\nthink so what what and then when did you\nget when did you guys get married cuz I\ndon't even know if we talked about that\n201 16 16 or 17 16 I know September 24th\n2016 an important date um yeah uh okay\nso and then how so how many marathons at\nthat point had you had under your belt\noh several at that point matter of fact\nour our the tables instead of having\nnumbers we had bibs from our marathons\nas the table numbers yeah people liked\nit or lonner dead I think other people\nwere like what nerds\nlosers um you had a ShakeOut run before\nthe wedding we did it was all it was the\nfaster basts at the time it was like the\nfaster basts at that point was a very\ntight group mhm which it was funny\nbecause like only half of them showed up\nbecause our um our wedding reception the\nnight before was very fun mhm and our\nreception was almost like a wedding so\nmany people didn't show up to the r next\nmorning because they were like sorry\nlike your so you did the rehearsal\nreheal yeah rehearsal dinner so\nrehearsal dinner the night before was\nactually a ton of fun we what's the name\nof that\nplace Parina bar coena which is on the\nwater MH we had a catered and open bar\nand people ate tacos and drink and\nsounds a good time\nyeah yeah it was a lot of fun um but\nyeah we did have a run the morning of\nthe wedding which my wedding planner was\nlike freaking out about and she was like\nyou can't just like go for a 10 mile run\nin the morning and I was like yeah I can\nit'll be fine it it's my\nwedding um okay cool and then um and\nthen so after so you got married and\nthen I feel like so when did so when\ndoes this like believe in the Run big\nrun media when does that all come that\nactually started before we got married\nokay um so I moved back back here in\n2012 that's the same year I ran that\nBaltimore Marathon I that that year yeah\nI was working at Social toaster and\nthat's a that was a big year for you\nyeah geez a lot of changes and\num I want to say two years at Social\ntoaster three years at Social toaster\nand then that's when you kind of left\nand and started big run officially and\nthen I probably joined I think it was\n2013 no\n2014 when I when I started big run or\nwhen you came\nboth yeah I started in the fall like in\nOctober and by the spring of the\nfollowing year so it's like 1415\nsomewhere there yeah um so that's when\nlike that officially started and\nthen yeah we we took off we moved in\ntogether at that point yeah um it's\nfunny though cuz Thomas I think you said\nthis in your interview about how like\nLor pant was so yeah big part but I\ndon't think he the the part that's so\ncrazy is it was a\ntweet that we put out that was just like\nbig run media it was like defining like\nwhat we did like social media for the\nendurance space uh well no I think that\nwas the Twitter description okay and\nthen like I was tweet I was I had\nnothing to do cuz I was starting a\nbusiness you know so I was tweeting\nquite a bit mhm and she just happened to\nsee what one of these tweets and like\nreached out and that's how we created\nthat whole um guide to for race\ndirectors which is how we got all those\nleads which is how we ended up doing\nmarketing for all those events right\nwhich is basically what the core of big\nrun media was for many many years yeah\num and so that was what we were doing\nuntil the pandemic I mean I think what\nwhat worked in I think what was\nsomething that Drew us together at that\ntime was I was a crave director so I was\nvery much into design and that kind of\nside of stuff Megan had the Practical\nstuff like was managing clients for\nsocial toaster and and\norganizing campaigns yeah so my job\nthere was I think I was account manager\nis that what my title was I think so\nyeah and so I was basically working with\nthe clients directly to set up these\nprograms okay um and then I would\nsimilar to what we do now like with the\ntrail boards like I would request the\ncreative and things that I needed from\nfrom Thomas um and that's kind of how we\nwork together and it's funny because but\neven deeper than that I think so like we\nwere working with clients that were\ntrying to understand this tool that\nwasn't the most easiest to like kind of\nfigure out how to do a campaign with so\nMegan and I would sit down together and\nbe like okay for example it's The Hobbit\nwhat do we want to do for this how can\nwe get them to get their audience\nengaged in this so Megan and and you\nknow we would also work with um our\nmanager at the time Sarah Sarah who and\njust come up with ideas we'd be like\nhere's what we think would be a cool\nidea for this campaign and I think the\nfrustrating part was the better that\nMegan and I got at doing this the more\nthat kind of fell to us MH and that was\nwhen we both were like at least I was\nlike if\nwhy are we doing this for them like this\nis a business that we could be doing for\nourselves yeah in a space that we enjoy\nright which is running so yeah and\nthat's like what started that and then\nlike you guys kind of both talked about\non on your episodes of how it shifted to\nbelieve in the Run specifically because\nof the pandemic um and that\nwas simultaneously really hard but also\nreally exciting for me specifically\nbecause at that point in time Big Run\nmedia for the most part was just me and\nthen asking for some creative from you\nbut I was primarily doing all the\ncampaigns and setups and talking to\nclients and all that and so when that\nall went by the wayside in a way um\nafter the pandemic it was like\nterrifying a little bit that there\nwasn't that like constant um Revenue\ncoming in from these clients but it was\nalso like really exciting because it was\nlike oh I'm now like doing all this fun\nstuff with you guys unbel in the run and\nit was like what else can we do\nyeah yeah and I got so interesting and\npeople a lot of people listening\nprobably don't remember this because the\npodcast started you know two or three\nyears ago I guess but when you were\nduring that time frame maybe\n2021 you were super reticent to be on\ncamera or talk yeah and and maybe that\ngoes back to your public speaking type\nthing but you like hated it and Thomas\nalmost had to force you to do it well I\nwould get mad yeah I would get like so\nfrustrated cuz I wanted shoe reviews I\nwanted a female shoe review and I\nremember like getting ready for work I\nwas like Hey I'm going to need you to do\na video today and she's like I I I've\ngot another run I don't want to wash my\nhair this I'm like M why are you making\nthis so hard and I was frustrated you\nwere frustrated and I remember at one\npoint I just like screw it and then\num I think there came a point where you\nwere going to be okay with doing the\nvideos and stuff and being in front but\nat that point I was like already like\nI'm not even I don't I don't even want\nwant to get well I don't know about the\nwashing hair and running thing but my my\nhangup was specifically like I had so\nmuch work on the big run side and it was\nlike doing these videos took like an\nhour or two out of my day and it it was\nlike this at at the time in my mind this\nwas not bringing in any any revenue and\nI'm like they don't take an hour they\ntake 10 minutes and so I was like I have\nto stop what I'm doing which is the\nreason this business is functioning\nright now to go do this silly video and\nit was obviously very shortsighted but\nin my mind like that's where the I mean\nthat's part of it I mean were you\ncomfortable being that was definitely\npart of it yeah I don't think that you\nlik it being like I think that all of us\nhas to get past that little part where\nit's like you think YouTube is\nlike that's your image World it'll stay\nwhereas a video last like well yeah\npeople can go back and look at videos\nbut it is\ndisposable like our Instagram post and\nif you model a sweater or or some\nclothing on Instagram that's got 24\nhours and then it's pretty much gone but\neven like\nlike my natural inclination is like not\nto be the center of attention like I'm\nI've never been someone who's like let\nme be out in front let me look at me I'm\nlike can I wear all black and be in the\nback corner please like that's where I'm\ncomfortable and so when you throw a\nvideo camera in front of my face all the\ntime it's like I think it just takes\nthem getting used to it definitely does\nbut I like now you're pretty amazing in\nfront of the camera I think that like\nyour natural your personality comes\nthrough I think that I think it's just\npractice it's like anything is it\npractice or did you let down like this\nisn't like I feel like when you first\nget in front of the camera you're so\nconscious that this is a permanent thing\nor like this is it like people are going\nto watch this over and over and over\nwhere like even now you probably watch a\nvideo Robin you probably are watching\nlike focusing more like when we do a\nshoe review you probably look at\nyourself even when you're not talking or\nsomething or judging like this where\nsomeone who's watching is probably\nlooking at the shoe looking at the the\nthing they're not analyzing pretending\nto work\nyeah yeah um no but I do feel like it's\nlike changed a lot I do think that's\npretty cool I feel like I've noticed\nthat over time yeah I mean I I think I\njust attribute it to just doing it over\nand over again until you're comfortable\nand then also\nlike what's the worst that's going to\nhappen I do remember mean on YouTube\nthey're going to be mean on YouTube\nthey're always mean on YouTube I used to\nthe days where I knew I wanted you on a\nvideo I was\nlike CU it was two things it was\nstarting off in the morning being like\nhey I want you on video today you be\nlike okay okay I'll blow dry my hair\nwhatever it was um and then I knew that\nat some point during the day I was going\nto have to interrupt you and get you to\ndo it and you already didn't want to do\nit so it was like Megan can you can we\ndo this\nyour life's so hard it was hard man\nRobbie knows he witnessed it yeah yeah\nbut I also know like if that is it does\nthat is annoying if you are in the\nmiddle of something and you're just like\nI got to like Sho stupid it is like kind\nof annoying the difference though the\nlike if you annoy Megan or something she\none she probably won't tell you yeah and\nyou don't have to go home with her yeah\nthat's true yeah facts again Thomas's\nlife is so\nhard\nyeah um and so okay yeah but then no\nit's cool how that's uh kind of\nprogressed and evolved I no longer buy\ntrail running shoes from Under Armor for\nthe\nlooks well there's always tomorrow well\nthat's a good question I think the\naudience would probably already know it\nbut what would be your favorite shoe\nthen like right now all time favorite sh\nobviously the alpha fly all right I know\nsilly one right yeah I mean I don't know\nthe three is pretty great all right so I\ntake either we kind of like earlier when\nwe interviewed Robbie his tip to\npeople was to kind of like manifest like\nwhat you want like he figure out what it\nis that you want and work towards it\nmine was the consistency like if you\nwake up every day and do something\ntowards your goal you're going to get\nthere what would be your recommendation\nfor someone who looks at what you're\ndoing and says\nuh I would love to have created a life\nlike\nthat I\nthink if I had to pick one thing it\nwould probably be surrounding yourself\nwith people that no more can do things\nbetter are smarter stronger or just\npeople that are that's me and Robbie\nyeah so who are you describing this in\nthis scenario like my like my whole life\nlike I said earlier like I've had the\nbest bosses and like I've I consider\nmyself very lucky I also i' it's funny\ncuz I I talked to Megan featherson about\nthis I feel like the harder you work the\nluckier you get and I think I saw that\non a successories poster yeah that\nsounds right and\num but I just and I think part of\nputting yourself around people who have\na really strong work ethic or who have a\nskill set or knowledge that you don't\nhave like that's the best thing you can\ndo and just learn from from people\naround you and I feel like I've been so\nlucky to have been surrounded by people\nthrough every step of my life where I'm\nlike I've learned something from them\nwhether it's a skill or a a trait or or\nwhatever there's just been so many like\ngreat people in my life I do think we\ntake for granted like\njust\nagain we we have a a good core here\nbelieve in the run and and I think that\nthere's no body who is like doesn't want\nto be doing what we're doing like so\nthat you put in that extra time you you\nknow maybe polish a piece you're writing\nif you're Robbie excessively you know\nyou get it like think about it and and\ndo it and we all hold each other also to\nlike a higher standard I think that we\nall check ourselves like if Robbie\ndoesn't like the way a graphic showing\nup on a video he's going to be like hey\nwe need to fix that you're certainly\nlike going to be you know making sure\nlike okay guys we need to have all these\nthings lined up for this and kind of\nlike making sure that we all stay\nfocused on like the main goal are you\nsaying organized that is that is part of\nwhat I'm saying um like I just trust in\nthat at this point like I know that\nyou're like I that's a thing like if I\nhave to the summer like when we go on a\ntrip normally I just I'm like okay Megan\nwill have it I can pack my bag and just\nshow up and I know that she'll tell me\nwhere to there's an itinerary\nspreadsheet that you won't open at all\nthat I have spent time on including all\nthe information you need you don't\nthat's not my learning technique it's\nnot your love\nlanguage certainly not my love language\nuh I get it yeah but I I do think we\ntake for granted that we're in a unique\nposition because everybody here enjoys\nand has like whether or not you're\nalways in love with r running I know\nRobbie's in love with writing and\nwhether or not you're always in love\nwith running which you always are um I\nknow that you have a passion for what\nwe're doing here at believe in the run\nso I know\nthat that's not that's not\nusual yeah that you're surrounded with\npeople so like when you're saying\nsurround yourself with people that's\nthat's tough because I don't think if\nyou're working at a place where people\naren't excited to be doing what they're\ndoing then find a new environment yeah\nyeah like that's an easy one for me\nthere's you can find people look at when\nI was doing those wax molds when I was\n10 years old in the in a factory there\nwas the most enjoyable humans in the\nback that's what always strikes me\nsometimes\nis is uh yeah I've had jobs the same\nsituation where it's it is kind of the\nenvironment and the culture too you can\nwork a bad job or have people who are\nand that's always amazing to me because\nit's people who don't make a lot of\nmoney necessarily like you know what I\nmean they I mean I'm not to say your\nparents didn't pay their employees well\nyou know what I mean but it's not like\nthey're CEOs of companies and they're\nand people are just super content and\nhappy whenever I see some it's always\nlike so crazy to me when I see someone\nat a bus stop or something and they're\nclearly have to take the bus to their\njob maybe the Amazon warehouse whatever\nand they're super nice to you or say hi\nand I'm like see like they're doing\nthey're they have it like I don't know\nit's just like there's something just\nabout being content with Where You Are\nin a way but yeah it depends on the work\njust the culture of the place where\nyou're at too you know and you have to\nhelp cultivate that in some way yeah for\nsure okay so next question okay what are\nyou excited about in\n2025 oh\nman a lot our travel for sure I think\nwe're going to be going to some very\ncool places probably\nTokyo um people keep asking if we're\ngoing to the Tokyo Marathon we not going\nto the Tokyo Marathon yeah something\nelse happening in Tokyo over the summer\nor late summer yeah um also we signed a\ncontract to do some stuff with as6 that\nI'm pretty excited about might have to\ntap into that public speaking that I\ndidn't love so getting out of my comfort\nzone there for sure okay um well you\nknow you'll have to move we're finally\ndoing the runnner roast is that the news\nyes okay it's happening Laura green\nsigned off yeah everyone's getting\nroasted someday it will happen we just\nbe me me and Laura green roasting each\nother\num that's cool though yeah yeah sorry I\ndidn't mean to you on no yeah I think\nthose things I'm excited about I'm just\nand like our team is growing and we're\ngoing to get more into Trail which is\nexciting I it's funny because I'm so\nhesitant to go run Trails but every time\nI do I'm like this is the best thing in\nthe world mhm so yeah it's exciting it's\nit's all positive good stuff yeah um and\nso how do you keep staying in love with\nrunning that's maybe a tip that some\npeople in this room could\nuse and listening um\nI I never regret getting up and going\nfor a run like I always feel better\nafter I go for a run it's like my\nfavorite way to start the day and I\ndon't like when I get up in the morning\nI'm not like oh let's go I can't wait\nI'm like I want to hit the sleep thing\nand back you are normal okay but it's\nit's a habit at this point and it's kind\nof just like I like I know what's coming\nat the end of the run it's the great\nfeeling and like rest of the day feels\nbetter and so that's the motivation that\ngets me actually out of bed but I think\nyou have to do that over and over and\nover again um goes back to Thomas's\nsuggestion of consistency which I think\nis is pretty imperative and then like if\nyou stay somewhat fit it's so much\neasier to try and get really fit whereas\nif you go back to zero it everything\njust feels harder well what about just\nlike because I think environment has\nsomething to do with it we when we\ndecided where we wanted to live the\ntaxes and stuff are high yeah but for\nfor me at least the ability to run\naround the water in the morning and\nexperience kind of like the scenery that\nwe have when we run oh for sure can kind\nof like once I'm out on the run like\nRobbie's asking to stay in in love and I\nguess this is mine but once I'm out\nthere sometimes it's just like you see\nthings and you're up in the city before\nthe city's awake that I think is just\nit's almost for me romantic in a way and\nI don't mean romantic like love romantic\nbut like romantic in the\nlike experiencing life in a it's\nbeautiful yeah like the more like the\nsunrise is beautiful it's it's funny\nbecause I've done a couple doubles with\nthis weird timing where like the sun\ngoes down like 4:30 and so I've been\nable to catch the sunrise and the sunset\na couple days and that's like just like\nit's so simple but it's so beautiful and\nit just like makes your day and believe\nit or not I actually got up this morning\nto run I saw you and did you actually\nsee me see me yeah I was I was running\nup the hill and you came you were ahead\nof me I was going to run after you uh\nwell hold on so I was running through\nthe\ncemetery uh casual and there was a it's\nvery appropo there was a Cooper's hawk\neating a squirrel and it as I was\nrunning towards it I it like flew up in\nthe air and then like caught the\nunderside of its wings\nand uh body and it was like the morning\nsunlight was like on it I'm like dude\nthat's most beautiful thing yeah I was\nlike that was awesome like straight up I\ndon't even know what to say and I was\nlike that's was because I was running\nthis morning it was cool yeah um but I\nwas wearing the mauno Neo Zen Shoe Co\ngood which is very awesome shoe wa it's\nfunny though that um you talk about the\ngetting up and running and and being out\nthere\nearly as for me\nthat's our natural default you'll be\nable to run like you like running in the\nevening just as much as in the morning\nyeah I think when I do it I like running\nin the morning more unless it's the I do\nlike running in the evening in the\nsummertime like like the evening Trail\nruns are probably like that that Vibe um\nbut I always feel better running in the\nmorning and you know I I feel like even\nthe last couple weeks I was kind of in a\ndon't feel like running phase but if I\ndon't run for a few days like I I feel\nhorrible I mean I really feel out of I\nlike I have to actually run now because\nI you have to squeeze out the hate yeah\nit just you feel\nlike not moving your body is weird the\nwhole feeling it's I can't ever actually\nstop running which is sad oh no is there\nanything that I'm tied to this that we\ndidn't ask you that you wanted to answer\ntoday\n[Music]\noh I don't think so is there anything\nthat you feel like people misunderstand\nabout you or don't know about\nyou um I don't think I'm this way\nanymore but I growing up was super quiet\num and that was misinterpreted as being\na\n[\u00a0__\u00a0] especially in high school um but I\ndon't think people I hope people don't\nthink that anymore I'm when I'm quiet\nit's it's because I'm shy it's not\nbecause I'm feeling any other way okay\nfinal final question a lot of people\nthink that um like when I first met you\nI was like oh you're you run pretty good\npace and at that time it was probably\nlike 830s or something like that like\n930s yeah you changed you think I was\nrunning sevens when I start running well\ncuz at that time I was faster and so I\nthought you were faster but um the uh\nbut people think that they see somebody\nwho can run sub three hours and they\nthey they have some special ability or\nare a better athlete or it's natural for\nthem which there are some people who\njust seem to be able to throw on a pair\nof shoes and throw\ndown\nbut we've talked about it what do you\nthink about how\nmuch is that your natural ability and\nhow much is the work that you've put in\nI don't think I have any natural ability\nI know I have some\neveryone I think has some but I like I'm\nnot built like a runner no one in my\nfamily runs I didn't I hated running\ngrowing up like I I really do feel like\nrunning is is very much a mental Sport\nand because I do enjoy it so much that's\nhow I've been able to stick with it and\nget faster and enjoy it the whole time I\nmean it took me 5 years to break three\nhours trying to break three hours for\nwhat I'm getting at is that\nyou've it's not like I think some people\nlook at someone like you and they're\nlike oh she can just do that and you put\nin what I'm trying to get at is the work\nthat you put in yeah it's it's a lot but\nit's you know you call it work and I and\nit is work it's it's hard work but it's\nwhat I enjoy so it's hard for me to look\nat it that way sometimes I think um but\nwhat what I it's not easy for you like\npeople what right do you understand what\nI'm trying to say Roby yeah it's like\nthe workouts are hard like yeah it's\nit's like some people think it's just\nlike you were saying you don't really\nwant to get out of bed and do it people\nI think a lot of people think oh you're\nso into running you just like or you're\nlucky jump into jumping for joy out of\nbed to get to get into the workout and\nthen like when you're do a double you're\nlike thank God I get to do a double\ntoday and yeah and then it just like I\nmean i' and I've seen like trust me I\nknow how much you work at it\nbecause I it seems actually insane to me\nto bang your head against the wall for a\n3-hour marathon running 80 mil a week\nfor however many years or close to 80\nmiles a week and then just to take a\nminute off of a time that's like yeah\nbut that's so much discipline and work\nit really is yeah um yeah I mean it is\nit's it's hard work and it's time I\nthink and\nI was trying to tie it back to you said\nearlier that luck happens the harder you\nwork the luckier you get yeah yeah which\nyeah I I stand by that a lot I\nthink it's like I think I'm more envious\nof you being able to funrun New York\nCity at a 330 Pace than I am of you\nbeing able to run a 241\nMarathon 245 245 Marathon 320 in New\nYork 3 okay sorry but okay kiding but\nthat is the thing it's like which one\nwould I rather have I'd rather be able\nto run New\nYork having a blast you can everyone 320\noh at that pace yeah then running a a\n245 Marathon I think I would rather have\nthe 320 having a good time like if I\ncould run every Marathon fast is having\na good time I'd rather do\nthat yeah I can see that I\nI don't think there's any better feeling\nthough than being super fit like you\njust feel good I don't Robbie do you\nknow what that feels like uh I'm trying\nto recall a moment in my life I think\nwhen I was like nine there was a point\nin time see here's the thing that drives\nme nuts is I put in the discipline I put\nin all the work I do this stuff my coach\nhas me doing as much mileage as my body\ncan handle and I still like like I can't\nthrow down like you can't\nmake I mean I didn't have the best year\nof running I'm coming off of a it's also\nhard because I I I had like two or three\nyears of PRS after PRS and so then when\nyou don't do that for an entire year\nit's slightly disheartening yeah but\nyou're still running wicked good races\nyeah still it's not I me you're not\ngetting what you're hoping to get out of\nit I guess yeah and I didn't I didn't\nnecessarily H like think that of that\nwas going to happen but it's it is hard\nto think like oh my Marathon PR is now\nover a year old like that doesn't seem\nthat long ago but it is it's like over a\nyear and it's\nlike but I think it's it's good and like\nto your point Robbie like no I'm not\nalways like motivated to get out the\ndoor and in fact like right now I'm not\neven motivated to like run fast so and I\nbut I think those es and flows are just\npart of it too like you can't always be\non yeah or you'll burn out\nI\nthink yeah no I do but I do like how you\nhave fine-tuned like every single aspect\nor try to over the years where like your\nnutrition your hydration your workouts\nyour like\neverything except for the drinking no\nexcept for party you don't party that\nmuch you have fun when you have fun um\nbut then like for me I always feel like\nI've left stuff on the table you know\nbecause I'm\nlike I if I did all of those things and\nreally really focus I could probably I\nknow I could be a lot don't you feel\nlike everybody thinks that though like I\nI would but I know it is because I don't\ndo those things like I'm not new like I\ndon't have a good nutrition plan or like\nas far as like my weekly I get it like\nlife but you've dialed in all those\nthings which is it shows but and and it\nshows when I was doing all those things\nand I know like I'm not like I'm not di\nI'm\nnot right now I'm going to flip side\nthat for you though I do all the same\nstuff that Megan does yeah dialed it all\nin\nnutrition\nmileage doing it all and I don't see the\nsame results so like as much as people\nthink they might be leaving something on\nthe table you might\nnot yeah no I know I know you can I know\nwhen I do I know when I\ndo do some of those things that it like\ndoes show results\nso like when I was oh my workouts though\nmy workouts show the results yeah it's\nrace day just and I don't know that\ncould be something else yeah um haven't\ndialed in that psychology yet yeah get\nEmily sa\nback anyways yeah I'm trying to think if\nthere's anything else that want to ask\nor forgot I'm sure there's like a\nmillion things I'll think about later\nwhy don't I talk about that attached to\nthis should be the pizza recipe the\nbagel recipe and your pretzel re great\ndo you find is that your other love is\ncooking my love for her is the cooking I\ndo feel like it's a really good thing\nfor me and that it's like I'm not\nlooking at a screen I'm not it's and\nit's like almost therapeutic where it's\nlike I'm creating something and I'm\nalways just feeding people so that's\nnice yeah making other people happy yeah\nme yeah primarily do you Thomas do you\nthink if Meg um ever like if she wasn't\nin your life do you think you would be\nalive right now yeah I I know exactly\nwhat it would be\nlike would you be able I mean we might\nfind out soon I don't know M would you\nbe able to survive yeah I I survive\nquite well I'm a here's here's the thing\nI am a cognitive offloader cognitive\nwhat is that that mean means that if I\ncan offload anything to someone else so\nthat I can concentrate what's important\nfor me yeah then I will do that okay and\nso uh for an\nexample if I had to cook or cook for the\nboys if if Megan was like I I'm not into\nthis then I I know I figure it out right\nI'm not a helpless person but when Megan\nis when Megan's going to make fresh\npizza dough on a Friday morning before\nwe go out out for a run and then when we\nget home she's you know got it all set\nup to go into the pizza oven and all\nthat stuff yeah why am I going to fight\nthat I mean that's fair yeah that's a\ngood point and then Saturday morning\nthere's you know Bagels Bagels dough\nrising and then boiling it up so yeah U\nno yeah obviously I'm blessed to have\nsomeone with so many talents and uh\nthings in my life but I think that's\npart of the reason why initially uh\nMegan and I got together was that\nthey're the cognitive offloading not\njust the cognitive offloading but I mean\nto a certain degree yeah but the yin the\nyin and yang of of how we operate yeah\nso I don't know I think\nthat yeah for I mean it's your your\nthing but for me oh you know what what I\nwant to ask is it weird to be\nworking so this is actually interesting\nbecause I talked about this when I was\nwhen I was I was talking about being in\nthe band I said you know there's no one\nin your life you're really next to like\nall 24 hours a day because most people\nthey like my wife works at different job\nI work different job everything so but\nyou guys work the same job and live\ntogether and obviously CU you're married\nand everything else so you are you\nreally are next to each other 24 hours a\nday so is that is that does that get is\nthat different I don't know like I don't\nfeel like we are together okay like for\nme uh and I don't know I'll let Megan\nanswer for herself but for\nme when we're at work that it feels like\nthere's a like like it's not the same\nperson okay um and\nthen when we're at home like even to\nthat degree Megan could be working on\nstuff downstairs I'll be upstairs she\ncould be working you know cooking and\nI'm driving the boys uh and doing that\nstuff so I don't like honestly I feel\nlike I I wish I had more time with Megan\nyeah but it's not like you're living a\nvan life or whatever no like like it's\nalmost to the point like yeah when we go\non trips like we don't take vacations we\ndon't really do date nights so like it's\nnot like I have uh that style of stuff\nso even when we go on these trips for\nwork it's not like a vacation with your\nspouse right so as a matter of fact if\nmy one complaint I'd say that hey that's\nwe need to work on that side of side of\nstuff yeah yeah no I mean I feel you is\nthat is that do you have similar yeah I\nmean it it does feel it's like I said\nlike I grew up with parents that work\ntogether too so it doesn't feel that\nweird and it's almost like it's just\nwhat I'm used to so it feels normal like\nit doesn't feel\nweird and then there's Ralphie that's a\nwhole other thing Ralphie's the best is\nhe in here he would have been on your\nlap for sure he's done two really messed\nup things the past two nights oh really\nwoke me up at 1:00 a.m. crying at the\ndoor like he had to go out waited till I\ngot up walked over to the door and\nopened it sprinted over to the bed and\njumped into where I was sleeping what a\njerk he's getting smart yeah so then\nthat worked so what did he do last night\nso last night he just got up to go take\na pee in the middle of the night that's\nnot an emergency he didn't do that you\ncan hold that no and he never he's\nalways slept through the night unless\nmaybe he's got a prostate problem no\nhe's just getting needy yeah um anyway\nall right so that's about sums that up\nyeah that's I I think we covered almost\neverything I'm G to think of so many\nthings but it's fine well I do think\nthat all of us when Robbie after you\nfinished your there's probably stuff\nthat you felt you left out yeah I I went\nuh total like blackout in my brain after\na certain point in our so I don't even\nknow I'm going to have to rewatch I'm\ngoing to have to listen because I'm sure\nI left the\nwhat I guess it didn't ask the last\nthing was what was your what's been your\nfavorite because you asked me that I\nthink what was your favorite memory of\nbelieve in the run or thing that we got\nto\ndo I think it might have to be the\nOlympics in Paris yeah just cuz that's\nnot something I ever thought that I\nwould experience in real life mhm\num yeah I mean just thinking about this\nyear alone is crazy\nlike Venice\nBerlin I mean I think the craziest thing\nis the fact that you can do a hydration\ntour like it's a tour about hydrating\nthat's insane that I that I pitched in\nan email randomly not expecting a\nresponse from right and but hundreds of\npeople show up yeah in freaking all\nsorts of cities Shaunie Oklahoma or\nsomething I don't know that was not it\nbut close yeah St Louis did you do St\nLouis uh Oklahoma City Oklahoma City uh\nbut yeah that's amazing yeah yeah it's\nall good it's\ncool all right anything else uh no it's\nup to you Meg you got you got anything\nelse you want to add no this has been\ngreat guys thanks for having me on all\nright say bye bye ma bye Ma sorry about\nhigh school\na\n[Music]\n[Applause]",

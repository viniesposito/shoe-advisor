  "text": "[Music]\nall right so this is our first time\ndoing a live Q&A like this I think so\nwe'll see how it goes it'll be probably\na train wre to some degree but if anyone\nwants to come in and hang out sit down\nover here it' be way less awkward so you\nshould probably do that thank you it's\nlike a p like a campfire type situation\nover here nice and cozy without without\nbanjos yeah yeah I mean it's a little\nbit of uh a little bit of that but um\nwe're excited to talk to Scott today\nScott welcome thank you it's great to be\nhere yeah um and if anybody I think we\nwe'll do a little bit of an interview\nand then we'll do a Q&A afterwards have\nif you have any questions I'm sure\nthere's burning questions of everyone in\nthe crowd so if that sounds good we can\njust kick it off good all right all\nright so we're here with uh cover i w\nsay Cover Girl I guess cover boy Scott\njurrick cover cover man last time I\nchecked anyways yeah on the uh the\nnewest cover of the possessed um number\n58 number 58 z i I like to call it a Zen\neven though it's more of a newspaper Zen\nbut um I'm excited to talk to you Scott\nI read the interview we both read the\ninterview and uh glean some useful\ninformation about you and your\nbackground and growing up so maybe let's\njust kick it off that way where tell\neveryone where you're from where your\nroots are I feel like that's pretty\nimportant to where we are\nnow so uh I'm originally from northern\nMinnesota and uh I'm basically up near\nCanada like I was closer to Canada than\nI was closer to Minneapolis St Paul so\nNorthern Minnesota we take pride in\nbeing Northerners and we're kind of like\nwe do our own thing I grew up total\nredneck hunting fishing I know it's\ncrazy people think you know this vegan\nhow how was he a redneck but I grew up\nhunting and fishing and spending a lot\nof time Outdoors like waiting for fish\nto bite in the middle of the dead of\nwinter so so I got to be honest I read\nthat in the article and my goal for\ntoday was just to turn this into a\nfishing podcast so I talk fishing I\ndon't know if we can do that but I did\nwant to ask what species you would fish\nfor as a kid what were your favorite\nthings to catch anything that I could\ncatch I mean I literally would do that\nlike I love catching I mean walleye are\namazing\nnorthern pike is probably a nice but we\nused to go out in this little tiny boat\nand sorry all you fellow vegans I'm\ngoing to talk a little bit about fishing\nbut um cuz it's some of my like Fondest\nMemories like spending time outdoors and\neven though at the time was a kid we'd\nsit out in this tiny boat on the out and\nanybody knows Lake Superior I grew up\nabout 20 mi from Lake Superior oh wow\nit's this basically giant ocean that's\nfreshwater and we would sit on this tiny\nlittle boat and just hope these like\nsalmon and trout would bite and when\nthey did it was I I knew I I wasn't even\nable to like pull them in that's how\nlike strong they are and like yeah we'd\ngo out but the the craziest part was\nactually getting out there and hoping\nthat we wouldn't capsized like yeah my\nuncle was wild and crazy I just had yeah\nwild family members who just like take\nus out and do this stuff and I was like\nwhoa like are we going to capsize out\nhere so like looking back in hindsight\ndo you feel like that that kind of wild\nSpirit of northern Minnesota is embedded\nin you and whether you knew it or not\nwas part of your DNA that came out in\nultra running and trail\nrunning I do like to C I think part of\nmy background growing up where I did\nlike out in the woods away from all my\nfriends 5 miles from town uh I learned\nto just like find joy and spending time\nin the Backwoods and just building forts\nrunning around on the trails that I\nwould build tree forts you name it like\nit was my escape and it was also like my\nrefuge um so if you could have both\nthings it was like\na pleasant spot and then just times\nwhere I'd like lay out in the woods and\nlike you know mosquitoes would be biting\nme like crazy but like it just it was\nlike home and it just formed me I think\nit helped prepare me for a life of ultra\nrunning yeah it's kind of interesting\nbecause when I was a kid and doing Forts\nand doing all that stuff out in the\nBackwoods I was also getting into\ntrouble like it wasn't necessarily all\nyou know Stephen King Stand By Me uh\nkind of stuff how did you get into\ntrouble back then and what what what was\nyour driving uh way of having fun out in\nthe\nwoods you know I wish I grew up in a\nmilitary family so like I a lot of my\nfamily members including my father they\nweren't cool like you knew was\ngoing to hit the fan if Dad came home\nand like you know stuff had burnt down\nlike but playing with matches I was a\npyro like I love to play with matches\nand so I feel you if I were if I were to\nget in trouble it was probably like\nstarting some on fire and but I\nalso had grandfathers and uncles who\nwould start stuff like we'd have these\ncrazy bonfires like we we burnt our\ntrash in like metal barrels and stuff\nlike that so stuff that's not like cool\nanymore but I I also had to burn my\ntrash as a chore for a child so that\nshows you where I grew up to uh did you\ndo pallet fires where you took old\nwooded pallets and piled them up see we\ndidn't have access to those it was just\nlike find any piece of wood could throw\nit on and just keep it going and yeah we\nhave and as a kid it was like so much\nfun I just remember that I feel like\nblowing anything up as man I'm really uh\nI allow to say this publicly uh I mean\nyou just take you know take the spray\npaint can throw it in the fire see what\nhappens I mean we used a lot of\nflammable liquids to get things going\nyeah so but yeah spray cans were\ndefinitely that was closer to bomb\nexplosive category and explosives\nweren't quite as cool see this is a\nrunning podcast by the way we are uh\ncovering all things running which you\nknow you got to you got to have some\nrisk and danger when it comes to trail\nrunning depends depends where you're at\nso I think it's all part of the equation\num so yeah and so you grew up in\nMinnesota you got into trail running you\nyou did trail run as a kid but then you\nkind of took a break or found your way\nback to it in a way um how did it come\nback to\nyou I guess the biggest way it came back\nto me was I I would run as a kid out on\nthese Trails but only pretending I was\nlike on a horse and I I was always like\nI was always a Native American like\nIndians were the coolest my mind\nlike the Cowboys weren't as cool sorry\nall you Cowboys here in Texas but I see\nthose bu eyes I um yeah I just it always\nresonated with me and I would just\nremember like that joy and that Joy\ndidn't come back again until after all\nthe years of playing team sports where\nwe'd run laps for punishment and even\nthe cross country races I did at in\nfourth grade fifth grade sixth grade\nwhich I came in second place the cross\ncountry coach was always trying to get\nme to come out for cross country and I'd\nbe like nah I'm not going to do it like\njust not just didn't love it and I don't\nknow whether it was because it was a\npunishment activity before but it really\nwasn't until I got into college and I\nhad some friends who like they were\nhippies they were outcasts they were\ncharacters and they showed me like the\nway in terms of like trail running can\nbe fun and then some of them told me\nabout these ultas and it wasn't until I\nmaybe connected my past and that joy\nthat I had as a kid and how I played\nwith this activity now that was no long\nlonger punishment those long hours of\nNordic ski training is really where it\nresonated with me we go for 3 4 hours\nand I was like very close to what I did\nhunting and fishing like spending all\nday out in the woods yeah you seem like\na really nice guy and you're telling us\nthe stories about how it was fun to be\nout there on the horses and running on\nthe trails none of that sounds\ncompetitive at some point a competitive\nswitch happened like how did that come\nabout are you like a really nice guy and\nthen as soon as this gun goes off things\nchange\nI had polish grandparents who lived\nthrough the Great Depression\nso they definitely were hard asses my\ndad was like so I think competitively\nlike it was like okay how fast can you\nstack wood how fast can you like do so\nwe do like just I guess like hard labor\ngames and that's how I got my\ncompetitive mode and so yeah I seem like\nMr Nice Guy but when it comes to like a\nrace or a competition I see my daughter\nright now I'm just like holy like\nhow did she get so competitive cuz I\nswear to god like people think like\nScott jerk's grooming his daughter and\nlike my wife is like cuz she's like\nJapanese American they're just like\nturning I I like to say my kids are\npolish\nSamurai and like they have this stubborn\nand like just hard like compe and I'm\nlike I'm not doing this but I have to\nlike nobody believes me but like that's\nhow I just it was imbued in Me by having\ngrandparents who made me do the things\nthat I didn't want to do all the time\nand be like I don't care if you want to\ndo this you're doing it now and like\nthere was this competition of like okay\nI'm going to do it and it had to be done\nright and just like that trial and that\nthat's where the competition came and it\nit was like later it was like to prove a\npoint and those of you know like for\nbetter for worse like I don't know I\nused to do stuff I'm not always like\nproud of but like we used to talk\nall the time I remember on Race courses\nlike back in the day I talk about ultr\nrunning as being you know how is out in\nthe audience and I like we used to talk\nso much and like just give each\nother a hard time and nowadays it's like\noh you can't say anything like that cuz\nthat you know you can't say that I mean\nobviously people say anything they want\nonline but um there's too much Mr and Ms\nand Miss nice guy kind of attitude so I\nmean I spend a lot of time listening to\nJenny's voice cuz I listen to the north\nand it's kind of uh interesting to me\nthat you guys are so close and you do\nall these things\ntogether is there is she want to be as\ncompetitive as you are in support of you\nlike is she pushing you she definitely\ndoes like it's so funny like for her own\nself though like she's so like people\nare whoo she's super hard on SC like you\nknow she wants to like see me go to the\nbrink and then sometimes she's like whoa\nlike maybe we push them too far um but I\ndo appreciate it in her and then she's\nalso somebody who she doesn't like to\nhurt herself as much like she can do\namazing things like she's a we're\ntalking about like talk about cut off or\nlike basically get under the the time\nlimit type of individual and I've seen\nher go to some places that are just as\nhard of the things that I do so I think\nshe knows like what that takes she may\nnot want to hurt as much or like maybe\nshe just wants to hurt longer for the\nstuff that she does like get her money's\nworth but it's so funny cuz yeah she can\nbe sometimes some just like damn like\nyou're so hard on like but it's that I\nthink that tough love sometimes and then\nturning that off and being somebody who\ncan be there and I think that's always\nthat fine line that we try to like\npractice in life and I mean we're all\nlearning about that and like how far do\nwe go and when do we pull back and yeah\nit's like this give or take and this\nbalancing act that you do because yeah\nso one of the things you talk about in\nthe interview um of possessed is this\nidea that you've gotten older you're\npast you're you're not winning Western\nState seven times in a row anymore uh\nand you're moving into a different phase\nof your running career or what that\nlooks like as far as challenges or what\nrunning or trail running or ultra\nrunning means to you and can you tell me\nabout how that transition happened was\nthat a natural thing or is that\nsomething you had to be intentional\nabout and choose like a path that you\nhad to choose to go down or did you kind\nof was it something that happened\nnaturally where things just kind of fell\ntogether that way well first off I mean\ndidn't you read the magazine like I'm\nstill winning Western States yeah oh I\nforgot I'm sorry it must have been a bad\nedit that I got so yeah my bad no um no\nI'm not reincarnating myself as uh young\nJim Wamsley but uh yeah it's a good yeah\nthere's some conspiracy theories out\nthere you might be living in multiple\ntimelines that are parallel um but to be\nserious and answer the question I think\nit\nreally a lot of times people use the\nword retirement and like there's an end\npoint and obviously I know like I'm not\ngoing to win Western States again that's\nnot that's not going to happen um nor do\nI like want to necessarily run that race\nbut there comes a point where not the\nwriting is on the wall but for me I\nstarted to get you know what what do I\ndo next do I need to keep striving I\nstarted second guessing myself and I\nthink that's a point where not the big\nRW in terms of retirement happens\nbut you for me it's like I made peace\nwith like where I'm at as an athlete as\nwell as like do I want to go to those\nplaces anymore and it's like that's not\na good place if you're try like I went\nback to Leadville I think in 201 this is\nwhere Jenny will get me like we WR\nabout it in north and like she was like\nwhoa where's the Scott jurich that I am\nused to seeing like who just like fights\nit and I was like fine just like phoning\nit in and just like cruise on in I'm\nlike I'm good like whatever happened she\nwas like no way are you doing this and\nfor me I think there's that fine line of\nlike being driven to do something but\nthen if you second guess it yeah um it\njust started to be like not as fun and I\nwas like not trying to do things because\nI needed to do them but I just didn't\nhave my heart in it in the same place\nand that that's a hard thing as a top\nlevel athlete to be like I know I could\nstill do these things but I'm starting\nto second guess why do I do this why why\ndo I keep doing this when I could like\nCruise in or I could just keep running\non the trails and you know doing the fun\nthings I love to do with this sport um\nso that's I think I didn't make a\nconscious decision but more like okay my\nheart is in the game that's why doing\nthings like the Appalachian Trail it's\nlike finding things that still Peak my\ninterest that encourage me to go to the\nlengths that one needs to go to yeah can\nwe talk a little bit about ultra running\nin general because back in I'd say in\nthe preborn to run days there wasn't it\nwasn't as big of a sport as it is now\nthere weren't as many people out there\ndoing it matter of fact you could\nprobably count the people on one hand\nthat were doing 50 to 100 miles and more\nuh races and now you look and it's\nalmost like it's the evolution people\nrun a marathon they do a 50k the 50 mile\n100 what's the biggest change in the\nsport that you've seen and where do you\nsee it going in the future knowing what\nyou've seen in the\npast yeah I was talking to Hell ker\ntoday a little bit about like that in\nterms of like where is the sport going\nlike is it continuing to grow in\nSkyrocket like it has or are we reaching\nthis like Plateau or like es and flows\nof like you know how many people want to\ndo this stuff I let's be real it's not\neasy to go out and run 100 miles\nregardless of you're trying to just you\nknow make the cut off or if you're\ntrying to win and so I think\nfor what's most I think different I mean\nI don't know I mean to be honest I don't\nthink anything's really changed there's\na lot of peripheral changes and like\nwindow dressing that's changed but at\nthe core the sport is the same cuz if\nyou want to run 100 miles a you're going\nto work your tail off and B it's um it's\nnot for everybody and if it you know\nit's going to grow but I think it's\nstill going to be the special thing that\nwe hold on to and I think that's that's\nthe magic there is letting people\ndiscover what what's out there for them\nlike what is and we're all going to keep\nask I mean I'm still asking that's why\nlike I don't even like to say I'm\ntotally retired because like what is out\nthere in the sport that I'm still\ninterested in what how do I want to so I\nwant to it's a lifestyle and I think\nmore than anything regardless of all the\nthings you know people gripe about oh\nthe races are getting too you know too\nbig there's too much money in it now um\non the competitive side like oh we got a\ndrug test now there's like money for\nathletes and then on the other side be\nlike oh race directors are getting money\nhungry um and everyone gripes about\ngetting into races is so hard like those\nthings are happening but when the start\ngun goes off it's still the same Sport\nand so I like to look at it there's a\nbright future still with running and\nit's still going to be out it's still\ngoing to be Fringe I think that's what\npossessed magazine is is highlighting\nit's very Fringe like again I mean\neverybody's not going to I know Born to\nRun made people think they all want to\nrun ultramarathons but not everybody is\nactually going to put the time and\neffort and I think that's the beauty and\nthe magic of running in general is that\nsomething is going to Spur somebody to\nget off the couch do something different\ndo something they never thought in their\nWildest Dreams whether it's running 100\nmiles or running around the block and\nthat magic is out there for everyone and\nit's so accessible too all right so I'm\nguessing like with you going from a\ncompetitive mindset and trying to run\nthese races as fast as you can it's kind\nof like head down and cruising and and\njust doing that what are some of the\nthings that you've learned like in maybe\nslowing down or approaching races\ndifferently like what is the next step\nif you can give somebody advice who's\ngoing from highly competitive to maybe\nfinding like joy in doing something like\nthe Appalachian Trail or something like\nthat\nI mean I don't know if I've got a great\nanswer for that because it's different\ntalking to somebody like say Jim Wamsley\nlike like what I remember talking to him\na couple years back and he was like yeah\nI don't know if I want to do this I\ndon't know if I want to like you know\nwin Western States seven times like\neverybody's in it for something\ndifferent like some people are like hey\nI want to get the best out of myself for\nfour years 5 years 6 years and then\nmaybe do something else and like come in\nand out of it um so I think it really\nreally comes down to like what what do\nyou want to get out of it at what point\ndo you segue and I don't know there Leed\nto be for me for me it was I don't know\nlike it was fun just playing it like\ntrying to crash and burn like one of my\nmentors one of my heroes was uh Eric\nClifton and Eric anybody knows Eric\nClifton or heard about him there's just\nall these characters Eric was the guy\nwho showed up in like 5K racing Flats\nafter running on the track Barefoot for\n10 mies that was his thing every year\nMountain Mass Mountain masus he would\nrun on a track for 10 Mi Barefoot and\nthen show up in his racing flats take it\nout at like you know 5:30 Pace running a\n50 mile and granted we start on a road\nbut he would like literally like as if\nhe was going to run a marathon or\nsomething shorter and he would just go\nout go For Broke and so a lot of us\nplayed with that like going for broke\nand just Hammer from the Geto try to\nhang on and see how far you could get\nand then you get more strategic over the\nyears so for me it evolved into like\ntrying to be more strategic learn more\nabout like what I could do with my body\nwhat I could do in training what I could\ndo for fueling nutrition hydration and\njust like put all of that together so I\ngot to I think there's the Ethereal like\nmetaphysical side of ultr running and I\nwas way into that aspect but then I was\nway into the science too so it's funny\nlike now things resurface like you know\nhyper carbo loading or carb you know in\nhyper carb consumption whatever you want\nto call it like that was stuff that I\nwas tinkering with way back in the day\ncuz a lot of people wouldn't eat a lot\nand I was people are like who you're\neating all of that in an hour and it was\nlike we were we were doing this stuff so\nwe were experimenting a lot and I think\nthat's what was cool about it that's\namazing um so we'll uh start the Q&A\nhere in a little bit but I did want to\nask\nyou you know obviously you had your\nlittle your playlist from when you were\nyounger in the in the magazine so you\nget threw out some of your uh Glam Rock\nhair metal hits uh from the from the 80s\nwhat since we are operating on a karaoke\nstyle machine I'm not going to ask you\nto do karaoke but if you were to do\nkaraoke right now what would be your\ngo-to\nsong like from that era any any song Oh\nany okay all right I thought you were\ngoing to like we will judge you if you\nsay a Taylor Swift song I me throw out\nsome Twisted Sister or like Quiet Riot\nlike it was definitely a throwback so\nagain Jenny was really worried like\neveryone's going to think who reads the\nmagazine that I actually listen into\nthis stuff um and I know there's a big\nyeah Metals having a Resurgence but um I\nwouldn't be able to probably do that but\nmaybe I maybe I could throw down on some\nof that I would say my go-to for karaoke\nis Painted Black okay Stones classic and\nuh I know it's seems but that's my I was\ngoing to say d Snider On karaoke might\nbe a difficult ask so you might want to\nyeah painted black seems a little more\ndoable than some Twisted Sister but all\nright that's that's my gotoo but I have\nyou know I have others you know that I\ncan all right have to we might have to\nfind a karaoke bar in Austin so someone\ngive us a tip on where to go um and last\nthing well I have a personal question I\ngrew up near the application Trail my\nparents still live there so every now\nand then uh I'll hit it up but this is\nin\nPennsylvania uh any tips for trying to\nrun on a trail that's actually just a\npile of rocks because you did 55 m a day\non that section I think around that\nwhich still blows my mind so if you have\nany tips especially for someone with\nterrible ankles it would be much\nappreciated yeah Rock Sylvania as it's\ncalled um yeah you know I actually had\nmy best some of my best I did 59 miles\num as like my high in in rock Sania and\nI think really it's just about like I\nmentioned like going for broke and just\nlike going for it that's I'm a big\nbeliever and like sometimes you just got\nto throw yourself into the fire that's\nwhat Ultras are all about I do I can't I\nliterally can't even I would say yeah\nthrow yourself Into the Fire and you\njust you got to do it repetitively like\nthe only way you get confident on rocks\nand there's no doubt like there are\nstretches in there where you just like\nit's like it literally is nothing but a\nrock file I mean there's there's Legends\nwhere they they they talk about all the\nPennsylvania like Trail clubs would\nactually go out with wheelbarrows and\nactually take the Rocks cuz if you look\nat it Carl Meltzer would just be like\ndude if you look at it there's rocks you\nknow right down the trouble there's none\nhere there's none there just down where\nthey put it like that's what's so\nconfusing is that the trail is just\nrocks but they everything around it so\nhe's just like and so there's I don't\nknow whether it's Urban myth urban\nlegend whatever you want to call it\nthere's literally like it just seems\nlike they've taken wheelbarrow loads of\nrocks and just thrown on there you know\nevery which is cool about the at and we\nyou know again what Ultra culture and\nTrail culture is is these like stories\nand characters and like everyone is\nproud of their section of the at and it\nhas like reputation and there's so much\ntradition and that's what I love about\nthe sport uh ultra running trail running\nis that there's this history and\ntradition behind it and I think that's\nlost nowadays with social media it's\nlike what if it didn't happen the last\nyear 2 years or even sometimes the last\nmonth it it it's forgotten so it's like\nyou got to bring that back so I would\nsay just get out there more practice on\nit all right subject yourself to the\nRocks it's got to be like Mogul like\nit's it's Mogul right you get better at\nit and the more miles you have on your\nlegs after a while you don't care the\nmore times you fall the less the less\nyou actually care about falling than\nyeah work on it work on it I'll send you\nmy hospital\nbill uh Q&A time yeah let's do it all\nright who's up any questions anyone or\nwe'll take roast we can take roast yeah\nyeah we\nde saw\ncom kind of excited about sport what\nraces are you about what long trails are\nyou still curious about\num so the question was what what am I\nmost curious about um I guess being\nembedded in the community that's why I\ngo out and help friends or guide blind\nRunners like I get excited about seeing\nit from a different vantage point and to\nme that's so valuable I think there's so\nmany athletes like they stop doing their\ntheir passion or I guess some people\nlook at as occupation or whatever art\nbut for me it's like I still want to be\nembedded in I want to be embedded in it\nyou know till the day I can't anymore I\nwas hanging out with uh Rob McNair those\nof you from Southern California may have\nheard of uh Rob McNair he used to hold\nall the 50k course records down in SoCal\nand he's from Huntington Beach and I saw\nhim at Havalina he's 70 years old 70\nyears young 70 years young and he's like\ngosh Scotty I remember when you know you\nwere 20 I was 40 and we'd just be like\nhammering each other and like that's the\nstuff that I you know he's got like a\nbroken back fused spinals columns and\nsections and he's like out there helping\na buddy and he's you know doesn't he has\na flip phone no texting and it's like\nstories like that like connecting with\nit and reminding myself what I want to\ndo with it so the things that get me\nexcited um I was helping Jeff uh\nBrowning so Bronco Billy out on the CT\nI've always wanted to do the CT it's\nlike it's my home course in a way um so\nthere's there's a lot of those things\nwhere I'm like I just got to make it\nhappen you know I turned 50 recently and\nlike the writing's on the wall like okay\nif I'm going to do these things I got to\ndo them now and so it gets me fired up\nand then Hela came out for a week of\njerk boot camp in Boulder so over five\ndays we ran 80 miles and I'm like okay\nlike I can just rip off 80 miles and I\nfeel pretty good and like gets me\nexcited so yeah there's more to come so\nyeah\nnext someone has a question they're all\nsilent\nyeah you're you're a really good writer\nspot who was like you have any literary\ninfluences who do you look up to when\nyou're\nwriting can you tell us a little bit\nabout your process writing and what\ninspires you yeah it's a good question\num I don't know sometimes I think I'm\nnot a good writer it's like not it's\nit's not what I like went to school for\nlike whatever but I've learned how to\nlike love the process so for me\nsometimes and the more writers I talk to\nI'd be like this is so hard this is like\nhard like I'd rather be out running\nthan doing this um and I think that's\nwhat intrigued me is the process is so\nhard for me um I didn't grow up with\nthis like literary bone so I like\nthrowback to college I loved reading\nlike dovi like like it it's hard stuff\nbut crime and punishment I used to read\nthat stuff like I don't know maybe again\nI'm from Northern Minnesota so I could\nrelate to like stories like that but um\nthat and then but when I was out in the\nNorthwest Tom Robins he's one of my\nfavorites like he just weaves these\nstories that are just so wacky in wild\nand I think having lived in the Pacific\nNorthwest it was a lot about Seattle and\nthese just crazy story lines that\nconverge um like super cool so I I think\nthose would be like two of my um writers\nI know they're in opposite ends of\nspectrum but Russian literature versus\nsomebody who writes like wild wacky\nfiction um but I think more than\nanything it's I I remember when we were\nwriting North I'd come home after 4\nhours at the coffee shop writing and\nJenny would be like what you got a page\nand a half for 4 hours and uh it's a lot\nlike running Ultras it's like this slow\ntedious process and when you come home\nwith a page and a half you know like\nmaybe half a page is good and it can be\njust really like a grind to get there\nbut I think that's for ultra running as\nTommy but I love when things do flow and\nit's like okay I wrote some good\nthere and then the editor like comes\nback like oh actually it's better to do\nthis so it's like this tinkering with\nlike a process that's fascinating for me\nbut it's hard to sit in front of a you\nknow typewriter write on paper um and so\nI respect writers and then some of my\nbuddies who like write like full-time\nthat's what they went to school for\nthey're like nobody likes this like\nwe all we all hate deadlines I'm like\nbut you guys must love writing like you\nknow it's just like musicians like you\nmust love playing music you must love\nwriting music and a lot I have not yet\nto find a writer who says I love to\nwrite like I think they like when\nthey're in the flow state of getting it\ndown but yeah it's fascinating like I I\ndon't know maybe there's somebody out\nthere that loves it but it it's hard\nwork it's it's really like just mentally\ndraining but um it's still really cool\nso those of you who write like hats off\nto everyone who does it cuz yeah and to\nbe really efficient now it's like\neveryone expects you to write really\nquick yeah um I remember doing pieces\nfor the magazine actually um and just\nbeing like Oh God this reminds me of\nbeing on Deadline mode cuz we were we\npulled pulled this off very quickly and\nI had to write a recipe a playlist and\nlike put together these like intros and\nI was like oh man like this is like and\nwith a big deadline of like looming out\nthere so um which I appreciate like if\nyou don't have deadlines you don't get\n done um and yeah you just got to go\npedal to the metal sometimes all\nnighters and that's what Jenny and I did\non north um so it was a lot of yeah I\ndon't know how we stayed together after\nthat like I think the at was way easier\nthan uh writing that book like am yeah\ndon't um don't write a book with your\npartner or\nuh spouse because or or if you do if you\nsurvive that then you've got something\ngood all right should we wrap it up Max\nMax got yeah all right thanks Scott um I\njust have one question about looking\nback on your career is there any like\none specific race that you're most proud\nof or is it like just the consistency of\nthe results of Western States for some\nmany years or is it the setting the\nrecord on at on the at or is it maybe\nsome race that would really expect but\nlooking back like I guess what are you\nmost proud of from your it's a good\nquestion um cuz after a while things\nkind of like blur together and when you\nhave a long career and you you're able\nto like turn out results um I think\nsometimes I like how do you pick one um\nbut I'd have to say like on one Spectrum\nthe at was on another level because\nbattling and like working with the trail\nand working with all these things that\nwere happening and being able to pull\nthat off like it's just it was like it\nwas like an epic Tome versus like\nWestern States like I'd have to say 2020\nI mean sorry um 2004 when I set the\nrecord because for so many years I was\ntrying to chip away and when I look back\nat my early times I'm like damn that's\nso slow I I look back at it um but it\nwas the process to get where I got to\nget to 20 2004 when I got down to 1536\nand I think that was so special because\nyou know Dave Mackey was pushing me like\nit was just on paper it doesn't look\nlike it was an epic duel but um we\nreally pushed each other along with the\nother athletes out there like Hal was\nrunning that year I mean it just kind of\nall like sometimes comes together and\nthat race um despite it going up and\ndown um things came together and yeah\nMike Morton was a big hero of mine and\nbe like yes another non-california male\nto win that race is uh super cool so got\nto say that one but even my first 50\nmile like I I credit that even though\nthough it wasn't like this Pinnacle of\nmy career it got me to where I was you\nknow where I am today really like if I\nhadn't run that 50 mile the Minnesota\nVoyager and just been like why why would\nI ever do one of those it was horrible\nlike finishing that race say like okay\nyeah kind of cool but that sucked like\nand finishing second you would think\nlike oh man you finished second like you\nshould be psyched I remember just being\nlike no way never again um but I got a\ncredit it's like it got me out there and\ndoing something and it was all the wacky\nNorthern minnesotans that that did help\nme as well just like you got to do this\nthing um so yeah with a family that was\nsaying like why would you ever do like\nthey were just like why would you run 50\nmiles through the woods like they just\ndid not understand that I think I\nactually got to run a 50- mile with Hal\nuh in California for the north V\nChallenge and uh it was it ended my\nwife's she did her first 50 mile and her\nlast 50 mile on that course so\nit we weren't ready for it I mean no one\nis I think it can only be so ready for\nthese things and that's what's so\nmagical about the run but specifically\nthe ultra run and 50 miles so yeah if\nyou shared a course with Hal like 50\nmiles like when I say shared a course he\nlike finished when I that's right you\nshared it though you you were still out\nthere yeah and I think that is the\nbeauty like I think you know ultra\nrunning is at a Crossroads roads where\nmaybe the elites won't always be able to\nlike just with numbers and such be able\nto run the same day like we might might\nsee some of those changes um I'm just\nkind of thinking in my mind like where I\npossibly the sport might go but you're\nstill going to cover the same course and\nthat's pretty cool but how do we like\nget enough people on the course so that\nyou can still battle fact Trail runs\nright how many people can get out there\non a single track exactly and uh\nEveryone likes to be but it's not like a\nBoston Marathon where you can run you\nknow tens of thousands tens of thousands\nof people or a New York City marathon\nlike it's just it's not as conducive to\nthat so do you have to two days of\nracing do you have to have separate I\ndon't know it's it's a real turning\npoint I think in our sport but\ninteresting yeah that's for another day\nmaybe that won't even happen in my\nlifetime I that it will the cool thing\nis a lot of people want to keep the same\nand I think there's Merit to having some\nthings the same but I think the sport I\nnever want to be one of those old guys\nwith the sport being like oh man I\nremember back in the day like why do\nthey have to do that like they ruined it\nlike I just it's going to evolve um I\ndon't know I'll be the grumpy old guy\nokay I'll let you be the grumpy old guy\nall right so um I think we're ready to\nwrap it up I want to say thank you to\nsatisfy for bringing us together thank\nyou Scott this was a lot of fun really\nappreciate you taking the time to talk\nwith us and uh really appreciate satisfi\nletting us have this opportunity so\nthank get get a copy of Poss too yeah I\nthink everybody gets copy right\neverybody should get a copy not to me\nbut I think everybody should there's\nsome really big pictures of me so be\ncareful sometimes I'm like whoa like\nthis is I actually brought all the way\nfrom Baltimore to get you to sign it and\nI left I have it in my backpack all\nright I think we can make that I think\nwe can make that happen I like that um\nso thank you not that anybody wants to\nhave it signed but if you want it signed\nI will I brought a Sharpie so we're good\nperfect he's ready all right thanks\neverybody thank you for coming out\nlistening ja yeah and thanks to the\npossessed folks yeah Jason's not here\nwho uh edited and like interviewed us it\nwas it was a blast and Jenny's way more\nfunny so read her interview first\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

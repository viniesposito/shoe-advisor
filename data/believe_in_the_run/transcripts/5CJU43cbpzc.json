  "text": "hey this is Taylor with cing the run and\nI'm here with Nick product line manager\nat Brooks trail running um I do want to\nsay we're getting to the end of the year\n2024 was a big year for Brooks lot of\ngreat product and we're seeing an update\nto some of the favorites um already so\nthis is exciting like Brooks getting on\na roll it's going to keep on rolling\nwhat do you have for us well I'm glad\nthat you said that because we're\ndefinitely seeing a lot of changes in\nour Trail line we're going to continue\nto push continue to to to really push\nthe throttle we want to keep innovating\nwe want to keep bringing our best\nTechnologies best midso Foams into the\nshoes and you're definitely seeing that\nin 25 you're going to keep seeing it in\n26 so we want to make sure that people\nare going out having a really really\ngreat time on the trail staying out\nlonger better cushion more protection\nunder feet great stability great all the\nthings that Runner Runners need so\nthey're not thinking about the shoes\nthey're kind of thinking about the Run\nOkay so the first really really fun one\nthat we have is the Catamount 4 this is\na big update to the three so the three\nused DNA flash V1 with a sky Vault plate\nthat was co- molded which means it's a\nvery thin and flexible plate for rock\nprotection that's inside the midso foam\nbut we wanted to do was maintain all\nthat really responsive py uphill drive\nall the stability and that stable ride\ngoing downhill but we wanted to push the\nturbo button on Flats so we took a\nlittle inspiration from our our road\nElite carbon shoes this is a full length\ninject Ed pack renew plate that is\ncurved so it starts in the middle and\nthen it curves down with DNA flash V2\nwhich is super light super fast super\nresponsive and that is going to give\nmore propulsion more Speedy more py\nfaster but maintaining the same weight\nand maintains the same price which is\ngoing to be really really great for a\nlot of runers so what is the price what\nis the we can you give us all the specs\non it yeah the weight is\n9 uh 6 oz you're going to get a stack of\n3428 total we're adding 2 mm of extra\ncushion underfoot and the price is and\nexactly and then you're also uh see be\n170 so keeping in a really really\naccessible fun price range for a lot of\npeople to really enjoy but our athletes\nhave been running in it they've been\nracing in it they ran CCC at UTMB we've\nhad athletes at uh across the globe\ngreat results and they've been loving it\nwell and and this one is Market as racer\nwe talk about it as a racer but for us\nwe with V3 and V2 we found that it was a\ngreat allaround shoe too do what you\nrecommend it for that just like daily\ntraining even but if you want that\nfaster clip lighter feel this is great\nit to us it resembles the Hyperion line\non the road side correct and so obvious\ninspiration but it's the same last same\nfit as a Hyperion same offset as many of\nour Hyperion mainly the same foam is our\nhyperian but we're building it strictly\nfor trail and so when we kind of work\nthese things out for trail one of the\ncool things about Sky plate is that it's\nthree pronged in the back here and then\nit's two pronged so that's going to\noffer more adaptability more flexibility\nit's going to maintain that really\nstable ride on trail awesome and and\nwhat's the lug depth on these this is\n3.5 mm lug depth of Trail TCH green\nwhich is our branded outs soole rubber\nsuper super sticky traction on wet Rock\nparticularly but really works amazing on\ndry dirt and all terrains yeah I mean I\ncan't think of a more exciting update so\nfar and like maintaining some of the\nthings we loved about it so awesome yeah\nso Catamount four what's next four so I\nwant to talk about the Caldera next\nbecause this is our Max Kush Max Comfort\nshoe is from the Calera 7 to the 8 we're\nmaintaining the same midsole so the\nstack height is going to be 38.5\n32.5 this is for DNA Loft version 3\nplush soft Comfort adaptable grippy\ntraction and on the upper we're using\nthis really really cool materialization\ncalled tpe so we use TPU these\nthermoplastic unit kind of um protection\ntoe guards right it's for durability\nit's for protection A supplier found a\nway to weave it into fiber form and so\nwe had it in the Catamount 2 3 the\nCaldera 7 we love this materialization\nso we're just evolving it making it\nbetter and better it is hydrophobic it's\nabrasion resistant it's super high\ndurable High protection but you're\nmaintaining all that breathability all\nthe comfort that you need in exactly and\nfrom a technical standpoint of like\nthat's what's providing a lot of the\nnext to skin comfort and we know in\ntrail we need that durability to hold\nthat fo a lot more soly you're going to\na lot of really rugged places you don't\nwant the shoe to break down in 100 miles\nwe want to increase that durability and\nthat materialization is going to be in\nthe Calera and the catam sweet that's\nawesome and does the weight anything\nchange weight stack anything on this one\nmaintains the same also yeah awesome\nokay thank you and what's Price Point\nagain\n150 okay very reasonable for sure okay\nso this is our spring 25 line so really\namazing update that we are going to on\nthe Cascadian 19 this has been around 19\nyears yeah 19 years and I mean we just\ntalked about it on a podcast but like\nthis is the shoe that kind of set the\nlandscape for modern day trail rad If\nwe're honest and so like what's similar\nfrom the first days what's different\nfrom the first days what's the update\nall about this is I will say\nquantifiably subjectively objectively\nfrom testing from perception from our\nathletes from Runners it's the best\ncascading we've ever done so this is the\nfastest we've pushed an innovation into\nthis shoe it's $150 Workhorse all Trail\nshoe all we've tested in every region\nthat we can possibly think of in the\nworld to really maintain it's stability\nit's protection it's grip traction but\nyou're getting all the Comfort all the\nall the the fun goodies of a work course\nTrail shoe so big changes is we're\nfinally bringing DNA Loft version three\nmidsole uh nitrogen injected midsole\ncompound we're going to a 6mm offset so\nwe're adding 4 mm of cushion in the\nforefoot 2 mm of cushion in the heel\nyou're getting a soft smooth super\ncomfortable ride but we have this trail\nadap system technology this was in the\nCascadia 17 and 18 and we're improving\nthis in a drastic way so previous\ncascadas you had to kind of glue two\npieces of midsole foam together you have\na plate in between we found a way to co-\nmold the plate into the foaming process\nso no more Glu no more stiffness it's\nsuper flexible but you still have that\nthat prong flexible ballistic Rock\nShield that's going to protect you in\nall the areas that you needed underneath\nthe shoe so that trail adap system what\nthat is is a middle loaded plate it is a\nwiden base and it's all these really\ngreat Flex Groves that's going to adapt\nand morph to all different Trail\nterrains man Cascadia get new life this\nit's a big one goes from like this has\nbeen doing really well in lifestyle you\nguys have been doing really well doing\nreally great with hikers recently\nthrough hikers but to see like it's\ngetting the Run treatment for sure\nthat's exciting you're going to\nimmediately notice the comfort that\nstable ride all the really goodies right\nwhen you put your foot in cool thanks I\nmean this is exciting for 2025 for\nBrooks keeping the pedal going oh yeah\nthat's awesome thank just wait until\n2026 too here we go yeah first h",

it's all right\nwe're there I can't stop that's all\nright today is another fun episode where\nwe're interviewing each other and Thomas\nis in the hot seat yeah right origin\nstories I wish it was a hotter seat it's\na little chilly it's very cold yeah what\nyou get when you when you have an office\nin a building that's a former slaughter\nhouse or whatever it is Butchery not\ngreat meat render yeah the ghosts of\nhogs live in we're back to scrapple\nagain wow um anyways but yeah this is a\ntherapy session for Thomas newberger\nfounder a believe in the Run I think\nwe'll we'll see how deep we get into the\nthe the depths of your mind let's let's\nI'm excited let's go so this is so I\nguess the last I did the first one which\nwe're recording this before that comes\nout so I don't know how the response\nwill be it's GNA be great okay I felt\nlike it was a little rambly because I\nwas just kind of going through the\ntimeline of my life I I felt like it fit\nyour personality okay so I don't know\nhow you want to start out but I I think\nthink we should start out from the\nbeginning okay in the beginning the very\nbeginning is I was an unplanned child\nwere you I see look we're already\ndiscovering things I never knew I was uh\nmy parents were in St Thomas Virgin\nIslands and uh that's actually how I got\nmy name okay uh are you are you kidding\nme no I would have been Virginia for\nVirgin Island if I was a girl so I ended\nup with Thomas St Thomas it's funny\nbecause the Virgin Island's kind of like\na oxymoron there it is [\u00a0__\u00a0] Island oh\nWowway sorry Mom yeah uh I my mom and\ndad had already had their two kids and\num they had a boy and a girl perfect\nlittle family and then uh yeah you came\nalong yeah red Havoc lady pack ladies\npack your uh birth\ncontrol yeah unplanned um so you were\nnumber three how old are how much older\nwere your other siblings three and four\nyears older that's not that crazy no\nit's not crazy at all not like 10 year\nGap yeah and so honestly I never can\nfigure out where either of you are from\nI always feel like I know and then I'm\nlike I guess that's not right so I was\nborn in Los Angeles okay really yeah\nAnaheim didn't know that yeah uh you\ndon't actually know Thomas at all yeah\nthe uh my parents moved to the Bay Area\nshortly after that my dad took a job\nwith a bank in San Francisco okay and uh\nwe moved to the Bay Area uh Lafayette to\nbe specific and uh we were there for a\nfew years but like growing up at that\ntime was like different and since I was\nkind of like the last kid there was no\nno adult supervision at all yeah because\nyou grew up in uh you could just say the\ndecades I don't want to age\nyou this was it when we moved to lafette\nit was like I was a year old and it was\n1970 okay so um oh man you were born in\nthe Summer of Love 72 I you weren't born\nuntil 71 so this is checking out 72 all\nright how old are\nyou in a month I'm going to be older oh\nI sold someone I was 43 yesterday which\nwasn't true I'm 42 so I get it you just\nforget at this point you but you should\nbe aging up always down I know yeah um\nyeah so they moved to in the 70s and uh\nit was a fantastic time to grow up uh\nmy childhood was a little different I'd\nsay than normal though so my parents\nuh we they split um when I was around\nseven okay so and I was already kind of\nlike I didn't have Hands-On parents\nbefore then right but after that it was\nlike so did it feel traumatic to you um\nI don't think I understood what was\ngoing on you know I I remember them\nsitting us down they say hey we're not\ngoing to live together anymore and I was\njust like okay and the first time I\nrealized that my mom wasn't coming home\nat night like after I was in bed or\nsomething was I had a nightmare and I\nwent to their room to like get soothed\noh and when I knocked on the door and it\nwas just my dad I was like he's like go\naway pretty much yeah he wasn't he\nwasn't uh he wasn't cut out like to be\nlike a dad I don't think yeah he didn't\nhave that paternal Instinct he didn't\nhave the skills and was he uh still in\nthe banking industry at this time\nyeah yeah he was he was actually a\nrealtor for the bank so what he did was\nhe\nfound like locations to put branches so\nwhen they were opening up a new Branch\nthey'd say okay this town where should\nwe put it he would help negotiate the\ndeal okay for for putting that so was\nthat a busy was that timec consuming job\nor was it just like he had his own life\nkind of thing you you know at this point\nhe's single he's Works in San Francisco\nit's about a 30 to 40 minute commute by\ntrain every day okay so when you say San\nFrancisco were you guys living in the\ncity no I lived in Lafayette he live his\noffice was in Embarcadero okay which was\nfun later on when I would got into\nskateboarding to be able to go down\nthere and that's where a lot of like you\nI would see like pro pro skaters yeah\nthat was like a space that right you\nwould see that but um yeah so he that\nthat happened and uh my mom left and she\nmoved to Berkeley okay which how far\naway was that uh it's on the other side\nof the tunnel so you have to go that\nagain is probably 30 40 minutes at least\num I remember when we were in Oakland\nyou were Oakland and Berkeley are right\nnext to each other uh right so I was\ntrying to get in grip miles and so we\nhad a layover and I just took the BART\nBART yeah that's when we were coming\nback from uh that was the world world\nchampion yeah and uh and I took a\npicture of some building or I think it\nwas by Lake Meritt or on the way and you\nyou were like yeah I lived in that\napartment I didn't live there mom your\nmom did so it was kind of opposite when\nthey got split up it I the odd thing was\nI stayed with my dad mhm so my dad ended\nup not knowing how to raise kids so he\nmy your siblings and you were all in the\nsame house for this moment so there was\na short period of time we were all\ntogether um and my dad brought in this\nlady named Natalie to be our\nperson and she had two kids of her own\nso he move we're I'm in a divorce\nsituation just adjusting to that my dad\ndoesn't know what to do so he hires this\nlady who looked like the witch from Bugs\nBunny what which W which witch you know\nthe one like when she scrambles like\nstuff flies out of her hair yeah and\nthen Bugs Bunny looks to the Cameron and\nsays I know but aren't they all inside\nyeah um but he hires her and she comes\nin with a family and her son is a\nspecial needs kid who uh can't use his\nlower leg so he's strapped into a\nskateboard basically no way yeah it it\nwas he was actually it amazing on this\nthing it had two wheels that would go\nand then the back wheels were actually\nthe other way so that they would lay\nflat and it could break oh but there's\nsomething wrong with his sockets so that\nhe was strapped into this\nthing like a v-shaped thing and he's on\nthe skateboard thing but the dude could\nget around like you wouldn't believe um\ndo you ever know what happened to him no\nhe wasn't the guy at the New York city\nwas he yeah maybe he I'm saying I'll\ntell you this he could probably skate\nlike insane I don't know if his legs\never healed up but they moved in and uh\nit was a circus like she had a pitol\nthat stank they had like one of those\ngroovy Vans with the bubble on the side\noh yeah and uh she was a nightmare and\nshe basically started homesteading like\nmy dad wanted to get rid of her but she\nwouldn't leave so she was a squatter\nbefore it was cool yeah so yeah my dad\nended up marrying this woman named Sally\nOh I thought you were GNA say her no so\nshe didn't he didn't marry her she she\nwas just like taking care he gets this\nlady in Sally who this should have been\nthe first warning that lady came in and\nimmediately got into a fight with\nNatalie who was the other person and\ndude this is W like a physical fight\nwhere cops came really this sounds like\nexactly how I imagined California to be\nin the 1970s so this is I'm imagining\nCharles Manson was involved at some\npoint prior to prior to all this so they\nget an altercation and it was kind of\nreminds me of that story the old lady\nwith a mouse and then she gets a cat to\nget rid of The Mouse and the dog to get\nrid that's what my dad did was like he\ngot a shittier thing like when you give\na mouse a cookie type thing yeah to get\nrid of Natalie\nbrought in Sally I guess that's like an\ninvasive species really yeah so Sally\ntook care of that but Sally was like by\nbipolar okay and immediately my brother\nchecked out at this point so my brother\nwent to go live with my mom which I\nthought was kind of messed up it's like\nthey started taking yeah individual kids\nright right like I'll take that one\ngetting for for Dodgeball yeah yeah so\nmy brother went with uh my mom\nand I stayed with Sally and my sister\nand my\ndad what age is this I am now probably\neight or nine okay that's a lot to\nhappen in a year or so also my school\nclosed down my public school and I\nshould have gone they like reallocated\nkids to different schools but because of\nthe divorce my parents thought that it\nwas better that I stayed at the school\nthat I was at which actually got turned\ninto a Muslim\nschool for sufis I I don't even know\nwhat that is that a certain sect yeah oh\nwow so they leave me in this school my\nsister goes to a regular school my\nbrother's off with my mom at a regular\nschool I'm in third\ngrade and they're teaching me math by\ncounting beads like oh like an abacus\nlike yeah like an abacus but also like\nthere's strands of beads and the blue\nones were worth this much and this one\nit basically almost like a money system\nwho and so they're they're teaching me\nall this stuff and I'm like coming home\nand I'm like I don't know what's going\non\nso they finally figure out that I'm\ngetting taught more about religion than\nlike actual skills no way so they pulled\nme out of school and put me into a\nregular\nschool but by that time all my friends\nwere gone right and I had to make all\nnew\nfriends and I'm in I'm at school and the\nteacher hands me a math sheet and she's\nlike here fill this out you know it's a\ntest I'm like where's where's my bees\nwhere the bees yeah\noh geez yeah so it was pretty bad but\nthen the worst part was as soon as my\ndad actually got married to Sally she\nlost her mind and she started abusing\nboth my sister and myself no way yeah\nand it was it was it was pretty hardcore\ngeez and uh yeah and and did that did he\nknow what was going on or like that was\nthe upsetting thing cuz at this point I\nfelt like I said my dad didn't really\nknow how to raise kids and at this point\nhe was like\nI don't want like I'm already I lost\nthis I I don't know I can't I don't know\nhow to handle the situation he didn't\nknow how to reprimand Sally okay so he\nkind of was like letting stuff happen\nright and uh to the point where like I\nmean I don't want to get into like all\nthe abuse stuff but it was bad yeah so\nhow many years did this\nlast I'm trying to think when so I ended\nup getting on a Greyhound bus and my mom\nhad moved to like the country in\nNorthern California so I got there and\nwhen I got there I said I can't go back\ndidn't you say you took the bus just by\nyourself but yeah it was from Oakland\ntoo and it was the sketchiest like we're\ntalking like sketchy bus station like\npeople doing stuff like in the coin\noperated like toilet stalls oh man like\ncrazy crazy situation 4 Hour uh bus ride\nup to where my M lip mhm and uh she\nended up taking me to a\npsychiatrist and the psychiatrist said I\ndon't care what you do don't like go\nback or whatever okay that's\ngood and\nthen sorry\ndude all right so you go and you live\nwith your mom Y and that's where um I\nend end up meeting at that time my best\nfriend Ryan Davidson who is still I\nthink he's up in Seattle now but um we\nkind of through Facebook and stuff we're\nable to stay in touch a little bit but\nthe distance has been a little too far\nand and I pretty much never stayed in\nany school more than two years so it was\nreally tough was he at your school yeah\nhe was at my school and he he\nhad like a he was a kid that loved to\nget into trouble so we hit it off real\nwell real fast and uh what kind of\ntrouble well let's my first experience\nwith weed was was with Ry but besides\nthat like my mom was uh poor like it\nlike when I live with my mom we lived in\na trailer for a little while and then uh\nshe actually built her own house so she\nbought like a house kit and what she\nyeah she she built her house what do you\nmean built her house that's like before\ntiny houses were cool too yeah she B\nbasically there's this lumber yard\ncalled 84 Lumber and you could buy a\nhouse all the materials so she laid a\nfoundation she all herself well her and\nthis guy Al okay and they built the\nhouse from the ground up but while they\nwere building it we lived in the trailer\nshe bought six acres of land and that\nwas it but there wasn't really any money\nso my one big treat a week was I was\ngiven like $4 to go skating at the skate\nrink and Ryan was usually Ryan and this\nguy David were the two of the three of\nus pretty much hung out pretty tight and\nRyan was really into art my mom was an\nartist so we kind of bonded on that\nstuff and uh we because we didn't have a\nlot of money I started making\nskateboards out of like we would make it\nout of like plywood and stuff like that\nso we're putting that stuff together way\nbuilding little ramps and like Towing\nourselves with motorcycles to get over\nthe ramps stuff like that\nawesome but we you we were kind of like\nat that point he was living in the\ncountry and you kind of got into it but\nit seemed like you had more supervision\nfor me it was like how do we not be\nbored right so we were we were pretty\nmuch getting into trouble all the time\nbut uh like some of the great things\nwere that we had like this bridge near\nthat went over this it was called Cow\nCreek and there Silver Bridge went over\nit it was about 30 40 feet over the\nwater but you could jump into it if you\nlanded in the right spot nice so we used\nto uh do that a lot um just that kind of\nlike board yeah kids getting into stuff\na lot of BMX biking a lot of\nskateboarding a lot of just let's like\nwhen you we were talking about like a\ntree was like the closest gas station\nstore oh yeah was like five miles away\nyeah but we make a trek of it the whole\nday like what would you go get uh you\nknow whatever is like uh if like I\nremember getting you know the cheap\ncandy because we didn't have much money\nso we would get like Wafers or something\nor the Taffy you know oh yeah the Taffy\nstuff but like we make a it was like\nkind of like when I see the movie um\nwhat's the movie where they go to see\nthe dead body Stand By Me Oh Stand By Me\nyeah that we make days of it like that\nwhere to get to the store and back you\nknow you're you go swimming in the creek\nfor a little while you get there and uh\nyou know that was a start of stuff like\none of my friends had Atari that we'd\nget to his house was like a you know an\nhour walk we'd all Trek over there oh\nyeah but we got real into that kind of\nstuff and I think you know similar to\nRobbie where I didn't have access to\nthings and so I went from the Sally that\nwas with my dad she wouldn't let us\nwatch TV at all so we were like blanked\nout of Pop Culture there and I remember\nlike going to school and kids would be\ntalking about a show and you'd be like\nyeah trying to\ninterject but there's nothing to say it\nkind of does like for all the parents\nwho think they're doing their kids a\nfavor by keeping them away from pop\nculture you're not you're ostracizing\nthem it's one of those weird things\nthough where I you hate it as a kid and\nthen you're like well would I have been\nso into things appreciated it more later\nin life yeah like it's like a weird\nnecessary evil to appreciate culture I\nthink it I think it it keeps you from\nbeing able to there's a balance there\nsurely yeah so we got up there and and\nwhen I was with my mom since again\nthere's no money there's no cable TV or\nanything I had a 13-inch black and white\nTV and you had to like aim it at a\ncertain direction get fuzzy things put\nthe put the tin foil on antennas first\ntime I saw the shining it was on like\nthat black and white TV you remember\nhaving to hit the top of a TV to get it\nin the right the frequency but uh yeah\nalways be hitting the TV Saturday\nmorning that but I went from the\nopposite thing so since I didn't have\nany TV like Saturday morning cartoons\nlike I watched everything until those\nwent off the air yeah um and yeah so\nthere you know it was a again my mom\nworked she was an artist so again we're\npretty much left our um at that in that\nsituation and you know we got got into\nsome trouble with doing stuff like you\nknow little light vandalism and stuff\nlike that um were you inspired by Mom\nthe artist I was you know I got positive\nfeedback uh for my artwork and one of\nthe things my brother used to draw and\num he said he stopped drawing when he\nsaw that I was better than him nice like\nis like I ran him out of the market he's\nlike as soon as I saw you he's like I\nwas like damn what am I even doing he's\nbetter than I am and so it was a point\nof like that was one thing that I always\nheld on through throughout my childhood\nwas like creativity artistic and drawing\nand stuff was always a strong suit and\nit got me attention with adults it got\nme attention with kids like every all\nthe kids would be like hey can you can\nyou draw this for me can you you do this\nso it was always something did you draw\nlike dirty pictures like to get to kids\npay you to do that I mean there is a\ncertain phase where you go through where\nyou're like yeah I can especially back\ndraw not like you had access to anything\nyou're just imagining stuff oh jeez yeah\nselling illustrations again Ryan and I\nRyan introduced so Ryan had his house he\nhad a satellite oh and had access to VHS\nand all that stuff so like I would\nstarting to get exposed to like horror\nmovies like it was almost scary to go to\nhis house because I didn't want to watch\nhim but I also didn't have a color TV so\ngoing over to his house you had he had a\nbig screen TV with a satellite and you\ncould watch it all um yeah so uh Ryan\nwas also like kind of he was into music\nhe started playing instruments um\nyou just he was just one of those kids\nthat like he could ride a dirt bike he\ncould yeah take all the cool he could do\neverything and he was he seemed good at\neverything and he he was grown up in\nHawaii and then moved uh over to the\nstate Soh uh you know we just had you\nknow tons of fun hanging out and doing\nthat kind of stuff and uh when I left it\nwas it was sad because we didn't really\nstay in touch when I went I ended up my\ndad ended up sallying him she on the\nside of a highway threw a boulder at him\nand then just left um they uh but so\nwhen she left I decided hey you know\nkind of sucks being poor i' rather go\nback my dad wasn't rich but he was like\nmiddle class and I was like I think I'd\nlike to go back to Lafayette and go to\nhigh school there and it was in that\ntransition year going to high school\nokay so I went back to and I was it in\nmy school in mville I was fairly popular\nlike I that I was a big fish in a small\npond there I was like somebody yeah and\nI had friends I had girlfriends I had\nyou know the whole works and I went to\nback to school and aalan had like 3,000\nkids in it and I was nobody 3,00 kids\nyeah like uh when I would go to lunch I\ndreaded lunch because I had no one to\nsit with or talk to that's the worst\nthat sounds awful I was like please just\nlet this be over and luckily it was a\nschool that but you know it's in\nCalifornia mhm most of the year you can\nsit outside and eat oh yeah so I started\njust like finding a quiet\nspot ended up making friends with\nanother guy that liked to skate and it\nkind of unraveled there it was kind of\nweird though because when I came back\nsome of my friends from elementary\nschool were going to ocalan but at that\npoint their clicks are all made and they\nwere like right you can't come back plus\nI look like Ralph Macho and I had my\nhair parted in the middle probably\ncountry Pumpkin Style so they were\nprobably like n nerd wearing suspenders\nin a check checkered hey guys can we\nhang out um I think I was still wearing\nbraces oh man that rough so did you have\nglasses too uh no I think my dad was\nkind enough to let me get contact oh\nwell that's good um and then when I\ncouldn't afford them at my mom's house I\njust was blind yeah like I'd rather I\nwouldn't wear the glasses and just be\nlike I can't see anything but this I had\nto wear the glasses but that was that\nwas the worst too yeah and uh you know\nso\ngot back in skating kind of became my\nthing and as soon as I got back with my\ndad about a year into it he decided um\nhe was going to marry this woman back in\nBaltimore oh wow and so that's the\nBaltimore connection all right he again\nleft M but this time instead of me going\nback to my mom's house they just left me\nin Lafayette and I ended up living with\num one of my dad's friends okay so he\nleft we still had the house there my\nbrother was living in the house mhm and\nhow old's your brother at this point 16\nokay okay or no at that time I think\nmaybe he was like 17 or 18 that's a\ninteresting time to leave a person that\nage in a house yeah well my brother got\nin trouble he got he yeah he he was you\ndon't need to go into it it's fine my\nbrother had been living by himself since\nhe was 16 like he got uh kicked out of\nmy mom's house and my dad and so he my\ndad got got him an apartment at 16 whoa\nthat's wild so yeah um so my dad moves\nback to the east coast and the woman he\nmarries uh it she didn't want kids okay\nso nice when it was time for me to join\nthem it was boarding school like you're\ngoing to go Plus at the time like once\nhe left and I didn't have any parents\nyeah I was skateboarding became\neverything to me right and so I was\ngoing to school like half day okay and\nyeah cuz why not yeah we kick out of\nschool right go to Taco Bell seems Seems\nmore important well which at that point\nTaco Bell might be more the house I was\nstaying at had a pool oh so we would\nditch school yeah get Taco Bell skatee\nfor a while right hang out by the pool\nthey had an 18-year-old daughter that\nhad all her friends over all the time so\nyeah ditch school as well I'm like 16\nand there's 18-year-old yeah you can't\nyou School cannot compete with that\nthere's no way and that was a time that\nI really got into again into kind of\nlike started doing maybe a little more\ngraffiti yeah and uh other vandalism\nthat I don't really want to get into but\num that's that's fine yeah they so I was\nkind of like you weren't carjacking\npeople I was on my not quite um I was on\nmy way to being to needing to go to\nboarding school yeah yeah you're on your\nway to Skid R via like they just left me\non that trajectory it would be a\ndifferent uh story um so yeah so they\nsent me to boarding school and it was\nfunny I checked out all these different\nboarding schools and\num the one that I chose first off I went\nI was from California and I went to the\neast coast in the summer to look at\nboarding schools in the upper east coast\nperfect it looked beautiful there's like\ngreen grass there's Breeze there's\nleaves on trees it I'm like wow this is\ngorgeous I went to this one school and\nit was in a Shaker Village like that's\nwhere pilgrims are not pilgrims but\nShaker was a religious SE for some\nreason I Quakers there's shakers too\nshakers so just so you know what a\nshakers Quakers baby shakers don't\nbelieve in um yeah I reproducing I I\nremember that okay I saw something on\nInstagram that was super weird about it\nso they don't reproduce how does that\neven how does that work how is there\nthey take in children oh and it pretty\nmuch is a it's I don't yeah it's I mean\nwe the School purchased it I think I\nremember seeing there's like one left or\nsomething like yeah one lady probably\nyeah she's like 160 so what was kind of\ncrazy though is they did work on some of\nour buildings on campus that were Shaker\nbuildings and they found like fetuses\nwrapped in corn husks and stuff that\nwere walled in so like use them as\ninsulation well what had probably\nhappened was people were probably having\nsex and then somebody would get pregnant\nand then they'd have to figure out what\nto do with and they hid them in the\nwalls that feels like the weirdest spot\nmight I'm not sure if God approves of\nthat I don't think that I don't think so\num that's insane there's another story\nabout how wait is this like a wies tail\nor no no there was another this when\nthey were redoing some of the building\nthey okay found it there was another\nstory of um they were hunting a rabid\ndog and one of the Shakers got shot in\nthe head because they thought the dog\nwas coming around the corner and it was\nthe person I think it was just murder\nand they tried to make up a story but uh\nall kinds of stuff went on back then\nnobody there was nobody knew is that\nlike the plot of The Village basically\night shyan's like Village I don't know\nbut it it seemed lot like that but the\nother thing was it's snowed October 4th\nand it didn't come off the ground till\nApril so yeah like I I went through this\ntotal shock of like sounds horrible but\nso in high school I made friends with\nthis kid named Nemo Nemo uh dad was an\nart dealer in in New York\num you\nknow yeah but anyway yeah uh Nemo was\nreal big into graffiti and was a really\ngood artist and so we became friends and\nlike back then in school like if I was\nin class I was just drawing all the time\nlike I was not like even my college my\ncollege notebooks are just illustrations\nyeah but you went to Art School in\ncollege\nyeah I went yeah but also I went to\nliberal arts school too right so um yeah\nso Nemo and I become friends he's got a\nhouse his family lives in New York City\nso he's got that so on the weekends we\nstarted going to New York City and this\nis in the 80s right yeah okay that's\nlike dude it was nuts grimy New York\ncity so when we would go to New\nYork uh it we were pretty much again\nunsupervised yeah and I didn't know this\nat the time but when I got out there you\nfind out really quickly that you can go\nanywhere you want at 16 so we were going\nto clubs all the time we were going to\nlike at that time the tunnel Limelight\nPalladium uh Mars all these different\nclubs yeah and you can drink there was\nany kind of substance around that you'd\nwant I was meeting all sorts of colorful\npeople yeah um at the time when we were\nthere like the standard thing to carry\naround was a box cutter so that like if\nyou got in a fight you just slice\nsomebody or something like that that\ncounted as CU is that not illegal to\ncarry on you I think it was just cheap\nand easy and if you open up someone's\nface it bleeds real fast so that like\nyeah it's SC it's scary to people um got\none on me right\nnow but uh so we started doing like that\nstuff and and a lot of like going into\nthe city\nwas you know at that time it was a wild\nwild west New York City and there was\ndefinitely times where is this this is\nManhattan though yeah yeah and like\nthere was a couple times where we\nescaped pretty hard you know close to\nDanger yeah and you know we're starting\nto tag stuff and and uh Nemo had already\nbeen part of like the graffiti scene but\nyou know we started getting into that\nstuff but it it got weird when people\nstarted carrying guns in that scene yeah\nso um that's when I was kind of like I\ndon't want to do this anymore yeah yeah\nand uh wait people were carrying guns\nwhen they were going and doing graffiti\nso at that time like graffiti was kind\nof like territorial so you would tag up\nand if someone right over your tag or\ndisrespect you fights would usually\nensue so when I imagine New York City in\nthe 80s I think the Warriors is that\nkind of of what it was like so one I'll\ngive you one example we I went to a\nparty and um and I was\nlike I was California in New York City\nyou know I was like I was in the group\nof people I was hanging out with\nthere I'm\nthinking maybe maybe there's a couple\nother white people but it was it was\nmore mixed in our group and we went to a\nhouse party and uh I was at the house\nparty and I started talking to this girl\nand I'm out out in front of the building\nMH and uh this guy named Jerry Dean\nJerry Jr is what he wrote and one of the\ncommon ways to get into a fight back\nthen someone said you know what do you\nwrite meaning what's your tag or\nwhatever so this guy Jerry Dean who's\ntwice as big as me looks like the Hulk\nlike he's just jacked he just gotten out\nof prison he was like prison yard yeah\njacked yeah like there's a certain way\nyou can look only from lifting weights\nand guess so he he comes up to me\nbecause he sees me talking to this\ngirl and he goes hey what do you write\nI'm like Ferris and he's like I don't\nknow you he goes I write Jr you know me\nI was like no I don't know you and so I\njust noticed this Shadow over my\nshoulder there's another dude about the\nsame size as him and I'm surrounded Now\nby four dudes that are the same size as\nhim and they start like pushing me\naround they're like ah is he fear in his\neyes I see fear in his eyes and they\nstart pushing me around and they they're\nlike like somebody goes oh wait you\nright Ferris I'm like he goes oh man\nsorry I didn't know who you were and he\nlike I like kind of pushed my way out of\nthe little circle and I go lean up\nagainst this car so I'm in between the\ncar and the the\ncurb and uh he comes back over and goes\nhey man I didn't know who you were and\nhe puts out his hand like he to like\nshake and when I go to shake his hand he\ngrabbed me by the top of my head threw\nme down between between the two cars and\nhim and his four friends with\nTimberlands on just started stomping on\nme and my head's hitting the curb I had\njust gotten this new vision skateboard\nshirt that I loved you know it was like\na white shirt with a vision skate you\nknow and uh I'm getting stomped on in\nfront of this girl that I thought was\ncute and I was felt like I was making\nnot cute anymore Making Waves um she was\ngone at this weren anymore yeah she was\ngone at this point so I'm getting\nstomped on him and like skin is getting\nbroken blood is coming out and then Nemo\ncomes over and he's like yo yo yo what\nare you doing and they're like this guy\nyou know and he's like no he's with\nus and I when I heard he's with us uhuh\nI just realized oh crap this dude now is\nwith us oh so they picked me up from the\nstreet my shirt is R oh he was with you\nguys yeah no way so my shirt is ripped\nand you got to see me in high school at\nthis time I'm probably 160 mhm\nlike Skin and Bones yeah like I looked I\nhad the\nmorisy haircut you know it was\nlike I get up it's my shirt's ripped I'm\nlike bleeding there's blood on my shirt\nlike just scuffed up and then they're\nlike oh cool all right whatever man\nlet's go to this club and I have to go\nwith this guy spend the rest of the\nnight with this guy nice and I'm like I\nwould have just left and been like I'm\nout I'm in New York City like I'm\nhanging with Nemo there's nowhere to go\nso I'm sitting at the tunnel all like\njacked up just drinking beers looking\nlike I got rolled well I did get rolled\noh man yeah that sucks so yeah New York\nwas fun um there was another time where\nwe almost got murdered by a gang of kids\non the subway but we got away yeah and\nlike I'm shaking and uh I'm like\ndude like next stop let's just get out\nof here and um my friend Nemo was like\nwhy are you being such a puss you know\nthis he goes but let's get a\ncab but like we almost got like these\nguys were going to kill us like it was\nlike it was bad um but anyway so that\nwas New York and I was ready I was ready\nto leave yeah once high school was done\nI actually came home and begged my dad\nlike please don't send me back M I'll\nI'll be\ngood yeah and uh they're like it's too\nlate um so I finished up my time in\nboarding school and uh that I I ended up\ncom down here and wanted to go to art\nschool and so I ended up at Maryland\nCollege of Art\nand I loved the idea of being at art\nschool but once I was there I just I\ndidn't really love it I felt\nlike it was kind of antiquated at the\ntime and most of the kids that were\ngraduating I saw working at the\nrestaurants we went to oh yeah so we'd\nbe like you don't say I'm like wait I'm\ngoing to finish this\ndegree and my options are going to be\nworking at the pizza place or while I\nhave a loft that I'm sharing with three\nother dudes and we're painting right you\nknow hopefully it's similar to your band\nlife yeah but I knew immediately that\nwasn't going to be for me oh when I\nfirst moved to Baltimore I looked at one\nplace that was I think three Micah guys\nand I dodged a bullet on that one for\nsure you did they were like I think they\nwere talking he's like yeah the one guy\nkind of likes to just do his art\nsometimes he hangs out naked I'm like\nprobably good yeah I see that's a thing\nlike that was the thing about art school\nthat I thought there's doing\nart and I felt like half the kids there\nwere really good at Art the other half\nwere really good at pretending to be\nartists and having their parents pay for\nit yeah was like smoking cigarettes\nnaked it's like or just trying to do\nweird like I'm I just want to try to do\nand that's why how many how many clove\ncigarettes did you go through during\nthat time\nCL SAS were probably more in the New\nYork days okay um camels were the\ncigaretta choice at uh at art school and\nparli parliaments parliaments\nparliaments were there but that's when\nmy grandma smoked so okay I think they\nwere cooler later on maybe like then\nlater 90s probably it kind of was like\nit became like the what's that beer that\neverybody started drinking the um PBR\nyeah PBR um so there's a lot of kids\nthat are there just there that are like\nthink it's fun to try to be like they're\nthe art project I'm going to be weird\nand and do that but like when you're\nlike okay well let's see your portfolio\nyou're like this [\u00a0__\u00a0] sucks right right\nnot even like in the good way that it\nsucks like it's so bad like sometimes\nit's ironic yeah but um so I was at our\nschool I was like my brother at that\ntime had moved from California to the\neast coast here and he was at talson\nUniversity and I saw him going to\nparties and there was girls there and\nthere was looked fun and everything so I\nwas like well maybe I'll get another\ndegree while I'm getting this art degree\nI'll get a psychology degree and maybe\ndo art therapy for kids uhhuh and you\nknow try to help okay help kids I wonder\nwhy I would want to do that but um so I\nI go to I went to\ntalson and as soon as I get there my\nbrother basically finds a girlfriend and\nhe's nowhere to be seen right okay\nand so I'm like ah great um but I I\nenjoyed the the tal and stuff and um I\nended up getting the double degree and\nobviously Next Step would be to go to\ngrad school M but I was like at this\npoint I was like 24 and I was like I'm\ndone with school I want to I want to\nstart life yeah I want to do that right\nso I ended up um getting a job at\nNordstrom okay which actually was like a\ncontinuation of high school or college\nyeah because it it was a playground for\nme like it was like it had all the stuff\nyou know the the gear and the clothing\nand all that stuff yeah I guess that's\ntrue but it also had a lot of female\nemployees right and yeah we could skip\nover that part um no but so you did yeah\nI remember man that's like that's a lot\nof hard left turns\nthat wait so I know I know you played\nSports of some kind so when were did any\nof that come in well when I got to I I\nskied my whole life and when we went to\num when I went to boarding school they\nhad skiing there okay because there's a\nmountain called Jiminy Peak nearby so\nthat was you would think it would be fun\nbut when you have to go skiing every day\nwhether you want to or not or whether\nthe weather's good or bad yeah it and\nlike they made you go skiing yeah like\nit was like a almost like a cross\ncountry team like was a team yeah so\nyou're like practicing yeah so you you\ngo out\nand and the I also found lacrosse I came\nso my first year I played lacrosse I was\nthe most improved player okay because I\ndidn't have in California at the time um\nand then the second year I was team\ncaptain and most valuable player but it\nwasn't because I was good I think it was\nbecause I just was enthusiastic and I\nworked hard okay and I and I was kind of\nvoted by my teammates they were like\nnice yeah so it was a nice it was a nice\naffirmation wasn't skill based I didn't\nknow you were a LAX bro H I'm not but my\nwe had one kid at the school Rich whose\ndad was a corporate lawyer uhhuh now\nthis school was like all income levels\nlike we had Puerto Rican kids that were\non scholarship all the way to corporate\nlawyer Sons okay so his dad had a\nhelicopter and for One lacrosse game he\ngot fully suited up his dad landed him\non the field\nwell the pilot landed him on the field\nand he came out of the helicopter what\nlike while the other team was doing\ncalisthenics and fully draft feel like\nhe had a Target on his back for that\ngame for sure no I mean and we crushed\nthat year that that was we were I think\nwe might have been undefeated my first\nyear that we did it but and then I also\nplayed basketball uh I actually got to\nplay against the school that Mike Tyson\nwent to really they had a chain link\nfence around the court and you still got\nhit with rocks but um that's crazy yeah\nyeah um but never running there was no\nrunning in your life I mean lacrosse had\nlike we did running like a mile warm up\nor whatever like that but yeah no no\nrunning never thought about running uh\nthe only time I ran was when I would\ncome home from school I just kind of\nfelt like doing something so I would do\nlike a mile loop around the house just\nto just to run but I think I probably\ndid it in like basketball shoes or\nsomething yeah um really wasn't on the\nradar and then uh when finished up it\nbeing a manager at Nordstrom which was\nit was it was a great job at the time\nyeah um it taught me a lot and\nespecially back then it was customer\nservice oriented and it was a civil\nplace to be and dealing with the public\nseem a lot more civil than it is today\nand uh one of my friends was working in\nthe mortgage industry he's like hey come\nwork in the mortgage you can make a lot\nof money so I quit there and went to\nwork there and you can make a lot of\nmoney and yeah but it sounds terrible I\ndid but it was the worst lowest I've\never felt about myself oh just like\nyou're it was just a scummy what did you\ndo all day make calls yeah they would\ngive you a stack of people who need to\nrefinancing what year is this you would\ncall them uh this probably would have\nbeen around 96 okay okay yeah so doing\ndoing calling these people and the worst\npart about it I just felt like you\nwere people needed money so you were\nhelping them refinance their house and\nstuff like that and sometimes you were\nlowering their interest rate but most of\nthe time you were doing things to to um\nscrew their situation right like\nincrease their interest rate get money\nout of their house so that you can get\npaid your fees and stuff like that it\nwas just the grossest thing so I\nimmediately like didn't enjoy the work\nand started not like I was employed\nthere but I wasn't working because I was\nlike this is the worst as a matter of\nfact it was really sad a friend of a\nfriend was refinancing their house and I\nsaw their name on the paperwork and I\nwas like I heard the loan officer\ntalking about how they were his last\nname was Hall and they're like we're\nhauling this guy and it became the word\nfor really screwing someone over oh my\ngosh and I I tried to call the guy he\nsaid and I was like dude do not sign\nthis paperwork don't sign the paperwork\nbecause they're so is the idea is that\nthey lower the interest rate but put a\nton of points on it or like so here's\nthe thing you could like say that you\nqualified for like a % interest rate\nyeah they can sell you a 7% interest\nrate and then The Brokerage makes that\nmoney that extra money on that so first\noff oh I got I got you first off you\nthink so say that your interest rate was\n10 but I could get you three yeah but\ninstead you make it to seven and and I\ncollect a fat check from that then on\ntop of it there's fees that I can build\ninto your loan right so then they were\nbuilding fees into the loan so that they\nwere getting it on both sides so they\nwere getting a paycheck from right\nhiking the interest rate on you and they\nwere getting a paycheck from the the\nbuilt-in fees that they were putting in\nand so I called the guy and I was like\nhey don't do this he's like I don't have\na choice I need this money I was like\ndude like you're not just go someplace\nelse don't do this loan because was it a\nwas it a short and was it a fixed rate\nor was it like variable so did they get\nlike a shortterm I don't even remember\nit was it was going to he was going to\nlose his house like and I was just like\ndon't do this and that's that's the\nmentality of the top producers where all\nthat kind of like screw the how you go\nhome and sleep at night well I ended up\ncalling my uncle I was like look I don't\nthink I can do this and I was like I was\nlike I need some ethical advice he's\nlike if you think it's unethical quit\nand then the housing bubble well sooner\nor later crashes and then nobody gets\nhas held responsible and everybody walks\naway yeah I mean there's hate it I mean\nI do know somebody who went to jail for\nsome stuff uh but even then it probably\nnot that long and not it's just crazy\nyeah tons of people's lives yeah it was\nit was just a really shady business and\num I remember I I I ended up just\nquitting and I got a job uh at another\nplace doing in marketing and I kept it\nwas was first sales and I was like kept\nedging I would go to the marketing\ndepartment all the time be like hey\nopenings and like and finally work my\nway over then that company went out of\nbusiness they they went through $30\nmillion and nice bellied up and at this\ntime I was like\nokay what am I going to do I I went back\nto my art background I was like I need\nto learn computer skills I have zero\ncomputer skills for\nart I'll I'll take anything so like you\nI was on like unemployment for a little\nwhile when they cut the when they let\neverybody go like we showed up to work\nand there was guards at the door and\nbasically boxes and they're like take\nyour stuff and yeah and go um I ended up\ngetting a job at a screen printer and\ndesigning t-shirts and I went in and I\nsaid to the guy said\nhey\num I I have no skills on the computer\nbut I I tell you what I promise you I'll\nbe your top Performing Artist if you\ngive me a shot yeah so I took a 50% pay\ncut like just almost dropped like\ndropped my pants for it I was just like\nconsider this getting paid to go to\nschool yeah and um I went and I got got\nreally good at it and I was doing\ndesigns for the US Open and different\nyou know some fun stuff that was a schol\npretty cool and really start big Johnson\nt-shirts yeah some of that um and I\nreally H my skills and and the thing was\nit it also like the pressure I was able\nto turn things over quickly yeah like\nlike that was I think the biggest skill\nI Learned was not only to design quickly\nbut execute quickly and work and that\nplays into like when I ended up meeting\nMegan um but I got really good there and\nI started doing freelance and I was\ngetting enough freelance I started\ngetting into arguments with the\nownership because he didn't want me\ndoing freelance ended up just quitting\nand opening my first business which was\nnew designs and\num I was really good at the creative and\nmarketing side uhuh not so good at the\nbusiness side\nshocking so uh you probably didn't note\nat the time but um a local uh PR Company\nthat didn't have a creative department\nthey were looking for someone to start\ntheir creative\nDepartment my work was really\ngood and they saw that yeah and they\nwere like ah this guy would be great so\nthey offered me a job to start their\ncreative\nDepartment be the creative director at\num this company\nand they didn't know it but like I was\nprobably a month out of like probably\ncrashing and burning so I was like yeah\nI'll do that well I I have my hands tied\nright now really really have some\noptions that are more enticing but zero\noptions like the that sound of the plane\ncrashing was was they couldn't hear it\nbut so I went there and um again that\nwas a great experience I'd learned a ton\nabout uh branding and marketing and that\nand while I was there I you know I\nstarted getting into running I'd gone to\na 5k okay and 5K marathon right yeah\nyeah as they all are it was actually the\nBaltimore marathons 5K and so it kind of\nwas in a way yeah well it was funny I I\nthere was a couple women at the the\nmarketing agency that were Runners and\nso they asked me if I wanted to go for a\nrun so I started doing like little two M\nthree mile runs and you know how it is\nit hurts oh yeah um but then I signed up\nfor the 5K and when I saw like the\npeople at a running event I was like oh\nthis is amazing like I want to be a part\nof this this seems cool because up until\nthen the only way I saw people in public\nwas probably at a bar right right you\nknow it was like that's how I thought\npeople met and I went to the running\nevent and it's like wow there's people\nthat are full of positive energy life\nand looking healthy yeah I did the 5K\nsmoking Sig yeah well I did I I may have\nbeen at the but um uh the I went\nafterwards I went to a bar and we were\nwaiting for one of my friends who doing\nthe marathon and there's dude who looked\ntotally out of shape walked up and he's\ngot the Half Marathon medal on I I just\nlook at I'm like if that guy like\ncongratulations man dude I thought he\nwas like a superhero I was but I was\nlike if that guy can run a half marathon\nI can run a half marathon yeah so I\nactually the guy it's funny because the\nguy is a faster bastard now but this guy\nPaul sorry I feel like whenever I think\nof that what you're talking about I feel\nlike in elf when he uh when it was like\nnumber best coffee in the world and he's\njust like\ncongratulations I feel the same way\nwhenever I would see someone with a\nmarathon metal I'm like you you did it\nyeah you are a superhero so Paul I said\nto Paul I go oh gez I think I want to\nrun a a half marathon he goes that just\nsign up for a marathon training you'll\nrun a half while you're doing and then\nyou can run a marathon so I went from 5K\nto signing up for a marathon how long do\nyou know how long the training was um\nyou did a program right yeah I went I\nwent to weeks same as Robbie I went to\nCharm City and signed up for the thing\nand there was a free one at Falls Road\nbut I was like I I need to I need to put\nsome skin in the game I need to yeah and\nI remember telling my friends and family\nthat I was going to run a marathon and\none of my family members laughed in my\nface like there's no effing way you're\nrunning a marathon which was at the time\nreally hurtful but it lit a fire in me\nto be like yeah F you I'm I'm going to\ndo this was it your brother no okay my\nbrother's actually really supportive\nyeah okay it was kind of funny he was\nlike all right because I what I did was\nwhen I signed up I knew I I wanted all\nthe motivation to finish that's possible\nso I told everybody that I could and my\nfamily friends hey I'm signing up for a\nmarathon I'm going to run a marathon\nthis spring yeah just put it out there\nlike I'll be humiliated if I don't do it\nyeah it's good so I ended up um running\nmy first\nmarathon and it like some was it the\nBaltimore marath no it's the DC I was\ngoing to say you said spring yeah I did\nit in DC um I don't know it was it the\ntime the Sun Trust I don't know what it\nis now okay but now it's rock and roll\nis it rock and roll yeah I think so so I\nended up doing it but as soon as I cross\nthe finish line like a little switch\nclicked off my brain and I was like oh\nif you plan man and follow the steps you\ncan do anything and I don't know why I\nthought this at the time but I was like\nI could write a book like that was like\nthe aut Apex of if you're disciplined\nyou can get things done yeah well before\nthat it's like you're like a there's no\nway I can do that because you don't see\nthe steps yeah I get it I actually know\nexactly what you're talking about yeah\nso I don't know why I thought I could\nwrite a book because I'm not a very good\nwriter but at the time I was like I\ncould even write a book yeah um but I I\nwas just like oh you can do anything and\nthen one of our clients at the agency\nwas gortex mhm so I went to a meeting at\ngortex and you know I'm feeling pretty\ngood now I'm a marathon guy you know\nthat place is full of athletes yeah and\nuh Cynthia M was there and she was\ngiving us uh all this in you remember\nCynthia she was the one when we did the\nNorth base um she starts telling me Oh\nwe sponsor a race out in uh Colorado\ncalled the trans Rockies oh nice she's\nlike it's a six day uh 130 mile race\nOver the Rockies\nright and I was kind of like this is\nafter right after your first marathon\nmaybe I had done two at this point I\nthink maybe I had done okay two I I\nthink I followed that followed that up\nwith um like the Baltimore Marathon or\nsomething I forget which one um but I\nwas like huh that seems like a scary\nchallenge I I think I could do it and\nit's actually how uh believe in the Run\nstarted so again again like setting\nmyself up so that I wouldn't you know\nbail out on it I uh decided hey I'll\nI'll raise money for a charity for Trans\nRockies and\nuh I need a website so I put together\nthe website believe in the run first off\nwhere'd you get the name from well there\nwas okay at that time there was an ad\ncampaign going on\nuh I think Nike had it and um I was\nobviously in the marketing and I was\nlike okay I went and looked I was like\nthat's a good I like I like that\nsentiment and the whole thing was like\nit wasn't just believe in the r believe\nin the run you R running never get takes\nmore than it gives or something like\nthat uhhuh and I was like ah believe in\nthe run I said ah let me let me get that\nURL if it's\navailable and it was yeah and then I\nlooked at the agency that was doing the\nwork and it it's like brickfish or\nsomething like that I was like oh\nthey're probably going to lose their\njob so I got the URL and I started using\nit to uh raise money for the Baltimore\nchild abuse center and why did you pick\nthat well just okay\nyeah never mind yeah so uh you know it\nwas something that I thought had meaning\nfor me for um you know earlier in my\nchildhood mhm so uh I decided to raise\nmoney for\nthem and uh since I had PR marketing\ncompany that I worked with I was able\npull some strange get on some like at\nthat time radio shows and promote what\nwhat I was doing and\nuh it's I started like putting my\ntraining on there as I was asking on the\nwebsite for donations and this is\nprobably before everyone in their 2009\neveryone in their cousin was asking for\na race donation so probably wasn't as\nlike well I also said I'm going to do\nthis one time okay and I'm not I'm not\nI'm never going to ask for for this\nagain so I cuz I did I still feel that\nthere's I do get annoyed because like we\nall run we all do it and sometimes when\npeople are like hey help me raise money\nfor this because I'm running yeah you're\nlike yeah we're all running um and you\ndo it whether or not we give a donation\nyeah it's nice that you are but um it I\nwas like this is the only time I'll do\nit big event 30 Mi um so I started\nraising money and I had to do posts on\nthe website so I started talking about\nmy training what I was wearing what gear\nI had that stuff and people were more\ninterested in like what gear I was using\nand they wanted to know because at that\ntime there was nothing you couldn't go\nanywhere to find out okay you're going\nto be running in the mountains for 20\nmiles what gear do you need right what\nwhat uh you know polls or what's good\nout there for for for this I by the way\nI think you can still look back and find\nthose unbel I think I've archived some\nsome of the worst ones but I think uh\nbut I think you can I think you might be\nable to go back and find some of those\nposts well the the funny thing the first\nones anyway at that time Byron um what's\nhis name from iRun far he was the only\nperson that he was in DC and he had run\ntrans Rockies so I was like um let me\ncheck in with this guy and see what he\nknows like if you know if he knows any\ntips or anything like that and I just\nremember him writing back to me real\nquick about something and whatever but\nit kind of gave me I was like I think he\nwas probably the only other person doing\nkind of\nlike Gear reviews at all yeah probably I\ncan't imagine too many people back there\nwere doing it I remember when I first\nstarted writing there was\n[Music]\num going to forget his name now uh he\ndoesn't review anymore oh you're talking\nabout Pete lson Run blogger Pete Larson\nwas my kind of like my mentor in a way\nonce I started doing like at first it\nwas a charity and training site but then\nwhen I started talking about gear that's\nwhere the interest go that's people\nstarted interested so I started talking\nmore about gear and that's when Pete\nkind of was like hey you can do this you\nshould you know do this or do that and\nhe also was the first person like he put\nme in touch with like saky and stuff and\nwas like hey you should give this guy\nshoes and Sketchers and sket yeah and\nSketchers um so he kind of made some\nintroductions to some Brands and it kind\nof snowballed like once you start\nreviewing some of that stuff the other\nbrands are like hey do you want you want\nme to send you some stuff we'll let you\ndo it so I was like oh look at this I'm\nand at this point I'm\nlike two three years into running yeah\nand I'm getting you know stuff sent to\nme like a free pair of shoes I'm like\nthis is the greatest thing ever oh for\nsure by the way I'm can see your weekly\ntrans Rockies run training week seven\nyour weekly updates yeah you've really\nkept a good run Journal I got to say\nreally I mean you literally put every\nday of your training on there oh wow\nnerd well there was nothing back there\nwas no like Strava didn't exist I was\nusing daily mile um I oh here we can I\nread one and yeah go ahead this is your\nlong run for week seven I thought this\n22 M run was going to be a big struggle\nI was achy and tired I downloaded Dean\nkass's 50/50 book on the iPhone last\nnight remember this and started\nlistening as I began to run and uh that\nwas on the NCR oh yeah and you uh listen\nto that while running felt good you have\nto understand like back then nobody was\ndoing Ultras right I know like it was it\nlike it was really like now I I I feel\nlike I don't know what you'd have to do\nto impress somebody cuz like back\nrunning across the country know yeah uh\nwell at Megan when I met Megan I was\ntraining for a 50 mile and you thought I\nwas insane I thought you were absolutely\nnuts um but yeah so I started getting\nfree gear and stuff and so the site\nstarted shifting to more of a gear site\nMH which played into I've always loved\nlike I I played um I I during\nskateboarding I was all into the gear\nand and everything like that and then\nlater on I dabbled in golf and I got\nreal into like\nthat gear and clubs and everywhere I\nwent I collected the little golf balls\nfrom the course and stuff like that so\nI've always been like a gear nerd and\nrunning just was like an explosion yeah\nfor me it was like oh you need all this\nstuff like I remember my first pair of\ntights and like do I need shorts over\nthese or do you you just kind of like go\nout with just tights on yeah can't do\nthat not when you first start out build\nthat confidence level dude I ran a\n10-mile with a hydration pack\num the Baltimore 10er oh 10er okay I got\nyou yeah yeah there's a there's a race\nphoto of me with a camel back on it\nrunning like with 7inch\nshorts Corney dwalter style yeah a\nmatter of fact I would look just like it\nbut um yeah so it got started getting\nreal into running because the gear was\ncoming and I just fell in love with the\nsport I loved being around the people um\nlike everything it just I fell in love\nwith like just talking about it all the\ntime I was probably completely annoying\noh yeah um I mean I know I feel like\neveryone is when you first start now\nit's almost I try to avoid it cuz I know\npeople are trying talk about anything\nbut people were trying to avoid me so I\nget it yeah I I I mean I I remember I\nwent to a wedding and I was going to\nhave a six mile run the next day so I\ndidn't\ndrink you are that is nerd Lev there\nlike well it was the longest run I'd\never done at the time it was when I was\nlike training for my first marathon I\nwas like I don't know if I can do six\nmiles you know I won't drink at this\nwedding turns out you can drink as much\nas you want knock out six miles yeah but\num yeah uh so yeah we got into that and\num finished the trans Rockies I donated\nI think I think it was a total of like\nnear 5,000 bucks or something to the\nBaltimore child AB center did you well\nyou had a goal did you reach the goal or\nyou got as much as you could cuz you had\na on the post it said goal it post had a\ngoal of like 11,000 or 12 I I didn't\nreach that goal okay I got I think I\nthink I got to around five all right\nstill valuable yeah\nso did that and uh it gave me a lot of\nconfidence being able to do that I\nremember before I went for the run I\njust went to Breen Ridge to go skiing\nwith my brother and stuff and and I\nremember being up in those mountains\nbeing like what did I do yeah why did I\nsign up for this I was like how am I\ngoing to run over one of these things\nyeah like this is ridiculous right and I\nI was like almost terrified but it was\ngood it made me take the training\nseriously MH and I just followed that\nthey had training on the trans Rockies\nwebsite so I was like just following\nwhat they recommended as like here's\nthis will get you through and at the\ntime was it sponsored by Under Armour\nwas no gortex oh okay yeah gortex was\nthere the first time and then when we\nran it together what who was the sponsor\nit switch\nSolomon who was\nit I don't\nrecall yeah I forget it wasn't Under\nArmour yet no I guess it didn't I guess\ntheir investment was not worth it sorry\nwell we got kitted out by um oh Newton\nyeah oh wow but they didn't sponsor the\nevent I don't think oh okay no but we\ngot some shade from were being like\nwhere cuz like we were decked out in\nhead to toe every day and there's this\none Le one Trail dudes that were like\nhere comes those Newton\npeople and that was like before like\npeople were doing stuff like that like\ngetting sponsorship so I'll get into how\nthat happened but so I end up\num\nagain at the time when I was at the\nagency that I was at I started just\nfeeling feeling like one I didn't like\nthe rules of the agency like we were\nsupposed to track every minute every day\nthat we were there like it had to be\nbuildable hours and stuff and it just I\nfelt stifled creativity and stuff like\nthat and then I also was very much into\nuh social media and stuff and I saw that\nas an\nemerging place to be and the owner of\nthe company wasn't really buying into it\nhe thought it was going to be more of a\nfad and that like our clients didn't\nneed to be on social media I was like I\nthink you're wrong um so I ended up\nquitting and again started another\ncompany called Wonder Dojo okay um with\nanother guy and he was the developer I\nwas the designer and we were going to do\nwebsite design stuff like that and this\nguy only liked to work at night I'm like\ndude how are we supposed to start a\nbusiness something I kind of do\nyeah it literally like I was like and he\nwas doing like a free website for a\ncoffee place because they gave him free\ncoffee I'm like dude I can't be doing\nwebsites for free coffee I need money\nwas his name Cosmo Kramer pretty much it\nwas it was funny so like one day I just\nwent up to him I said hey this isn't\nthis this isn't going to work uhuh I go\nuh he goes is it is it me yeah I'm like\nno no I just think I want to go a\ndifferent direction so I ended up he was\nlike can I keep the name and the logo\nI'm like you got it m I'm just out and\nuh I ended up going to do Consulting\nwork for uh social toaster so social\ntoaster is one of the companies and so I\nwas working for a couple of different\ncompanies doing like Consulting you're\ndoing sales yeah sales and consulting\nstuff um uh not at Social toaster was I\nI was doing sales doing sales huh that's\nweird I don't remember that switched you\nout of that cuz they were like nope not\nthis guy yeah you were exchanging their\nwork for free coffee yeah that's right\nthey push him straight into marketing\nthey're like this guy likes to paint\nstuff yeah um which was great so I\nstarted uh like I wasn't full-time there\nI was just consult I was working for a\ncouple other um entities too but I like\nsocial toaster and uh the people like I\nreally enjoyed working with the people\nthere it was a lot of fun um we had a\nton of fun there and it was like\nexciting when we were there it was like\ngrowing it was it's like that that\nstartup that you envision that's like 10\npeople it's really young they have\ninvestors so there's a bunch of money\nyou're trying to figure out how to make\nstuff work but you're with a team that's\nlike super young super smart and very\nsmart so you're like it's like the very\nWork Hard Play Hard mentality right lots\nof lots of happy hours lots of like I\nand I started doing stuff like exploding\npumpkins at work it's I can't even expl\nthe Golden Age of startups when\neverything everything was getting money\nand yeah everyone's happy there was\ninvest C of beer in the office all that\nstuff so um at that time I am sitting in\nthis area where they let the intern sit\nbasically because I would come in with\nmy computer and just work there for a\nlittle bit and then head out and one day\nI come in and this lady mhm is and at\nthis point I'm at I'm doing like three\nmarathons a at least a year maybe four\nfour to five marathons and an ultra\nevery year yeah and uh I come in one day\nand at the desk we normally intern sit\nis\nMegan and so I'm like being friendly\nuhhuh hi I'm Thomas are you the new\nintern uhhuh I had just moved from\nCharleston to Baltimore and got my like\nfirst real big job as a marketing uh\nokay like uh or I guess I was\ntechnically an account rep at that point\nanyway I was very excited about this big\nnew job and he looks right at me and\ngoes so you're the new intern and I was\nlike she heard you're who is this dick\nwad so we get immediately go into get\npulled into a meeting where I'm in a\nmeeting and I'm looking over and I'm\ngetting like like mean daggers yeah mean\nlooks I'm like what\nthe it's just short with me like the r\nlike like I got nothing uhhuh uh from\nfrom it but like I was like whatever um\nbut then we started working together and\nwhen we got projects and Megan and I did\nhim like we crushed them like we worked\nfaster and put stuff together to the\npoint where I felt like everything got\njust shoveled to us yeah we were very\nefficient and even my I think we've said\nthis before but they called us the GSD\nteam oh yeah and um get [\u00a0__\u00a0] done yeah\ncuz we could just they'd hand us these\nlike projects that they give us like a\nweek timeline and we could get\neverything done in a day nice and so we\nwere just like knocking out work and it\nwas and it was fun and so then we had\ntime to also go to happy hours and goof\naround yeah it was just a fun fun time\nof life but like uh well they had this\ntool that nobody knew how to use so we\nended up like building campaigns for\npeople like and like big like quick and\nLoans like the Marvel movies like we did\na Spider-Man movie we did The Hobbit\nmovie but we had to come up with like\nthe whole idea for the campaign how it\nwas going to go out like do all the\nplanning for it did you ever do at arb's\ntexting text campaign no no we did Sony\nphones like giveway but surprised I\ndidn't find those and somehow well there\nwas a group of people that we hadn't\ngotten into text yet ours was mostly\nemail and social based okay all of the\nlike push notifications and such but um\nso we got really good at that and uh\nMegan and I just I I think that was a\nstart of like a deeper friendship like\nwe just relied on each other so much to\nget stuff done that it just felt fun and\neasy to work together and and she was\nthat missing part of me that like that\nbusiness side the details and the stuff\nMegan was was that and I started like I\ndon't know if like on straa or something\nbut I started seeing her\nruns and I was like hey you actually\nyou've run pretty well like have you\never thought about doing a\nrace and so Megan started running I'll\nlet you tell that story your episode but\nat that time I was training for a 50\nmile and uh but then I realized he also\nhad this believe in the Run website on\nthe side and I was like well you should\nprobably have a female perspective too\nand so he's like yeah actually that's a\nreally good idea that would grow the\naudience and then I was like well can\nyou give me access to the back end and\nmaybe I can set up advertising and he\nwas like if you want to do this on your\nown time that's fine and I was like\nabsolutely and so I start well not only\nthat you were like it what really\nstarted you was you were like you get\nshoes for free yeah yeah I mean I feel\nlike that's yeah and she's like can I\nget shoes for free yeah if you want to\nreach out go ahead yeah so he basically\ngave me an email address and then I\nstarted just reaching out to all these\nBrands and it like snowballed from there\nbut I think you probably realized before\nme that we were spending so much time\ncreating this content for other brands\nthat we didn't care about it was like\nwhy don't we do this that's exactly what\nI had care about like in my head I was\nlike why am I like this isn't really my\njob my job was to design the interface\nand just do the graphics MH for for\nthese campaigns yeah which was fun I\neven got to do a logo for Shakira which\nwas we were on the phone with her yeah\nreally that's hilarious yeah um we've\nbeen on the phone with some crazy people\nRose Macwan who was the guy who the guy\nhad the triple filtered VA the rap guy\noh um shoot we were on with a lot of\nmusicians yeah a lot of rappers and H\nTriple filtered yeah anyway who was that\nand so we we were doing all that kind of\nstuff and I was like Megan we're pretty\nmuch the marketing department for this\ncompany why don't we just go do it for\nourselves yeah I mean that makes sense\nso I like the thoughtful stuff that I\nalways do just\nquit CU I'm like I'm done you quit but\nyou stayed on one day a week well that\nwas the thing no I quit so they said to\nme if you'll stay on one day a week\nwe'll pay you this much okay which\nwas probably more than Megan was Mak it\nwas so I had to come in one day a week\nthat's insane stupid yeah and but I was\nthey weren't using me so like it I\nactually ended up quitting quitting\nbecause you would sit and I could have\nsat there and just collected money every\nFriday but I was like I want to\nconcentrate on what I'm trying to build\nhere can I ask you about the Boda real\nquick yeah I was thinking 50 Cent it\nwasn't 50 cent no was it oh it was P\nDiddy then no well tell me the parties\nyou guys have been\nto uh it was it pitol no no interesting\nthose are the those are like the main\nones coming up yeah I don't think it got\noff the ground oh okay but um yeah so\nwe I ended up quitting and starting big\nrun media and Meg was in the background\nand she was like it wasn't never like\nMegan wasn't working on Big Run media\nbut I quit and I was working on that and\neven to the point where I decided I\ndidn't even want the money\nfrom um the one day week and I looked\ninto the situation where uh a person\nLaura panny uh i' done a Twitter thing\nabout running in social media and she\nworked at athlinks and she's like do you\nthink he could write a guide to social\nmedia for race directors okay I'm like\nyeah I could do that yeah so I made a a\nguide to social media and as bad as my\nwriting can be this actually came out\npretty well in my head well if you\nremember I\nlike we said yes and then you're like\nyou can you you work with all these\nsocial media people you can you can\nfigure this out and I was literally\nGoogling stuff as I was writing stuff\ninto this document like it was insane\nthat we said we could do that no I I\ndidn't think it was because I felt like\nwe were doing all that stuff it we were\nnot okay anyway so we we designed this\nbeautiful guy it looked great yeah and\nuh she's like\nlook I'll give you the leads anybody who\ndownloads this I'll give you their email\naddress okay and at this time I'm\nthinking I'm going to be working with\nBrands doing marketing for like a new\nbalance an as6 an Adidas like brand\ncampaigns like social media campaigns\nfor him I'd never ever thought of races\nor race directors or anything like that\nbut I was like okay I've got time right\nnow starting the business we put it out\nwe got all the leads back I started\nsending like in the back of the booklet\nit also said if you don't want to do\nthis big run media can do it for you\nyeah and so we started getting all these\nleads and within three months of me\nleaving full-time social toaster uh I\ncalled Megan I said hey if you want to\ncome over we have enough money now to\nsupport you and and which was crazy if\nyou think about it now that that was the\ncase yeah so Megan Megan came over and\nwe started uh big run media and I was\nstill doing believe in the run on the\nside and I started doing like YouTube\nvideos just because I was like well it's\nGoogle if I put those videos on the site\nmaybe I'll get better SEO yeah and I had\ndecent SEO because I like at that time\nagain there weren't a ton of right\ncompetition it wasn't that hard I just\nused like yast SEO to figure out the\nkeywords and all that stuff yeah and um\nit was the site was doing well and at\nthe same time we were going to a\nbusiness advisor we pay I paid a guy to\nkind of like coach Us in starting the\nbusiness and he's like what's this\nbelieve in the run and I'm like well\nthat's actually and I start getting all\nexcited and talking about cuz that's\nwhere my passion was mhm and me was like\nyeah yeah\nand the guy was like no how many people\nhe's like this website traffic's pretty\ngood he's like you guys have something\nhere and we're like well I'm like well\nwhat do we have and he's like I don't\nknow but like this is good and then I\nactually had a guy come to do the um big\nrun media website help and he's like uh\nwe want to work on believe in the Run\nnot uh big run media and he's like this\nsite's actually this is your site we're\nlike no no no we need to focus over here\nstill uhhuh so we kept like\navoiding cuz we couldn't see a clear\npath to believe the Run being a revenue\ngenerator that could sustain two people\nor one yeah or any human being so it was\ngreat yeah we got free gear we got free\nstuff but it it I just didn't see we\ncouldn't do that leap um and you know so\nwe continue doing it always a passion\nproject I probably spent 50% of my time\non believe in the Run 50% of my time on\non Big Run media uh clients and stuff\nlike that mag was still doing reviews\nand stuff but I think you were\ndefinitely hyperfocused on big run at\nthat time yeah I mean if you remember we\ntook on way more clients than we could\npossibly retain and most of the people\nthat that we worked with thought we were\na team of 12 yeah everybody thought\nthey're like how big is your team we're\nlike ah we just would avoid that\nquestion all the time and be like yeah\nour team back home is great and yeah it\nwas just us for several years and Yeah\nwe actually had to hire our first\nemployee because we were going to a\nwedding my brother's wedding in Ireland\nand we couldn't possibly maintain the\nwork while we were away that was Rachel\nyeah um who you know cuz she was there\nwhen you got there and then uh we got\nfortunate enough that\nwe every time something that was bad\nhappened it was a good thing yeah\nso we ended up um moving out of the\noffice that we were in and Robbie came\non board and we talked about in Robbie's\npodcast how the magnetism of working on\nbelieve in the Run kind of led to that\nand uh like I was like oh this is fun we\ngot I got a partner who also wants to be\ndoing this yeah to Megan I Megan and I\nprobably had a couple arguments about\nhow much time that we were spending on\nuh believe it or not well it's hard when\nyou're the person working on the side\nthat creates the revenue versus the side\nthat doesn't which is more fun yeah yeah\nno it makes sense I'm not judging but um\nyeah and you know it's\nbeen it it is also strange like the\npandemic it really did change the\ndynamic of believe in the run it's the\nreason what it is today yeah I I think\nthere's yeah certain pieces came\ntogether I think that you know certainly\nRobbie you coming on and and being uh a\ndriving force in in some of the things\nthat we're doing the fact that like we\ntalked about that the brands didn't know\nreally what to do during the pandemic\nand we were an outlet for for them uh is\nand I I have to say like even M Baker is\nI think a huge reason that you know I he\ntook a chance on us kind of put us in a\nspotlight where then other people saw us\nand they were like hey if they're doing\nit with you we want to do it with you\nand it kind of landslide and that's even\nin the reviews like if we you know like\nif we do a a shoe review we we get all\nthe shoes but if we do like a poll\nreview for hiking MH 20 other poll\ncompanies will call us sunglasses yeah\nright yeah like we're like hey we don't\nnobody ever sends us sunglasses we do\none sunglass review it's like Landslide\nof sunglasses comeing I also think\nthough like even in\nearlier when we were talking about when\nyou first started there was no one else\nlike no other Sho reviewers no one\nputting out that type of content and the\nones that were around at that time\naren't necessarily around now and I\nthink part of the reason believeing the\nrun is so successful is because you've\nkept it alive the whole time it's been\nso consistent I was thinking of Robbie's\num he ended his podcast with kind of\nlike his advice which was like\nmanifesting sort of like what you want\nand I I was thinking my biggest thing\nthat I would recommend to\npeople like this this wasn't a linear I\nwant to do believe in the Run we do\nbelieve in the Run kind of thing it kind\nof hopped all over the place and we just\nkind of stuck with it but the main thing\nthat I think is a value over almost\neverything else is\nconsistency and like staying and true to\nyourself and doing the things over and\nover and I I especially when we started\nthe business and there's those days\nwhere you wake up and you're like I\ndon't know what I'm doing and I was just\nlike just do one thing that will move\nthe company forward just do one thing\ntoday that will move things forward and\nnow I have a team so I\nforget how much like there's I think one\nadvantage we have and this is why I love\nhaving a team so much and I I the people\nwho are Solo doing something like what\nwe do I don't get it because\none having a team uh like Robbie's\ncreativity and genius when it comes to\nwriting you're like a genius when it\ncomes to organization and business and\nthen I feel like on the creative side I\nthink I bring a lot of skills that way\nbut we can flux so like if one of us is\noff or having a bad day or a bad week\neven like you are right now\nthe other people can carry the water and\nit's like I feel so fortunate that we've\nbuilt a team and we're expanding it even\nwith Taylor that we have a team of\npeople that each one is really valuable\nin my opinion and I look at it and I\nfeel so fortunate to be surrounded by\npeople\nthat are we're all on the same Mission\nlike sometimes I I know that we'll get\nirritated with each other from time to\ntime but it's usually about something\nthat is like\na difference of opinion on how to grow\nbelieve in the run or how to solve a\nproblem that solves a problem for beli\nin the Run yeah and stuff like that so\nlike for me while yes I get you know\nthis is like where we're getting to for\nme is definitely like a dream come true\nand to live a life that we get to live\nand travel and do this stuff is\ninsane is pretty insane and like we made\nthis there there's this job didn't exist\nI know that's when some people ask kind\nof what I do hard to describe but I do\nsay it's like could never exist outside\nof whatever time frame this is right\nlike it's impossible yeah you could CU\n10 years ago you couldn't I couldn't\neven predict this even 10 years ago even\nthough you had Believe it or on you\ncouldn't actually I don't think there\nwas a way to really make money off it at\nthe time like even if you wanted to like\nI don't even if you did the same steps\nand everything it condensed it I don't\nknow if you could really maybe 10 or 15\nyears ago but that there wasn't enough\nsocial media there wasn't enough\ninstagam wasn't even around yeah like\nthat wasn't a real thing that is the\ncrazy thing\nabout like money was never the goal yeah\nand I think that's the other thing that\nwhen we look at the environment and the\nspace that we're in M with money not\nbeing the goal I see a lot of people\ncoming into it now that money is the\ngoal yeah and like oh for sure even if\neven if we\ndidn't even if for some reason the\nrevenue went away it'd be tough for us\nto pay salaries but if it went away I\nthink in some format or another we'd\nstill be doing what we did well that's\nwhy\nand I'm not like obviously we're not\ngoing to give away all the business\nSecrets but I would say there's plenty\nof times where\nwe'll work with Brands who Runner world\nisn't going to work with outside isn't\ngoing to work with because they just\nstarted and they don't have a way to get\nin or well like if we think of Brands\ncool like smaller Brands I mean path\nprojects is we've been work you've\nworked with them before I was there when\nthey first started I don't think I've\nthere's been a day that has gone by in\nthe last year where I'm not wearing one\npiece of path projects between their\nunderwear no I'm wearing them right now\ni' that's why I'm not so quiet the bass\nlayer on the\nyeah um but they but for and there's\nthere's just been other brands who will\nreach out and I'm like yeah I want to\nhelp you I don't we don't get a kickback\nfor stuff like even the satisfy podcast\nthat we did\nin uh at TR it was like yeah we just\nlike we we that'd be cool to talk to\nScott plenty of plenty of other outlets\nwould charge whatever yeah there's a\ndifference between I mean obviously it's\na business and we have to that that but\nno I don't think think I don't think\nthat's wrong I think that that we still\nare fans of the sport and fans of the\nspace yeah so if there's an opportunity\nthat arises that you know maybe it's\nit's with a a partner that isn't you\nknow nor a normal person we'd work with\nthat being a fan we're not going to turn\nsomething down if we think it's\nworthwhile and benefits it but it's it's\nboth yeah obviously in a lot of cases\nI'd say there's certain that are paid\nfor but it's kind of like what feels the\nyou know I mean yeah what feels\nauthentic what feels like the right way\nto approach it or the right thing to do\ninstead of always\nbeing like certain Outlets that are\nmilking every single drop out of\nsomething that they can yeah I don't\nknow we don't have to talk about that\nyeah I guess I I say we but we do things\nbecause we like to do it and we work\nwith people because we like to work with\nthem it's not because you're trying to\nhit a revenue Mark and we don't have any\ninvestors and we don't have any uh we're\nnot under the\ngun you at least not right now I mean\nhow many things have we have you turned\ndown we turned down that because it just\ndidn't fit right or it wasn't uh it felt\ntoo disingenuous yeah too dising exactly\nwell that's the thing people don't know\nthat they don't know it but that's the\nthe thing like we are not going to take\nevery opportunity we're not going to\ntake every sponsor and we're in a luxury\nspot that we're able to do that uh so\nI'm not hating on people that don't do\nthat but but I feel like if you're in\nthe space like right now you're saying\nlike if you have if it's just you and\nyour own Instagram that's a hard uh Rock\nit's a hard thing to draw water from and\nso you're you have to take things that\nyou don't believe in to make money on\nthere I'm sorry but you do like you just\ndo and that I I really do feel like one\nof my proudest things about um believe\nor well there's a couple things uh and\nI'll wrap up because we'll probably need\nto wrap up but I already canceled my 1\npm because pass it I was going to say\nthe things that I'm proud of one is that\nwe've built a a strong team and I think\nthat to me it's exciting that\nthis this idea this concept was able to\ngrow into something that could\nsupport a team of people to live and and\nthat we're able to grow and even have\nlike I mean we're up to seven people now\nthat we have on payroll and not just\nlike support them to live but like\ncreate these experiences that you'll\nremember forever yeah like going to the\nOlympics right going to Tokyo going to\nParis going to Venice like those are\nthings that I mean I never dreamed we'd\never do yeah and not not just that but\nobviously from the and this is something\nI meant to say in my podcast which I\nmight bring up again cuz I still I felt\nbad about once I left because you asked\nme which I'll ask you too what's your\nfavorite memory memory or if you could\npoint to one thing what's your favorite\nthing about believe in the run and in my\nmind I was thinking business or just\nrunning experience\nbut it's for me it's definitely the\ncommunity or people because when you\nshow up to an event and there's like 500\npeople there or whatever who listen a\nlot of people who listen to this podcast\nhonestly it's like crazy and it's\nawesome meeting them running them with\nthem just doing stuff like that but I\ndon't for you I mean guessing I know for\nyou it's kind of the same but well yeah\nbefore I get there the other thing that\nI think that I'm really proud of uh as\nfar as what we do and I and I believe\nthat it's again goes back to the team\nbut we've we keep ourselves in check\nabout our values of being authentic and\nthere is there's nothing that's come out\nof here where I'm like oh that that that\nwas gross like we we fudged a little bit\nor we lied yeah or we Mis like\nmisrepresented uh to our audience like\nthe fact that we've\nmaintained\nan whether people like it our opinion or\nnot it is our opinion we don't we've\nnever\nthere's no grayline in what we do I feel\nlike to our audience we've always been\nhonest and true and I don't think that's\nas easy as people especially when you're\nbuilding a business I don't think it's\nas\neasy or you can say emphatically the way\nthat I feel that we can that we have\nstayed true to our values to be honest\nand and you see us work with Brands and\none of the first things we talk to the\nbrands about\nis reviews aren't paid we can't accept\nmoney for reviews MH they and even if\nit's a shoe that you want us to be\npromoting with an event we're still\ngoing to write the review or talk about\nthe shoe in the way that's authentic to\nus which you know it was a little\nnerve-wracking at first but the\ncompanies seem to understand that that's\nwe lose our audience if we lose\nthat Honesty with them right yeah okay\nso favorite memory or experience or\nwhatever it is I I will go it might be\nrecency bias but Robbie brought it up my\nhead like every time that we travel I\nthink it's\neven it's one thing when we go to like\nBoston New York or Chicago and we see a\nlarge group of people who feel like\nthey're part of our community come out\nthat's that's an amazing feeling um but\nwhen we've gone abroad to Tokyo or to\nGermany or to London and people come out\nbecause they feel connected to us that\nto me is super special that we're able\nto reach people that I never even\nimagined that would want to be part of\nour community\num the other thing I love is that we\nrarely ask our audience for anything\nthere's no patreon account there's no\nyeah uh paid subscription to our website\nthere's no we we I think what we do is\nwe give like we we give the reviews we\ngive the the entertainment the podcast\nwe don't ask you for it we'll get\nsponsors to help cover the cost but even\nwhen we do an event like we always want\nto have a piece of Swag for you or have\nsomething a thank you for\nbeing you know a for being part of our\nour whatever it is we're doing I feel\nlike even our parties is like we want to\ngive and I think that we tend to give\nmore than we take yeah I mean it's comes\nout of a budget\nsomewhere but that you know I I don't\nknow when I look at and try to see the\ndifference or if there's somebody that I\nthink is a competitor and stuff I'm like\nare they\ndoing what we do are they giving back to\npeople are they providing right you know\nwhat we provide to people yeah and I\ndon't think there is a lot lot of that\nout there well no I mean certainly with\ndifferent places they have investors\nthat they need to hit a bottom line or\neverything else and I mean not saying\nthat the employees there don't want to\ndo the best that they can and but you\nthey have to work within a certain set\nof boundaries they only have can only do\nso much yeah but that's the nice thing\nabout being completely independent by\nthe way having a website is like a huge\npart of that because you get the control\nlike that's the one thing yeah we talk\nabout that all the time yeah I just like\nthere's I think any other platform it's\nlike you're really beholden to the\nshifting stands of whatever that\nInstagram's algorithm yeah if YouTube\nrecommends your video uh I mean there's\nso many different factors when you don't\nown the\nplatform but I also you know like I\nalways even just forget like our emails\nlike how much value is in that's the\nthing is like people don't it's just in\nthe now nowadays people don't think\nabout email and website but they're\nstill the two most valuable things you\nhave 15,000 people opening an email\nevery week that's insane value yeah it's\nlike straight up yeah but people don't\nget that and you know not sexy we took\nwe took a risk on getting purchasing\nthis building yeah but I you did yeah I\nmean you're part of the company so if I\ngo down but uh the but this has turned\nout like we built a community here with\nthe B the believe run club that meets\nhere every Thursday which I have to say\nagain the team carries the water on that\none that's Helen and and you know Ryan\nto a certain degree are are pretty much\nyou know the stewards of the Thursday\nnight run group and keep that Community\ngoing but then when we have an event\nwhere uh sponsors wants to do something\nfrom our headquarters all those people\nshow up because they're used to you know\nhaving that\nsupport and being part of this community\nso I mean it's just it to me I feel like\nwe we are living a completely Charmed\nexistence right now so yeah absolutely\nokay and future future looking what are\nyou most excited about for 2025 oh just\n2025 I thought you were going to go even\ndeeper than that I mean if you want to I\nmean longterm the next 30 Years what\ndoes that look like long term I\nwant us to to build something that there\ncan be f us is taken care of yeah like I\nwould love like I don't want believe in\nrun to\nnecessarily be just the three of us and\nthe extended family but like I want us\nto bring in talent and cultivate people\nthat are passionate about what we are\nand can continue and grow the business\nin ways that we haven't imagined the\nways like if you look back from when\nRobbie first started with us we couldn't\nimagine where we are now right I mean\nit's insane just the difference between\nwhen you started and now um so like\nthat's the the goal is to figure out how\nthis grows and\ncontinues into the future so that's\nthat's one thing that I'm excited about\nfor the future but\n2025 I am possibly committed to to a 35\nmile run through the\nAlps and uh you know I haven't been a\nlittle scared in a while and the idea of\ntraining for a\nmountain uh run 35 miles after travel\nand all that stuff it's kind of got me\nexcited about running again like not\nthat I'm not excited but like I know\ngood or bad I can run a marathon yeah uh\nwhich how many marthon have you run uh\nI'm I'm not exact the exact number but\nit's over 40 okay that's insane yeah so\nI kind of stopped counting I thought I\nwas closer to 50 I think I thought so\ntoo I thought like 48 or something I\nthink you're at 50 I I don't think so I\ndon't know um but yeah so I want to run\nLondon well if London happens to be the\nmarathon something ring still yeah still\nunsure about that but um and then uh\ngoing to shamani and uh doing the\nOCC race yeah it it's got me it's got me\nlike okay I'm excited to I'm gon to have\nto start running the hills running the\ntrails yeah and uh I'm like this is this\nwill be a good uh challenge for me and\nthen you know if that goes well I know\nthat I'll come off the that mountain and\nrun a fall Marathon really well yeah um\nthat'd be awesome but uh yeah and that I\nguess I'm excited about even the\nweightlifting Journey that we're doing\nlike to see how that affects everything\ndid you do before picture I did all\nright I it's it's horrendous it's so\nscary um but then there's you know the\npersonal stuff like Megan and the boys\nand all that stuff that you know I hope\nI'm hoping that 2025 is a great year for\nus so yeah you know definitely Theo I'll\nwill be doing his first uh Spring Track\nyeah so awesome yeah cool all right all\nright another really long podcast for\neveryone hopefully you enjoyed it yep\nyeah I like it that's good all right\nthanks for coming on I blacked out\nduring part of it I don't know I don't\nknow what happened all right bye

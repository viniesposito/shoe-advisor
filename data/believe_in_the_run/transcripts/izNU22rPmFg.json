  "text": "hi I'm Thomas with believe the run this\nis Robbie with believe the run and we're\ngoing to go over our most exciting shoes\nfor 2025 that we're looking forward to\nbut before we get into that make sure\nyou stay at the end because we're going\nto tease out some stuff that maybe we\naren't supposed to be talking about yeah\nwell we'll\n[Music]\nsee new year new us new shoes new\neverything new new burger new readinger\nand it doesn't work but we're here we're\nexcited we are excited there's some\nreally cool stuff coming out in 2025 we\ncouldn't contain our excitement so we\nthought Robbie what should we do let's\njust make a list of our most exciting\nshoes of 2025 I don't even know if all\nthese shoes are going to be good or not\nI'm just excited about them let's start\nout we're going to go alphabetical order\nfor this list so no favorites just\nstraight A to Z there's no Z but uh\nwe're going to start out with Adidas or\nThomas likes to say let's talk about the\nevos first okay so controversial cuz\nsome people already have it in 24 but\nwe're calling it a 2025 sh the wide\nrelease is in March 2025 this shoe is\ngoing to be I'm I'm predicting this is\ngoing to be your Tailor Swift of shoes\nthis next year everybody's going to be\nclamoring to get get these and I think\nthat you're going to see it on a lot of\nRunners feeds if you belong to a run\nclub or something like that get ready\nthis is going to be it I mean I feel\nlike even if you're not it's going to be\na lifestyle shoe for a lot of people I\nmean it's a great shoe it's we're\ntalking about $150 price point a l\nstrike Pro\nmidsole classic silhouette it's looking\ngood it's coming like I said coming in\nwide release in March I don't know this\nis going to W all right let's move on\nnext shoe uh let's go into the Adidas\nadios Pro 4 that's again also saw uh\nsomewhat of a release here in December\nbut that's going to be you know gearing\nup for those spring races and this one\nwe got to run a marathon in and we can\ntell you right now it's a banger yeah\nit's probably my favorite race stue\nright now there's need a little more\nroom in the toe box I feel like if you\ngo half size up that'll fix things but\nor are they going to change that just in\nproduction you think oh maybe they will\nI don't know but I love that shoe uh\nit's just like a better so much better\nversion of the uh adios Pro 3 bouncy\nFast Fun Great upper that's going to be\na good one yeah it's punchy let's move\non to the next brand we're talking about\nBrooke\nBrooks has turned things around I know I\ncan't say that I've been that excited\nabout Brooks in the last couple years\nwe're excited about a lot of the models\ngetting some upgrades in 2025 so we're\ntalking about the glycerin Max 2\nspecifically which is going to see a DNA\ngold top layer that's the peba style\nmidsole material that they're going to\nbe coming out with and I feel like\nthat's going to be a really nice one and\nthen also with the DNA gold is the\nBrooks Hyperion Elite the PB four PB and\nthe five yeah I've already run in the\nfour PB it's a big Improvement welcome\nto the dance Brooks we're so happy\nyou're here now and that shoe works and\nthen the five just has some style points\nI mean the one they showed us looked\nlike it was like the racer from Speed\nRacer yeah the mach five or what not the\nmach five what was the blue racer guy\nthe zero yeah yeah yeah it looks good\nanyway I never actually watched Speed\nRacer so oh really yeah I was like I was\nin that in between time of life so the\nPB version which is kind of the H\nhyperian Elite 4 and a half basically\nthat's coming in February for 250 fall\nis the Hyperion Elite 5 all right let's\nmove on dude Hoka Hoka had some good\nstuff come out 2024 we're seeing some\nupdates to some things mainly C clo X1\n2.0 which is I don't know seems like a\ncode to get into some nuclear missile\nsilo but it's still a name for some\nreason that's what the drones are\nlooking for is the name of the next TOA\nshoe probably so that's their\n$275 race day shoe slup Sho SL daily\ntrainer Thomas's this is the Hope is\nthat it's be going to move it fully into\nthe race day shoe some changes to the\nupper little tweaking of the midsole I\nthink that it's going to lighten it up a\nlittle bit and maybe yeah maybe it'll be\nthat shoe that you're picking for race\nday I mean I felt like the first version\nof the shoe was the most fun shoe maybe\nI've ever run in and so I'm hoping that\nall carries over to this version as well\nwhat was a shoe that we all love but\nseemed to cause problems for people yeah\nso the Hoka Mach X2 2024 was such a\ngreat shoe maybe would have won shoe of\nthe year except for the heel collar\nwhich tore people's ankles to Pieces\nthey should have called the Hoka razor\nyeah Sketchers and Hoka could have\nfinally collabed together yeah anyway so\nthey fixed that heel counter and the\ncollar and it's pretty much the exact\nsame midsole which we loved and the\nplate and it just that shoe is just so\nmuch fun to run in so we're really\nexcited to see more people enjoy that\nshoe yeah and that'll be coming in I\nthink late summer early fall for 190 so\ndefinitely stick around for that one and\nthen this year I didn't even know about\nhalf the stuff hoko was bringing out\nuntil it came out right so who knows\nyeah there could be other bangers in\nthere all right next up let's talk about\nthe mauno Neo Zen which we actually have\nhere it's actually out now I think the\nfull full release is January 1st we've\nbeen running in this shoe so we can tell\nyou that this is a shoe you want to be\nexcited about it's exciting the price is\nexciting the fit is exciting the foam is\nexciting if they don't change anything\nwith the fit which I don't think they\nare right now the only thing I have to\nsay about the shoe is go a half size\ndown yep but bouncy underfoot soft soft\nfoot bouncy it harnesses all that\nfeeling that we loved in the Neo Vista\ninto a more I don't know normal trainer\ndaily trainer what I like about it the\nNeo Vista was a lot of fun but that wide\ngape in the middle made it a little\nunstable because you had those two rails\nbasically of rubber on the side so with\nthis not having that plate in that\nValley this one feels a lot more stable\nbut you still have all that cush yeah I\nthink this uh it was this TPU midsole I\nthink uh people are going to be a little\nbit surprised by what maunu is coming\nwith if you haven't experienced yet or\nthe Muno comeback I think this is going\nto be the one enery next yeah all right\nThomas let's move on to New Balance one\nof my favorite shoes is the rebel MH\nit's had some ups and downs but the\nrebel four was great and it just need a\nlittle tweak to make it even better and\nI think the rebel V5 is going to be that\ntweak all right and I don't know how\nmuch we're allowed to talk about it\nright now but we could tell you it's\ncoming we tell you that it's probably\ngoing to be good and it comes in a lot\nof good colorways all right and then we\nalso have the New Balance SC Elite V5 so\nthat's the carbon plated race stue\nThomas that's uh also seeing some\nupgrades I believe I think they've been\nlistening to the people they're bringing\nthat platform in a little bit it's going\nto be lighter it's going to be more race\nlike it's going to have a little more I\nthink that's what the I think that's\nwhat we want it was a the SC Elite has\nalways been a little bit too uh\nconservative nice nice Comfort over a\nmarathon but sometimes you want a little\nbit more aggressiveness so hope hope we\nget that I think we're going to get that\nat least from what I'm seeing all right\ncool let's move on to Nike there were\nsome shoes in 2024 that we were excited\nabout coming in the year like the\nalphafly but honestly besides that there\nwasn't much else feel like things are\nstarting to change it's starting to tip\none of these shoes I've already run in\nand really had a good time running it\nit's very nice I enjoyed reviewing it\nthe price tag is a little heavy but\nwe're talking about the Pegasus premium\nright so that's a\n$210 shoe that's coming in Spring 2025\nnow a lot of people have seen this shoe\nand they they say this is BS this is a\nlifestyle shoe what are you talking\nabout this is a running shoe it has a\nfull layer of Air Zoom in it uh has some\nzoomx foam but what what's been your\nexperience in this shoe it's really fun\nlike it is a heavy shoe on the scale but\nbecause of the zumax and the air you\nknow coming in there you really get a\nbounce and a lot of energy return so\nlike I was doing long double digit miles\nand the shoe just sang it just felt\ngreat it never felt heavy on my feet and\nmy legs felt great afterwards I don't\nknow what more you could ask for all\nright for a shoe like that and so in\ncase you haven't watched our running uh\na videos from the running event which\nyou should do the Nike is moving things\nshifting things around moving shoes\naround getting rid of some other models\nso we're not going to see the Invincible\nanymore we're not going to see the\nInfinity Run so they're moving them into\nthese different silos or categories\neither they going to be the peg the\nvomero or the structure yeah and one of\nthem we're really excited about is a\nVero that's their cushioning platform\nand there's some crazy looking stuff\ncoming out of there yeah so there's\ngoing to be the standard model of those\nshoes and there's going to be the plus\nand the premium and you'll see different\naspect you can you can kind of figure it\nout from the shoes that we've seen\nalready in the Pegasus plus and the\nPegasus premium kind of where where\ntheir shoes are going to fall into in\nthose categor\nso we've seen a couple of them I think\npeople are going to be interest like\nit's I think it'll also be divisive I'll\nsay yeah it's going to shake things up\nbut here's the thing that we're seeing a\ntrend across the board is that lifestyle\nshoe and that performance shoe they're\nstarting to like kind of bring them\ntogether where you're having shoes that\nnot only look great and interesting but\nthey're also going to perform yeah I\nthink with the rise of the Run clubs the\nmore social aspect uh just running in\ngeneral becoming more popular yeah I\nthink that we are starting to see that\nkind of molding melding of the two and\nspeaking of that was a little segue but\nspeaking of running becoming more\nmainstream in public more Runners are\ngetting at you know people started in\nthe pandemic or in the soci social clubs\nor the running clubs are now increasing\ntheir distances maybe doing their first\nmarathon and now we have a first time\nMarathon or shoe in the on cloud boom\nMax yes and what's exciting about this\none is it's really designed for somebody\nwho's going to be out there a little bit\nlonger so you're 330 and above Marathon\nthis shoe is supposed to be more\nefficient supposed to help you get\nthrough the marathon more comfortable\nand it looks great too yeah and we've\nseen that with these shoes like the\nSolomon slab Spectre which has been\ngeared towards 330 and slower\nmarathoners that we're I feel like\nthat's a thing uh Niche that brands are\nleaning into is that firsttime\nmarathoner or slower marathoner who need\nmaybe needs a little bit more support or\ncushion or Comfort over over the\nmarathon you're still getting all the\npremium right like ingredients but it's\nput into a setup that's going to be\nbetter for you like okay if you're going\nto be the tip of the spear and you're\nrunning in our premium race stue that we\ndevelop for the top athletes you're\ngoing to not get the benefits of having\nsome of the stability and stuff that as\nyour form breaks down over the marathon\nfor someone who's out there for 2 hours\nand 9 Minutes 2 hours and 10 minutes\nversus somebody who's out there for 3\nhours and 30 and above these shoes are\ngoing to have a better experience for\nyou in the Long Haul so it's not\nnecessarily like Hey we're gatekeeping\nthe technology it's like hey this might\nactually give you a better experience\nnext up this is another shoe that you've\nrun in Thomas we have you and Megan are\nboth running it but the salony Endorphin\nElite 2 love it I absolutely love this\nshoe now we were just talking about\nshoes that were built for that 330 and\nabove marathoner and then there's a\ndifferent shoe for the you know Pinnacle\nRunner this shoe I feel like works for\nboth it's kind of dynamic the way the\nfoam changes when you're running in it\nyeah so that has the all new incred run\nfoam which you came up with that name\ndidn't you okay if you don't put that on\nme Ricky Bobby uh the incred Run phone\nwhich is a soft bouncy lightweight\nmagical fo in your hand you can squeeze\nit like a marshmallow it's like but once\nyou start running and especially when\nyou start picking up the pace somehow\ngets denser so while you're running say\nmore easy Paces it feels great because\nit's nice and bouncy and soft but as you\nstart to pick it up instead of it being\nlike that situation we talked about in\nother shoes where if it's soft it starts\nto feel like you're running through sand\nthe shoe actually kind of like changes\nas you're going through your speed and\nas you put that pressure on the foam\nit's really Dynamic and the shoe is so\nmuch fun to run in I really like it I\nthink it's probably one of the better\nrace day shoes I've run in Period across\nthe board and I think it will work for\njust about everybody and I think that's\ncoming in at the\n$275 price point in Spring 2025 mhm\ncontinuing with sakon we have another\npopular very popular shoe I think it's\none of the most visited reviews on both\nYouTube and our website theorin speed 4\nis seeing an update to guess the\nEndorphin speed five wait they're not\nskipping a number that's amazing yeah uh\nthey're not norda so they're staying to\nthe normal uh numbering sequence so\nwe're going to the endorf speed five\nthat's going to be an exciting shoe I\nmean hopefully it's not an exciting shoe\nit's so well- loved that it's hopefully\njust a continuation of what makes the\nspeed a great sh yeah I think they're\ntrying to make it even a little bit more\naggressive back to the kind of what we\nloved in the speed one and two so we'll\nsee hopefully that works out again it's\njust a great versatile shoe that\neverybody loves and and they're going to\nrelease it in the mutant color way which\nis somehow a five years later now a\nHeritage a Heritage color I mean with\nthe attention span these days that does\nseem like a long time doesn't it I mean\nanything before Co seems like decades\nago so fair enough all right moving on\nlet's get to the sketch um honestly the\nwhole Sketchers line I'm just at they're\nback almost yeah it's it's mostly just\nSketchers they're back we thought they\nwere just gone I thought Sketcher\nperformance was done for yeah and then\nwe tried a couple of their shoes on\nwhile we were at the running event I\nhave to say they're they're they're good\nyeah they have a whole new Arrow line\ncoming out so it's three different shoes\none's like a Max cushion super\ntrainer uh like a Tempo shoot the vault\nis a race Tempo shoot that was the one I\nkind of was into yeah that's I think\nsome people I think people are going to\nlike that and they're using their\nhyperburst foam they nitrogen Infuse\nsuper critical um I think they they've\nalways done that well so they were The\nOriginators they were so I'm excited to\nsee what's coming from them all right\nnext one's a weird one I didn't expect\nthis to be on here we're talking about\nspeedland for the road yeah for road so\nwe're talking about the speed RX\nfpy which is again a lot so this is\nspeedland athlete Don reel's first or\nsignature shoe and it's a road model\nthat employs the speedland boa fit\nsystem with the dials on top but it also\nhas this midsole that takes a page from\nthe Adidas Pro Evo 1 Playbook which is\nit's an uncompressed block of foam that\nwas basically cut out into a very\nlightweight shoe for how much stack and\nsubstantial elements there are to it I\nthink it's going to be an interesting\nshoe I tried it on they give you two\noptions you can put a plate in it or not\nhave a plate in it I tried on both and I\nhave to say without the plate I and\nnormally I would be like I think I'm\ngoing to like without the plate because\nI like that cush I like that balance it\nwas almost too balancy too squishy\nwithout the plate I put the one on with\nthe plate and I was like all right this\nfeels amazing this one's not cheap if\nyou've got the cash and you want to shoe\nthat you could do that long distance\nit's going to be going right up against\nshoes like mounted Coast or something\nlike that where you're going to be\nlooking for that Ultra distant shoe for\nthe road\nyeah and I so that's it's you said it's\nnot cheap it is $299 I think pre-orders\nopen up shortly uh deliveries in April\nit's going to be an interesting shoe for\nsure all right Thomas last in the shoes\nwe can talk about category just tell me\nit's something that's foot shape you got\nit dude it's your lucky day talking\nabout the toppo athletic Cyclone 3 this\nis kind one of those sleeper hits that a\nlot of people\nespecially maybe people who have\ndefected from the ultra call\nuh have moved on to too athletic the\nCyclone 3 is a very simple daily Trainer\nslmo shoe with a full pack midsole 5 mm\ndrop 5mm drop uh only 20 mm second of\nheel this is that shoe for all those\npeople that are complaining that shoes\nare getting too stacked and too cushiony\nand too that this one feels low to the\nground fast grab it we actually have it\nyeah we do have it um it's quick in the\nturnover it's light like if you've been\ncomplaining that things are getting too\nstacked too cushy this is going to be\nyour shoe yeah that's what 7.4 ounces\nfor your men size 10 and a half now with\nthe pack midsole it's got to be\nexpensive right 150 coming in h February\n2025 so there we go as you might have\nnoticed we didn't do trail shoes in this\nvideo our lead Trail reviewer Taylor\nBine of the dirt division he's out in\nColorado he'll probably give you a\npreview but what I'm excited for\npersonally the norda 005 that's I feel\nlike that's going to be an awesome shoe\nwe wore that for an entire week we did\nwe actually running it it's that's I'm\nexcited about that we saw the satisfy\nthe rocker that looks like it's going to\nbe a great shoe you could probably guess\nit's not going to be super cheap but\nsome cool stuff into that the North Face\nis doing some awesome things normal L\nsportiva uh dude there I feel like Trail\nis hitting its stride right now where\nthere's just some crazy models coming\nout from all kinds of Brands uh we have\nour most exciting ch shoes of 2025\npreview on the site it's like 16 or 17\nshoes over there make Taylor get in\nfront of a camera and read them off yeah\nyeah maybe we'll make him do that so\ncheck that out but let's move on to\nmaybe like the secret under embargo\nsegment we can't really say much about\nsome of these shoes but I'll see what\nThomas does so he gets in trouble for it\nand I don't so take it away Thomas all\nright look I hyped up a shoe really bad\nand when it came out it was a\ndisappointment this is in 202 three yeah\nit was like I was like it's going to\nchange the running it's the greatest\nshoe ever and that was the Prime X\nstrung 2 yeah when we got here I think I\nstill believe that we tried on a\nprototype shoe that didn't quite make it\nto production for sure this year though\nI tried on the prime\nxung\nthree and they said it was in Final\nPhase so it should be what comes out and\nif it is I'm going to say again man I\ncan't wait for this year all right I'm\nI'm not saying anything but I also\ndidn't try it on so or at least in my\nsize anyways I'm also excited an update\nto one of our favorite shoes the Boston\n12 is coming yeah and you can probably\nguess what other Adidas shoes are Tumi\nsen season upgrade every year that's\nalways been one of our favorite uptempo\nshoes 5K 10K Racers so that's I'm sure\nwill be exciting as well cuz we've also\nseen the the the super Foams the really\nnice Foams kind of start trickling down\ninto everything now which you may have\nnoticed from some of the previews\nalready and I think that's going to be\nexciting and moving the ball forward as6\nhas some stuff coming that's pretty sick\ndude as6 is going to be hitting it out\nof the park you're going to see\nsomething from them may got to test out\none of their shoes that we can't even\ntalk about that is right up there with\nthe Pinnacle of what's available on the\nrace day today and she\nsaid it's is comparable to the top stuff\nas you can get and watching Thomas on\nThe Struggle Bus I want to tell you what\nit\nisor it's amazing uh it's going to be\ngreat and I also know that they're\nworking on some other shoes we've heard\nsome names thrown around that I won't\nrepeat because they're telling me that\nit's not that name but I think it is\nthat name okay but it might have blast\nin the name somewhere it's going to be\ngreat it's going to be up there with the\nsuper blast as uh a shoot it to consider\nfor running around all right uh you know\nwhat Robbie the ones that we couldn't\ntalk about we kind of alluded to them we\nsaw some stuff from Nike in the\nstructure line that you guys were like\nBlown Away by I mean visually I was I\nthought it was pretty awesome obviously\nI didn't try it so I have no idea I'm\nexcited to I I know we didn't mention\nthe tracksmith Elliot racer that's going\nto use a drop in midsole with a plate\nI'm interested in it I don't know like I\ninterested in anything that people\ntrying new stuff yeah that one's going\nto be coming out you're going to first\nsee it in Miami\nuh they're going to be releasing it\nthere and they've got some other stuff\nup there seve at tracksmith they're\ngoing to really make a go of it in the\nrunning space for Footwear and I'm\nexcited just to see because shoe and\nculture run running shoes run culture\nregular culture Trail everything is like\nkind of swirling together we've seen\nsome sick collaborations over the last\nyear I think it's going to be 2025 is\njust going to blow the doors open on all\nthat stuff so I'm excited to see what's\ncoming in that way and how running is\njust going to keep taking off and going\nup so that's it for our top shoes of\n2025 or the things that we're excited\nabout if you're excited about it too go\nahead and

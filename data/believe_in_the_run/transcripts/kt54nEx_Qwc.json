know do you know what I love\nthis time of year everybody's posting\ntheir top you know their list of their\npodcast Spotify and stuff and uh I don't\nthink anybody listens to this show\napparently there's numbers that Megan\ncrunches that say people do um and but\nseeing it for me is visual so seeing all\nthese people coming up in our stories\nand stuff saying that they listen to the\npodcast that's exciting I know I saw\nthat this morning and it was like it was\nthe drop fuel for the soul Aly on the\nrun cidus and desen Cara was like almost\neverybody's like in some order and I was\nlike this we're in good company that's\nwhy I've been commenting what I love is\nthe people that listen to all the\npodcast it's like oh the drop and the\nfeel for this you're like hardcore\nyou're you're in the biggest NDS think\nI've seen anybody that didn't anybody\nwho tagged f for the soul also had the\njob is it yeah yeah yeah so yes in case\nyou are unaware you are listening to\nfuel for the soul the podcast where we\nchat all things hydration and nutrition\nand how it affects performance and today\nwe're going to answer a bunch of fun\nlistener\nquestions but first uh so Runway is\nsponsoring this episode they have lovely\ncollagen and protein products which\nMegan you can speak to all of the\ngoodness of they do they do they are\nreally trying to wrap around everything\nthat we need from a supplement\nstandpoint to be a healthy run runner\nhealthy Runner and continue to be\nhealthy so collagen helps with our\njoints and soft tissues to keep us\nhealthy protein for recovery and\ncreatine is added to their protein to\nalso help us with strength muscle mass\nand Recovery I've been using the protein\nand creatine thing a lot yeah my brother\nwas in town for Thanksgiving and I like\nhe better not see that or he's going to\ntake all of it yeah I put out I put we\nhad some lesser Brands around the house\nthat we spotlighted you know we put it\nin front of the other stuff so that he\nwouldn't grab it Runway was in the back\nover Thanksgiving yeah sorry Runway\nwe're not ready to give up our supply\nyet he can go ahead and buy it with\nthere's a discount right yeah yeah a\nglowing recommendation right there that\nyou didn't want to share it so yeah so\nyes if you guys want to try some and you\nhaven't yet go to Runway . life so\nthat's R nw. lifee and use the code\nfeathers 15 for 15% off your purchase um\none thing I want to talk about was\nbefore we got started uh the difference\nbetween someone like\nyou who\nis uh educated and reads research and\nactually bases your advice on science\nand experience and we don't take on a\nsponsor that we don't believe in or we\ntry a product and don't believe in there\nwas recently this study that showed like\ninfluencers recommending stuff and how\nthey determine whether or not they'll\nrecommend something and also how other\npeople take in that knowledge whether or\nnot they vet it or look for scientific\nfact or anything like that I know that\nI'm always reaching out to you and being\nlike hey feathers is this miracle uh\npill that they say will reverse aging\ndoes it work and you're like\nno you know that that kind of stuff but\nit's interesting to me do you feel like\nthat we Fallen because we are in the\nmedia and because that we do podcasts or\nevents or whatever it is do we fall into\nthe influencer realm I mean I I I think\nwe probably do that's what my TR badge\nsaid but I I makes me cringe a little\nbit because I'm like I don't like that's\nI didn't start doing what I do to be an\ninfluencer you know I think we are\ninfluencing people's purchases um but I\ndon't I don't love that term at all can\nthere be a difference between I cuz I\nfeel like an influencer now some people\nare proud of being influencers I it's\nnot something I've ever wanted to be no\nI wanted to give people good information\nto which they could make their own\ndecisions yeah we've done that with\npersonality and tried to do it with\nhumor and with quality content and that\nkind of stuff but I've always avoided\nkind of think of as influencers and I\ndon't really see you as an influencer\nit's not like you're showing me your run\nand then being like and then I took a\nketone and amped it up for the last\nthree months well I also think when you\nthink of influencer you think of almost\nlike a sales person because it always\nfeels like they're trying to make you\nuse a product or do something and so\nlike Megan's literally sharing\ninformation and educating Runners to\nhelp them make better choices of what\nproducts they want to use versus being\nlike here use take these ketones that\nmay or may not do anything we do talk\nabout like for we do have sponsors so\nRunway was just one yeah but like for\nexample when we when we decided to take\nrunway on as a client for advertising on\nthe show MH they sent\nproduct we tested the product we tried\nthe product ourselves we made sure that\nit was something that we could recommend\nto someone so in a way that is a sales\nsure uh pitch but what we're trying to\ndo I think the difference where we're\ngoing\nis I find that an influencer if a brand\nis willing to go to them and throw cash\nat them typically they're not turning it\ndown they'll say yes yeah yeah well and\nI mean I think we're very particular\nabout who we take money from and the\nreason we do have some sponsors which I\nthink people have mixed feelings about\nthat is because so we can continue to\nput out free high quality content for\npeople like we we need to make a living\nat some point right so like anytime I\nhave a sponsor that's why because I want\nto be able to offer more free things to\nour audience so bringing on that sponsor\nallows you know us not to have to charge\nsomeone for something that we're\nproviding you know so it just kind of\nit's like a win-win and then too what's\ninteresting is like our sponsors who\nhave been on this podcast like Runway or\ncherry Bundy um they say our codes are\nused constantly you know more than a lot\nof their other codes because we are\nparticular about who we recommend and I\nthink you know in my eyes I want to\nbring on people to sponsor that fill a\nvoid or a need and runway's first\nproduct was collagen and collagen is so\nclunky for a lot of people to take if\nthey don't like it in their coffee or\nthey don't want to put it in a hot\nliquid before a run and they had a\nproduct that was like an electrolyte\ndrink so you know when a company comes\nout it can fill a void of something that\nwe need as Runners then and it's quality\nand it's tested and we like the people\nbehind the product um you know it's kind\nof a no-brainer to me to bring people\nlike that on you made a good point and I\nand i' i' I've said this before to\npeople who have either you know come at\nme and in a in a way all the things that\nwe do that provide\num financial compensation for what we do\nMH I'm always trying to give like when\nwe have parties or if we're doing events\nI'm always trying to make sure there\nsomething in it for the people that come\nwhether it's Swag whether it's you know\nwhatever it is they're getting something\nout of we do the car boxes we we are\nalways constantly trying to provide for\nour audience and we doing it at usually\nzero or very very low cost for example\nlike grit that we just did that's a the\nentry fee is less than if you tried to\nbuy the\nGarment you know uh just for yourself so\nyou're getting a whole community and\nthat stuff\ninvolved without without that and we\nhave the website now you're even\ncontributing to the believe in the Run\nwebsite with nutrition advice so you\nhave a website that's already a\nphenomenal resource for people at zero\ncost they can go there find out do the\ncalorie calculator do the carb\ncalculator do all the things that they\nwould need to do on their own you\nprovide that at no cost I I I see the\ndifference that's where I kind of see a\na big difference between we're not just\ntaking money to to do ads or to do uh\npieces we're trying to actually bolster\nup we actually have employees we have\nyou know people that are helping us put\nthe content out and that that does cost\nthere's a cost involved right but the\nend goal for us is to to give good\nquality enjoyable\nentertainment to our audience yeah yeah\nit it's funny say that because I just\nlaunched the group nutrition classes for\nthe spring so the for any any race it'll\nstart the first week of January and then\nwe'll have a group specific to Boston um\nand it's they're filling up pretty\nquickly we still have a few spots left\nprobably when this airs there will be\ntoo um and you know people are like we I\nlearned so much in that class which is\nthe goal right to get people together\nreally educate people talk about the\nright topics for where we are in our\ntraining to really help figure out how\nto scale nutrition performance nutrition\ndaily nutrition All That Jazz but then I\nhad somebody reach out when I was\npromoting it yesterday and they were\nlike I just need to let you know I only\nused your free resources on your website\nand I had a 20-minute Marathon PR and I\nwas like that is so cool like I love\nthat I can give people excessive\nattention and a ton of Education if they\nhave the finances for it and they want\nto be a part of something like that but\nthen I also love that if someone doesn't\nhave the time or the resources to be\nable to join a group like that that they\ncan still get what they need so um it\nwas it was cool to to hear that\nyesterday the other thing that's NE\nabout your groups though that I've\nnoticed because I had to go to one of\nyour Boston group meetups had to I had\nto well look it's it's a busy weekend\nand we were there for I forget why we\nwere stopping by our hotel we were\ndropping something or I was going I just\nwant I just want to hang out with M um\nand uh I I noticed right away that\nthere's a bond between the people that\nare in the group so they're all like for\nthe example the Boston group they're all\nrunning Boston they're talking they're\ngetting hyped they're motivating each\nother and it is fun if especially if\nyou're maybe you don't live in a city\nwhere you can do group runs or whatever\nyou're part of a group leading up to\nBoston you get to Boston you get to meet\nthem you get to hang out with your hero\nMegan featherston and AKA feathers I\nstill chat with several of the girls\nfrom the initial group back in what was\nthat 203 2021 was the first year I know\nI was looking back at that so this will\nbe the fourth year I've had a grp\nstraight out of crazy right it was I\nknow I love and that you can see little\nfriendships form like there was the two\ngirls at the Chicago ShakeOut that were\nin the group um and they became like\nbest friends and it was like I was like\nthis is wonderful and I think it's\nimportant to know too like I have people\nthat are trying to break three hours in\nthat group and I have people who run a\nsix and a half hour marathon in that\ngroup so it's like a super diverse group\nabilities ages experience so it's just\nfun to kind of see all those all those\ntypes of Runners get together and learn\ntogether yeah I mean to get back to my\ninitial question I don't I don't I don't\nsee us as influencers I don't think that\nwe are marketing for the sake of\nmarketing or that um I think that we\nhave a mission and and a and a reason\nbehind the passion that we have for the\nspace that we're in um you happen to be\nin love with helping people reach their\ngoal through uh dialing in their\nnutrition we happen to be on the other\nside where we're like hey your gear and\nhow you feel about running is is tied\ntogether so you know I think that it's\nwe're we're in the service industry more\nthan the influencer industry that's a\ngood way to put it I\nagree I hope that's how we're viewed at\nleast yeah that's the goal well I'm\ntelling people now so if you're\nlistening that's the way to look at\nus I think people get that I think\npeople are soing up what we're still in\nhere right like I think that's why we\nhave such a great we'll just end this\none now peas and\ncarrots wait what about Emily Jess and\nhow question we got to do this stuff all\nright let's roll right into these\nquestions now that we've chatted about\nnonsense for several minutes our first\nquestion is from Emily she said I know\neverybody is different and there is no\none amount for everyone but I'm mainly\nwondering if there is an equation or a\ncalculator of some kind to find a\ngeneral idea of the nutrition ballpark\nyou should be in I understand that\nseeing a professional to make it more\nindividualized is preferred but I don't\nhave access to a dietician at the moment\nand the weight list for a dietician in\nhealthcare is currently two\nyears I am a healthy individual and I\neat when I'm hungry but sometimes I\nworry that I may not be eating\nenough It's Tricky right I mean I think\na lot of people have this same question\nso you're absolutely not alone Emily a\nlot of people don't understand how to\nscale nutrition for running and a lot of\ntimes our appetite alone isn't enough to\nguide us most people don't notice a huge\nhuge change in their appetite or hunger\num when they're changing things so I\nmean looking at it from my perspective\nwe want to like find an equation that\ntells us how much nutrition we need on a\ndaily basis which there are some\ncalculators out there but then where it\nbecomes nuanced is like okay that's how\nmuch nutrition I need if I'm laying in\nbed all day that's an easy equation for\nmost of us but then we need to look at\nhow much are we running how much are we\ncross trining and how busy is our\nday-to-day life like I sit on my butt in\nmy day-to-day life so like I don't\nexpend a whole lot of energy but um my\nkids were asking me yesterday why the\nmail man walks through our yards and I'm\nlike because he walks house to house and\nit cuts you know his his travel time a\nlittle bit so somebody like that is\nburning a ton of energy through their\ntheir job so you know kind of to answer\nEmily's question we need to figure out\nlike how much energy does my body need\nto just stay alive and then add on to\nthat any type of planned exercise but\nthen also any movement that it just\ncomes from our daily life uh whether\nit's work or child care or you know\nwhatever that looks like um so it can be\nkind of tricky to figure that out so\nthis time last year we put together the\nprogram called fueled that has those\ncalculators available to people they can\nplug and chug what their daily nutrition\nneeds are uh carb needs fat needs\nprotein needs fluid needs um all that\nkind of stuff and then the cool thing\nabout that is you can change it\ndepending on your mileage so you can\nlearn how to kind of scale your\nnutrition so is available if Emily or\nsomeone out there wants those\ncalculators to play with themselves um I\nsignificantly cheaper than you know\nworking oneon-one with the dietician you\nthink like you could even type this\nquestion into like almost like a chat\nGPT where you would be like hey I run an\naverage of this many miles a week I am\nsitting at my desk this many hours a\nweek and I weigh this much and like can\nyou give me the optimal amount of\ncalories or whatever I would I would bet\nyou that you could do that I'm going\ntest it mate's going to test it are you\nguys surprised I've never played on chat\nGPT never I I don't know because scares\nme I think there's both sides to it I do\nthink it has some decent information but\nyou are going to get sort of like\ncrowdsourced information like I did a\nthing where I was like okay I need two\nworkouts a week with weight training for\na runner to uh benefit you know the an\nendurance athlete and I don't want them\nto be longer than you know 40 minutes\nand it'll come back to you with a plan\nand the plan looks very similar to other\nonline things that I've seen so it's\nlike they kind of pull all the same\ninformation but then again you're like\nokay well that is what I guess works\nyeah so it's like it's you know I don't\nknow I I'm not 100% trusting it just yet\nyeah yeah it's kind of scary yeah\nbecause like especially if you ask it\nlike some things that they could screw\nup right what if it tells somebody like\na wh low ball energy need and then\nthey're undering you know that makes me\nnervous a little bit there's a lot of\nequations that come into or pieces and\nparts that go into how much nutrition\ndoes our body need and it is so\nindividualized even calculators alone\nsometimes aren't enough right but um I'm\none of those people like his handheld\nlike I'd rather learn from you and then\ntry it on my own like the best\neverybody learns different made can read\nit and then absorb the information and\nbe fine with that some people can watch\nvideos and be fine with that and I can\ndo tutorials on videos for like stuff\nthat I'm doing like in the creative\nworld but when it comes to like actually\nlike even like with a camera or\nsomething like that I got to play with\nthe buttons and do the you know the\nadjust it and kind of like aperture is\nlike abstract until I actually use it\nmhm so and I think like human\ninteraction is so important for us to\nmake Behavior changes too you know so\nhaving that like support along the way\nand personalization and feeling like\nsomething is tailored to you is very\nimportant for a lot of people I I would\nagree yeah um Megan I'm gonna send you\nthis because it's honestly very\nfascinating you could probably have it\nwrite a a uh calculator for your website\nbecause it can do all the coding but I\njust I wrote into it that I'm 30b female\nthat runss 50 miles a week and has a\nsedentary job it's not me say female how\ndid you gain all that and\num and it came back with an insane\nanswer that I'm sending to Megan and she\ncould tell us whether or not it's can\nyou read the answer no it's like\nparagraphs and calculations and okay\nwild we can move on and you can look at\nit and then we can cheat we'll come back\nto it at the end yeah all right um so\ndid we did you wow that was a good hook\nto get people to listen to the end did\nyou did you do we think we answered\nEmily's question though generally\nspeaking Yeah I think that you did I\nmean if you want to synopsize what you\nsaid maybe we could do that since we\nkind of went off in different direction\nyeah so I mean you can find calculators\nonline to help figure out those Baseline\nenergy needs but then you know what I\nwould want Emily to make sure she's\ndoing is to take into account any\nadditional energy expenditure through\nplanned activity and then through just\nyour daily lifestyle would be important\nand if you really want something more\nthe fueled program is available to\npurchase and it's like an on demand\nthing that you can just kind of guide\nyourself through that has some videos\nand calculators and all that kind of\nstuff\ncool all right our next question is from\nJess she said I went from seeing how far\nI could get with no food training for\nUltras to now I see how much food I can\nfit into my training runs so thank you\nI'm a caffeine lover I try to be a good\ngrownup and stick to the recommended 400\nmilligrams a day but my question is how\nis caffeine intake Ed by a runner's\nweight and activity levels I have heard\nyou say caffeine before evening runs may\nnot ruin your sleep because it's\nmetabolized quicker when running does\nthat mean we could actually take in more\nthan 400 milligrams if we are running it\noff or a bigger Runner or my way off\nbase I'd love any insights or thoughts\nfrom y'all for info I'm 59 160 lbs and\nrun about 50 Trail miles a week and lift\nheavy four times a week I usually have\naround 200 milligrams at 6 a.m. and 200\nmilligrams at 10: a.m. let me let me\njump in and answer this one you can\ndrink as much caffeine until you start\nare getting dizzy oh gosh that's where I\ndraw the line that's Thomas's influencer\nadvice when I start seeing spots in my\nvision I put the coffee down when my\nheart starts racing out of my chest and\nI'm an anxious mess I know I've overdone\nit yeah I know I'm kidding um I think\nI've only done that once I think we\ntalked about that before one time in\ncollege I like took way too much\ncaffeine and I was like I'm dying my\nheart is going to stop and explode um\nanyway so I Jess obviously listens\nbecause she knew some of the numbers\nthat we've talked about on here which is\nawesome so when we're thinking about\ncaffeine needs for runners there's kind\nof two things to keep in mind one is the\nFDA says adults shouldn't consume more\nthan 400 milligrams of caffeine a day so\nthat's where the 400 milligrams is\ncoming from um but then when we look at\ncaffeine for performance so we know that\nmost people respond positively to\ncaffeine not everybody um about 90 95%\nof Runners are going to benefit from\nadding caffeine in with mental Acuity so\nlike just a little bit sharper mentally\nto hang on to Paces it decreases our\nperceived exertion so we can run a\nlittle faster without it feeling faster\num over time and then also why am I\nblanking on the third thing oh it\ndecreases our perception of pain I need\nmore caffeine clearly um when we look at\nhow much caffeine is needed to have\nthose three benefits to our performance\nit's anywhere from three to six\nmilligrams of caffeine per kilogram of\nbody weight so Jess is also on to\nsomething and she's saying I'm 160\npounds does that mean I can tolerate\nmore caffeine let's say than a 90 pound\nRunner and the answer would be yeah\nbecause it is weight based but that is a\nbig range so I calculated the caffeine\nrange of that three milligrams to six\nmilligrams for her and that would be 220\nmilligrams to 440 milligrams of caffeine\nthat would benefit her performance so\nnot a whole lot more than 400 right so\nlike we could probably easily keep her\naround 400 get the benefits not get more\nthan the FDA thinks is healthy for us um\nbut it begs the question of someone\nwho's 200 pounds and running like they\nwould be well over that 400 milligrams\num if they went to like six milligrams\nper kilogram of body weight um and my\nthought with that is we probably don't\nneed the benefits of caffeine on\nperformance every single run right like\npersonally I just use caffeine for long\nruns especially my like really long runs\nand then I use it during RAC wait wait\nwait wait wait wait wait wait you're\ntalking about caffeine gels not correct\nyou drink coffee every day before you\nyeah oh yeah okay we're starting with\nsome milligrams yeah but I I maybe I'm\nnaive but I can't imagine people are\nlike regularly drinking 400 milligrams\nof caffeine in the morning before a run\nmy thought would be in order to get to\nthat amount we're taking some before and\nduring would be I don't know maybe how\nmany cups of coffee is 400 milligrams it\ndepends on if you brew it at home or go\nto Starbucks right it's all going to be\ndifferent but typically they say like 80\nmilligrams of caffeine per cup but most\nof us are pouring like two cups into one\nof those big tall like travel mugs you\nknow so I don't know most people\nprobably getting around 150 milligrams\nof caffeine maybe 200 maybe so I'm this\nwhole time I'm thinking about Ben\nJohnson who weighs 150 probably is my\nguess because he's muscular um and uh\nI'm guessing that dude is probably\nbanging down I don't know 10 to 12\nMortons of caffeine\nduring her race I mean didn't we see his\nthing it was like I think he switched it\nup though oh he did he he decreased it\nwell and part of that this is also a\ngood conversation for Jess too is we\nbuild a tolerance to caffeine so if we\ncontinually take in 400 milligrams of\ncaffeine is are we going to need more to\ncontinue to feel the benefits right so\nyou know we've talked before on here\nthat we don't like have to abstain from\ncaffeine the week of our race to have\nbenefits on race day but if we're\nhabitually taking in 400 milligrams of\ncaffeine or more on a daily basis we are\ngoing to increase our tolerance to that\nso we may want to be a little more\nstrategic right and cut back to 200\nmilligrams a day and then go up to the\n400 for you know the performance\nbenefits for those long runs or workouts\num and speaking of Ben I'm pretty sure\nthat's what he did I think he weaned\nhimself down on a daily basis yeah I\ndon't think he he takes much at all\nanymore yeah all right but here's a\ncrazy thing my I'm testing out this ring\nthing Ultra human Ultra human and it has\na caffeine window but I don't like the\nwindow yeah it's weird it's not I like\nit we wake up we go downstairs empty the\ndishwasher put the dishes away make the\nbed and then hot cup of coffee with\ncollagen in it like that's the day if\nthat doesn't happen it's it doesn't feel\nright the ultra human ring recommends I\nforget there's some terminology they say\nbut they want you to wait caffeine\noptimization yeah but there's a reason\nthere's like a window beforehand that\nthey're like you need clear out\nsomething I don't know but and then it\nbasically said to start caffeine from\nlike 9:30 until like 11 a.m. and like\nthat's the only window which I'm not\nsure the reasoning behind it but that's\nwhat it recommends well and 9:30 to 11\nis very different for someone who wakes\nup at 4:00 a.m. versus someone who wakes\nup at 8:00 a.m. you know like that seems\nkind of AR true yeah I defin I got up at\n4:46 this morning 4:46 thank you for\nthat clarification\nwell I'm like why am I Wide Awake it's\n4:46 um okay so 400 milligrams is total\nfor the day but when we're talking about\nperformance I know you always say the\ntiming is really important so like I'll\ntake we'll do a caffeinated gel which is\nusually 100 milligrams for the first\nhour and then you want another one for\nthe second hour and then potentially for\nthe third hour right that's 300 yeah\nright yeah yeah yeah takes about an hour\nwait a second how much caffeine is in\nthe Morton cuz I was I just is it 100\nyeah cuz I know there's 100 calories is\nit 100 milligrams of caffeine too\nmilligrams of caffeine yep okay that\nmakes it easy right right yeah so it\ntakes an hour for that caffeine to peek\nin our bloodstream and it hangs for a\nlittle over an hour so we do want to you\nknow be strategic with our timing I\nthink then the question I always get\nfrom people is can I still drink my\ncaffeine in the morning so I think most\nof us need that to wake up and be alert\nand maybe go to the bathroom before a\nrace or long run so to me happiness\nright makes me happy I woke up this\nmorning and had to get uh Smith to the\northodontist to uh get his brazes off\nround one round two um and I didn't\ndrink coffee and I got there and I was\nlike I don't know how I just drove a\ncar I never don't caffeine morning\nfunctioning yeah okay so we're\nsuggesting to still stick within the\nguidelines pretty much any performance\nbenefits you're not going to gain over\n400 for the most part unless you're a\nmuch larger human or you drink a lot a\nlot of caffeine in which case maybe you\nshould just bring that down the first\nmaybe we should reevaluate right and\nthen too if you are taking more for\nperformance you're not doing that every\nday so it's fine like if it's once a\nweek twice a week like that's okay yeah\nspeaking of performance enhancing I was\nwatching this thing on World War II go\nand apparently the Nazis were taking\npriva tin have you ever heard of priva\ntin no what is it we got to find out\nabout this stuff cuz apparently this is\nwhy they were like super soldiers they\ncould fight all night and stuff like\nthat and it gave you big confidence and\nall that stuff it gave you big\nconfidence okay it gave you\nthat BD\nbde okay I'm trying to Google this and\nI'm like what is this oh it's a\nmethamphetamine for sure it's a\nstimulant like ader\nall yeah so they were handing these out\nlike candy apparently to the solders huh\nconsidered an energy booster and it was\nperfectly legal that's what Google says\nuntil 1941 so uh it's not something I\ncan use for racing no please don't okay\nour next question comes from Ashley she\nsaid I'm still chasing the big sub3\nbarrier and if I'm being honest I've got\na ways to go my PR in the marathon on a\nflat course is 312 I know every Runner\nis different but both feathers and Meg\nhave crossed that sub3 barrier with a\ncombo of good fueling and training I\nknow that the megans sorry about the\nspelling have traded nutrition coaching\nand nutrition support and I was\nwondering if you could talk a bit about\nhow the two work together especially\nwhen you're working toward a big scary\ngoal like sub3 marathon when you're over\n40 and running in the malarial swamp\nthat is Maryland in the summer for\nexample how do workouts change when\nyou've when you're trying to tackle the\nsub three how does nutrition change when\nyou're working toward that kind of elite\ngoal I know that y'all try to give\nadvice to the general population I\ntotally get that you don't want to\nalienate anyone however for those of us\nchasing down big things I'm curious\nabout how training and nutrition Chang\nat these higher\nPaces yeah I you yeah so what why don't\nwe have Megan talk about how training\nchanged hers and you talk about how\nnutrition changed yours I'm curious what\nI I kind of have thoughts of what Meg's\ngonna say but I'm curious if that's\nreally what she's gonna say so you start\nyeah so it's interesting I\nmean it's not so much the changes with\ntraining like the the workouts\nthemselves are all very similar the long\nruns are very similar I think a lot of\ntimes depending on the person your\nmileage can increase which can help just\nbuild some of that aerobic base which\nthen can help you last longer in a\nMarathon distance but in general while\nthe paces are maybe getting a bit faster\nthe workouts themselves are very much\nthe same but but I think what she's\nasking is she's trying to unlock this\nsub three and she knows that both of you\nguys had sort of an effect on each other\nand I think what she's asking is Megan\nhow and this feathers feathers how did\nthe training with Megan change\nyour approach to marathoning and vice\nversa Megan how did well I mean all of\nmy all of my training runs got better\nbecause I was fueling properly so while\nagain the training didn't necessarily\nchange drastically the workouts that I\nwas doing went way better especially my\nlong runs that had workouts in them\nbecause I wasn't fueling properly before\nso I would burn out towards the end or I\njust never got as fast as I could\nbecause I wasn't properly fueled and\nthen all of a sudden you realize if you\nactually take in carbs during running\nand before that you have another engine\nand the recovery and you recover way\nfaster so so before that if you were\nlike you were doing you were running as\nhard as you could and maybe bonking a\nlittle bit and you didn't even know it\nbecause your training you weren't going\nthe full 26 miles so you're able to kind\nof have success up until a\npoint that you didn't even know cuz I\nremember the frustration that you had\nyou're like I'm I'm doing the training\nI'm getting there I'm doing the numbers\nand then on race day I get these cramps\nand I Collapse so it it was almost like\nwell it was such a Snowball Effect too\nright because I didn't know things like\nmy iron was low and that I was supposed\nto be fueling before every run like I\nwas doing fasted runs every day I was\nnot fueling properly during races let\nalone during my training or hydrating\nand so yeah it was like learning all of\nthis and then applying all of this to\nthe training is what made the training\ngo so well is in my opinion yeah so it's\nit's a cumulative effect yeah and then\nit just happened to show up on race day\ntoo yeah well when you can when you can\nhit these these new paces and this new\nmileage and you feel really good doing\nit it makes you confident for race day\nthat's what I was going to ask is a is a\npsychological Factor there too when you\nsee you're stacking these workout 100%\nlike and when I was working with Megan\nspecifically I remember I was like\ntracking everything and I would look at\nthese long run workouts and I would like\ncome home and be like happy and feeling\ngreat and I just run like 22 miles at a\nclip that I'd never done before and then\nthat just Builds on itself week after\nweek throughout training and then you\nstart you go to the start line and it's\nlike absolutely I can do this that's\namazing yeah and so feathers on the flip\nside you had the nutrition and you were\nalready run you had already run a sub\nthree hour marathon at that point right\nyeah yeah when I started working with B\nyeah so what changed for you with\nworking with Megan as a coach well I I\nwant to back up a little bit to Ashley\nsaying 312 is a huge leap to sub three\nbecause I don't think it necessarily is\nlike if she has room to grow like I ran\na 315 before I had kids and I was like\necstatic I was like this is amazing if I\nnever run faster than this in my life it\nit's it's this was so great right so I I\nthink having appreciation for like how\nfar we've come and not necessarily being\nlike overly hungry for that sub three is\nso important so I was wondering if Meg\nwas gonna say like we like we both like\nto work we both like to work hard we\nlike to work to our potential and as you\nstack That season after season after\nseason all of a sudden you've got this\nlike Fitness that you're like holy crap\nright you know when we're putting all\nthose things together so um I think\nAshley can totally do it and I think\nwhen I started working with Meg my\nmileage didn't change a whole lot\nbecause I have jacked up feet and I was\nworried about pissing off my achilles\nagain like I kept doing all the time\nyour shes changed yeah my shoes did\nchange yes they did um but for me it was\nmore quality in Long runs so it was like\na lot more marathon pace in long runs to\nget me comfortable with marathon pace to\ngain confidence in marathon pace and\nthen also I just think you gain a lot of\nFitness from throwing that marathon pace\ninto long run so I would say from a\ntraining perspective that was probably\nthe most consistent change but again\nit's not nothing crazy nothing over our\nskis it was marathon pace right you know\num and I Lov to run marathon pace so\nthose ones were always fun workouts to\ndo um but as far as nutrition goes\nexactly what Meg just said you know I've\nhone I've changed my Nutrition a ton\nsince I've had kids like I have done a\nlot wrong in nutrition in the past we\ndidn't know we didn't know a lot you\nknow until just the past like five or\nsix years about how important this was\nand what this looks like so I mean even\nI was using myself as a guinea ping with\nnutrition you know um to really get that\ndialed in and figured out and exactly\nlike what Meg said training is obviously\na huge piece of it but if we're going\ninto those training runs well fueled and\nwe're fueling during them and we're\nnailing hydration we can gain more\nFitness because we can push our bodies\nharder out there so it is it's like this\nlovely synergistic effect between\ntraining and solid Nutri ntion and the\nrecovery and the performance nutrition\nso um I just I think it's a secret\nweapon to dial in your nutrition that a\nlot of people don't think about right\naway um it's the last thing that people\nthink about usually but um quick quick\nobservation or or or something to I\nthink put in there for people to think\nabout when was your first marathon and\nwhat was the\ntime 2009 and it was\n358 High yeah okay and when was your sub\nfirst sub three\n2019 so 10 years later so 10 years later\nyou had some kids there were some things\nin there that changed but Megan uh for\nyou what was your first marathon what\nyear 2012 and what was the time 256\n3:56 and when did when was your first\nsub\nthree um unofficial was Co but so we'll\nsay official was the wood\n2021 N9 years okay so both of you're\nclose to 10 years between the time that\nyou started running I do think the the\nlove and the passion and the stacking of\nworkouts and and chasing the goal for\nyou guys took time and it I it really\nnow people look at you and they say oh\nlook at how fast the Megs are they're\nthey're amazing you guys worked your\nasses off to get here and you tweaked\nthings and you adjusted you tried Megan\nyou read like every book there was out\nthere yeah I think that's the other\nthing is um I think Megan and I are both\nsimilar in that we're always willing and\nwant to learn and so if there's a better\nway we're going to be all years like if\nthere's if there's science to support\nthat something works better than what\nwe're currently doing I think we're both\nlike well let's try that like there's\nthere's always ways to improve and we're\nalways learning and I think you have to\nwant and believe that there are things\nyou can do to create success in order to\nbe successful do you think either I mean\nmay you always had a successful uh\nSports career as a as a kid you were\ncoordinated you played top level in and\nstuff but would you say that you were\nexceptionally talented at running either\nof you I hated running my whole\nchildhood yeah I was always the runner\non the team like played Midfield because\nI think they saw that I had some decent\nendurance but I wasn't fast like I\nwasn't the one who could go steal the\nball and score you know what I mean like\nI was just the war course distributed\nthe ball to the fast people so yeah I\nmean I was all right but I wasn't like\nStellar yeah I mean being able to\nwatch Megan Advance through running and\nlike watching her journey it like I it's\nsomething so spectacular that I've Seen\nHer Go from pretty not like you were I\nalways felt like you were a little above\naverage but to watch you get to the\nlevel where you are now where even the\nidea of trying to go after an otq is\nsomething in your head silly no you know\nit like that's pretty amazing and I I\nthink that if people are willing to put\nin the work and be patient and don't\ndon't look at that person that maybe\njust fires off a you know sub three\ntheir second Marathon or first marathon\neven and be like discouraged and then\nfor those people who are more in my camp\nwhere you know running in the mid 3s is\nis fun and you can still love running\nwithout having to go after a sub three\nyou don't have to have have a sub three\nto be a quote unquote real Runner I\nthink you can really enjoy the sport at\nany Pace but to watch but Ashley you\nshould definitely go for it go for it go\nfor it we're pumped for you to do it\nyeah yeah keep us posted yeah but at the\nsame time as I kind of mentioned before\nlike the people that I see have the most\nsuccess truly just love the sport of\nrunning it's not about the time right\nyou know I think we could probably both\nagree with that like yeah it's cool to\nbe like wow I did that I ran that fast\nbut that's not why we're running you\nknow it's not about achieving a certain\ntime yeah um okay let's get at least one\nmore question in here this is from\nJennifer she said is it possible to have\ndelayed bonking I'm currently marathon\ntraining and I've noticed the last few\nweeks after my long run I'm super tired\na couple hours after my long run it's a\nchallenge just to walk the dog could\nthat be a sign of under fueling during\nor after my run or both thank you all\nfor sharing so much information with us\nI listen\nreligiously I think this absolutely ties\ninto a lot of the things we've talked\nabout today um yes that's absolutely\nunder fueling so just because you don't\nBonk during a run doesn't mean your\nfueling was okay A lot of people are\nvery tough mentally physically and they\ncan gut out some really decent long runs\nmaybe even hit Paces even if they're not\nfueling well but they feel it after\nright like they don't recover as quickly\nthey're like dead to the world for the\nrest of their Saturday after a long run\nand it doesn't have to be that way um I\nstill remember moving\nafter a long run and cleaning the whole\nhouse top to bottom and like I made sure\nI fueled like crazy you know to make\nsure that I had the energy to then go do\nthese other things and it works you know\nso I would say 100% you know Jennifer is\nunder fueling if she's feeling like she\ncan't walk her dog after a long run I\nthink anybody who has kids also learns\nthat your long run isn't the end of your\nday and that you now have to spend\nenergy making sure that you're you're\nyou're doing that so if you don't have\nkids borrow somebody's and your\nendurance will go way up oh my gosh I\nstill remember I had my kids really\nclose together so I knew I wasn't going\nto get back to marathoning but I did\nwant to try to break 90 in the half\nbetween the kids so I was like training\nfor that and I just squeaked under 90\nyou know right before Smith first\nbirthday and then you know got pregnant\nthere shortly after but I still remember\nthat was the first time I had to come\nhome and be a mom after running a race\nand I was like this is just for the\nbirds I like this little one-year-old\nneeds me for everything and he doesn't\nknow I just broke 90 in the half yeah\nhe's not he's not impressed by your\nmetal or anything and by the way 90\nsounds so much better than\n130\nyeah I don't know where we like cut draw\nthe line on the numbers I don't know it\nsounds better I like it I also think in\nmarathon training if you're if you're\nnot really diligent sometimes it's easy\nto under Fuel and like it just it adds\nup and then all a sudden at the end of\nthe week it hits you versus like\nthroughout like you're fine and then all\na sudden you're like oh shoot right also\nhow many of us just aren't hungry after\na long run most people aren't I've\ngotten done after a hot long run and\nit's like I have to force myself to put\na bagel down my mouth yeah and honestly\nif I am hungry after a long run I know\nthat I either didn't eat enough the day\nbefore the morning of didn't feel during\nlike that's usually when I don't feel\nhungry after a run I'm like all right\nyou nail this you know and then of\ncourse you have to like force yourself\nto make sure you're eating but um okay\ndo we want to try to answer James\nquestion real fast what's up James sure\nyeah let's do it okay James said I have\nbeen a vegetarian for over three years\nand have seen a huge reduction between\nmy recovery time in those three years\napproximately 50% not saying this will\naffect everybody I have been listening\nto your podcast which clearly supports\nhow important taking a collagen is for\nrunners but how do I get this without\nconsuming meat I seen in a number of\nplaces that there are Marine\nAlternatives and other vitamin\nalternatives which claim to trigger your\nbody to produce collagen I know this\nwill never be the real thing but I want\nto find the best alternative is he\nsaying it's harder to recover or easier\nto recover harder I think he's saying\nhe's like his recovery time is twice as\nlong was how I read that oh yeah yeah\nokay yeah so he's recovering like 50% of\nwhat he used to recover 100% of yeah he\nworded it a little differently than our\nminds are working but um I actually\ndon't think this is a collagen issue I\nthink this is a protein issue so it's\nit's almost like he didn't know that he\nread a study that said you need twice as\nmuch protein to recover as you get older\nif you're a vegetarian you know so it\nall goes back to the amino acids in\nvegetarian proteins most of them are\ndeficient Lucine Lucine is what triggers\nour muscles to recover um so without\nadequate Lucine we're going to delay\nrecovery time so there was a phenomenal\nstudy that did look at this and it shows\nthat you actually do need significantly\nmore protein from a plant source\nto trigger those muscles to recover so\nif he's not being diligent about getting\nenough plant-based protein and it's you\nknow we already need to eat more\nquantity of food to get a plant-based\nprotein because it's not quite as you\nknow dense in protein as say meat is but\nthen we even need more than that so my\nthought would be he needs to find like a\nhigher quality protein powder like the\nrunway that has adequate Lucine in it\nsoy protein actually has adequate Lucine\num or this is where sometimes I do\nrecommend Branch chain amino acids like\nif he's like I can't get any more tofu\ndown if you added like a branch chain\namino acid supplement to that that would\ngive you the Lucine that then you know\ncould trigger that and then the protein\nfrom the tofu could do the rebuilding\nright so sometimes I will recommend\nbcaa's post exercise for vegetarians or\nvegans that aren't doing great meeting\nthat increased protein need um so\nthere's there's options there but rather\nthan focusing on the collagen I would\nhave him Focus on making sure he's\ngetting adequate protein timely Post Run\nwhat is what is Lucine and where does it\ncome from Lucine is a branch chain amino\nacid so it's in any type of protein even\ncollagen has some Lucine it's just not\nenough to trigger our muscles to recover\nso um that's why like whey protein\nisolate recovers our muscles the fastest\nbecause it has like the adequate amount\nof Lucine in it soy protein's pretty\nclose to that though and then um the\nrunway protein is that Brew or baker's\nyeast so it is very high in Lucine as\nwell so there are options from like\nvegetarian and vegan standpoint but say\npart of his recovery James's recovery is\na problem with joints like say he's\nfeeling ay in the joints he's thinking\ncollagen could help is there something\nfor uh vegetarians or vegans that they\nmake like collagen stimulators like so\nthe different amino acids that would be\nin collagen they get them from like\neither a marine Source or there are some\nvegan sources\num but there aren't there isn't research\non it yet so is it just a waste of our\nmoney does it work that's where you know\nI'm I don't think there's enough\nresearch to recommend it yet um I've\nlooked into a bunch of them because this\nis a very common question I get from My\nVegan Runners um and I have not found\nsomething that I'm like yes let's do\nthis um but hopefully there will be\nsomething in the future but for James's\nany anyway you're just suggesting to get\nin the increased protein at this point\nthat's what my gut says that he just\nneeds to focus on protein quality and\nquantity yeah all right James you heard\nit here first so earlier in the show we\nmentioned that I was going to type into\nGoogle or sorry into chat gbt uh a sort\nof calculation if you will for how many\ncalories I should be intaking based on\nmy lifestyle weight and being a female\nwhich I just threw out 130 PBS 50 miles\na week um and a female and it gave a\nbunch of information Megan is it legit\nat all so the equation that they use is\nthe Mifflin St Jor equation which is\nwhat I use for athletes it's the most\naccurate for an active individual\nwithout knowing fat-free body mass so\nthey use the same equation that I would\nuse for your resting energy needs those\nneeds that if we're laying in bed all\nday right so they use the same equation\nas they would for me and then the next\nthing they did is multiply that resting\nenergy need by an activity factor which\nis something we learn in nutrition\nschool so like these activity factors\nvary based on daily activity and all\nthat kind of stuff so that's how they\ncalculated how many EXT how much extra\nnutrition you need a day for running 50\nmiles per week um this is not how I\ncalculate it so this is where we may see\na little bit of discrepancy it's it's\nprobably within the ballpark of where\nyou would need to be but I typically\nfind an activity factor for that\nperson's daily living and then I\nseparately calculate like weekly energy\nexpenditure from running and any cross\ntraining and then kind of spread that\nout equally dayto day um so I do think\nit could potentially underestimate\nnutrition needs here for a runner\nhonestly um but the ballpark isn't\nterrible yeah yeah um all right that\ndoes it for this week I got to say it\nthank you all for submitting your\nquestions and if you have a question we\nhaven't answered on the show you can\nemail us at f for theou podcast\ngmail.com and we will answer it here on\nthe show now you can do it bees and\ncarrots bye bye\n[Music]\nhe",

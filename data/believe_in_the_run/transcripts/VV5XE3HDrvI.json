  "text": "hey this is Robbie with believe in run\nand we are here live from the running\nevent last meeting of the running event\nwe're feeling it the end is INS sight\nbut we saved the best for last we got\ntoo athletic I'm here with Russ from\ntoppo athletic Russ good to be back feel\nlike this is a yearly Tradition at this\npoint so yeah it's a nice annual last\nmeeting of the show it feels like a good\nway to cap off well it's been a really\nfun couple days in Austin we're both\nlosing our minds we're not sure it's\nkind of like being inside a casino here\nyeah there's no clock the wall they\npumping oxygen yeah we don't know where\nwe are you can drink at 9:00 a.m. it's\nlike acceptable uhhuh depends what Booth\nyou're at yeah so where's the ashtray at\nI anyways all right so let's get on to\npreviewing some of the 2025 lineup why\ndon't we kick it off here we got the\ntole athletic Aura why don't you give me\na rundown sure so the aura is a brand\nnew product coming from toppo athletic\nthat's going to be launching in January\nso just a couple months away this is a\nproduct that's going to be our Max\ncushion uh stability shoe within our\nline so it'll have the same stack height\nas at with that 38 to 33 mm midsole\nplatform so tied for the highest within\nour road line but it's going to feature\nour unique YF frame posting system which\nis both on the medial side and the\nlateral side of the shoe so that's just\na firmer bit of foam uh embedded within\nthe rest of the midsole okay this y\nframe is meant to cradle the foot and\nespecially cradle the heel and just keep\nyou centered right over in the platform\nnice we think that this is a product\nthat's going to appeal to that customer\nlooking for a Max cushion shoe for their\nrunning but also really appeal to the\nperson that's looking for for a great\nwalking shoe and a Comfort shoe option\nsure for uh spending time on their feet\nokay nice so combination walking running\nshoe mhm looks good feels good kind of\nand I got to say too athletic ERS you\nalways nail it I can tell this is going\nto be pretty comfortable on the foot so\nyeah what's um what's the weight on it\ndo you have so in a men's n it's going\nto come in right around 10.9 o um it'll\nretail for 165 okay and you said January\nright January exactly okay cool yeah\ncoming up soon very cool all right so\ncoming right out of the gate with a new\nmodel why don't we go next to\na not old model but a model that's been\naround for oh you want to do that one\nall right oh we're getting into the the\nexciting stuff all right all right let's\nbuckle up this is uh the so this is the\nCyclone Cyclone 3 Cyclone 2 one of uh\nour favorite shoes of\n20123 that was a just lightweight\nreally up Tempo Fast Fun it just felt\nlike a great running shoe sometimes it's\nhard to find those these days just a\nsimple No Nonsense running shoe you got\nthat paback midsole and the uh and the\nlightweight air mesh upper and uh I'm\nwalking I'm doing the whole walk through\nfor you and anyways I it doesn't look\nlike a lot has changed ex you tell why\ndon't you tell me what has so like you\nsaid the Cyclone 2 was really well\nreceived by our customers as well as a\nlot of reviewers like like yourself I\nknow you really like this shoe so we\ndidn't want to reinvent the wheel with\nthis update so we've kept the same mids\noutsole platform on the shoe the same 28\nto 23 mm platform same pbox formulation\nall the way through the shoe um what's\nreally changed here is the upper we\nwanted to just create an upper that\nwould secure the foot that much more\nover the platform so that when you were\nkind of cornering quickly in the shoe or\nyou know doing a track workout or\nsomething like that that mood foot would\nbe even more secure the 4 foot hasn't\nreally changed it's just that we added a\nbit more material um to the midfoot of\nthe mesh to deliver that that kind of\nmore locked in fit I got to say the only\nI feel like the only negative I had\nabout the cycl 2 was what you're talking\nabout is that cornering or you know it\ncould get a little come out over the\nedge a little bit of uh the upper could\nmove a little bit on that so it's good\nto see that there's a little bit more\nmore structure to make sure you're\nlocked in over the midsole and it is by\nthe way what's the weight on this again\nso this is coming right around 6.9 o in\na men's 9 or around 5.5 in a women's 7\nsuper light um still retails for 150 and\nit's going to come out in February all\nright and so reminder this is uh again\none of the I thought one of the most\nunderrated shoes if you're not onto this\nshoe you need to be onto it you got the\npaback full paback midsole lightweight\npackage fast and light just a fantastic\nshoe all around and you got a nice rub\nbrow to too yeah sweet all right let's\nmove\non all right we got the uh Phantom 4\nhere right so this is Phantom is more of\nyour daily trainer kind of reliable shoe\nso why don't you give me some details on\nwhat's changed from the version three\nyeah so like you said the Phantom 4 I'm\nsorry Phantom is kind of our uh High\ncushion neutral daily trainer within our\nline that Workhorse daily trainer it's\nactually the most popular shoe in our\nline for either Road or trail from a\nsales perspective yeah um this new\nversion is going to feature just a\nlittle bit more stock height in the\nmidsole so it's gone up 2 mm to a 35 to\n30 mm midsole platform we've also\nupdated the density of the foam or the\ntherometer of the foam so it's a little\nsofter little softer zip foam just a bit\nmore rebound underfoot um a bit more\nComfort we've also updated the outsole\nto kind of segment the Rubber and the\nheel of the shoe allowing for kind of a\nsofter Landing a little bit more um\nflexibility within the heel and then\nhave almost full rubber coverage in the\nforefoot for a more stable toe off yeah\num and that that rubber just adds\nrigidity to really create that Poppy\nSnappy ride that you're looking for when\nyou're when you're towing off and daily\ntraining nice and you're going to get a\nlot of miles out of the shoe I could\nfeel like just from the Rubber and the\nmids soole for sure yeah this like like\nwe said it's going to be that daily\nTrainer shoe um a great option for your\nlong runs recovery days and daily miles\nthis should be that kind of Workhorse\ngo-to shoe within your rotation nice um\nand what's the price point on this so\nthis is going to be 145 and it's going\nto be coming out in May in May all right\nso those are the three Road models I\nfeel like um yeah again some exciting\nstuff and by the way Cyclone 3 looking\ngreat if you haven't been onto the\nSpectre 2 from 2024 you might want to\ncheck that out that's that's like a\nmaxed out Cyclone I would say yeah yeah\nso while Cyclone's going to be more for\nthat person looking for a more moderate\nstack heite I like to use that like I\nsaid for my track workouts for my\nshorter Tempo runs things like that\nCyclone's going to be that that more\nHigh stack version spect I'm sorry yeah\nspect last last last day uh Spectre is\ngoing to be that high stock height\noption um you get 9 more mm of foam\nUnder Foot compared to Cyclone better\nfor your faster long runs um longer\nuptempo days but that Sho is still super\nlate super late yeah yeah coming in\nright around like 8 8.1 o in a men's\nsize 9 so super light I used it to race\na marathon oh ni couple months ago so I\nI love that shoe very cool all right\nwell Russ thanks for walking me through\nthe road shoe we're going to have Taylor\ncome in in just a second and do the\ntrail shoes that's going to be a\ndifferent video so stick around for that\nthanks so much",

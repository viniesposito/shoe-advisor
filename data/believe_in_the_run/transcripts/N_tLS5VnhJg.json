  "text": "[Music]\nall right this is going to be fun we\nhave Victor Diaz from Renegade running\nand if you're not familiar with Renegade\nyou're not really following along what's\nhappening in running especially in run\nculture and uh Victor's going to give us\nthe down low on everything that's going\non Victor what's up good morning thanks\nfor having me Thomas I'm excited to be\nhere I know it and we kind of know each\nother we spent time we've uh you know\nshook hands and been in in our each\nother's faces so it's not like uh this\nis the first time getting to know each\nother we had dinner together and yeah we\ndid yeah lots of wine that night yeah I\ndon't even recall did you drink did you\nhave any of that wine I did not I did\nnot but we were at a really nice uh\nHotel up in the Berkeley Hills The\nClaremont The Claremont\nyeah which we were there we came out so\nRobbie and I went out with norda to do\nan event uh kind of they were doing a\nrelease on their\nO2 which is kind of a lower stack closer\nto the ground Victor was nice enough to\nhost everybody at Renegade and uh so I\nhad known about you before we kind of\nconnected every once in a while online\nbefore that but that was the first time\nwe got to hang correct and you're from\nthe area so we had we were able to\nconnect on that um Talk about the um the\nlife of the East Bay uh as you know when\nwe were both younger and then kind of\nhow it is now\ntoday yeah and I certainly want to get\ninto like run culture and the Renegade\nstore and what you're doing there but I\nthink you have a bigger mission that I\nkind of want you to kind of share like\nyou're not just here to have a retail\nstore and to sling shoes or a sling gear\nwhat's what's your like whole philosophy\nbehind what you're trying to do out\nthere well I would was really um excited\nin the like right around like say 2015\n2016 watching the early emergence of run\nCrews mostly in Europe at the time\nprobably um run themm crew and pot run\nclub and seeing um folks from a lot of\ndifferent backgrounds coalescing\ntogether um sometimes around a mission\nsometimes around just the joy of being\nin community and then of course um more\noften than not around the joy of running\nand then to see that spread like\nwildfire into the US um black roses in\nNew York and and then of course the\nenergy of Korea Town and Good Vibes in\nLa that just got me really excited that\nthere was something different happening\nin the Run space unlike anything that I\nhad seen or experienced as a runner\ngrowing up in the late 80s and early 90s\ncoming into the sport um so I wanted to\nbe a part of it and I wasn't quite sure\nwhere or how initially um I was working\nin public education for a long time and\nI saw as I continued to hover around the\nrunspace I felt like there was a gap\nbetween this emerging excitement and\ncommunity building and coalescing around\nRunners from all backgrounds and spaces\nfor them to come and Shop hang out share\ninformation um talk about running and\nracing and talking about and talk about\nissues that were impacting our community\nand I didn't feel like that was\nhappening anywhere in the country and so\nI thought hey I'm I think I'm perfectly\npositioned to do this and that's really\nthe groundwork or the root the roots of\nwhat um sparked the opening of\nrenegade so like a shift in culture I I\nwould say before before that time period\nI really feel like your retail\nexperience was pretty cookie cutter\nyou'd see a rack of Brooks clothing\nyou'd see a rack of Nike maybe you know\nsome socony it was the shoe companies\nkind of like putting here's your run\ngear and if it wasn't a lot of like it\nwas more performance-based than maybe\nstyle based so it's like okay this shirt\nWicks sweat who needs to do anything\ncrazy put it out in a couple different\nfluorescent colors maybe and a black and\nand that's where you go what I what I\nfound interesting about run cruise and\nwe started faster basts back in like\n2012 was uh that this became a way to\nexpress yourself in running and kind of\nidentify with like-minded people or\nother people I think what I see uh in\nyour mission is also kind of helping\nthat underserved clientele maybe the\nmarginalized clientele and bringing them\ninto the spotlight or at least giving\nthem a place to feel where they belong\nin the sport and are part of the sport\nhow important is that to you yeah uh\n100% that's you know I would I would\nalso say that you know the beauty of run\nCrews because nearly all of them do not\nhave a physical location um P being the\nprobably one exception since they're\nalso a retail store um they'll get\ntogether wherever and and and usually\nyou know around um you know like-minded\num interest in their community be it\na um Community uh Meetup spot uh a\nrestaurant a bar places like that so\nthey really have this um you know like\ngo- get it attitude about them the\ndifference and where I felt like I could\nmake where I where where Renegade could\nmake a difference is that run stores\nkind of have the opposite um ethos it's\nlike we hold all the expertise we help\nhold all the\ninformation if you're if you are serious\nabout running you'll come into our doors\nand that's just I think a real that's\nkind of like the chasm between the two\nthe tension between the two communities\nso so I opened up with and and and I'm\ndriven by what can we do to reach\nindividuals small run clubs larger\nrunning crews in a way that feels real\nauthentic um and we can connect around\nsomething bigger than running and and\nthat's that's really where the work is\nat yeah and that interesting you say\nthat um I've seen kind of like a a full\ncircle uh with run Crews and I I think\noriginally I I get what you're saying\nlike I didn't start running in high\nschool and then go to college and then\nyou know grow up in the ecosphere of run\nspecialty and I think the running stores\nthat are getting it right and we're\nseeing some of these emerg that are kind\nof exciting and have that energy you\nwant to be around but there was a time\nperiod where I think these run clubs\nspun out of like I don't want to be\nowned by a running store or like find my\nrunning group at a running store so they\nsplit off and they kind of create their\nown culture and kind of grow this\norganic group of people that like to run\ntogether you can it doesn't even have to\nbe around structured you know workouts\nor anything you can just be like hey\nthis is where we meet we all run this\nand it's social we have some beers\nafterwards or whatever and then it's\nkind of evolved into this thing where\nwhere it became real appealing for\nBrands now to kind of like skip the\nstore and go straight to the Run Club MH\nand then there's backlash from the\ntraditional stores that are like hey why\naren't you supporting us anymore we buy\nall your shoes MH and then so I'm seeing\nthese run clubs actually get almost like\nsponsored and pulled back into the store\nI'm wondering if that is going to kill\nthe culture or do you think that grows\nthe culture in certain circumstances and\nI'll give you before I let you answer\nthat I'll give you the my thought is\nthere's some stores that do it right I\nthink the loop The Exchange\nRenegade uh you know Runner space\nthere's there's some stores that are are\nembracing what the Run clubs are doing\nbut there's other ones that are just\nplugging in as a marketing\ntactic yeah I mean I definitely feel\nlike um you know um running stores and\nrunning brands for that matter the big\nshoe\nbrands I feel like we're approaching a\nplace now where like you got to earn the\nrespect of the community you got to earn\nthe respect of some of these run Club\nFounders run crew Founders um and if you\ndon't yeah they're not GNA they're not\ngoing to support your business um which\nI think is a great is a great um um\napproach like you know communities of\ncolor largely are ignored by the running\nindustry they're used primarily to like\ncolor up their social media you know\nit's like you know um if we want to add\nsome flavor to it you'll put someone in\nyour social media sadly and\nunfortunately it seems to be like the\nsame person for you know showing up in\nlike four or five different shoe brands\nsocial media for like 18 months or\nsomething it's like I don't know if like\nthey all have conspired to some cookie\ncutter formula um so I think that the\nthe the the growth um and the political\nnature of it also because I don't want\nto I don't want to lose that it's a\npolitical act when a group of people and\nwhen it's a largely communities of color\num groups of people in the large numbers\nthat they're coming together that's a\npretty profound political statement so I\nthink more shoe brands are no longer\nwalking that fine line they're actually\njumping all in with both feet or they're\ngoing to miss the opportunity because\nlike I said at the top of this question\nlike you really have to come and earn it\nyou got to be real you have to be\nwilling to just do more than just throw\nyou know a handful of shoes um or a\nbranded singlet at a crew now um and I\nthink that's the way it should be all\nright so you threw out kind of a word\nthat I think is kind of like a tricky\nword especially in today's climate\npolitical what do you what do you mean\nby political when you use it in that\ncontext well when you see I mean I think\nwhen you see any um it when you see a\ngroup of people of color coming\ntogether\num really like let's say a from a topic\nor or a function um that can be that\nfrom the outside can be um intimidating\nto um um somebody who is not a part of\nthat group um and the you know the the\nsort of historic nature of that thinking\nis like that group is conspiring to do\nsomething Fillin the blank mischievous\npolitical um you know social upheaval or\nsomething like that you know um so the\nappearance of it conjures up you know or\nevokes a lot of different feelings um I\nI call it a political act because in\nmany ways our communities let's call it\nthe bipo community just for the sake of\nmore\nspecificity um though it represents a\nlot of different groups of communities\nof color right\nAfrican-American Asian\nLatino um when we come together there's\num there's just this feeling like we can\ndo anything together um and so um you\nknow that's it's an exciting moment um\nbut it but I can see where it would be\num scary to to some people um and it's\nthe first time this has happened in\nrunning and the and the numbers that\nit's happening\nin I mean that's the exciting thing is\nthat you know when you think about like\nfrom our perspective the more people\nrunning the more people need information\ninformation the more people that will\nsearch out that information whether it's\nthrough us or through somebody else but\nthe numbers grow the races grow the the\nhealthy ecosystem of running grows so\nyeah I mean you know growing up in in\nthe East Bay and stuff like that at\nleast where I grew up I was exposed to\nbipo communities my entire childhood\nlike you're not going you're not going\nto grow up in the at least when I was\nthere it it was very diverse as far as\nuh the community then you know you come\nover to New York same thing and even in\nBaltimore where it's it's a pretty\nintegrated city um it there was a time\nwhere it felt a little less integrated\nbut now when we go for runs and we do\nstuff you're going to see uh you know\npeople of every background at these runs\nso I I to me it's not as crazy but I\ncame into running later than like the\nyou know I wasn't running until uh 2000\nand uh like seven and so I you know I\nkind of saw a shift but it wasn't it's\ndefinitely gotten more inclusive in the\nlast 5 10 years but I think the running\nCommunity has also grown in the last 5\n10 years for you when you see\nit I see it from a different perspective\nbecause obviously being a white guy and\nand coming into it I'm like I've seen\nthe community here you know it's been\nhappening but from your perspective\nyou're do you feel like this is a new\nthing or am I like like downplaying a\nlittle bit how much it's\ngrowing yeah I mean I you know I I'm I'm\nquite a bit older and like I said I\nstarted running in the late 80s um and\nearly 90s more competitively um\neverywhere that I've run there have\nalways been people of color that have\nrun um I I I think the difference\nbetween um then and now is that we\nmostly ran in our communities mostly if\nwe did race it was within our\ncommunities and didn't travel very far I\nthink that the difference and what's\nwhat makes it more visible and in my\nopinion more beautiful is that we're\nactually leaving the community and going\nand racing outside of our\nneighborhoods many people have the\naudacity it seems to be um to go and\nrace major marathons around the world\nwhich is really exciting\num and then many are are we're now\nseeing um they're actually dabbling in\nmultiple Sports not just running you see\nthem now taking on um cycling gravel\nriding Triathlon and things like that so\nit does give license when you start to\nsee larger groups of people of color it\ngives a license for more groups to\nemerge as more of us travel to other\nraces again it gives license and\nconnectivity safety um fun excitement to\nto travel to those places I know a lot\nof people for example Chicago is kind of\ngetting that energy where a lot of\npeople love to go to Chicago and New\nYork um because of the diversity of\npeople that are racing communities that\nthey can stay in and R race and run and\ntrain at um and and of course that's\nwith the context of what's been\nhappening at Boston what as well right\nwhich is kind of seems to be going in\nthe other direction so so these are\nnarratives that people are like\ndiving more deeply into and um and it's\nchanging it's changing the sport it's\nchanging who\nparticipates um and yeah that I'm\nenjoying seeing that for sure so as a\nstore owner and seeing it like firsthand\nwho's coming into the store who's\nengaging with product and stuff like\nthat what are some things that you're\nseeing that would maybe be different\nthan you might see at a m city run or at\na you know on Austin or some of the\nother parts of the\ncountry well we spend a lot of time in\nthe community and we do a lot of events\nin the community that um some running\nrelated um that we don't charge for so\num maybe you know and we're we're really\nvisible so the only thing that's\nrequired of the communities for them to\ncome out like our track nights for\nexample on Wednesday nights it's at the\nlocal Community College we always have\nupwards of 100 120 130 people um and\nit's exciting to see that they\ncoales themselves outside of that\nWednesday night so they'll run in groups\nof five or six or seven on other days\nand things like that they're joining\nraces together so and then of course\nthey'll come and shop at the store and\nyou know in pairs and small groups and\nthings like that so so there is this\nsort of like inextricable bond that I\nfeel like we have with our community\nwe're at a place now where I don't know\ntwo-thirds of the people that come into\nthe shop we already know them\nwe've seen them out in the community\nthey've come to our events um they're a\nmultiple repeat customer so there is\nthat familiarity I wouldn't go as far as\nsaying it's like a barber shop because\nwe haven't reached that level of of\ncoolness yet but it is a place where\npeople come and you're\nknown um you're recognized you're\nacknowledg uh acknowledged um and you're\ncelebrated and we have that sort of\nconnection and then just I mean on a\nlike much more specific specific note we\ndid an event on Saturday here at the\nshop with Nike sportsare so the the\nsportsare side the lifestyle side and um\nthrough our partnership with Nike and\nthrough the event um close to 400 pairs\nof shoes were gifted to people in the\ncommunity in a really cool sort of Nike\nstyle with like suitcases and we had DJs\nand food and a run and there was a dance\nparty at night so it was essentially a\ncelebration of yeah celebration of Nike\nproduct a celebration of our community\nsome product and the energy was high the\nturnout was crazy um so it's those kinds\nof events coupled with our like every\nday or you know every week sort of run\nfrom the shop activity and everything in\nbetween so see I don't I don't know you\nknow what the sort of culture or ethos\nis like at a Mill City um they have of\ncourse a long-standing relationship with\ntheir community and do an amazing job of\ncommunity building themselves um yeah I\nwould say that we just do it sort of\nlike Oakland with a little bit more\nstyle you that's what I was getting into\nthe Oakland thing and I'll get back to\nthat in a second but it's funny you said\nbarber shop because I'm always talking\nabout like for our space here in\nBaltimore we're not a retail store or\nanything like that but my favorite place\nas a kid was always the record store or\nthe skate shop and you went there even\nif you weren't purchasing you I would go\nto the SK shop and they would put in\nlike tapes you know at this time VHS\ntapes of cavalero and people skating and\nand you you could just sit there and\nmaybe the owner order pizza and we would\njust hang out and I've always wanted to\nhave that vibe in the things that we do\nfor uh believe in the run and one of the\nthings I'm noticing is kind of like a\nparallel between us is giving to people\nis more fun than taking from people and\nwe've always wanted when we do events\nthey're free events we want to we want\nto bring people in and and create that\nparty atmosphere that makes them love\nthe sport that we're in and maybe\nintroduces them to other people that\nfeel the same way and one of my favorite\nthings is seeing kind of like uh we have\nthe believer run club we have faster\nbasts and I've watched kind of the\nsocial groups grow out of that where\nthey're now creating their own Social\nCircles outside of the Run Club but\nwe've had marriages babies all that\nstuff it's just a fun like way to live\nis like to\nhelp spread the the passion for a\nhealthy thing like running one of the\nthings I noticed in\nOakland was that man that's a tough\nplace to be doing business we went to\nthe Target there while we were visiting\nyou there's a dude with like a\nsemi-automatic you know rifle standing\nat the the guard I know that you've had\npeople like smash windows before and\nstuff like that how it seems like you're\ncommitted to the community but man it's\ngot to be rough sometimes\num well it's rough to operate a business\num just in general it's tough to operate\na business um in a city that has many\nother um issues of which you know crime\nis one of them for sure but Oakland has\nmuch bigger problems and issues I think\nmore um systemic than than crime um I\nwould say it's more a lack of leadership\num at the like City Council and and\nmayor level um which I think is just\nkind of generally a problem with\npolitics in general but um um but\ndefinitely a city of this size needs\nstronger leadership and I think without\nthat that's what many of the small bu\nthat's what we talk about when small\nbusiness owners get together um is it is\nthat there isn't the kind of\naccessibility we would want with our\npolitical leaders and there doesn't seem\nto be an urgency or a plan in place and\nso when you don't have those things then\none of the byproducts is um crime\nunfortunately or it's the crime that\nhappens sticks out like is this thing\njust GNA keep getting worse because of\nthe things I just mentioned you know and\nso it's the same here in\nBaltimore what's that it's Baltimore has\na similar\nissue yeah and we're seeing that we're\nseeing that across a lot of cities um\nyou know there's for whatever reason\nthere's there just seems to a lack of\nleadership um around um um some some of\nthe cities that that that unfortunately\na number of people of color are living\nin but just with regard to Oakland I\nthink that's the bigger issue um yeah\nbut you actually you said something\nabout I want to go back to though about\nthe skate shop you know um I I'm I've\nbeen getting questions now about like\nhow um I got good at building community\nit seems to be like a like a like a like\nit's kind of almost Voodoo or something\nyou know in the sport of running um\nbecause people within the sport of\nrunning have asked me you know like\nwhat's the formula like if we have some\nlike you know master plan like a plan\nyeah like a PowerPoint but as you were\nsaying that you know like about barber\nshops and skate shops you know um I mean\nI grew up in a barber shop in in San\nJose with my father as a barber and um I\njust feel like early on you know I grew\nup in a neighborhood and at a time where\npeople looked out for each other um\nevery adult had a right to parent you um\nyou know um if you had food or whatever\nyou had in the neighborhood it was\nshared with other people who needed it\nso there were people constantly coming\nthrough my grandparents to eat or grab\nfood or maybe even sleep and stuff like\nthat\nso I I guess in some way I can say that\nI've sort of been preparing for this\nmoment like my entire life you know but\nit but it does bring a bigger question\nto the floor for the sport of\nrunning that I feel like still operates\nvery transactional you know I mean even\nlike your store runs you know um it's I\nthink most running shops that do runs\nfrom their shop you can feel in most\ncases that that infrastructure was\nreally set up to like bring demo shoes\nand to to sell you something inside the\nstore um maybe sell you a training plan\nand things like that you know so um yeah\nunless you've been to a skate shop when\nyou were younger and like you know you\nyou you needed like a set of wheels so\nyou can get home like the shop owner\ngave you a set of wheels to get home you\nknow um and so so I think that that's a\nthat's a bigger question that I wish\nthat the running industry would have\nwith itself you know or maybe at places\nlike TR like how can we be more\nefficacious in our communities how can\nwe have a greater impact I mean we're\nreally just running you know what I mean\nit's not like yeah you know what I mean\nit's like we're in movement and we're in\nmovement in spaces that in many of our\nstores if you go out two or three or\nfour more miles there's a great need\nfor the infrastructure of what we do\nright like we\nmobilize um there are people that are\ntalented across a lot of different\nIndustries\num there's people with a great deal of\nlike fortitude I mean to run a marathon\nor an ultra takes or 5K for that matter\ntakes a lot of fortitude so what if we\nlike bottled up all of that secret sauce\nand did things just a few more blocks\noutside of our shops you know like how\nthen do we start to transform the\nneighborhoods we live in you know and\nnot depend on political leaders or the\nperson at Target to make our spaces\nsafer you know yeah well I think you\nknow we we talk about like the building\nCommunity thing I think that people can\nsniff out\ninauthentic motives and you know if it\ndoesn't feel right it doesn't feel right\nand you're not going to get the vibe\nthat you're looking for so when people\ntalk about a Playbook or how do you do\nthis I don't think it's a how it's like\nwhy are you doing\nthis and I think the problem is when\nsomebody comes to you and says hey can I\nget a playbook for how to build that\nCommunity yeah you're like you don't\nneed a Playbook you just need a reason\nwhy why like do you want it cuz look\nmaybe you will get rich owning a running\na running store you know and I'm sure\nthere are people that have but for the\nmost of us like if you're going to own a\nskate shop a barber shop a whatever it\nis you're not looking to you know Bank\nyou know like it's not like a investor\ncomes in and says what's your investor\ndeal let's let's build this up and and\nblow this out you know so I think a lot\nof people that when it resonates it's\nbecause the motive behind the shop like\nwhy why why do you have a shop\nVictor yeah I mean I want to see a I\nwanted to see a difference in our\ncommunity on a lot of different levels\nyou know I wanted there to be a safe\nspace for people to come together I\nwanted us to be able as a larger group\nof people to have an impact in our\ncommunity um and um those were those\nwere two big reasons why um um yeah and\nit's I the the joy of us um um in being\nin movement together to address our\nissues in our community together there's\nreally nothing like it you know um I\nmean we mobilized for a nonprofit in our\ncommunity the nonprofit has nothing to\ndo with running and on two different\nfundraising events the entire Community\nnot just Renegade or not because of\nrenegade it was all of us together\nraised like over 30,000 for a nonprofit\nthat's run entirely by volunteers and is\nworking with day laborers in the Oakland\narea\num so so that to me is the is the is the\nwhy that's the joy of what we're doing\nso like a vehicle to get you to another\nspace to be better man to be better to\nbe better in community to to live in a\nbetter space like you were saying I mean\nyou know I live and work in this area we\nrun and hang out and eat and in the\nneighborhood I walk around this\nneighborhood with my kids um and you\njust want to feel better in that space\nand feel more connected to each other\nyou know um and that's that's a big part\nof the why I mean if I look at Oakland\nnow from when I was a kid and so my mom\nlived in Oakland for a short period of\ntime right near your store um\nand Oakland in the time when she was\nthere late 70s early\n80s like it was a disaster as far as\nlike I I remember it as a child like you\ndidn't go to Oakland you went to\nBerkeley you went you know other areas\nbut Oakland was kind of like you don't\ngo there now Oakland Hills is a\ndifferent story but when now when I went\nthere it's actually kind of crazy CU now\nI saw it visiting you was like okay it\ntook an upswing and then it looks like\nCalifornia in general like San Francisco\neverything kind of like hit a peak and\nit seems like it's like so even with the\nproblems though it's better than it was\nwhen I was growing\nup yeah I mean there's I yeah I I don't\nthe history of Oakland is is you know is\na lot more complex than than what we can\nhandle in this podcast you know but but\num but again it's it's a beautiful city\nI don't think it's any more or less\ndangerous than any other comparable City\nI don't think it has any more or less\npromise than you know some emerging I\ndon't know Suburban City or something\nlike that you know it's just kind of\njust just like you know there are City\nthat do well for themselves and and are\nable to make progress um you know I've\nnever I haven't been in Minneapolis for\nexample in a very long time I know that\nsome of the cities in the Midwest and\nyou know sort of I don't know lay their\nhat on\nhow how joyful the places are um so I\ndon't know I don't live there so I'm not\nI'm not going to compare or contrast it\nto others I know that there is a there\nis a beautiful energy in Oakland because\nbecause of its diversity because of its\nhistory um because of the art because of\npeople that are out in movement together\num around each other and honestly I I I\ncan't I I couldn't I mean I most cities\nthat I've lived in have been similar in\ntheir diversity in their challenges in\nthe joy and um I I couldn't imagine\nliving any place else or I else yeah I\nfeel the same way about Baltimore I'm\nlike I I almost feel like when when is\nthe rest of the country going to\ndiscover this little gem that's right on\nthe water half an hour from DC an hour\nfrom Philly a two-hour train ride to New\nYork City like we're in the perfect spot\nwe just got to figure this out but\neverybody has those challenges I noticed\nthat you guys threw some uh attention\ntowards Los Angeles though for a little\nbit there is that a permanent Renegade\nor is that just a popup like what's\ngoing on there yeah we opened our second\nstore\nin Los Angeles um in October um for all\nof the same reasons I've been mentioning\nhere about um why we started Renegade\nand why Oakland um I went to school in\nLa I have family in\nLa um La is just beautifully\ndiverse um and um an amazing space to to\nrun to ride to swim um to be active um\nand um where we we located our second\nshop in Silver Lake which is I feel like\na great ju toos to like downtown LA East\nLA um and uh the sort of new\ngentrification of that area so it's got\nlike a good mix of a lot of different\nthings happening um and yeah we're\nreally lucky to be there and a big part\nof the decision to move there was how\nmuch support and love and and being\nconnected to the um the you know a lot\nof the Run crews in La so um yeah that's\nour second shop we're excited to be\nthere and um and it's beautiful to\nconnect there's a really um amazing sort\nof tension between Northern California\nand Southern California it's existed\nlong before I was born um but I know it\ngrowing up I was actually a Dodger fan\nliving in the Bay area so I was like\nmost most hated on my little league\nteams um and um so it's actually nice to\nbe in both places and have people visit\nfrom both areas um living and running in\nboth cities so um it's great to be sort\nof be in both to be situated in both\ncommunities so we're gonna see a\nrenegade cap that has orange and black\nwith an orange bill on one and then a\nblue blue and white no man that ain't\ncool enough plus it's already been\ndone yeah man California's a weird space\nuh yeah um it's interesting though\nyou're you have a curated collection at\nyour store and you really like here's\nwhat I find is interesting about\nlike I feel like there's a few taste\nmakers in the space and I think that you\nhave your finger on that pulse for like\nwhat's coming next and kind of like\nwhat's interesting in the Run space how\ndo how do you go about developing your\nuh collection there for\nRenegade um I I definitely am obsessed\nwith design\num capital D design in the in the most\nin the broadest sense um you know\nwhether that's architecture painting um\nmaterials apparel um so that generally\njust draws my interest at a very high\nlevel um I studied it um in college I\nwas fascinated by it as a kid um as a\nMexican growing up and there's murals\nlike around you all the time and the\npolitical nature of murals um has has\nbeen has been something that has um yeah\nI mean it it it's it just sort of grew\nme up actually from like a knucklehead\nteenager into you know a wannabe\nintellect as I got older um so Art and\nDesign have kind of helped sort of grow\nme up to be the person I am today to\nappreciate you know um you know\nmessaging and um storytelling and the\nimpact that a narrative can have have\nwhen it's present the the chaos that\nhappens with the lack of a of a\nnarrative that you can connect to um so\nanyway I've been sort of obsessed with\nwith design um as a as a little kid and\nand again even more so now as an adult\num I love artists designers that have a\nstrong purpose to their work and so so\nwhen I you know I think like I think one\nof the first before well in the running\nspace um before I think satisfying\nDistrict Vision kind of started to\nemerge around the same time and you can\nfeel the the design in ttention in the\nglasses that District Vision um was\ncreating at the time um and of course\nyou can feel the design\naesthetic and function and and\ndifferentiation that satisfy was\ncreating at the time and my God that was\nexciting and so I I find I try to find\nBrands and designers like that that want\nto push the\nboundaries um that want to create\nsomething that hasn't been created um\nand and I just try to latch on to it and\nin some instances they're and in more so\nnow actually um they're not even running\nrelated and I just want to have them in\nour space because they're just so\nthoughtfully designed and made and so um\nan wander is probably one of those\nbrands that is not running related just\nbeautifully made garments that straddle\nthis like design and and function and\nBeauty um maybe it helps that the design\nteam is a man woman team so it has like\nthis beautiful yin-yang to it um and so\num so yeah that's you know that's that's\nsort of the premise I guess I how I\napproach it um and at this point we we\nnow kind of find each other through\nsocial media through um you know just\nkind of visiting each other in person um\nbut yeah that's that's the level of\ndetail that I obsess with these things\nand not everything meets that standard\nin Renegade of course you know some\nstuff you just you just need a waste\nbelt to put your phone in you know so um\nso but but the things that excite me are\nare are those give me three brands that\nyou carry that are unique to R rade say\nthat you feel like Runners should be\naware of or maybe you don't even carry\nhim now but you want Runners to be like\nkeep it an eye\non wow so there's I mean in the shop\nright now there's two small brands that\nthat I I I really like what they're\ndoing one is Tanuki from Japan the other\nis Mountain martial arts from Japan\nthey're both young small brands that um\nI think are having fun with um um with\ntheir running apparel um they're pushing\nthe boundaries on like Silhouettes and\nfabrics um and they're kind of whimsical\nwhich is kind of fun too you know so\nthey give you um I don't want to mention\nother brands names that I that I that\nact\nWhimsical and their stuff is kind of\ncrappy um so this stuff is is I think\nhas taken that approach to being fun\nlike Mountain Marshal lights for example\nhas they do like a lot of camo print and\nstuff like that which of course\neverybody has done um but they'll do it\nwith like a Polar Tech fabric they have\nthe absolute best um uh pocket system\nalong the hips of their shorts and so\nthat's um that's really exciting to see\nthere are two new brands that we're\ngoing to be carrying they're out now on\nsocial media you can see them one is UNA\nand the other's portal um two brand new\nbrands what I love about um una's um\nagain the designer comes from a high\nfashioned design so\nthere's a there's a a difference in\ntheir Silhouettes that is very as it's a\ndeparture from you know the traditional\nsinglet with the like the exact same\nscoop on the neck and the exact same\nopening of the arms and things like that\nso they're just playing with different\nshapes um and that's exciting to see\nbecause it's all with technical\nmaterials and for the purpose of running\num and then the other's portal and the\nguys at portal come from an ultr running\ntrail and cycling background and in fact\nthe first drop is going to have running\nand cycling um and trail running um\npieces all in the first drop um and so\nso th those are those are brands that\nI'm excited about in this early part of\nuh\n2025 all right now this is going to be a\ntough one but where do you see I mean\nwe're running come in the last 5 years\nespecially out of uh covid and all of\nthat where it's come from in the recent\nhistory where do you see it going\nbecause I don't see it like I don't feel\nlike we're reaching a bubble I don't\nfeel like this new growth is these\npeople are going to go away\nnecessarily uh but I want to know from\nyour perspective where do you see the\nsport\nheaded I think if you asked me this\nquestion like once a week for the next\nlike 10 weeks I probably would have 10\ndifferent answers\num for sure one thing is smaller brands\nare having a larger impact on bigger\nBrands um even though the larger brands\nare not as Nimble and can't get stuff to\nMarket as quickly it's gonna have it's\nhaving an impact I mean you see that\nalready with like you know an does an\namazing job with their apparel it's\nchanging that um norda and what norda\nhas done um in the shoe world is when\nyou rais the ceiling like that with you\nknow I'm sure that there were design\nteams talking to their bosses at every\nmajor brand when asked we want to make\nwe want you to make a better Trail shoe\nand their response was okay I know all\nthese materials I can make you a kickass\nshoe but this is what we'd have to sell\nit at and they might have been fired\nlike mids sentence you know what I mean\nlike that's how the industry has been\nfunctioning and Nick and Willa and norda\nchanged all of that dramatically I mean\nseeing fall winter 25 shoes it's like\neverybody has a trail shoe at\n275 and higher now and that's all\nbecause of Nick and Willa and norta you\nknow like no one would have had the\naudacity to do that you know so the\nsmaller brands are having a big impact\num on the larger Brands and that's\nexciting to see because now you get the\nartisan and the audac and the creativity\nof a small brand um and then you get\nsort of like the access to insane\nmaterials and technology and hopefully\nenvironmental thoughtfulness from the\nlarger Brands to make competing shoes in\nthat space so so that's going to just\ncontinue to percolate and and then just\nfeed off each other you have way too\nmany smart creative\ndesigners on the apparel side in running\nthat are not going to go anywhere I.E\nlike a Bree um they're going to continue\nto make even cooler even more amazing\nstuff um and you have the larger Brands\nnow that have recognize they're losing\ntoo much market share um and they have\nto get cooler hipper and be more agile\nand so um so I think that's gonna have\nwe're gonna see more of that play out I\ncan see the larger Brands having more\nlimited drops more collaborations like\npost archive faction and on um so\nrunning's just going to keep getting\ncooler I I like that um when you said\none thing that I think that there's a\nthere's been a price raising in shoes\nnow for the last few years I It Started\nWith You Remember When The Vapor fly\ncame out and people were like $250 for a\nratio that's crazy and they couldn't\nmake enough of them to Supply the demand\num same thing happened with super blast\nwhen that came out there're like people\nlike that's ridiculous this isn't even a\nrace stue it's over 200 bucks nobody's\ngoing to buy it they can't keep it in\nstock the I think it sometimes it merits\nit and sometimes it doesn't when I look\nat norda and you brought up norda as an\nexample for a more expensive Trail shoe\nnorda is using dyema bioda which is good\nfor the environment they're using the\nvbr out\nlike they're trying to create a really\nquality shoe and that's why it's priced\nwhere it is but they also can't compete\nwith the production numbers that maybe a\nNike can put out or an Adidas can put\nout or one of the major brands so you're\ntalking about a smaller inventory\nthey've got to make their profit on a\nhigher price Goods\nproduct other times we're now seeing\nthat all the bars are being lifted and\nall the shoe companies are now charging\nmore so I think sometimes when you raise\na ceiling and you do something creative\nand you bring in a new product that's\ngreat but I do also feel like there's\nsome bleeding from the in Industry where\nthey're still\nusing not as great components but\nthey're bringing the price up do you\nwould you agree with\nthat um actually I I think I'd push back\na tiny bit and say\nthat you know I mean the when you raise\nthe bar not everyone's going to sell a\nbuttload of you know two $300 shoes and\nin fact that's never going to be a major\nshoe brand strategy um so then how do\nyou capture I mean everybody's been\ntrying to\ncreate and capture the market of that um\nwhat what we call now like this super\ntrainer you know so it's like a $50\nsavings or a $75 savings on what you\nwere just talking about um um so anyway\nI what I see now is like the Nova blast\nat 140 is a phenomenal shoe like it just\nchecks a lot of boxes it performs it's\nlightweight the price is great um and\n$140 is still a lot of money but I think\nbecause of because of what we expect now\nfrom two 180 and20 and $275 shoes you\ncan expect more from this $140 shoe so\nyeah um Mount to Coast you know a new\nbrand um I think it's rare for a new\nbrand to get as many things right as\nthey have gotten right and the R1 I\nthink is is an absolutely phenomenal\nfirst time out of the gate shoe a\nlightweight shoe eight ounces a sensible\ndrop at 8 millimeters a sensible stack\nat like 28 in the midfoot um like it\njust like it got out of its own way and\njust made a very simple nice fitting\nshoe it seems like an easy formula right\nyeah so they kept it simple and and if I\nwas in that room I would have said hell\nno don't charge 160 like charge a lot\nmore you know uh but they were smart and\nshows that they're smarter than you know\nthan a lot of us at keeping it at 160\nand because of what you can expect in\nterms of durability it's even a better\nvalue because you can expect um a lot\nmore mileage than your traditional shoe\nbut amount to coast and the materials\nand performance of a Nova blast I think\nare aided by these super trainers and\nthese Racing shoes that now have people\ntalk talking about\nmaterials about you know performance\nabout longevity and they have that\nformula where they're you know their own\nequation that to then ask themselves is\nit worth it and whenever you have a\ncustomer asking those questions that's\ngreat for everybody you know yeah well I\nagree with you I mean I can name you've\ngot the rebel V5 you've got the Nova\nblast you've got the evos coming out\nfrom Adidas you've got the Brooks\nHyperion those are just four ride off\nthe top of my head that are under 150\nbucks that benefit from the materials\nthat came down from the Super Shoes to\nto in there I mean the evos has got the\nLight Strike Pro two in in the mid sole\nall these Foams this technology in this\nwhat I would say right now the most\nimportant thing that's happened to shoes\nin the last uh 10 years is the super\ncritical Foams and the introduction of\npeba into the uh mix and some of these\nother uh\nT\nTP uh Blends and stuff like that that\nare trickling down to the consumer at\nwhat I would say now what used to be the\n120 the MH that price point is now the\n150 so there has been some inflation but\nthere's that Tech is dropped down and\nyou're getting an extremely incredible\nwhen I grabb one of my old\nshoes from you know five years ago and I\nfeel the midsole I'm like how did I run\non this yeah but yeah yeah yeah and\nagain that you know because we we have\nmore people in the running space now um\nwe encourage people if you're running\nyour first 5k 10K half marathon there's\nno need for a racing shoe there's no\nneed for a plate there's no need even\nfor like a TPU like get a shoe that fits\nwell that you enjoy putting on every\nsingle day and have fun running all\ndifferent speeds and distances in that\nshoe and and just become familiar with\nyourself your body what's working what\nisn't working and on your second or\nthird pair of shoe of shoes then you can\nstart to add more Tools in your tool\nbelt as we call it you know start\nexperimenting all right so we're we're\ntalking about entering 2025 now is there\nanything that you you're really excited\nabout in the upcoming\nyear\num well um we're getting a lot of Buzz\nRenegade is because of La I think\nbecause of the work we're doing in and\noutside of running um because some of\nour emerging Brands so I'm excited for\nsome of the\nPartnerships um that we're going to have\nfor 2025 some of the new brands some of\nthe new um projects that we have cooking\nup so that's exciting like we're\nbecoming more relevant and that's that's\nexciting because that's a celebration of\nof like the team here um I have an\namazing leadership team I mean I should\nreally pause for a second and say that\nlike there are three folks um on our\nlead leadership team in addition to\nmyself you know Hannah Mia and Sarah\nthat are like it's like this is like the\nbrain power behind what we're doing um I\nactually just want to stay on this point\nfor a second because what we've talked\nabout so\nfar and and and and where we're headed\nand what I'm excited about is only\npossible because we've set up a\nstructure where we really try to operate\nyou know again like maybe like a design\nteam maybe like a marketing team maybe\nlike a charter school Founders\nleadership team so it's like we have\nthis leadership team that really leans\ninto each other's strengths creativity\nwe brainstorm like we're a design team\num so so so the team at Renegade and the\nthe staff are just like amazing folks um\nand so that's exciting because this the\nteam that's coales man when you meet\nthem individually collectively when you\nsee their work with Major Brands you're\nlike holy crap did you guys cook that up\nyou know and I do want to say for a\nsecond because it's not happen stance\nit's not last minute it's not just\nslapped together like we put a lot of\ntime a lot of effort a lot of regular\nmeetings research I mean like there's a\nlot that goes into what we're doing here\num and we don't take any of it for\ngranted so I'm excited about our team\nand what we have cooking up um um for\n2025 um\nyeah I mean right now the the first\nthing that I'm excited about just like\nin runup to the LA Marathon which\ncoincidentally aligns with the Oakland\nMarathon one week later so we have a\nbunch of like programming that we're\ndoing um we have this campaign called\nthe rest for La where we're going to\nsupport the running Community with all\nof the things that they need to start\nand be successful at the marathon\nbesides a training plan so we want to\nlike support the the running Community\nwith the rest of everything else you\nknow so recovery and meditation and I\nthink it's like an art activity that's\nplanned you know just to like forget\nrunning for the night you know so it's G\nto be more of that so that's what we're\nexcited about\num I'm I'm working on I'm trying to put\ntogether like a small capsule of apparel\nthat reflects the ethos of renegade and\nthat celebrates our running community so\nI'm I'm excited about that I would say\nthose are two things right off the bat\num from a from a product standpoint\num I'm always excited about what\nsatisfies is doing their Trail shoe I\nthink is gonna really The Rocker yeah I\nthink it's G to really shake some people\nup the 005 is also exciting so to have\nthem kind of like battling it out you\nknow in the high fashion polished floor\nrooms you know of our shops to the dirt\nit's going to be exciting I've destroyed\nmy o5s already like I wore them to a a\nconcert we actually we actually uh crowd\nsurf Nick at the concert oh nice so\nyeah which I was surprised he was party\nto but we had we had again had another\nnice night of wine\ndrinking yeah yeah yeah that doesn't\nsurprise me actually yeah he's a good\ntime um all right Victor this has been a\nlot of fun I'm always excited talk to\nyou I think that you're filling a niche\nin the running uh space that is really\nuseful to the community and it puts a\nspotlight on what's possible when you\nfollow like not\nnecessarily you know the traditional\nbusiness plan but like going after being\nexcited about style design with a\ncapital D that kind of stuff and serving\nyour community it it creates something\nthat when people are asking you said\nwhat's the formula for community and I\nsaid authenticity to a certain degree\nyour uh enthusiasm for beautiful product\nbeautiful people and bringing it all\ntogether I think is that uh PowerPoint\nthat people are looking for but it's not\nsomething that everybody can can build\nbecause you got to have a little bit of\ntaste and style and uh a little\nbackground for it but uh I think you're\ndoing a great job and excited to see\nother other stores find their\npersonality similar to the way that you\nhave at Renegade because I think that\nthis is for me this is the exciting\nspace in running retail thank you so\nmuch man I appreciate that that's like a\njust like a a really great you know\ncapsulation of what we're doing and I\nappreciate that and um and thanks for\nyou know giving some space and time to\nrun specialty we we don't get it it kind\nof gets lost in the in the you know in\nthe world of um you know of the running\nindustry so I appreciate that as well\nand thanks for making the time for us\nall right Victor we'll check in with you\nin 2025 and see how that La went sounds\ngreat man we hope to see you out in La\nsoon maybe maybe all right take care\n[Music]\n[Applause]",

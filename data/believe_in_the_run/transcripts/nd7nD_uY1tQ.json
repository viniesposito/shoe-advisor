  "text": "hey this is Robbie with leand run and\ntoday I'm here with Alex Lynn product\nmanager at ASA we're going to talk about\nsome of the stuff coming in\n2025 uh let's dive into it what do you\nwant to start out with absolutely yeah\nso the first shoe we're most excited\nabout is going to be the experience flow\n2 okay uh so this was our first shoe\nwith drop right so back back in October\n2023 we we introduced drop to our line\nfor the very first time and just so\npeople don't AR this people who are\nwatching flow is your line that's the\nintroduction to drop yeah experien\nfamily traditionally your zero drop\nshoes so then I'm sorry the experienced\nfamily experience and then that so and\nwhat is the drop on the experience\nfamily at least right now yeah so it's 4\nmm drop so so we're at 32 in the heel 28\nin the 4ot um and just it's it's a\nlittle bit more approachable for those\nwho maybe are a little apprehensive of\ngot going into zero drop um but still\nstill has our signature foot shape fit\nyou know still keeping you relatively\nlow it's still low Drop so not not\nbuilding it up too much but maybe a\nlittle bit more approachable if you're\nlooking to to come into brand sure okay\nso tell me and what what are people\ngoing to get out of this shoe what kind\nof Runner is looking for this yeah\nabsolutely so uh we really see this as\njust a really light efficient feel\nunderfoot um one of our big goals with\nthis update was actually to increase the\ncushioning underfoot as well so it's\nit's light it's cushioned and it feels a\nlittle bit more efficient just with the\ngeometry so not only do we raise the the\nthe uh the drop or add drop to this\nwe're actually able to get a little bit\nmore geometry out of the tool as well\nokay so there's a little bit of a\nrolling more kind of keeping you moving\nthrough the strides yeah a little bit\nmore rocker shape okay and do you have a\nweight on this shoe yes this uh the\nmen's size 10 and 1/2 what we sampled in\nis coming in at 8.2 Oz for a 10 and a\nhalf for 10 and half pretty white yeah\nyeah so we got an all new compound we're\nactually it's a one of our lowest\nspecific gravities that we've got so\nvery very lightweight um and then we've\nactually been able to increase the the\nresponsiveness and the cushioning of\nthis okay so a new compound for the\nmidsole and what are you calling that\nyeah so we're calling it ego P35 okay um\nand it's really delivering on a really\nreally nice ride you know it was one of\nthose shoes that with our wear testers\nas they wore them they they were just\nimmediately going to just how great it\nfelt underfoot and how it actually had\nmore light which was awesome and what's\nthe release date and price on this yeah\nso we're going to release the experience\nflow too in uh June of 2025 and it's\ngoing to retail for $140 okay awesome\nall right what what you got next yeah uh\nso another another update for us is\ngoing to be the Olympus 275 okay A big\none yeah this is super exciting so uh\nwe're calling this the Olympus 275 is\nkind of homage to the brand and and in\nour Founders um really they they started\ntinkering with product in a you know\nwith with a toaster oven is it is it at\nthe temperature 275 temperature yeah so\nso that's that's our our kind of Nod to\nto the past there and we actually kind\nof took the same ethos right and so we\nwanted to take our our Olympus 6 and\nreally just make it a little bit more\ntechnical a little bit more performance\noriented so what we've done we we still\nhave the same outsole and midsole but\nwe've actually changed the Strobel and\nsock liner um to be a little bit lighter\nweight little bit more responsive feel\nsoot we've just kind of tweaked it\nslightly um but then really in the upper\nthat's the big story got the Matrix\nupper on there we got the Matrix upper\nyeah so very exciting it's it's lighter\nweight this is actually over an ounce\nlighter than the inline kind of Olympus\n6 that we've got um but super protective\nsuper durable consistent fit throughout\nand then we've also got this kind of\nsree sleeve in the back here yeah that's\nnice I like this that's a nice\naggressive toe bumper you will not be\nbanging your toes on rocks on that thing\nnot with this one inspiration really is\nfor those that are you know out there\nfor those Ultra marathons and maybe\nmaybe they don't want a carbon plated\nshoe maybe they they want some a little\nbit more comfortable for the Long Haul\nyeah this is going to be a great option\nforce and what's and for those of you\nwho don't know the Matrix upper super\npremium upper really great durability\nespecially um and then yeah you got this\nintegrated Gator here obviously vrum is\nalways topnotch so and what is the uh\nwhat's the stack height on this yeah so\nthe Olympus is uh 275 and the Olympus 6\nare both 33 mm stack okay and uh this is\npart of your zero drop family yeah still\nmaintaining that and then uh oh yeah\nprice and release date yep so this is\nreleased in July 2025 and it will retail\nfor $185 okay great all right let's move\non all\nright all right let's see so next up\nwe've got the Lone Peak 9 so obviously\nkind of the the shoe right when people\nthink of of ultra it's almost always the\nLone Peak the classic Trail model for\nUltra exactly yeah a second shoe that\nwe've ever come out with first first\nTrail shoe that we ever came out with\nand uh you know with with this update\nreally wanted to focus on what what\nconsumers were loving about this so\nthrough our focus group some of the the\nthings that we continue to hear Comfort\nis King right and that's something that\nthey they always relate to us really\nhighlighted by that that original foot\nshape fit uh and then another thing that\nthat we knew we could improve upon was\ndurability so both whether it was\nRunners whether it was hikers um people\njust W it casually they wanted to get\neven more out of this product and it's\nit's an aggressive product so we\nactually have a new formulation of Max\ntrck underfoot um maintains the same\ngreat grip and traction more durability\nso just getting more life out of it\nright uh same goes for the midsole so\nit's an updated ego midsole uh again\nsame great responsiveness and cushioning\nbut a little bit more durability all the\nway through okay and then what we've\nalso done is really focus on the fit\nthrough the the quarter here so uh\ntradition or previously we had more kind\nof TPU overlays noo TPU we've actually\nchanged it to more of a woven material\nall right I like that yeah and it just\nfits quite a bit better especially\ndynamically a little more flexible yeah\nyeah a little bit more flexible and then\nyou can also lock it down with these\nadditional eyelets um so if lower volume\nor you want you know maybe something\nmore technical can really lock it down\nall the way through but a very exciting\nupdate it's it's a big change for the\nLone Peak 9 but uh I think it's it's a\ngreat one and still maintains the kind\nof the the sole of what the Lone Peak is\nand you got what's the sack tile on this\nyeah so it's 25 mm 25 okay and then uh\nyou got the integrated or the gator\nattachments back here that's always been\npart of the shoe I think the Lone Peak 2\nwas like one of the first trail shoes\nthat I ran in actually oh right on\nthat's my favorite Lone Peak yeah so\nthat was a holds a a nice spot in my\nheart I say awesome right um and then uh\nthe price and release date for this yep\nso this is uh it's actually coming out\nuh in the US here in December so it'll\nbe out very soon retailing for 140 bucks\nright around the corner okay cool and\nI'm sure so we'll be rev reviewing this\nin the near future I'm sure be out in\nthe next couple uh couple weeks a month\nawesome perfect all right what do we got\nnext in the lineup and next up is going\nto be the experience wild too okay um so\ntalks about the experience flow right\nour our kind of first product with with\ndrop um this is actually the first shoe\nthat we've got with drop on the trail\nside so uh the wild 2 we actually got a\nreally good response with the wild one\nyeah cuz the first one was is kind of\nlike a road to Trail like do everything\nshoe it kind of became that yeah which I\ndon't know if that was what you were\nlook for but but I think what happened\nis it's just super runnable and we've\nactually found our Elite athletes are\nactually racing in this oh wow um\nbecause they just they just love the\nfeel underfoot it's it's pretty\nlightweight for a trail shoe but it's\nstill pretty protective exact so yeah\nwith this one we're actually keeping the\nexact same tooling underfoot got such a\ngood response didn't want to change\nanything there um and really it's just\njust through the upper so you can see\nthis kind of asymmetrical design a\nlittle bit more protective through the\ntoe there really want to make sure you\nknow if you're kicking a rock you get a\nlittle bit of protection all the way\nthrough and then highlighting in the\nheel just just the material brakes there\nwhat that does is it it really kind of\nemphasizes just the comfort that we we\nwant to continue to deliver upon so we\nhave those kind of Achilles pillows\nreally lock you down I noticed that\nthat's kind of a nice touch because a\nlot of times you know it depending on\nhow stiff the shoe is or whatever you\ncan get some heel lift in it especially\non the up hills so nice having those\nheel pose give a better lock down yeah\nyou kind of sit into it a little bit\nmore that's awesome okay so what's the\nstack title on this yep so this one is\n32 in the heel 28 in the 4 foot and did\nyou have a weight on this one uh this\none it's I believe 9.2 Oz for your 10\nand a\nhalf so again pretty light I can see why\nyour athletes would like this a little\nmore Nimble on the foot especially when\nyou're taking up to the speed and uh\nprice and release date yep so this is\nreleasing may may of 2025 and it's going\nto for 140 bucks so we're actually\ndropping the price on this oh W there\nyou go and was last one 150 it was 145\n145 okay there you go little shrink\nflation in in the good way yeah um all\nright anything else we got going on I\nthink that's what all we've got for yeah\nperfect for this well D thank you for uh\nthis is our first interview so I'm like\nstill waking up in my mind so I'm glad\nhad a fun Wednesday night even worked at\nall you know what I actually took it\neasy last night I I did not I had two\ndrinks done had nice and sleep and uh\nwe're back for day two so awesome yeah\nall right thanks dude really appreciate\nit thank you",

  "text": "hey this is Taylor with believe in the\nrun and I'm here with Jeff Colt um on\nSuperstar I'm just going to say it that\nway and also to te it off I've been\nthoroughly whooped by this guy multiple\ntimes cir series hes Mountain Run Like\nthat's such a good race oh wow such a\ngood race um but we're here to talk\nabout on um I've seen a couple of these\nshoes around at different events\nthroughout the SE prototypes of this one\non your feet many others um and when we\nshow on media I get comments like is\nthat an on shoe tell me more yeah\nbecause I'm just going to say it an has\nnot been playing a major role in the\ntrail scene for a\nwhile athletes but here we are give us\nthis next Generation give us the rundown\non what you got okay I've been running\nwith on since 2020 and since 2020 the\ndate has been 2025 okay of like we're\ngoing to make our Splash and Trail in\n202\nso as an athlete for the last 4 years uh\nanytime someone's like Jeff you run for\non like what trail shoe do you like what\nhave you've been running in and you\ncan't tell them I've been running in\nthis yeah and and I different prototypes\nand versions of what we're calling the\nUltra Pro um so for me it's it's huge to\nbe able to say yeah I'm running in this\nproduct it's now commercially available\nand do I believe in it like 100% um so I\ngot to work on this product from the\nearly stage prototypes all the way\nthrough to what we have here in my hands\num there's only one thing that remains\nwith the ultra line and that's the name\nokay this is the Ultra Pro this is the\nultra 3 you might know the ultra and the\nultra 2 I would say both of those shoes\nthey've had success they're a little bit\nmore in the like hike run space um\neverything is revised with this shoe and\nI'm going to start on the bottom with\nthe mission grip this is a totally\ndifferent rubber compound uh than on\nthose ear\niterations it's incredibly tacky it\nworks really well in wet slick\nconditions it works really well on you\nknow faster uh Colorado dirt trails I\ntook it on Falling Waters uh Franconia\nridg loop back in New Hampshire which is\nnotoriously Steep and wet and I'm like\nstill in Prototype phase before the 2023\nutnb and literally videoing telling the\nengineering team like Antoine I can't\nslip and I was just so fired up so fired\nup so um new rubber compound really\nreally grippy you'll see this Center\nChannel and this Fork the fork here is\nactually kind of showing that the plate\nthat's in this shoe is a forked plate so\nit's going to allow for you know\nvariable foot strike on different\nterrain without actually forcing the\nentire shoe to can of lever or or um you\nknow kind of tip uh additionally this\nCenter Channel mixed with the clouds\nthese clouds look small smaller from the\nsides if we go into the center they\nactually get wider and deeper okay\ninside the shoe what that means is for\nsuch a tall 38 mil sack heite shoe okay\nand what's the so narrow through the uh\nthrough the midfoot this shoe when\nyou're actually rolling on it it\ncollapses in on itself and it hugs the\nfoot really nicely so it provides a\nreally stable platform for being 38 down\nto 32 so 6 mil drop um traditionally a\nlot of trail shoes will do that with\nsome more other stability\nmechanisms fo so this is the CL actually\ndoing its job yeah a lot narrower\nthrough the midfoot than some of the\nother Trail Super Shoes on the market um\nif we see helan HF that means it's our\nsuper foam so there are different\ndensities of a super foam but Helen HF\nwe have two different densities here\nwe've got a peba and then down below we\nhave a tpe um so little\nbelow the nylon fiberglass plate so\nearly iterations where carbon fiber\nwasn't the right fit for the shoe um it\nwas a little too stiff um okay and is\nthis the same the same plate that's\nrunning here or is it two separate\npieces sorry it's it's one plate so the\norange you see is is the plate this is\njust kind of showing that it's a a\npronged plate um moving on from the foam\nwe go into the upper and with the upper\nyou have a completely static material\nit's a really Progressive design uh it's\nreally lightweight which is wonderful\nbut for a higher stack Shu again with a\nnarrower width you have an upper that's\nreally going to hold the foot tight in\nposition uh more of a conventional heel\ncushion okay not quite uh needed to go\nto like the the kind of Road supero uh\nminimal heel cushion it it it's really\ncomfortable um everything around this\nshoe was designed for efficiency so\nlet's look at the 100 mile distance\nWestern States UTMB the thought was not\nlike maximum uh return always it was\nlet's make this a really comfortable\nshoe to actually stride in so you don't\nsee this huge rocker but you get a\nreally nice roll through from both the\nDual density foam and again this ability\nto kind of collapse in on\nitself um So ultr Pro we've had you know\ntwo and a half three years of\nprototyping to get to this point uh\nathletes have been running in it now for\njust over you know a year and a half and\nraces it's an exceptional shoe and you\nsaid it like on showing up in trail in a\nvery intentional and meaningful way in\n2025 this is that showcase piece okay\nokay and and is this your\npiece just for race state are you\nbringing this out on certain types of\nTrail runs where does this show\nyeah I when I've had this shoe it's been\nJeff put as many miles as you can in\nthis send it back to me uh so like get\n350 400 miles in a shoe I'll ship it\nback to Zur my Western States this year\ndidn't go as as planned it was kind of a\nsideways race which ended up being kind\nof nice cuz the two pairs that they sent\nme for the race they were like giving me\nsome space and they didn't ask back for\nit uh they didn't ask for them back so\num I'll train in this shoe uh longer\nlike I wouldn't treat it quite like a\nroad super shoe that maybe it's like two\nthree runs a month type deal I'll do two\nruns a week in this shoe pretty\ncomfortably when this shoe comes out\nthough there's a reason I'll I'll end up\nin in a year putting more miles in the\nultra 3 probably than the Ultra Pro okay\nand some of that is um this shoe you\nknow the the foam the super foam's going\nto wear down or kind of lose its life a\nlittle bit quicker um this is still a\nredesigned you know very different from\nthe current Ultra line it's way more\nsimilar to the Ultra\nPro got a 32 mm stack height yeah so 32\nmil stack height a little lower to the\nground I think for faster races I would\nsay for like cir series I'd probably\nlean toward this\num the foam densities you've got Helen\nHF up above and then a more standard Eva\nbelow the plate is slightly softer it's\nstill a St shape and still a nylon\nfiberglass layout\nbut stiffer Foams slightly softer plate\nlower stock height I think it's a uh\nshoe for you know everyday training runs\num long run and\nthen uh maybe faster like in the 50k\nrace or just something more technical\nyeah it's much more moderately stacked\nfor Trails so still a 6 mm drop really\nstill a really really nice upper these\nshoes drain incredibly well yeah so\nbreathable you can see right through\nthem as we're we're looking at yeah\nthat's a a big thing when we were\nworking on this at the 2022 2023 Western\nStates was just like guys I I need a\nshoe that like if water goes in it's\ngoing to all pour out like gortex is\nthat right like don't don't give me\nstuff I don't need trim it down make it\nmake it so that it's going to work\nreally well for the athletes um the\nultra 3 is still going to do that okay\nso thinking of this as not necessarily\njust your daily trainer good option for\na variety of Trail a variety of\ndistances Paces but this is your Ultra\nrace day Sho yeah yeah so targeted for\nUTMB in western states um really made to\nbe an efficient shoe for that 100 mile\ndistance and when when is this when can\nwe expect to see June 19th okay of 2025\nso the week before Western States this\nshoe will launch and price point 260\nokay and the ultra 3 will actually be a\nlittle bit later July 3rd\nand uh 190 all right so these two are\nkind of the the ultra line also keep\nyour eyes out in the future for more uh\nyou know uphill short course oriented\nspeedier trail shoes so lot to come from\non okay and will that other shoe come\n2025 or are we going to wait till got to\nbe patient on that okay that sounds good\nthank you Jeff for joining us tell us\nall

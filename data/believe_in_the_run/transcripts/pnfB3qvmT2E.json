  "text": "[Music]\nhi this is Thomas with believe in the\nrun this is Megan with believe in the\nrun and Megan we got something new from\nuh Nike we do I'm pretty excited about\nthis because we've got the whole lineup\nhere just like we're going to see in the\nvomero line the Pegasus Line is now\nsegmented into three levels of what are\nthey doing with the Pegasus line why are\nwhy are we using like this line what\nshould it be intended for so this line\nis now the responsive cushioning line\nwhereas the vomero we talked about was\nthe max cushioning line and then they\nhave the structure which is for\nstability all right so we've already\nreviewed the Pegasus 41 it got a medium\nreview from us we felt it was a little\nthin under the 4 foot the react foam\nwas okay and then you move up to the\nPegasus plus and again we had a little\nbit of an issue with it being thin under\nthe for foot the foam just didn't react\na lot of people thought why isn't this\nthe Pegasus Turbo now we know because of\nthe way that they're organizing things\nthis is the plus and now finally we're\nreally excited about the Pegasus premium\nand of the three Pegasus spoiler alert\nthis is definitely my favorite Pegasus\nyeah I would have to agree so do you\njust want to get into it let's get into\nit let's start like we always do from\nthe top all right so this upper they're\ncalling it a knit woven circular upper\nor something like that circular knit\nwoven upper yeah it's got a bunch of\nstuff happening up here so you've got a\nlittle bit of mesh on the side you've\ngot a knit upper towards the forefoot\nhere you've got some overlays it's it\nfeels like a lot happening I mean what\nhow did you describe it earlier uh well\nthe tongue it's a weird tongue with a\nlot of weird holes in it that's not what\nyou said\nearlier all right anyway I really love\nthis upper I thought it does it's like a\nperformance upper it's got just the\nkitchen sink in it it's got a little bit\nof everything you've got plenty of\npadding around the heel counter and\ncollar to give you comfort the tongue is\nreally puffy and and like cloudlike it's\nlike lots of holes lot there are a lot\nof holes that's hey it's got to cut\nweight somewhere we'll talk about the\nweight in a little bit didn't work but\num I I just really love the detailing on\nthis shoe they call it a premium I feel\nlike it is a premium upper it's I I love\nthis upper it fits really well yeah I do\nthink the fit is really nice when you\nlook down it appears to be very narrow\nbut it actually it fit my foot fine but\nit does look very narrow yeah for my\nfoot which is narrow I found it fit well\nI didn't get any puckering I again I\nreally like this upper I thought it was\ngreat yeah all right so moving on to the\ngood stuff what do we got beneath the\nfoot all right you start off with what\nwe really like to land on zoomx and\nthere's plenty of it you can see there's\na very thick section of zoomx foam down\nhere for those of you who don't know\nwhat zoomx is you should but it's like a\npea foam that it might actually be real\npacks but it is real packs and um it\njust feels great bouncy Airy typically\nit's very light so if you just had a\nmidsole like on the race St shoes made\nof zoomx it lightens up the shoe quite a\nbit then getting down to the middle me\nyou've got a fulllength Air Zoom unit\nwhich is crazy um now this is where a\nlot of people are going nuts because\nthey're like this is Tech from the 9s\nwhat are they doing like it can't be a\nreal running shoe with all that we've\nheard a lot of your comments on\nInstagram about the shoe but I got to\ntell you one the new way that they're\ndoing these air units with the tensils\ninside that kind of like make sure that\nit's a little more stable and\ndistributes that cushioning from the air\nworks really well to I got to tell you\nthis little Cloud here is a joy to run\non it's also sculpted around the shoe so\nit kind of like hugs where the foot is\nwhereas of those like lifestyle shoes\nit's more like bulky and outward so this\ndefinitely feels more like a performance\nfeature versus some lifestyle thing\nalthough it does look good so I'd cross\nover and use it for lifestyle anyway we\npop down to the final layer which is the\nreact X foam and that has I mean it's\nbasically a pretty minimal layer of it\njust to kind of hold the bottom maybe\nprovide some durability for that and the\nway that they tie off that air bubble on\nthe bottom it almost gives you almost\nlike a little bit of a plate I wouldn't\ncall it a plate necessarily but it is a\na going to provide a little bit of\nstructure and uh just keep it kind of\nstable and similarly to the plate it's\ngoing to give you that propulsive\nfeeling so on toe off you really get\nthat pop from the air unit um when\nyou're running you can even see in the\nfront it just goes down to uh outsole\nmaterial here so you're not even having\nuh foam under the for foot which\ntypically you would say uhoh but you can\nsee how much zoomx dips down here so\nyou're really in good shape moving down\nto the out soole me tons of grip tons of\ncoverage almost full coverage rubber on\nthe bottom and you've got that waffle\npattern that Nike loves so much and yeah\nI I did do a couple runs in the rain or\nwet conditions and the traction was fine\nfor me so I mean all this rubber guess\nit's working now before we weighed the\nshoe I went out out of the box took it\nout for 12 miles and I was just like\nthis shoe feels great through the stride\nI was like bouncing I felt like the\nenergy return was insane like I just it\nfelt great on the run I didn't feel my\nleg is getting fatigued at the end of\nthe 12 miles I felt great later on in\nthe day my leg still felt fresh like the\ncushioning is insane in this I really\nloved it and we posted a I posted a\nquick video of it on Instagram people\nlike it's heavy as a Breck and I was\nlike I don't think so so I put it on the\nscale turns out they're correct I think\nfor my size 10 and 1/2 it's 12 2 2 oz or\n345 G which is maybe one of the heaviest\nshoes I've run in this year but to prove\na point to be like okay it felt light on\nmy foot now that I know how much it\nweighs let me go out and I had a hill\nrepeat session and I took it out and I\nwas like no this shoe feels good good\nthis shoe works and even trying to do\nquick turnover in it I didn't feel like\nI had bricks on my foot yeah so my women\n7 and a half came in at 9.3 o or 265 G\nso again this is a very heavy shoe one\nof the heavier shoes I've reviewed\nprobably this year ever maybe ever um\nbut I didn't like Thomas it didn't\nbother me out on the roads and I think\npart of that is because of this use case\nthis is just that shoe that's super fun\nto go run in like if you are not\nmotivated to get out the door you lace\nthis up and you have a fun bouncy ride\nunderfoot I will say it's a lot\nunderfoot so you've got 45 mm in the\nheel 35 in the in the um 4 foot and so\nand because of this like narrow build I\nwould say it's not the most stable shoe\nthat I've ever run in for me that's not\nreally an issue so it it didn't bother\nme but it is something to note if you\nare someone who needs that like very\nstable ride yeah the air bubble does a\ngood job of being somewhat stable\nespecially when you're running but it's\nnot going to it's not providing\nstability this isn't a stability shoe I\nfeel like when we talk about the\npropulsion and stuff like that you do\nget the weight bounces out with that\nfeeling of like just popping off your\nfoot yeah I just think the fun Factor\noverrides the weight for me and I think\nthat's been true for several shoes this\nyear which are we've talked about it\nbefore like the shoes feel like they're\ngetting heavier but we're kind of\naccepting it because a the tech is great\nand they're fun to run in and then B it\nkind of makes for great race day\nexperience cuz then you take this off\nand you lace up that super light shoe\nand it feels great the shoe that this is\nmost similar to for me was the glycerin\nMax from Brooks which I was surprised\nanother one that was heavier but the\nbounce in the foam and the rebound of\nthat foam kind of kept you like moving\nthrough your stride I felt like this\nreminded me of that a lot I would agree\nI think those are two very similar shoes\nin their use cases where I think they\ndiffer quite a bit is in the stability\nand the fact that that glycerin Max had\nsuch a wide base that you could just I\nmean you could run Forever fast slow\nwhatever this one it feels like it's a\nlittle unstable someone who wants that\nwider platform would definitely want to\ngo with the glycerin okay you do land a\nlittle further back than I do I wouldn't\ncall you a heel Striker but just maybe a\nlittle further back and so I didn't have\nany issues with the stability and that\nso that might be something to look out\nfor if you're a heel Striker or\nsomething like that you'll have to let\nus know what you think of the ride of\nthis now the shoes price dropped\noriginally it was going to be 225\nthey've already changed that before\nrelease to 210 so it's right close to\nthe price of some of these Max cushion\nshoes some of these super trainers and I\ndefinitely put this in the super trainer\ncategory even though it's called a\npegasus this thing packs a lot of tech\nyeah I would have to agree all right so\nlet's get into our form fit function uh\nout of five what do you give the form I\ngot to dock it a little bit for the\nweight so other than the weight this\nsho's so much fun and stuff I'm I'm\ngoing to go with a four okay I'm docking\nit quite a bit cuz I'm going to give it\na two it's very heavy and\nalso looking down at this shoe I I'm\nsorry I hated it I hated it when I was\nrunning it looks too narrow and it looks\nsuper weird and I didn't like it I think\nit looks great like from the side but\nlooking down is awful okay I didn't have\nany problem I think it looks great toe\ndown fit all right out of five I love\nthe fit of the shoe I thought the upper\nwas really dialed in I didn't have any\nproblems looking down at it like Megan\nbut it it just I thought it was a really\nwell executed upper it feels premium I'm\ngoing to I'm going to give it a five\nthat makes sense with your narrow foot\num I'm going to dock it a little and\ngive it a four again it does have that\nlike narrow build it's not perfect I\nfelt like maybe there was too much\nhappening in the upper but otherwise it\nwas pretty good all right all right\nfunction\nfor what it's supposed to be doing I\nthink it's fantastic we talked about\nsome other shoes on whether or not I\nwould use it for everything I actually\nthink that this is more versatile than\nyou would think at its weight like I\nsaid I took it out for a long run and it\nfelt fantastic went out and did hill\nrepeats where I was trying to you know\npick up the pace and it felt really good\nI think it's more versatile than the\nweight would let you think so again I'm\ngoing to go 4.5 all right I think I'm\nalso going to go 4.5 well I did mention\na few times the stability was a little\nyou know maybe an issue for some people\nI feel like it's just so fun and I do\nthink you'll get tons of mileage out of\nit and you can use it for a lot of stuff\nso four and a half for me as well all\nright so what's that total Meg you're at\n13.5 I'm at 10.5 despite the lower\nrating for me I do really love this shoe\nyou definitely would give this a green\nlight yes for sure it's just and again\nit goes back to that fun fact and\nwanting to lace up this shoe and wanting\nto go for a run yeah this was I got to\nsay a treat for me I love running in\nthis shoe so I highly recommend it if\nyou want something bouncy fun uh that\nlooks kind of crazy yeah I think this\nshoe is does the job we did notice that\nthere's a limited edition number on both\nof ours you have 15 of 500 or 70 what is\nthat is 15 wow she has 15 of 500 and I'm\ndown to 261 of 500 so you got here a lot\nsooner we're not exactly sure what that\nis I guess that's just for this colorway\nlike maybe there's a limited edition\ncolorway coming out there's certainly\ngoing to be more colors more\navailability it's not just going to be\n500 shoes it'll be widely available in\nthe spring of 2025 I don't think we have\nan exact date yet and again it'll be\n$210 you might have seen it was going to\ngo for $225 but they have reduced that\nto$ 210 all right so that pretty much\nwraps it up may what do we want people\nto do if you haven't definitely go like\nthis video subscribe to our Channel you\ncan also find all of these reviews in\nwritten form on our website on believe\ninther run.com you can also subscribe to\nour newsletter there um which gives you\na recap of everything we've reviewed all\nof our videos all of

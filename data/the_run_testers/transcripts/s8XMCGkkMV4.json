  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers in this\nvideo we are going to be doing a\ncomparison of the New Balance 1080 v14\nand SOC ride 17 let's have a\n[Music]\nlook the New Balance 1080 v14 costs \u00a360\nor\n$164.99 it weighs 287 G or 10.1 o for\nmen in a size8 and the drop is 6 mm the\nsakon ride 17 cost \u00a3 135 $140 it weighs\n285 G or 10 oz for men in a size 8 and\nthe drop is 8\n[Music]\nmm the New Balance 1080 v14 is a daily\nshoe built for comfort and accessibility\nin the previous version of the shoe New\nBalance modified the fresh FX midsole to\nbe noticeably softer but with that came\na dip in the stability and the\nversatility of the shoe the Tennesse v14\naddresses that with a slightly firmer\nversion of the foam and the overall mids\nso geometry in addition there's an\nupdated engineered mesh upper to improve\nthe fit and provide better breathability\nthat also includes a good level of\npadding as well as a soft gusseted\ntongue on the outsole is a modest layer\nof rubber across the key areas of the\nshoe although this doesn't cover the\nfull length of the midsole Pham the\nsakon ride 17 receives a big update in\nthe form of a new power on plus midsole\nthe same material used in the trium 21\nthis addition dramatically changes the\nexperience of running in the ride to\nprovide more cushioning increased energy\nreturn and a smoother the transition\nbuilt for daily miles the ride 17 aims\nto provide a balance of comfort\nversatility and a touch of stability for\nticking off the miles the upper also\nsees an upgrade with a new engineered\nmesh design to improve breathability and\na 360\u00b0 fit to ensure a good lockdown on\nthe outs soole there's a generous layer\nof rubber to protect the midsole and\nprovide a good level of grip on varied\nRoad surfaces and there's plenty of\ninterior padding for a plush level of\nstep- in\nComfort when it comes to fit I ran in a\nUK 8 and A2 which is my regular size in\nboth shoes the fit on both is good I get\ngood security and hold in all the key\nareas heel midfoot no slipping to report\nthe New Balance 1080 v14 definitely has\na closer More Hugging fit it's a bit\nmore plush it's not quite as roomy the\nride 17 I think have a bit more wiggle\nroom in the toe box it's a bit more Airy\non the foot they just feel a bit more\nspacious over all but both hold really\nwell they both have good comfort and I'd\nrecommend going true to size unless you\nhave particularly wide or long feet in\nwhich case I'd maybe consider going half\na size up in the New Balance so I've got\nmy normal size with both of these shoes\nwhich is a uk9 with sakon that's a US 10\nit's a US 9.5 with New Balance New\nBalance can be a bit more up and down\nwith its sizing across its shoes but I\nfound that the 1080 you fit me true to\nsize in that 9/ 9.5 and I had a good\nhold around the heel and midfoot good\namount of room in the toe box soy the\nsame they're very consistent with their\nsizing I've got the same size across\ntheir entire range pretty much and the\nride 17 fits in the the same way as all\nthose shoes so no concerns really with\neither shoe about the hold at the heel\nor anything like that only concern\nrelated to fit is these little fabric\neyelets you get on the ride 17 I have\nbroken one of those by pulling too hard\non my laces and you know that's\nsomething to look out for if you do have\nthe shoe I don't think it's going to be\na Corum problem I haven't done it you\nknow to any other eyelets on the shoe or\nmore than once but yeah they're a little\nbit more flimsy than the kind of more\ntraditional eyelet setup you have on the\nNew Balance so I would say these two\nshoes are very comparable when it comes\nto fit they're both very comfortable\nshoes there's plenty of space in the\nforefoot uh before the big toe and\naround the side I'd say that the ride 17\nis a little bit less forgiving than the\n1080 v14 um I've got fairly average\nwidth beet and haven't had any problems\nwith either of these shoes but I would\nsay that if you did have much wider feet\nyou might notice that a little bit more\non the ride 17 than the 1080 v14 there's\nplenty of ping on both of these shoes\nnot loads but what you'd expect from a\ndaily shoe plenty of comfort they're\nboth shoes designed for Comfort uh so I\nwould definitely stay to my size in both\nof these\nshoes so we got two good cushion daily\ntrainers here that you are primarily\nfocused on Comfort I'd say but do give\nyou a little bit of Versatility you can\nuse them for a mix of runs both a little\nbit different to their predecessors the\nride 17 is quite different to the ride\n16 and 15 which were lighter kind of\nlower profile shoes they had a firmer\nfeel they were more designed to be kind\nof lightweight uptempo daily trainers\nwhereas the ride 17 has kind of taken\nover where the Triumph 21 left off with\nthe Triumph 22 being a very different\nshoe you've now got a similar setup in\nthe ride 17 to the Triumph 21 with that\npower run plus midso which is a very\nreliable Pham it's a phone we've seen in\nshoes for many years and delivers you\nknow a nice blend of comfort and\nresponsiveness it's quite a dense\nfeeling foam it lasts forever but kind\ndoes deliver the properties you expect\nin a durable daily trainer like this I\nsay the ride to me feels a little bit\nless cushioned in the ride 1 it's got a\nlower stack and you can feel that\nparticularly under the 4 foot where it's\na fair bit thinner than New Balance and\na slightly slapper feel to it as well it\ndoesn't feel quite as rocked as the New\nBalance 1080 v14 for me which the 1080\nv14 was a really pleasant surprise\nbecause it's never been a shoe that's\nbeen right at the top of my list I found\nsome of the older versions were kind of\nokay pretty standard daily trainers and\nthen the 1080 v13 which was really soft\njust a bit too soft for me and with the\n1080 v14 they just tweaked that midell a\nlittle bit to be a little bit more\nresilient and I get a much better ride\nout of it as a result it's still a\nreally soft shoe and a comfortable shoe\nsofter than the ride 17 I'd say but I\nnow have a much smoother transition I\nget a little bit more kind of\nresponsiveness off the toes as well\nbecause that foam is that little bit\nmore resilient it just creates a really\nnice ride for easy runs with a quite\nspritely feel you're still being very\nwell protected but it feels like quite a\nNimble shoe on your foot and then it\ndoes have a little bit more versatility\nas well I think because the really soft\nfoam on the previous model I think I\njust got lost in and kind of wed through\nit whereas you get a bit more back from\nthe foam in the 1080 v14 did a run\nwearing both shoes at the same time and\nyou can really feel the smoother\ntransition and the slight extra softness\nyou get with a 1080 v14 I'd say like you\nhave that denser feel the R 17 it slaps\nher a little bit more you know it feels\na little bit heavier on the foot but it\ndoesn't really feel heavy per say it's\njust it's just bigger this feels much\nmore Nimble the 1080 v14 and I think\npart of that is just the way the ride\ntransition is a little bit better for me\nas a heel Striker they both feel pretty\ngood and comfortable but you get a\nsofter feel and like I say that slightly\nmore sprightly feel from the 1080 so\nthese two shoes are shoes that you'd use\nfor your daily training miles both shoes\nthat are designed for ticking off um the\nmiles comfortably um adding possibly a\nlittle bit of Versatility as well the\n1080 v14 I really like the shoe I think\nit's a solid daily training shoe I don't\nthink it's a particularly versatile shoe\nbut um the previous version of the shoe\nthe tenness v13 was really really soft\nthey really maxed out the softness on\nthat shoe and you really notice it on\nthe run I love that shoe I preferred\nthat shoe to the tv14 just cuz I like\nsoft shoes but I would only use that\nshoe for easy comfortable miles I've\nnever use that for Interval sessions um\nTempo sessions anything like that it's\njust too soft and too squishy for that\nsort of run but it's very comfortable\nfor easy day runs for Recovery runs um\nand possibly just just any run you need\ncomfort um and you're not trying to do\nanything else with it the 108v 14 the\nmid foam has been modified a bit to be a\nlittle bit firmer it's not massively\nfirm but it's definitely firmer than\n108v 13 it uh as a result it has a\nlittle bit more stability in it which is\nwhat a lot of people didn't like about\nthe tv13 it lost a bit of stability this\nis a lot more stable um and it's also a\nbit more responsive as a result of that\nmidell phone becoming a little bit\nfirmer um but still it's very\ncomfortable easy day shoe it's very um\nthe mid soole is very balanced so it\ndoes have a bit of softness in it um\njust great for ticking off the miles uh\nI wouldn't say it's particularly shoe\ndesigned for running faster in you could\nprobably go up to maybe um faster longer\nsessions things like that it's probably\nan all right long run shoe definitely\nwant use it for Interval sessions or\nfaster training sessions where you\nreally want to go top speed um but it is\na solid or daily shoe very much like it\nI think it's the the the strength of the\nshoe is that it is very accessible to a\nlot of people you get a bit of\neverything bit of stability bit of\nsoftness bit of comfort it's all in\nthere it's a great shoe especially if\nyou're a beginner or if you just want\nsomething in your rotation that just\nticks off all of those runs where you're\nnot necessarily doing anything specific\nthe sakon ride 17 big fan of this shoe\nuh used it quite a bit when it came out\nlast year and it very similar to the\ntenness v14 it's a very balanced daily\nshoe that uh isn't too soft it's a bit\nfirmer than the tening tv14 for me and\nas a result it's a little bit more\nversatile I definitely think this shoe\nhas a bit more pop in it um I'm more\nlikely to use the ride 17 if I was going\nout to do a faster session if I was\ngoing on holiday and I wanted to take a\nshoe with me that I could do all of my\neasy runs and do some interval sessions\nthings like that in much more likely to\nchoose the ride 17 just because I think\nit's got a little bit more to it than\nthe tenness v14 I think the tenness v14\nis better for easy runs um because of\nthe way that that mle foam is built um\nbut uh I think the R 17 is better for\nfaster runs so it really comes down to\nto that sort of um what your focus is\nwhen it comes to daily runs and what\nyou're most likely to do as part of a\ntraining block um and other things IID\nsay about these two shoes is that\nthey're both pretty stable um they you\nboth you get a good solid ride in both\nof these shoes but when it comes to\nstability they both have very similar\nmidell foam so you're getting a good\nsolid ride in both of these shoes uh\nother thing I would say about this is\nthe outsole on the ride 17 very very\ngood uh I really like this out soole\nit's it's got a good covering of rubber\non it but it's quite a uh sticky rubber\nso it's got nice little grooves in it\nvery good for um running in the rain or\nanything like that have no problems at\nall with the ride 17 TT v14 equally it's\na good out soole I prefer the ride 17\nout soole it's just a little bit\ngrippier for me and less exposed\nsections from the mid sole I haven't had\nany problems in the T v14 and I've I've\ndone about 70k in this shoe now uh and\nthere's not really any sign of we on the\nmidsole sections of the shoe but ride 17\nhas a better outsole for me in testing\nI've run loads of miles in the socony\nride 17 it's one of my go-to shoes for\nmy casual runs I use it a lot when I'm\nnot testing other shoes and I want\nreliable Comfort on a kind of heads up\nrun I've covered around 50 km in the New\nBalance 1080 v14 I've mixed up the pce\nand Terrain in both shoes I did a 5em\nprogression run in the v14 just last\nnight in fact quick take on both these\nshoes we starting with the ride 17 I\nlove the ride 17 there's excellent dis\nappearing comfort and a really good ride\nthat balances cushioned Landings with\nrolling response and a bit of springy\nenergy for me it's one of those shoes it\njust feels natural straight out of the\nbox it's not totally effortless but it's\nvery easy for covering long miles\nwhether you're moving slow and easy or\npushing things slightly more Up Tempo\nit's not super soft it's not super\nenergetic but it's nicely consistent and\nI think it represents pretty good value\nfor me the 1080 v14 offers roughly\nspeaking more of the same as the 1080\nv13 it's a really well cushioned shoe\nthat's great for easy miles there's\nloads of plushness and comfort in the\nheel collar the tongues and the uppers\nand it really does an excellent job of\ndampening the road impact I like the\nfact that it's back to having a stiffer\nmore immediate feel Under Foot with this\ngeneration so it's still highly\ncushioned but not quite as soft as the\n1080 v13 that brings a bit more\nimmediacy to the ride and some more\nenergy so I was able to move up from\nsort of 8 to sub seven minute mile Pace\non my progression run and the 1080 v14\nhandled all of that really well last\nnight there's a bit more upper Pace\npotential I think than you get from the\nv13 so I also did a side by side Mile\nwith one shoe on each foot it actually\nturned out to be closer to 2 miles when\nI was out there doing it but the big\ndifference here I think is that the New\nBalance 108 v14 just has a bit more\nsoftness and a bit more bounce the soc\nride 17 on the foot you know it's a bit\nmore connected it's a bit firmer it\ndoesn't sink as much there's not as much\nkind of Return of the foam so it feels a\nbit more controlled and there's a bit\nmore stability in the ride 17 the New\nBalance 1080 v14 isn't necessarily a\nhugely unstable shoe but it is a\nslightly more wobbly Shue Under Foot I\nthink if you really need a bit more\nstability the ride 17 is going to give\nyou more than the New Balance 1080 v14 I\nthink there's maybe slightly more energy\nin the v14 as well which I think is\ndifferent from what we got from the\nv13 before I would have put the ride 17\nkind of well ahead of the v13 in terms\nof its overall versatility but I think\nthe 14 now comes much closer the other\nthing I I think there's definitely More\nHugging feel on the foot with the New\nBalance than you'll get with the ride 17\na bit more room in the toe box both have\nvery comfortable fits on the foot but\nyeah that's the main difference here I\nthink you can feel the higher stack as\nwell on the New Balance 1080 v14 a bit\nmore there's a bit more connection to\nthe ground in the ride 17 you really\nnotice it when you put them side by side\nbut I would use both of these shoes for\nthe same kinds of runs\nmainly okay so which one would I buy out\nof these two shoes tricky one cuz I like\nboth of these SHO they're not neither of\nthem is my favorite running shoe neither\nof them is the top of my list for daily\nrunning shoes I definitely more likely\nto go for something like the Muno NE\nVista which is a bit bouncier a bit more\nenjoyable to running these are a little\nbit more traditional a little bit more\nstable a little bit more balanced when\nit comes to running which makes them a\nbit more accessible shoes like the mauno\nNeo Vista um are a little bit soft and a\nlittle bit wobbly so if you want more\nstability you're not going to get it in\nthat shoe both of these very stable\nshoes very comparable shoes if you're\nlooking for a solid um all round daily\ntrainer I think it really just comes\ndown to that versatility factor of it um\nwhich if you're looking for a faster\ntraining shoe and it's not the fastest\ntraining shoe out there but you can\ndefinitely do a lot more than tennessy\nv14 I'd go for the ride 17 if you're\nlooking for allout comfort and easy day\num over past sessions 10814 the other\nthing as well is the price of these two\nshoes there's a bit of a difference\nbetween these two by about\n25 because of that I'm going ride 17 all\nthe way one because um I just like I\nprefer to use this for those faster\nsessions but also it's just better value\nall round so I'm picking the ride 17 in\nthis versus verdict then and I think\nwhat you've got here are two genuinely\ngood shoes both better towards the\nslower end of Paces but both with some\nversatility and some capability if you\nwant to move up a few gears I wouldn't\nchoose either of them for my fastest\nefforts but in a pinch I can hit\nmarathon pce and Beyond quite\ncomfortably though I have to work for it\nin both of these shoes I prefer the\nroomier disappearing feel of the ride 17\nto the slightly cocooning hug that\nyou'll get from the plushness of the\n1080 v14 I also think the ride 17 offers\na slightly more stable consistent\nrolling ride that's a bit more connected\nto the road if you prefer more softness\nand bounce though go for the 1080 v14 if\nyou want more stability and ground field\nI think the ride 17 is your shoe for me\npersonally I'd be very happy to have\neither shoe in my rotation but I think\nit comes down to Value so the cheaper\nride 17 gets my vote not least because\nI've seen it going on deals for well\nunder1 at the moment so R 17 is a really\ngood shoe and it's a good value shoe as\nwell it will give you a very consistent\nlevel of performance across the lifespan\nof the shoe which i' expect to be very\nlong you get a little bit of Versatility\nhere you get Comfort it's a good foam\nit's a good shoe but I do prefer the\nride field of the 1080 v14 like it's a\nbit more expensive but I think you are\ngetting an upgrade in ride en joyment\nfrom it like I said it's a bit softer\nrolls through a bit better has bit more\ncushioning under the forefoot which adds\nto the comfort of the shoe it's bit more\ncomfortable and cushioned in general I\nwould say whilst also being lighter than\nthe ride 17 and I think all round this\nisue I prefer to use pretty much any\nkind of but especially on those easy\nruns where it just feels like a shoe\nthat disappears a bit more on the foot\nor one that is just a bit more enjoyable\nthan the ride 17 for me which like I say\nis a very solid performer you pick it up\nyou're not really going to be\ndisappointed I think it will suit lots\nof different Runners but 1080 is the one\nI'd pick it's just a shoe that I enjoyed\nrunning in more that's it from us on\nthis versus thanks a lot

  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name is\nNick in this video we're going to be\ncomparing the Nike Pegasus premium to\nthe Pegasus 41 and the Pegasus\n[Music]\nplus so the Pegasus line now contains\nthree shoes it's part of a restructuring\nof Nike's training range where they have\nthe Pegasus line which is responsive\ndaily trainers like these the vomero\nline which is cushion shoes and the\nstructure line which is stability shoes\nthe Pegasus pre prium sits at the top of\nthe Pegasus lineup ahead of the Pegasus\nplus with the Pegasus 41 being the\nstandard entry level model I guess so\nthey come at A Rang of prices like I\nsaid a pegasus 41 is the cheapest shoe\nit's \u00a3130 or $140 Pegasus plus is \u00a3165\nor $180 and the Pegasus premium is \u00a3185\nor\n$210 then it comes to the weights the\nPegasus 41 is 291 G or 10.3 o Pegasus\nplus is the lightest shoe in the range\nat 257 G or 9 oz and heaviest shoe in\nthe range is actually the Pegasus\npremium which is a beefy 328 G or 11.6\nOz all those weights are in my UK size 9\nshoes which is a us10 they've all got a\n10 mm drop the kind of classic Nike 10\nmm drop across the board when it comes\nto stack IES the Pegasus premium is the\nhighest stack shoe it's 45 mm at the\nheel 35 at the 4ot not sure on the exact\nspecs on the other two shoes but they're\nlower than that I think the Pegasus plus\nis probably the lowest stack shoe but\nboth it and the Pegasus 41 seem to be\njust under 40 mm at the heel when it\ncomes to design with the Pegasus 41 you\nhave a react x midsole with Air Zoom\npods in there the midsoles very much the\nkey differences between the three shoes\nthey've all got a blend of kind of three\nmaterials but like I said with the\nPegasus 41 it's react X foam Air Zoom\npods engineered mesh upper lots of\npadding on it and then a waffle tread\nout soole then as you go up to the\nPegasus plus you get an improved midsole\nfoam it's all made from Nike's zoomx\nfoam this is not the softest version of\nzoomx I've ever tested this is the\nbouncy foam you see in their best shoes\nin general but it is a more responsive\nand lightweight pH then the stuff in the\nPegasus 41 then you have a fly it upper\nand then a rubber out soole again you\ngot that kind of waffle tread pretty\ngood coverage on the shoe as well then\nstepping up to the Pegasus premium\nthere's a whole lot going on in the\nmidell here you've got three different\nmaterials basically a blend of the\nmaterials used in the Pegasus 41 and\nPegasus plus you got a top layer of\nzoomx foam with a layer of react X foam\ngoing from the heel to the midfit at the\nbottom and then in between those you've\ngot a full Air Zoom unit which is a\nfirst and Nike shoes is a very\nresponsive material obviously it's quite\neye-catching design as well you got\nengineered mesh uper good amount of\npadding there and then again waffle\noutsole good coverage on the bottom of\nthe shoe\n[Music]\nthere comes to fit of the three shoes\ngot all of them in a uk9 which is a US\n10 that's the size I use across Nike\nrange and have done for many years have\ndone in many models of the Pegasus and\nthe Pegasus plus turbo and they all fit\nme really well got a good hold around\nthe he and midfoot enough room in the\ntoes wouldn't say there's much of a\ndifference in fit across the three shoes\nthey've all got fairly padded uh heel\ncollar on the back there and tongue and\na good amount of room the toe so I'd\nstick to your normal running shoe size\nand the same size across these three\n[Music]\nshoes so Pegasus lineup these are all\nmeant to be responsive daily trainers\nkind of catering for different price\npoints different styles of running\nperhaps of different preferences and\nride feeli they've all got kind of\nFairly classic Nike silhouette with that\n10 mm drop fairly narrow design not the\nmost rocked shoes all around and it's\nreally the mix of materials you have in\nthe midsole here and the much higher\nstack height on the Pegasus premium that\ncreates a slight difference in ride\nfeeli so I've run about 50 to 100K in\neach of these shoes using them for a mix\nof daily training I've done some short\nruns where I've been wearing two of the\nshoes at the same time to kind of\ndirectly compare them and certainly I\nhave thoughts and we'll go into those\nthoughts now we'll go for the shoes in\nturn let's start with the the Pegasus 41\nwhich is the classic Nike Pegasus it's\nyou a really good model of the Pegasus I\nthink this is a really good mid-range\ndaily trainer that will suit lots of\nRunners hasn't got the most exciting\nride underfoot the Foams in the midsole\nare kind of comfortable but they're not\nvery responsive especially under the\nforefoot there but it will work for lots\nof Runners it's the most stable of the\nthree Pegasus shoes for sure the widest\nand the most stable it's not too heavy\nfor such a cushion shoe it does offer\npretty good blend of comfort and a bit\nof Versatility for daily training it's\nnot a shoe that I've Loved going fast in\nparticularly myself but you can do a bit\nof uptempo stuff and it's certainly\ngoing to be a durable shoe you know it's\nin line very much with lots of mid-range\ntrainers from other brands things like\nthe sakon ride 17 the ASX no blast 5\nthose kind of shoes it's not going to\noffend many Runners but it's also not\ngoing to give you you know a\nparticularly exciting feeling under foot\nand you do get more of that if you\nupgrade to the Pegasus Plus plus simply\nbecause of the improved foam in the mid\nsoole here so got quite a similar design\nall around 10 mm drop fairly similar\nlooking shoe little bit narrower the\nPegasus plus and with that better foam\nin the Mido just makes it a fair bit\nlighter all around and as a result you\nget a better shoe in terms of\nVersatility Pegasus plus is certainly\nthe one of these three shoes I would\nview as the best for faster running I\nenjoy doing know a wider range of daily\ntraining in it I think it's got the pep\nfor kind of tempo runs interval sessions\nthat kind of thing it's still not a\nreally far shoe it's not like a super\ntrainer like something like Nike Zoom\nfly which is a plate and just you know a\nmore sprightly design all around but you\ncan pick up in the pace in it it's got a\nnice natural feel on the foot and\ncertainly of these three shoes is the\none I'd be looking at if I was looking\nfor you know a really versatile all\nround shoe that has a bit of speed there\nit probably Compares best to lightweight\nplate free shoes from other brands like\nthe Hoka Max 6 New Balance Rebel V4 that\nkind of thing to show you can do a lot\nof different running in because it is\nstill cushioned and comfortable enough\nfour easy runs long runs the kind of\nstuff you do in the Pegasus it's not\nquite as wide and as stable as the\nPegasus it's not quite as cushy on the\nI'd say at the heel but it is still very\ncomfortable and I enjoyed going long in\nthe shoe uh without any problems and\nyou've got quite a similar ride to the\nPegasus 41 with that 10 mm drop kind of\nsnaps through you know you get a little\nbit of 4ot discomfort sometimes over\nlong distances because they are quite\nthin under the 4ot because of that 10 mm\ndrop but still a comfortable shoe and\none that I do think is the most verstile\nof these three the Pegasus 41 to the\nPegasus plus is quite a natural\nprogression you've got a similar style\nof shoe just with kind of better\nmaterials in the Pegasus plus which you\npay a bit more for but then the Pegasus\npremium is something quite different to\nthe others like it's got a lot more foam\nUnder Foot you've got a bouncier design\nfor sure this is the bounciest Pegasus\nfor sure you've got a really much more\nresponsive feeling under the for foot\ncuz you've got much higher stack there\nso you get more comfort with the Pegasus\npremium under the 4 foot and a lot more\nresponse as well like it does give you a\nreally bouncy ride I was running with\nthis shoe at the same time as the other\ntwo you do get you know a lot more lift\noff that 4 foot but the trade-off is\nthat it's a lot heavier this shoe and\nthat's noticeable as well like I have\ndone some faster running in the Pegasus\npremium and it just feels more natural\nto do it in something like the Pegasus\nplus because it's just a lighter shoe it\njust feels easier to up the pace in this\nlike when you get into a nice flat\nstretch of road or even a mile downhill\nyou can really bounce along and cruise\nalong very merrily in the Pegasus plus\nbut the weight certainly holds it back\nand I don't think it's necessarily uh\nthe most well-rounded daily trainer\nbecause it's also I think the least\nstable of these three shoes and it's not\njust because it's the highest stack\nheight of them but it's also got the\nnarrowest pinch Point around the midfoot\nwhich I think is quite a strange design\nuh Choice from Nike given that you've\ngot this High stack of Foams does mean\nit's ever so slightly wobbly underfoot\nlike I'm a neutral Runner and I still\nfound you know I was pronating a little\nbit in this shoe compared to the others\nand I think if you are someone who needs\na bit of stability I'll definitely avoid\nthe Pegasus premium of these three shoes\nthe Pegasus 41 is certainly the most\nstable so it's definitely the most\ninteresting ride of the three and it's\nprobably a little bit more modern and\ndifferent to the other Nike shoes\nbecause even though it still has that 10\nmm drop it does feel a bit more rocket\nand you transition a bit more smoothly\nin the Pegasus premium I'd say and\nhaving that thick chunk of foam under\nfoot is very different to other the Nike\nshoes which like I say often because of\nthe 10 mm drop can be a bit thin under\nthe 4 foot compared to lots of more\nrocked or lower drop shoes on the market\nPegasus premium you know has that extra\ncush there gives you a nice bouncy\nfeeling there gives you a more\nprotective feeling on long runs but yeah\nthe trade-off is weight and also\nunfortunately stability I would say so\nthis is a shoe that probably lines up\nmore with Max cushion Cruisers from\nother brands like the Brooks Glycerin\nMax uh the hoker Skyward X or the puga\nPuma mag Max it's not really a super\ntrainer per se like one that you'd use\nfor a bit of everything that's the Nike\nZoom fly for sure and in this range it\nfeels like you know you've got natural\nstep up from Pegasus 41 to Pegasus plus\nand something quite different on top of\nthat which you know will probably really\nappeal to some Runners but I think we'll\nhave less broad appeal than these two\nshoes the Pegasus 41 and the pegus plus\nare a pretty good reliable work or daily\ntrainers pegus premium is something\nquite\n[Music]\ndifferent so it comes to my verdict on\nthe Pegasus range I think the Nike\nPegasus plus is the best all around shoe\nin the Pegasus range these days it's the\none I'd be picking up if I was looking\nto add a shoe to rotation or if I was\nlooking for an all around a shoe to do a\nbit of everything in like it's it's\npretty comfortable it's lightweight it's\nfast it's nippy it's got a nice you know\nSnappy ride to it you can do bit of\neverything in it and it like I said it's\nquite a natural step up on the Pegasus\n41 you trade off a little bit of\nstability and width and comfort at the\nback of the shoe but you still have a\ncomfortable shoe here it's still pretty\nstable and you get a lot more response\nout of the zoomx mile you get a lighter\nshoe and just a more accomplished all\nround shoe so that's the one that I\nthink is the best shoe in this range\nthink if you're a newer Runner or you're\njust looking for a comfortable and\ndurable shoe for easy runs then the Nike\nPegasus 41 is a really good choice as\nwell it's a little bit cheaper than the\npegas plus it's a shoe that always pops\nup in sales as well and it's quite a\nnice shoe as well in terms of looks so\nyou can use it for walking around as\nwell which is good and yeah it's a good\nshoe as well it's like it's not as\nresponsive and fast for sure it's not a\nshoe that I view as particularly first\ntime myself it's a very solid all round\nshoe and one that will work for lots of\nRunners so I would say these are both\npretty good shoes that could find a spot\nin most people's rotation and the\nPegasus premium is something quite\ndifferent so I think it's not the shoe\nI'd recommend buying purely from a\nrunning perspective for sure if you love\nThe Look of this shoe and you want a\nshoe that you can use for lifestyle use\nand the occasional run it will do the\njob of that just be a bit wary of that\nstability if you also just want the\nbounciest liveliest ride possible out of\nthese three shoes then it is the Pegasus\npremium it's just the tradeoff there is\nvery much the weight so if you're\nlooking for the most fun shoe I guess to\ndo easy runs that kind of thing then it\nis the Pegasus premium but if you're\nlooking for a more of a Workhorse\ntrainer to do those easy runs and other\nruns as well then yeah the Pegasus 41 or\nPegasus plus I think you know certainly\nmore Compass running shoes and a fair\nbit cheaper but this is you know it's a\nbit different especially for Nike with\nthat extra foam under the under the for\nfoot there you are going to get nice\nbouncy feeling there it is fun to\nrunning yeah just got those concerns\nabout weight stability and indeed price\nso the other shoes I think are probably\nmore natural fits for most Runners and\nlike I say of the three my favorite is\ndefinitely the Pegasus\n[Music]\nplus that's our run through of the Nike\nPegasus lineup for 2025 let us know what\nyou think in the comments below please\ndo like and subscribe ring the little\nbell and we'll see

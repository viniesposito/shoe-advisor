  "text": "good morning from Paris I am here to\nrace the hoker city center Paris 10K\nheading down to start line shortly we've\ngot the whole race is right in the Heart\nof the City really winding around some\nof the most Central parts of Paris which\nbe very interesting it's quite a twisty\ncourse so it might not necessarily be\nthe fastest but it should be very fun\nand it should be you know a really good\nchance to see a bit of Paris while it's\nrunning hard I had a pretty big week of\nmarathon training with Valencia two\nweeks away so going to go out run as\nfast as I can no real expectations on\ntime but hoping to put in a for half\ndecent performance have a bit of fun I\nam testing a few bits out as always so\nI've got on my feet the hoker rocket X2\nbeen a long time since I racing these\nshoes I've used them for some hard\ntraining runs recently and obiously they\ncame out last year now so thought it' be\nthe fun to put those on again as the\nraces with hoker and try out you know\nwhat is still probably the carbon shoe\nI'd recommend most from their range just\ncuz cell X1 as much as I love it is\nquite a big heavy shoe and this is a bit\nmore lightweight and racy and then on\nthe watch front I've got the new coros\nPace Pro which I am putting up against\nthe Garment 4 a 265 the big new\nmid-range battle we have of AMOLED\nwatches so going to be testing those\nboth on what will be a very tricky\ncourse for GPS twisting around right in\nthe Heart of the City Center and I will\nhave the 4 a 965 in a pocket linked to a\npolar VAR sensor heart rate monitor so I\ncan look at the heart rate readings on\nthe watches as well so yeah a few to\ntest looking forward to the race should\nbe good fun good hit out two weeks will\nValencia see where the legs are at\nthey're quite tired is my guess but I'm\nhoping to have a good run and it should\nbe really fun\nso all done I that went really well in\nthe end I think I ran something like\n3225 30 30 something like that like\nfaster than I expected just first half\nwas great controlled running on field\ntrying not to slip over it was very wet\ntoday and um and I went through I think\nin around 1615 and then I thought oh I\ncan I can give it a go here I felt quite\ngood and I think I ran second half in\nnot too far over 16 so I'm not sure the\nexact time will be but is probably my\nsecond fastest 10k so I'm very pleased\ncuz obviously pretty tired legs marathon\ntraining it's a pretty twisty course it\nwas wet so it rained on the way to the\ncourse there a lot of cobbles in the\nfirst half and I'll say the poker rocket\nX2 as fast and great as they were today\nthey are not the best at gripping on\nthat kind of surface so I have to be\nquite careful I don't tend to slip very\nmuch because I have such a short stride\nbut yeah it looks a bit dodgy at times\nso that was a bit risky and the course\nwas really cool though it was like\nyou're right in the center of Paris\nyou're just winding around you're seeing\nlots of cool stuff quite a lot of good\nRunners out today so I was able to run\nwith people the whole way pretty much\nand really long home straight which is\nkind of good and bad it's um it's just\ndemoralizing in the first kind of like\n45 seconds of a straight like that you\ndon't look like you're getting any\ncloser but then start to pick it up felt\nnice and good and um yeah delighted with\nthat time if it is around there I'll be\nreally pleased with that it's probably\nmy like I say second fastest 10k fastest\nwas recently in the river Nest 10K which\nhas a nice downhill stretch in it which\nyou don't get here so yeah good run\naround watches it's a hard course to\nwatches so I think even probably from\nabout second or third okay they were you\nknow I was a few probably 50 m ahead on\nGPS that kind of things they were\nbeeping early before the lap markers but\nnot too bad overall results so I'll have\na look at them in a minute and then go\nback and look at the GPS Trace later\nwasn't really using the watch as much\ntoday cuz it was it was meant to be just\nyou know like a nice relaxing hit out\nkind of thing nice and controlled rocket\nX2 like yeah it's a shoe I've come back\nto a few times recently underrated a\nlittle bit probably CU it is light it's\nfast it's doesn't have the bouncy\nfeeling of some of the shoes I like and\nI think the problem I have with it\ngenerally is that like it feels it does\na similar job for me in being a\nlightweight pretty firm but you know\nresponsive shoe similar to the aex Mets\nP like Sky Paris which I always bang on\nabout my favorite shoe and that's just a\nfair bit lighter so but yeah I ran\nreally well today and really enjoyed the\nshoe everything felt in good working\norder for Valencia put it that way but\nI'll go back and check heart rate and\nGPS on the watches I think they're both\nI think the choros was actually closer\nto the lap markers for sure than the\nGarmin so throughout the race that was\nprobably the one that was definitely\nclose then gin ended up probably 100 me\nfurther over 10K than the chorus but on\ntry course it's hard to exactly know but\nall around really enjoy myself it's\nquite cold now I'm going to go warm up\nand we go from\n[Music]\nthere so just back at the hotel now\ncouple of hours after the race uh still\nvery pleased really delighted of how\nthat went all around like just didn't\nhave too many expectations heading into\ntoday was careful and trying to be nice\nand conservative and actually was just\nrunning fast and I thought I'd be the\nwhole way and you know picked up pretty\nwell in the second half there I think I\nran a negative split uh something like I\nthink I think I was about 1615 1616 at\nthe halfway mark and then did around 16\nyou know1 or so in the second half so\nyeah really pleased with that all around\nmassive confidence boost head of\nValencia in a couple of weeks to be\nrunning that kind of pace on a pretty\nbig week all good on that front and\nreally yeah did enjoy the race like it\nis a twisty course but it was probably a\nbit quicker than I expected there were\nonly a couple of real dead turnarounds\nand the rest of the time there were some\ndecent long straights there were lots of\nfast Runners there today so was able to\nrun in pretty good groups and all that I\nthink I was finished 11th in the end uh\nagain very pleased with that as well\npicking up people in the second half I\nthink I did quite well in moving through\nthe field there it was probably less the\ncourse and more the slippery conditions\nthat made it a little bit slower I think\nin the first half there where it was\nlots of Cobble stuff like I say which is\njust not great in Super Shoes if you're\non um slippery cobal they just none of\nthem grip that well I'd say some do\nbetter than this hoker though which is\nnot got that like I say the best grip\nbut performance of the shoe yeah can't\nreally argue with it like the rocket X2\nread has put H you in line with most\nSuper Shoes out there now I think after\na few years it was only kind of one or\ntwo big players now most brands have\nvery good Super Shoes and you're kind of\npicking between them more on personal\npreference rather than anything rocket\nX2 is certainly really strong option I\ndo think it is the faster shoe from\nhoker if you're looking between the cell\nand the rocket X2 like I love the cell\nI've done more miles in the cell than\nany other shoe this year I think and\njust using it for lots of Long training\nruns I have racing it as well but it's\nbig it's bouncy but you just got a\nlittle bit more kind of rev from the\nrocket X2 it's lighter it feels racer\nand especially someone like myself I'm\nlike a high Cadence Runner I probably\ndon't put get as much Bounce from the\nYow as some people so I prefer the\nlighter feel of the rocket X2 which just\ngives you that faster turnover and that\nget slightly more you fast feel\nespecially over something like a 10K uh\nso yeah enjoyed that just been checking\nout the GPS tracks from the watches and\nthe heart rate I do the heart rate first\nboth do kind of okay both were kind of\nout by a similar amount in different\ndirections the 4265 was quite low for\nlots of the race it looks like on the\nheart rate and then the choros pce pro a\ngood stretch where it was in line with\nthe heart rate monitor but then did jump\nquite high at the end had a little jump\nat the beginning really cold conditions\nIt's just tough for optical heart rate\nmonitoring like I would always prefer to\nuse an armband or a chest sensor myself\nyou see the nice steady progression in\nheart rate you get from that the polar\nsense which just a little bit more\naccurate but both watches were kind of\nokay they were you ballpark okay some\ndives off the Garmin and yeah like I\nsaid the big jump on the corus at the\nstart and at the end but overall they\nwere kind of fine I think the averages\nisn't that far out from overall average\nand they probably performed fairly\nsimilar to each other I think probably\nthe page Pro slightly more accurate in\nthe middle there but overall yeah\nsimilar performance on those front and\nthen on the GPS like it's interesting\nthat they are quite different so the\nchoros was closer to distance of 10K you\nknow that's good I think that you know\nwins out on that front for sure because\nI wasn't running very tight lines I was\nrunning a bit further than 10K I think\nthat's probably the more accurate\noverall distance from choros there and\nit was certainly closer to the markers\neach kilometer than the Gin throughout\nthe race look at the actual track though\nI don't know where Garmin has picked up\nso much more than the corus they do look\npretty similar throughout the race like\nboth of them have little wobbles where\nthey go quite wide outside of a street\nand the Finish Line they each have you\non different sides of the roads entirely\nwhich is interesting because I don't\nthink that fairly open bit of the course\nso I thought they'd be quite accurate\nthere but then they really dial in on\nLong stretches where clearly the GPS\nconditions were a bit better but for a\ncity center race I would say pretty\nimpressive GPS from both those watches\nlike was following the right areas most\nof the time was on the road not running\nthrough too many buildings and it just\nlooks you given the twisty nature of the\ncourse in amongst high buildings I think\nthey both did a pretty good job overall\ndistance corus was closer and it was\ncertainly better for pacing I wasn't\nreally pacing with the watching the race\nI will say that so although I did notice\nyou know every lap split and then\nlooking at the markers and seeing how\nclose they were they were both obviously\ncoming up a bit before the marker came\naround because they end up with reading\na bit long but if I was going to be\npacing using the watch the chorus would\nhave be more accurate on the day between\nthe two of them so that's a win for the\nchorus as well so i' say overall and\naccuracy they're both pretty similar but\nyou got to give the aage to the chorus\nI'd say on both of those fronts uh in\nthat race I think the heart rate was a\nlittle bit more dialed in for the middle\npart of the race in particular and then\nthe overall distance and pacing the GPS\nwas probably slightly better as well but\nboth performed really very well I think\non the accuracy front now like this mult\nthis mid-range band of watches is kind\nof my favorite band of watches now we've\nalso got the sunto races and the polar\nVantage G3 where you're getting the\naccuracy that You' get from the top end\nwatch is now and it's really whether you\nwant the other features from most and\nwatch is like the you know more rugged\ndesigns or the maps which you don't get\non the Garmin but you do actually get on\nthe coros that was interesting and it\nwas useful for me while I was here in\nParis my first run in the city I did a\nlong run using the navigation on both\nwatches Maps was certainly A Plus on the\npace Pro here so it's had a good weekend\naround it's also doing very well on\nbattery life that was the other thing so\nI because this was a weekend away both\nof these AMOLED watches it's interesting\nto see if they could last the full\nweekend away and both of them have done\nbut the chus has lasted longer on batter\nlife i' would say so I charged these\nfully on Thursday afternoon I came over\nFriday morning did a long run and then\nran on Saturday as well have done the\nrace now and the choros is at 58% so\nvery good really you know looking at\nthat kind of period like it was you know\nover an hour and a half of running on\nFriday know the hour Rod yesterday and\ntoday and the Garmin has dropped to 29%\nso big disparity on the battery life\nthere so the pace bro if you're looking\nat kind of an AMOLED watch you go for a\nweekend away without taking a charger\ndoing a lot of running it would have the\nedge like it was only a 10K today I was\nlooking at something like a half\nmarathon start to be thinking about\nhaving to charge the Garment potentially\nbut you know it would be fine until\ntomorrow but yeah I'm going back today\nif I was going back on Monday then the\nextra bat life from the choros would\ncertainly been a bit of a boon so all\naround a good weekend for the coros pace\nPro when looking at it in comparison to\nthe uh the biggest name in that\nmid-range watchfield which is the 496\n265 but certainly some of other\nadvantages to the 265 will go into in\nmore detail when we get round to more of\na comparison video but all around really\nenjoyable out really fun race massive\nfield out there loads of people out\nthere like really was quite a good\natmosphere throughout the race spite the\nfact it was quite damp and cold at the\nstart everyone having a good time\nsurprisingly fast course I would say\ngiven that I thought it wasn't going to\nbe very fast at all but you know it was\nquick enough I'd say you go and run hard\non that like I said great atmosphere I\nhad a really good time out there and\ndelighted with my result on the day",

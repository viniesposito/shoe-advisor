  "text": "hey there Tommy from the Run testers\nthis video is our annual run testers\nAwards where we pick our top picks for a\nrange of categories including running\nheadphones running watches and a series\nof categories covering different types\nof running shoe this is also available\nas a podcast so if you want to listen to\nthis then maybe don't watch this video\nuh and listen to the podcast version\nright let's dive in and see what we\npicked this year\n[Music]\nguys welcome back to another Awards the\nuh rers Awards\n2024 um it's been quite a big year for\nrunning kit we've trusted a lot of shoes\nthis year um and some really really\nimpressive ones I think you said Nick\nthat 2024 is is probably your favorite\nyear for R shoe releases for quite some\ntime yeah I I think it's been a great\nyear like we we're doing are trying to\nthink about our favorite individual five\nshoes of the year and I it's going to be\na nightmare for me there's so many shoes\nI've Loved this year yeah you're going\nto you're going to be back and forth\nwith that aren't you that's quite easy\nfor me I did it earlier um but uh okay\nso the the awards um just for people who\nare new to this uh we do this every year\nand it is um we pick a number of\ncategories um and we'll go through all\nthese in order um but the way that we\njudge the best shoes best watches and\nbest um headphones is that we each vote\non the products we think uh are in the\ntop three of those across each category\nand then I tally up all the numbers and\nthey will get um assigned a different\npoint value and I work out what the\nactual top three list is of um all of\nthe different uh categories that we've\ngot in the awards uh and we also very\nopen to corruption this system Tom just\nturns out\nresults well well you'll see that not\nit's not corrupted this year because\nnone of my shoes are winning or\num and then we also have the audience\naward which is where we gave uh all of\nyou an opportunity to um vote on what\nyou thought was the best running shoe of\n2024 uh now the when we're talking about\nthe awards 2024 we're talking about\nthings that were released in 2024 so\nthere were some people that commented\nand saying um picks of shoes that were\nabout six years old um which i' I've\ndiscounted from this um but uh yeah so\nsome interesting uh Awards to come up so\nlet let's dive in and do the first\ncategory okay so the first one is best\nrunning watch um so Nick do you want to\ntalk us through what how we pick the\nbest running\nwatch ah didn't expect Tom to come with\nme with the\nwatch you can swap it with Mike if you\nwant mik Mike doesn't watch usually yeah\nMike go on mik you do it running watch\nokay well I mean so I think first and\nforemost if you've looked at any of our\nreviews that we've done on the channel\nthere's some very kind of clear areas\nwhat we kind of focus on in terms of\nwhat we would say would stand out for us\nin terms of being a great watch for\nrunning and you kind of look at it from\na kind of design point of view and that\ncan be everything from kind of materials\nin terms of that Comfort um you know\nwhether you're wearing when you're\nrunning and outside of running as well\ntoo then you're kind of looking at the\nfeature sets and it's you know primarily\nit's about performance in terms of\naccuracy but it's also we're looking at\nthere's any kind of innovation in those\nfeatures as well too if you know certain\nbrands are pushing the boundaries in\nterms of what's expected from those\ntypes of features as well and then those\nkind of things that we you know we kind\nof expect and maybe potentially take for\ngranted but things like battery life as\nwell to you know we want something we're\nnot necessarily going to be charging a\nregular basis or if we are having to do\nthat there's something to kind of you\nknow make uh you're not making such a\nbig compromise in terms of getting that\nkind of good level of batch life to keep\nyou tracking your run\num over a week or longer so you know\nwe're looking across uh price ranges\nwe're looking at Value as well too so\nthere's a lot of things that come into\nplay in terms of picking the overall\nones and that's kind of hopefully that's\nhow it'll be represented in our\nchoices very good much better than Nick\nwould have done 100% yeah uh okay so uh\nin this category we've actually this is\ngoing to be a recurring theme in the W\nuh we've actually got two winners uh\nwith this year's best running watch\nthose are the Garmin Phoenix 8 and the\nchoros pace Pro uh so uh who any of you\npick this up Mike probably want to be\nthe one that picked this up uh why have\nwe picked\nthose well I think uh soly the Gin\nphoenix8 was quite a late launch in 2024\nand and the big deal or the big kind of\nheadline story here was that this was\nfundamentally gin kind of bringing its\nepics and Phoenix range and one kind of\nrange ultimately so now with the\nphoenix8 you're getting the option of\nAMOLED or the solar charging display\noption obviously you're getting multiple\nsizes as well here too it's also\noffering the latest in Garing software\nas well so you're going to see changes\nin terms of user interface that's going\nto impact on features like mapping and\nnavigation support you're also looking\nat how that's going to you know bring\nyou know the software together and make\napps and workout tracking feel closer\ntogether now I think first and foremost\nI think we'd all kind of agree from a\ndesign point of view in terms of having\nthat optional AMOLED display in a\nphoenix watch and bringing in those kind\nof epics um kind of um Hardware elements\nI think it's you know first it's a\nreally nice watch to wear you got those\nsize options ultimately it's got those\nkey things you want from a gun what's\nthe best of what it offers in terms of\nsports tracking and it's also trying to\nkind of further bridge that gap between\nbeing a smartwatch and a sports watch as\nwell to so you've got these kind of\nvoice enabled features now crucially I\nthink what we'd say is what you know\nthose features been brought in haven't\nmade a massive compromise in terms of\nbattery life that's always been the kind\nof biggest concern I think ultimately\nwhen you are introducing am displays is\nit going to impact on that battery\nperformance I think what we've seen in\nthe versions that we've tested that that\nbattery life still very much is there\nand you're not making those big\ncompromises so I think the G Phoenix a\nthat you know despite launching later in\nthe year it's definitely been the one\nthat's kind of stood out for us uh in\ntesting and you know the reason why we\npicked it as one um of our favorite\nrunning watches or our best running\nwatch\n2024 and then cars Pace Pro I think you\nknow again we've seen a lot of watches\nlaunch later in 20124 this is a\nmid-range watch corus's first AMOLED\nwatch as well too and I think you know I\nthink it would have been you know it was\nvery competitive I think in terms of\nthat mid-range space now but I think in\nterms of what you're getting from the\nthe coros pace Pro you're really\nbuilding what we've got on the pace\nthree it's obviously not as small and\nkind of dinky as that watch but it's\nkind of upgrading a lot of the features\nthat we saw there you've getting that\nAMOLED display as I said you're getting\nthat kind of very good battery life\nperformance and that kind of core\ntracking performance is very good you\nmaybe not getting the best in terms of\nsmart watch and Sport sports watch\nexperience or running watch experience\nbut I think ultimately there's a good uh\nkind of trade-off in what you're getting\noverall and you know crucially that\nprice what it's more expensive than the\npace 3 I think the price jump and the\nfeatures you're getting in return really\nkind of I think are justifying in terms\nof what you get overall as a running\nwatch wonderful um so uh other other\nwatches that we cover we talked about\nwithin this uh short list included the\nuh Garmin ino3 the sunto race s uh the G\n4Runner and the poll up Vantage\nM3 uh right let's uh go on to the next\none that is best running\nheadphones Kieran do you want to do you\nwant to explain running headphones yeah\nI mean essentially what we look for in\nrunning headphones I think top ofmost\nwe're talking about good quality sound\nthat's good fit so it's got to be fit\nsecure we don't want them dropping out\non the floor when we're running good\nbattery life we want good durability and\nthen we're kind of looking at things\nlike bells and whistles you know if\nyou've got find my buds or you've got\ncustomization of the the sound uh you\nknow some people I think in this team\nwill look ATC active noise cancellation\nand the transparency modes and kind of\nrate those higher among some headphones\nthan others and yeah we're just looking\nat a good sort of all round package that\ncomes in at a price that offers\nvalue okay so there's a there was a very\nclear winner in this category and that\nwas the Jabra Elite 8 active twos um why\nwhy did we pick that one I haven't\ntested it so I don't I don't know why we\npick this one so we've we've tested them\nbut I don't think we've put a review up\nbut\nwe the same as last year's yeah they\nthey I mean they are they offer the same\nkind of fully well-rounded package as we\ngot last year and that's you know they\nwon the award last year for a very good\nreason they've got you know for me\npersonally they've got great fit\nsecurity they stay in really tight\nthey're really comfortable to wear\nthere's a good competitive battery life\nas well in them you're getting kind\naround 14 hours I think without ANC that\ndrops to eight hours withc it's an extra\n32 in the case so the overall kind of\npackage of battery life there is really\nsolid there's I think the app experience\nand the features and the customization\nis up there with any headphones you can\nget so there's just lots of tools to\nchange the uh sound profiles personalize\nthe sound profiles to sort of tweak and\nstore your own sort of sound profile\nsettings uh the sound quality it's nice\nand balanced you know you get kind a\ngood Rich sound for me packs a lot of\nbig kind of big punch it's got that kind\nof top volume loudness that you look for\nin a good set of you know motivational\nrunning headphones uh the durability is\ngood of the buds and the case as well\nyou get durability in the case which\nmeans it's super portable if you want to\ntake it out on runs you don't have to\nworry about that case getting damaged\nmost of the buds in this category tend\nto be uh sort of rated for waterproofing\nbut the cases are often not and this is\none area where it stands apart uh I\nthink what else have I missed I mean\nyeah I think just basically the all\nround package of the Jabra Elite 8\nactive 2 a really good good the one\nthing I will say actually though is that\nthe price has jumped up a bit and you\nknow that some improvements in the\nactive noise cancellation and the\ntransparency modes there's some\nimprovements with this generation factor\nin the kind of there's extra mics for\ncall Quality all those kind of things I\nthink if you're not too bothered about\nthose things actually last year's award\nwinners would still be recommended on a\ndeal but those we feel those things have\nimproved enough to make the second\ngeneration the War winners this year as\nwell okay um they are was in deals as\nwell so that is one thing with Jabra and\nwe're still saying this cuz Jabra are\nlikely to discontinue their consumer\nheadphones right but it does seem like\nthey're going to be supported so I don't\nthink we have to worry too much about\nbuying them I think that's fair to say\nyeah okay and the runner up for best\nrning headphones was the Apple airpods 4\num which I never tried\nso why why did that why did that get the\nrunner up I'm already pleas has got\nthese are like my favorites I didn't\nknow you guys like them as much as me I\nthink it's just Nick\nthey just fit my ears so well I don't\nget on within ear headphones very rarely\nthe jabas do fit my ears actually but\nyeah the airpods for just fit my ear so\nI love having a partially open headphone\nbecause it means you can hear your\nsurroundings quite well they sound\nreally good for a partially open design\nthey have know surprisingly useful ANC\nfor a partially open design so I use\nthem when I'm traveling they're the only\nheadphones I really use now uh for\neverything and yeah I really like just\nthe fit and everything so I'm very\npleased they've ended up getting Runners\nup but someone else was have voted for\nthem it can't just to be me I mean I've\ngot them in I have got them\nin um they so the other ones that uh\nappeared in that list with the shocks\nopen Fit air the shocks open SPM Pro uh\nBose Ultra open what they called Ultra\nopen earbuds earbuds very good and the\nstto\nSonic okay so the next category is uh we\ndon't call it best because we uh it's\nfavorite Trail uh and the reason we call\nit favorite Trail shoe is just there's\ntoo many trail shoes um for us to cover\nwe don't test them in the same way as we\ntest running shoes uh Road running shoes\nso we call it favorite um trail shoes\nbecause we don't feel like we can call\nthem the best uh so this one is uh\nanother interesting one uh who who wants\nto pick up trail shoes yeah I mean I'm\nhappy for us in this category a trail\nshoe I think fundamentally it has to the\nkind of trails that we're running on\nhere when we're testing are often\nslightly Tamer you know if you're out in\nthe kind of mountains of Colorado or in\nthe you know the French Alps it's going\nto be a very different experience you\nmight want something that's slightly\ndifferent to this and this is why we've\ngot favorite and I think we're looking\nfor a shoe that can cover 80% of your\ntrail run so we're looking probably at\nslightly slower Paces rather than the\nsort of fastest top end kind of\nlightweight speed trail shoes we want\nsomething that's going to deliver really\ngood reliable grip going to be good and\ncomfortable over the Long Haul uh it's\ngoing to be nice and durable you know uh\ngood good price um yeah I think just\nthose kind of things we're always on\nkind of rollable kind of rollable we're\nalways on kind of running\nno runnable is the word I'm looking for\nwe're always on kind of runnable trails\nyou know Rolling Hills rather\nrolling so that's we're looking for\nshoes that can kind of tackle that and\nlight off-road running\nso there you go okay um so on this list\num hold on I'm just wrong right uh so on\nthis list we had uh a pretty pretty\nclear winner and that was the Hawker\nspeed goat 6 um why is\nthat lovely shoe we've used this on\nquite a range of terrains I think I took\nthis out to gr canara I've used it on\nsome soft stuff as well um it's just an\neasy shoe to recommend and a shoe I\nwould that would be the trail shoe I\nwould buy it does everything I need it\nto do it's pretty lightweight it's\ncomfortable it's reliable grip it's got\na pretty supportive upper it's just it\nwill do the job in all conditions I feel\npretty good about it like I remember\njust running down a hill in Gran can\narea and it like quite a steep hill and\nI don't go downhills very well it's not\nreally my thing and I just thought yeah\nthis shoe is just going to catch me\nbasically it's very reliable it's going\nto grip well and I think you can do you\ncan do pretty much everything in this\nshoe it's very burst the only thing I\nhave really against it is it's quite\nsimilar to the previous model and that\nmight be available in a deal but I just\nhave never disliked a run or found that\nthe speed goat doesn't grip for me or is\nuncomfortable it just it always seems to\ndo everything really well very good\nglowing review um and the runner up was\nanother Hokah shoe it was the tecton X3\num and which which I imagine is for\nquite similar reasons it's a wild shoe\nthough that that was that's just a\nthat's a really bound I mean that's I\nthink one of the first troll shoes to me\nthat really felt pretty wild and crazy\nand bouncy a bit like the Adidas did\nlast year but yeah I took this for a\nlong run in Scotland and it protects the\nlegs I think so that was a big thing I\nnoticed about for me like I felt so good\nthe next day compared to what I normally\nfeel when I I think about 1,700 meters\nof climbing and descending in that run\nand that's just not what I do so\nnormally I'd be in tatters for a week\nand I felt fine it's so protective it's\nbit wild though right Kieran you knows\nas wild yeah I mean I I think this is a\nreally great shoe for attackable kind of\nracing Trails so I often do a race\ncalled The New Forest Marathon which is\na big mix of um road to Trail but all of\nit's it's pretty flat it's you know you\ncan really go at it on this particular\nrace and it fits that bill really nicely\nfor me if I get to anything too steep I\nfind it a little bit too energetic you\nknow more skilled Runners can probably\ncope with it better but that's you know\nif you've got a a piece of trail that\nyou're going to go and run that you know\nyou can run all out then I think this\nshoe works really well and in my head\nI've got the kind of thing where you\nmight be thinking do I run with a road\nshoe or do I run with a trail shoe those\nones that if it's you know if it's dry\nand hard you can get away with the road\nshoe this shoe will excel on that\ntrail and yet it's also got that\nmountain pedigree I think like like I\nsay if you're a skilled Runner I think\nyou can do a bit of everything in this I\nthink actually this I believe from what\nI understand about it the hoker tekan 3\nthe one that's the consumer Edition is a\nbit Tamer than the one the Prototype\nthat has been used to win UTMB I think\nthey they made it less soft right so\nit's probably yeah I think this I think\nthe formation of the speed of the carbon\nplay is slightly slightly more\naggressive I think and they've kind of\nrign that in a little bit to make this\none a little bit more accessible for\neveryone else so it's not well it is\nprobably targeted as you guys have kind\nof said more kind of kind of skilled and\nkind of more more challenging Trails I\nthink it probably is going to make it\nthis design is going to make it more\naccessible to more Trail Runners I\nthink nice okay uh and other um picks\nthat were in our short list were the aex\nmeta Fuji Trail which is something that\na few of us have been testing aex truko\nMax 3 uh sokon zodos Exodus Ultra 3\nzus zus mer agility and the Adidas terx\nagravic speed you know what's glaring in\nthis submission and I want to I want to\nshout stop the steel at this point he\ngot his own category okay the meore\nflight award Mar more flight award for\nbeing the best maram more Flight of the\nYear okay yeah yeah\nyeah okay uh so the next award uh Nick\nyou can do this one because you uh seem\nto enjoy explaining the difference\nbetween these this this in this category\nmore than anyone is the best all rounder\nSL daily trainer well we didn't explain\ndifference did we we had a long fight\nabout it if I was um but what do we say\nin the end it was like we did want a we\nwanted a vend diagram we were all R was\nif you had one shoe that could do\neverything D was a you know your\ntraining an allrounder is a is a is a\ndaily trainer but a daily trainer is not\nnecessarily an allrounder yes is that\nwhat we said yeah anyway we did actually\ndid a video on the best all rounders\nrecently and all of our Windows popped\noff in this basically yeah it's a shoe\nyou can do everything in it works both\nas a standalone shoe like a rotation\nkiller a shoe that you can do every\nrunning it's fast enough for Speed\nsessions and racing even but it's\ncomfortable enough for easy runs it's\ngreat for cruising around in great for\nlong runs um or you can have it in a\nrotation as just a really versatile shoe\nyour daily trainer essentially where you\nmight then surround it with an even\nfaster pure racing option and then have\na more cushioned pure easy option with\nit but the idea is it's a shoe that you\ncan think about your running plan and go\noh I wouldn't mind doing any of those\nruns in this shoe or I'd love to do any\nof those runs in this shoe so lots of\noptions these days in this category\nevery brand now has them there's more of\na divide now so you either go for a\nplated trainer in this category lots of\nThe opest Rounders are plated shoes now\nwhether they have a nylon plate or a\nmore flexible carbon plate than you get\nin a full racing shoe or you have a\nreally lightweight bouncy unplated shoe\nthat you know still can do speed because\nit is unplated but is also still\ncomfortable because every shoe these\ndays has a pretty high stack of foam and\nit's quite comfortable because Foams are\nso lightweight and that means you can\nget really versatile shoes that can do a\nbit of everything without having a plate\nso yeah there's this category is now\nLaden with great options and it's one of\nmy favorite categories for sure yeah is\nis definitely one of the most well there\nwas a lot of options in this in this in\nthis category um and the top the top two\nare joint first um joint winners for\nthis category and probably will not\nsurprise you uh one of them was the\nsakon Endorphin speed 4 the other was\nthe asex Super Blast 2 um Nick please\ncontinue with why we pick those well\nthese actually wer my choices so I'll\nhand over I I can assign them though\nbecause I think Kieran I assume picked\nthe sock the Endorphin speed\nfor put that one first and I had the\nsuper blast second yeah I mean the speed\nthe speed four and I I basically\nseparate these out the speed four for me\nis it has a few characteristics that\nsort of make a start different it's it's\nkind of really light it's really precise\nthere's a lot of agility in the shoe\nit's probably I think slightly kind of\nmore direct than the super Blast 2 which\nI quite like if it's got now when you\nlook at it in comparison it's got I\nthink a bit more of a traditional ride\nbut it's really Lively it's really light\nit's really energetic it when you want\nto go slow if you like that kind of ride\nthat's a bit more kind of ground feel\nit's comfortable enough to tackle the\neasy miles but then when you actually\nyou know it comes to life when you kick\nup the pace and that's when the foam\nkicks in and the nylon plate sort of\nstart to do the work and you can\nactually take this shoe I think through\nthe whole gamut of Paces I can do pretty\nmuch any training run in this I also\njust just think it's got really nice\nsort of Disappearing feel on the foot\nit's one of those shoes that no matter\nwhat I'm doing in a training session it\nwill just disappear on the foot and let\nme get on with business and I think\nthat's it has a it cuts a slightly\ndifferent path now than something like a\na super blast 2 which I also like but I\njust like it because it's just got a\nlittle bit more of that kind of nimble\nagility to it I think it's definitely\nnow the lowest act really of these even\nthe plated ones especially under the 4\nfoot you know it's and that can lead to\nit being a little bit less comfortable\nunder the four I think on harder long\nruns than some of the other options like\nthe max2 the super blast which are now\nso built up there but it does give it a\nreally Nimble feel if you're going to go\nand do like short intervals or something\nlike that which yeah does expand its\nversatility and it's really cushy at the\nhill for such a fast and lightweight\nshoe like as as a heel strike if I'm\nmooching around that's where the\nsoftness I think is really clear in it\neven with that plate in there the other\nthing is it's very\navailable very\navailable oh God yeah God here we go so\nwant to talk about the super to you talk\nabout Blast tom was saying the other day\nif you can't get a super blast you're an\nidiot I did not say that please don't\ncomment on that I actually said we\nshould probably start featuring it\nbecause everyone keeps complaining about\nthe they can't Tom you had two pairs of\nsu blast haven't you no uh no not Su\nblast I've got any pairs of superlast 2\nMike had two and he two that's why\nthere's none available Mike keeps\nstealing\nthem a kitchen feature out of them\nuh just cut some up or reading comments\nit was probably not a surprise that the\nSu Blast 2 was going to crop up in this\num we have all very much enjoyed testing\nsuperlast 2 and many of us enjoy testing\nsuperlast one um and the reason why it's\nso popular is it I I think it's because\nit it really delivers a certain type of\nallrounder star running really really\nwell I use it as a uh longer session\nTempo training shoe if I'm doing\nmarathons it becomes it's it's probably\nmy favorite shoe for hitting those\ndistances and times where I need to\nmaintain a really consistent Pace it's\nnot necessarily the best interval shoe\nin the world it's not necessarily the\nbest easy day shoe but it really hits\nthat bit in the middle really really\nnicely uh it doesn't have a particularly\nsoft mid sole it's got a lot of ACC\ncushioning in it but it's still a\nresponsive a little bit of firm than\nsome people might might expect from a\nshoe that's got that level of cushioning\nin it um but it has a lovely turnover\nit's just very very quick off the quick\noff the mark and um yeah I think that's\nabout it really what have I missed hard\nto get hold of hard to get hold yeah\nwell I did say that hopefully aex will\nproduce more of these in time yeah I\ngoing on I just I mean yeah yeah there's\nloads of colors being like leaked and\nstuff why aren't they coming out I don't\nknow I don't know well really like all\nteal one I think now that's going to be\na thrill yes it will be for\nyou so uh so there're the two topics uh\nother there was a lot in this category\nuh we actually probably one of these\ncategories of different choices that was\nin there so got the Muno Neo Vista Haw\nma X2 Haw Max 6 New Balance ballos s six\nno blast five uh New Balance Rebel V4\nand Brooks Hyperion Max 2 so pretty big\ncategory of choic lot of shoes lot of\nshoes we're just going to show you how\nbig that category is now and how many\ngood shoes there are in\nit okay so best cushion shoe I probably\nI'll explain this one so cushion shoe\ncushion shoe is really tricky category\nthese days because pretty much every\nshoe you could class in some way as a\ncushion shoe it's not like you know the\nlate 90s early 2000s where you bought a\nCushing shoe because you wanted a\ncushion shoe and all the other shoes had\nslightly smaller sack Heights most shoes\nnow will have a relatively large uh\nstack of cushioning in it the the\ncushioning that we how we classify a\ncushion shoe is normally a shoe that's\nnot specifically designed for like race\nday and faster training it's a shoe\nreally designed for click ticking off\nthe miles more more about comfort and\neasy runs maybe a bit more longer runs\nbut they're really shoes that are\nfocused on comfort and cushioning as\nopposed to you know the super blast\nwhich is a pretty Max cushion shoe but\nwe wouldn't put that necessarily in um\ncushion shoes I know Kieran would\nbecause he\ndid um but I think K cushion shoe picks\nover the years man in general when we\nsay cushion shoes we're really talking\nabout that that end of the spectrum\nwhere it's about comfort and enjoying\nthe run and not necessarily going at a\nfast pace I think that's fair to say\nisn't it BL 2 is great for that\nthough let's not do this again I got the\nblame last time you got be the\ninstigator the winner refer back to the\nprevious video if you want to hear us\narguing about that um so this another\ncategory that was massive there's so\nmany shoes in this category now with\nmany many Brands releasing their Max\nversion of quite a lot of um their their\nrange so the top two picks in it well\nthe the the joint winners in this were\nthe Brooks um glycerin Max and sakon\nhurricane\n24 um so these are two uh quite\ndifferent shoes actually so you got the\nBrooks M glycerin Max that which came\nout fair Fairly recently um and that\nshoe is\nobviously new development of the book\nglycerin Ryme but it's it's actually\nquite a different shoe there's quite a\nbig stack of cushioning in there um but\nBrooks is very much always focused on\ntheir shoes having good level of\nstability in them so it's quite a nice\nstable Max cu shoe it's got a relatively\nsoft midsole in it but you still feel\nlike you got a nice firm hold on the\nground and it's not wobbly or anything\nlike that um and it's actually as a\nresult it's a relatively balanced Max\ncushion shoe I think you can you can\nit's not a fast shoe but it's definitely\na shoe that you feel is more sitting in\nthat sort of daily realm necessarily\nthan than a really slow easy day shoe\nthat you can often find um is that right\nthat's right one problem with it though\nyou wouldn't get married in that\nshoe no I tell tell you what shoe you\nwould get mared the S hurricane\nhurricane 24 only one man can talk about\nthis shoe yeah go go on Mike go on talk\nabout your your wedding shoe uh shoe for\nweddings next category coming up um I\nthink I think for all I think I probably\nspeak for all of us I think this has\nbeen a bit of a surprise shoe for us I\nthink um you know for for me the\nhurricane I would I think the first you\nknow this is a kind of M stability Sho\nthat's kind of it's Focus none of us\nhere are kind ofab\nor use kind you know strictly stability\nFocus Shoes but I think in terms of what\nyou're getting here in the hurricane\nit's just a very comfortable shoe first\nand foremost from upper to midsole I\nthink that's that's the thing that\nreally strikes me and for the types of\nruns that you're ultimately going to be\nusing it for it is a shoe built for easy\nruns and that is absolutely where it\nexcels it it generally just feels very\ncomfortable you can roll through very\nnicely I think you've got those\nstability elements there but they're not\nkind of I don't think you know it\ndoesn't make a stability um kind of run\na kind of shoe I think anyone can kind\nof get on with the shoe and I think\nthat's fundamentally what I think we've\nall kind of found that it's you know in\nterms of what it sits and what it Del\nyou know promises to deliver that's\nultimately you get and it definitely has\nbeen a surprise shoe for me one that I\ndidn't think you know we we kind of\nprobably be talking about in this\nAwards yeah 100% I almost like I was\ntesting it but I haven't tested PR\nmodels of the line not a stability\nRunner and this is yeah probably my\nfavorite cushion shoe for a long time it\njust doesn't feel like the kind of shoe\nyou would get along with but yeah like\nyou say just ticks over so nicely ly is\nsoft but doesn't get Squishy and you\nknow bog you down it's yeah it's kind of\nthe shoe we I think some of us thought\nthe Triumph 22 might be with this power\non PB foam in it it's a really great\nshoe okay uh shortlisted entries in this\ncategory there's quite a few of these\nand they're quite varied as well so\nyou've got the New Balance more V5 think\nyou can guess where that came from that\nvote came from the hoker skywood X uh\nthe New Balance 108 v14 the ax super L 2\nthanks Kieran the HW skyflow H skylow\nand the on cloud Monster hyper so a big\nrange of shoes there in cushioned\nshoes two more Awards left Nick I'm\ngoing to let you do this one because um\nthis is your favorite category more\nflight time best best more flight\ncolorway 2024 we're doing best raceu\nyeah uh go on explain what makes a good\nrace you going to be fast that's what\nit's that's always it's going to be it's\nthe simplest one no ven diagrams here\nit's a shoe designed to be fast and\ndeliver on race day it's not necessarily\ngoing to be stable it might be stable\nbut it's all about running fast that for\nthat these days you need a high stack of\na very lightweight and soft and bouncy\nfoam with a carbon plate in there Trend\nthis year has definitely been to seen\nsome shoes move a lot lighter than we\nhad in the past and that's I think a\nreally welcome trend for me because\nyou're still getting these huge High\nstack shoes but they are now more\nlightweight and still delivering all\nthat protection that you've come to\nexpect from a race shoe and yeah they're\ngreat for every distance you you know\nyou might have a bit of a difference\nbetween your 5K shoe and your Marathon\nshoe but really I don't think there is\nthat difference so much anymore there's\njust a load of really really good shoes\nand every brand pretty much now maybe\nwith the exception of Brooks has\ndelivered a top class racing shoe that\ncan really compete at the top level and\nfor now I think a lot of this now comes\ndown to personal preference I think we\nactually all have quite a similar\npreference which suggests that shoe\nactually maybe is still a bit A Cut\nAbove but overall if you find a shoe\nfrom the brand you like and it's comb\nrate racing shoe you're probably going\nto get a pretty good shoe these days\nokay so the uh the winner for this\ncategory was by far in the way the the\nthe the the winner it was the got a lot\nmore um votes than anything else and\nthat is the aex Met speed Sky Paris uh\nwhy why do we love that Sho so much PBS\nPBS we love it that's right Kieran and I\ngot Marathon PBS kieran's got at least\none other PB in it I've got a half\nmarathon PB in it and just works it's\nthe full package like I say it's it's\nunder 200 gam in my size it is a full\nstack shoe it is comfortable over any\ndistance I've run London marathon in it\ndid my half marathon PB in it recently\nand it's just great it's just really\ngreat Tom I don't know what to say like\nuh it's also been a bit more durable\nthan I expected I'm about 250k into my\npair and it still feels just as bouncy\neven if the heel is deteriorating a\nlittle bit as you expect from AIC Super\nShoes where they don't cover the heel if\nyou're a heel Striker and that's what I\nmean it's like a fully modern Su shoe in\nthat you're getting that protection\nyou're getting that bounce you're\ngetting that propulsion but it's super\nlight so at the end of a race when you\nstart to feel a bit heavy legged the\nshoe is not adding any weight there it's\njust a bit of everything and yeah it\njust works really well and it's not\noutrageously expensive for a super shoe\nlike with some coming out this year have\njust pushed the price higher and higher\naex actually stuck to their previous\nmodels pricing which is quite a nice\nlittle\nchange excellent now the and the runner\nup for this category well is a I'm\nreally pleased that this shoes the\nrunner up uh because I've been banging\non about how good it is and and Mike has\nas well it's the Puma DV8 Nitro Elite 3\num which it's that that that shoe line\num I\nwe've all said it in the past that that\nthey're good the pum DV8 Nitro Elites\nand and the two but they're not quite up\nthere with some of the top tier comp\nplate Racers now the the new uh Elite 3\nreally is it's such a fantastic shoe you\nget a lot of Bounce out of it it feels\nreally really fast I used it for\nManchester half might Ed it for\nManchester half as well and I think we\nboth agreed that it was just a really\nreally good shoe so it's nice to see\npummer really getting getting to grits\nwith the the I think it's down to the\nfoam really in that shoe and it really\nmakes it a big difference in that um\nother sorry and they bumped up the stack\nbut made it lighter so again yeah yeah\nyou getting you're getting everything\nyou're not picking between weight and\nbounce or anything these days it's just\nyou just get everything it's great and\nit's under 200 and it's under 200 yeah\nso I've I've got a trick tricky Choice\nahead of me for Val Valencia because\nthat's I've got like three shoes to pick\npick now uh and the first the first of\nthe runner up both in there and the\nother one is the hogao X1 uh which is\none of our shortlisted pick so as well\nas hedo X1 cell X1 yeah cell C there was\nthere also the Nike Ally 3 the Adidas\nadios Pro 4 although to be honest I\ndon't think that's entirely Fair because\nwe haven't all tested that so that might\nhave got higher if we' all tested it and\nthe on cloud wi strike LS which again uh\nmight have been higher if we'd all\ntested it but um there they were the\nshort list for best race Sho first year\nneither the winner or the runner up is a\nNike\nshoe I mean the VAP 3 wasn't in\ncontention but I think wouldn't have\nbeen top to anyway you know\nyeah okay so the final award that we\npicked is the brand of the year um who's\nnot done Mike you you've only done one\nof these want to explain why we picked\nbrand of the year I think this is a\npretty self-explanatory one but I think\nthis is probably going to be the brand\nthat has has ultimately I think in terms\nof launches I would say probably in\nterms of innovation and I would say in\nterms of particular talking in terms of\nshoes you know you know evolving and\nenhancing existing lines and making them\nyou know better shoes as well so I think\nthere's a lot that can kind of\ncontribute to what you know we would\nconsider you know Brand's having a good\nyear in 2024 and there's definitely been\nyou know I I think we' all kind of agree\nthere's been a couple of brands that\nhave have really kind of stood out for\nus in that space that's kind of\nrepresented in who we've picked as our\nwinners yes um and the winner for the\nbest Brown\nthe brand of the Year 2024 is hoker this\nyear uh why have we gone for\nhoker I mean I think for me I could I\nthink from the beginning of the year to\nthe end of the year the the the launches\nhave been consistent in terms of you\nknow back you know back from kind of the\ncello to the Skyward we've had existing\nlines like the Max 6 new shoes like the\nsky flow so there's been I think\nultimately for me I think Hawker is\nbrought new lines brought new innovation\nbrought really very fun and you know\nshoes fundamentally from a performance\npoint of view really kind of deliver uh\nand I think you know a mix in terms of\nthose launches in terms of improving ex\nexisting lines uh and just having very\ngood sh you know very good shoe launch\nuh year I think that's for me that's\nkind of how I see it yeah after Banger\nhasn't it they've certainly had a lot of\nshoes people are talking about this year\nI mean previously we talk about like the\nH 5 and things but then then it was a\nbit of a big spag because we weren't\nmassive fans of the the macx but this\nyear it seems like every release you\nguys are talking about constantly\nbecause I'm not tested that many of them\nbut I've just been testing this the tx1\nand I'm really enjoying that\nsh okay and the uh runner up in this\ncategory was aex um uh which you know\nthey've done some fantastic uh they've\nhad some fantastic releases this year\nwhich um what she what the been the big\nshoes from mics this year super last I\nmean the best honestly they just\nreleased loads of great shoes I mean\nthey met P guy Paris as I racing pick\nsuper blast a top all rounder NOA blast\n5 really started liking that and it's\nit's less it's it's less of a surprise\nsome of the cuz a lot of them were\ncontinuations of shoes that were already\ngreat so I guess maybe that's why H had\na bit more yeah I suppose in this\ncategory you do sort of need to see a\nbit of change don't you as well like\nwhat what brands are really up and\nreally making big big differences in in\nwhat in what they're developing whereas\naex has been quite consistent you've got\nthings like the jel keano range which is\nuh really solid but they had you know\nJoo 30 last year was fantastic as well\nso um but great year for for aex um and\nthen other brands that popped up in this\ncategory were sunto New Balance and\nsocony so the final award is the uh the\nbig one the audience shoe of the year\nnow this is we basically open up the um\nthis category to all of the audience on\num YouTube on Instagram and ask for\ntheir top shoe of the year and we get\nquite a lot of people voting at this\nit's like 300 people comment on on this\npost and we get a lot of stuff so I sit\nand go through all of them and tally\nthem all up and work out what is the\nmost the biggest shoe uh and I don't\nthink you're going to be surprised and\nyou you well you won't because you can\nsaw some of the comments pop up as they\ncame in but uh super Blast 2 was the\nresounding winner on this one and by a\nlong way people absolutely love that\nshoe uh and there's a lot of comments of\npeople saying they can't get that shoe\nin everyone who got it may to vote for\nit yeah exactly yeah so that's that's a\ngood sign um so so well done for that\none um and then the uh runner up in this\ncategory was the fuel cell Rebel V4\nwhich is quite a nice surprise because\nthat's a shoe that we haven't mentioned\nyet in this video um well very Loosely\nrened but um that's a really good shoe\nthat um it's good to see getting some\nattention for this year um there were a\nlot of shoes as You' guess from about\n300 um go through them Tom I'm not going\nto I'm not through all of them through\nall the comments but I mean most of them\nare the ones that we've mentioned\nalready in this video so um yeah w a\nwide range but um asex super 2 gets it\nthis year right so great year for the\nawards some excellent shoes some\nexcellent products all around uh Kieran\nhas disappeared because he's so happy\nthat the aex super Blast 2 won the\naudience\naward easy running it he's gone for an\neasy run in it and then I think he's\ngoing to go some champagne to celebrate\num so that's it for on the awards thanks\na lot for watching or listening to this\nif you're listening to the podcast\nversion of it and um we'll be back very\nsoon with another review video probably\non the channel Mak sense yeah catch you\nguys later

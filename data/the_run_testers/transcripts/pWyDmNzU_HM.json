  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name is\nNick and this is our full review of the\nNike Pegasus\n[Music]\npremium so Pegasus premium is an all new\nshoe for Nike that's going to sit at the\ntop of the Pegasus line above the\nPegasus 41 and the Pegasus plus this is\npart of Nike's restructuring of its\nrange of shoes into kind of three main\nsilos which is the Pegasus line which is\nresponsive daily trainers the Vero line\nwhich is a more cushioned comfortable\nshoes it's going to include the next\ngeneration of the Invincible and then\nthe structure line which is stability\nshoes the Pegasus premium is coming in\nto sit at the top of the Pegasus line\nlike I say it's coming out at the end of\nJanuary next year and it's the most\nexpensive shoe in the Pegasus range at\n\u00a3185 or $210 it's also the highest stack\nshoe I think I've ever seen from Nike\nstanding 45 mm tall at the hill and 35\nat the 4T for a 10 mm drop it's pretty\nhefty it's 328 G or 11.6 oz in my UK\nsize 9 which is a US size 10 so you've\ngot engineered mesh upper Fair bit of\npadding around the back of the shoe\nthere and a pretty significant internal\nheel counter to add some support around\nthere quite a fluffy tongue as well\nalmost like a kind of duvet style\nmaterial here Nike certainly not made a\nbig effort to reduce weight on the upper\nit's fair to say then you've got a three\nlayer mid soole which is you know the\nreally interesting part of this shoe\nyou've got top layer that is zoomx foam\nthat's the bouncy peber based foam you\nsee in shoes like the Zoom 6 and the\nNike Racing shoes and indeed the\nInvincible then you have an Air Zoom\nunit running the length of the shoe now\nwe've seen Air Zoom pods in quite a few\nNike shoes like you can see them in the\nalphafly also been embedded into the\nmidsole of shoes like the Pegasus but\nnever seen a full length unit like this\nin a running shoe to provide a kind of\nresponsive ride along the length of the\nshoe and then at the back of the shoe\nthat kind of running to the midfoot you\nhave a bottom layer of react ex foam\nwhich is a pretty balanced foam it's\nfairly durable fairly soft it's nothing\nspecial it's not as you know exciting as\nthe foam's above it but is there\nprobably to add a bit more stability and\ndurability to the Pegasus premium then\nyou got a waffle tread outsole which is\nmostly covered actually is good rubber\ncoverage on the four and heel there you\ncan see the bottom of the Air Zoom pod a\nlittle bit of exposed react X foam there\nbut nothing too much and the sho's\nactually been pretty good for me on grip\nand durability so\n[Music]\nfar so it comes to the fit of the Nike\nPegasus premium I've got my normal size\nhere which is a uk9 US 10 that's a size\nI've been using in Nike shoes for many\nyears and all the other Pegasus shoes\nI've tested and it fits me very well in\nthat size I've got enough room in the\ntoe box good hold around the heel and\nmidfoot it's pretty comfortable shoe\nwith the amount of padding you have at\nthe midfoot and back of the shoe there\nso yeah no concerns at all about the fit\nI would stick to your normal running\nshoe size and if you've ever used a\npegasus shoe I would use that size in\nthe Pegasus\n[Music]\npremium onto the run test then and I've\nrun about 50k in the Nike Pegasus\npremium using it for a mix of daily\ntraining mostly pretty relaxed runs\nfairly long runs and then a easy to\nsteady progression run as well to test\nit out with some faster Paces it's a\npretty interesting shoe it's fair to say\nlike I've tested all of the Pegasus\nshoes released this year and where the\nPegasus plus feels like a pretty natural\nstep up from the standard Pegasus 41\nwith a pretty similar design all around\njust with a better foam this feels like\nsomething completely different it's very\nmuch a shoe that I think is Nike's first\nattempt to really compete in the max\nstack daily trainer category you know\ngot things like the Brooks Glycerin Max\ncame out this year the Puma mag Max the\nhoker skywood X came out I think at the\nstart of this year maybe even the back\nend of last year these are really big\nshoes lots of foam underfoot but they're\nnot really designed to be very fast\nshoes or anything like that they're\ndesigned to give you a lot of comfort\nand a fun bouncy ride for your daily\ntraining and the rid is bouncy it's the\nbouncy as Pegasus I can say that for\nsure you do get a lot of energy return\nfrom the combination of Foams in this\nmidsole I think the Air Zoom unit is the\ndominant thing that I feel on the run it\ngives a slightly firmer Edge to it than\nyou get from something just like zoomx\nfoam alone it does give you a lot of\nresponse especially under the foref foot\nthat's really notable for me compared to\nthe other Pegasus shoes and I've kind of\nrunning them at the same time and that\nkind of thing you do get a lot more lift\nand bounce off this forfeit in the\nPegasus premium because there is such a\nhigh stack there for a Nike shoe you\nknow in general Nike often does these\nkind 10 mm drop shoes and that means the\nfor foot often sits a bit lower to the\nground compared to other brands just\nbecause of the way you know a 10 mm drop\nwould work unless you have a very high\nheel stack which you do have on the\nPegasus premium which means you still\nhave a lot of foam under the forefoot of\nthe shoe that does give you a really\nbouncy feeling you know a very energetic\nfeeling there however all those Foams in\nthe midsole does make this a heavy shoe\nand you do feel the weight on the run\nlike if you're going to try and run at\nany kind of speed you're going try and\ncharge up a hill or anything like that\nit does drag a bit because it is a big\nshoe and it is a heavy shoe as a result\nthe pxas premium doesn't really feel\nlike a very versatile shoot for me it's\none that just makes cruising along at\neasy Paces you know feel quite fun\nbecause it is bouncy and everything like\nthat and you do get an enjoyable ride\nbut it's not one that you then really\nwant to lift the pace in I was doing\nthat easy to steady progression run in\ntoday like you can run in it at speed\nyou are getting a lot of bounce back but\nthe tradeoff you know bounce to weight\njust isn't quite tuned to my preferences\nanyway like Nike's done this quite a lot\nin the past actually it often feels to\nme that they put everything into\ncreating a bounce issue some like the\nalphafly 2 for example like it was a\npretty heavy Super Shoe but put a lot of\nBounce in there and the trade-off I\nthink was almost balanced there I think\nI did enjoy the outfly 2 as a racing\nshoe but here it just feels like there's\na bit too much weight for even all these\nbouncing materials in the mids cell to\nmake up for so it does work as a cruiser\nfor kind of relaxed daily runs but\nthere's a lot of tech and Foams and\nstuff going into that to create a shoes\nthrough that when there's a lot of those\naround really and then beyond that I\nthink the bigger problem in the way is\nprobably the instability in the shoe so\nyou've got a really narrow pinch point\nat the mid foot of the shoe and when you\nlook at these Max stack shoes that are\nbuilt for daily training things like the\nHocus skyex you know the glycerin Max\nthey have really wide bases even\nsomething like the super Blast 2 has a\nmuch wider base than the Nike Pegasus\npremium and that's done to create a more\nstable ride when you've got a really big\nHigh stack of foam here so I do feel\nthat this is an unstable shoe you can\nfeel yourself rolling inwards a bit I'm\na neutral Runner and you know it's fine\nfor me I didn't have any real problems\nwith it on the run but if you do pronate\nat all I would be certainly ster clear\nof this shoe and I was coming back from\na twisted ankle during my testing of the\nshoe and it was one that I just\nbasically didn't want to get back into\nfor a while because lot of cambered\nPavements around me like you know lot of\nbroken Pavements and it's the kind of\nisoe where you can land on the wrong\nspot and it's going to turn you a bit\nmore than other shoes because it does\nhave that narrow pinch point and it just\nfeels like an odd design choice to me\nobviously they did did make it a lot\nwider it would be even heavier and you\nthat's going to be even more of a\nproblem so it's a hard one to do but we\ngot all these Foams in the midsole the\nweights added up you haven't got that\nwide base for extra support and even if\nyou are a neutral Runner like if I'm\ngoing to go and cruise around in a Max\nstack shoe for my easy training as a\nneutral Runner I probably still want the\nwidth there the extra base that extra\nsupport because you know I don't want to\nhave any kind of instability or twist an\nankle or anything like that it just\nfeels like a bit of a worry here\nespecially if you are like me someone\nwho often runs on you just normal\nPavements which often aren't pristine\nand flat you often have to dodge around\npeople and there are like little cers\nand stuff like that so at the same time\nI was testing the shoe I was testing the\nASX over blast 5 for example which is\nalso a pretty high stack shoe comes in a\nlot lighter though and it has a wider\nbase and it was a shoe I was able to run\nin very comfortably as I was coming back\nfrom twisted ankle without really\nworrying about that at all so overall it\nkind of just ends up falling into a roll\nI don't quite understand the Pegasus\npremium it's fair to say like it has got\na bouncy ride now at a very simple level\nit's a pretty fun shoe to run in but\nthen the more you run in it the more\nkind of these little concerns arise and\njust means to shoe that I'm not really\nsure exactly what it would do for me\nbecause I don't really want to go and\nbounce around loads of easy runs in it\nbecause it isn't the most stable shoe\nand it is fairly heavy even for long\nruns at easy Paces I don't really want\nto use it for those faster runs because\nlike I said pretty heavy shoe not the\nmost versatile so yeah it was pretty fun\nto run in but not sure I quite get\n[Music]\nit so my verdict on Nike Pegasus premium\nit's an interesting shoe it was a fun\nshoe to run in nik's had a lot of fun\nputting all this Tech into a shoe and\nit' be interesting to see where this\nTech ends up in other shoes in the\nfuture but unlike the other two Pegasus\nshoes in the range which I think are\nreally good Workhorse daily Trainers for\nthose who like traditional ride with\nthat 10 mm drop they do a really good\njob this feels like a shoe I don't\nreally get like I said in the run test\nI'm not exactly sure we pick it up like\nif you have a lot of money you want to\nbuy a pretty interesting shoe a shoe\nthat's quite fun for certain types of\nruns you can do that job but when you're\nlooking at building an effective running\nshoe rotation it's not one that I'd\nreally better slip in myself some might\nfind the ride just much more enjoyable\nme of course like you know it's a fun\nride I enjoyed it but some might find it\nreally fun and in which case it's worth\nspending the money just to have that\nreally energetic feeling under foot and\nyou know bounce through some daily\ntraining in a really fun way and you get\na pretty cool looking shoe as well this\nwill certainly have some appeal as a\ncrossover shoe bit like the ultra Boost\nfrom mes which is shoe you can wear\naround town enjoy wearing It's a\ngood-looking shoe and then do some\nrunning in because you know it is a good\nrunning shoe like I enjoyed running in\nit it's not just one of those shoes it's\na lifestyle shoe I we get comments like\nthat all the time but no this is a\nrunning shoe and it's a shoe I enjoyed\nrunning in but I think it's a shoe that\nprobably needs to add value in some\nother way to really make it worth\npicking up and if for you that is you\nlove the look you love using it as a\ncasual shoe as well great you've also\ngot a pretty good running shoe here as\nwell you look at the price of the\nPegasus premium though it isn't hard to\nthink of running shoes that I'd\nrecommend getting ahead of it within\nNike's range I mean immediately the\nother two Pegasus shoes like I said I\nhave done some runs wearing the Pegasus\npremium on one foot and then the Pegasus\n41 or Pegasus Plus on the other and they\njust they feel like you know better\nrunning shoes like the Pegasus Plus in\nparticular is lighter got that zumex\nmidso gives you a nice bit of a poppy\nride and while those shoes are certainly\nthinner under the forefoot and feel a\nbit flat under the forefoot compared to\nthe bounce you get from the Pegasus\npremium all around they're a bit more\nenjoyable to run in I think and Pegasus\n41 being a good Workhorse Cruiser\ncushion shoe and the Pegasus plus being\nyou know more versatile shoe all round\nboth a bit more stable as well then Nike\nalso has the zoom fly 6 in its range\nwhich is cheaper and one of my favorite\nshoes of the year you've got a really\ngood combo of materials in there with\nthe zoom X foam there carbon plate in\nthere as well really fun versatile shoe\ngreat for Speed workor great for easy\nruns more stable than the Pegasus\npremium just a lot more fun to run in\nand a bit cheaper so that would be a\nreally good alternative if you are\nlooking for you know a proper super\ntrainer and you don't mind training with\nthe plate and then if you are looking\naround these other Max cushion shoes I\nthink the hoker skyw X and the Brooks\nGlycerin Max are both kind of better\nshoes in this category of maxed out\nshoes with loads of stuff going on in\nthe midell that are just a bit more fun\nto run in for your daily training like\nthey're both a little bit lighter I\nthink the Hocus SC X is a bit more\nbouncy bit more fun they're both more\nstable they both just seem a bit better\nsuited to the type of runs you'd be\nusing them for whereas like I said the\nPegasus premium has that instability\nproblem for a shoe with a high stack\nthat like if you're going to have that\nquite narrow design at the bottom there\nyou want it to be in a shoe that you're\ngoing to use for Speed work because\nyou're less concerned about stability I\nthink if you're going going to go and\npick up a shoe you're going to use for\nsome fast running and I really wouldn't\nuse the Pegasus premium for that myself\njust cuz it's weight and overall design\ndoesn't really lend itself to fast\nrunning for me some other shoes you can\nlook at as well it's obviously the Astic\nsuper Blast 2 which is cheaper than this\nshoe in the US which is you know wild to\nme that's a much lighter much more\nresponsive much more versatile shoe all\naround definitely what I'd pick up ahead\nof the Pegasus premium as a shoe you'd\nbe using for any kind of run really the\nPuma mag Max Nitro I'm not a huge fan of\nmyself I didn't really get on with I\nactually prefer running in the Nike\nPegasus premium but you know again that\ndoes have a wider design that I think\nlends itself better to regular training\nthen there's also the Muno NE Vista if\nyou just looking for a really fun and\nbouncy ride that's got a plate in it\nit's a lot cheaper though but it's again\na lot lighter a lot more fun to run in\nin general also you know very high stack\nheight similar to the Nike new balance\nballos as well now that's a really fun\nshoe like with a big rocker soft foam\nloads of Bounce you know it's quite\nexpensive but this is also very\nexpensive and I think that's a more fun\nshoe to do General daily training runs\nin as well so I did enjoy some runs in\nthe Pegasus premium I did find it pretty\nfun and bouncy shoe and a pretty\ninteresting shoe I think there are a few\nproblems here that make it a hard shoe\nto recommend like I think it is too\nheavy it's not that versatile and I\nthink that has that narrow pinch point\nthat makes it less well suited for kind\nof General cruising especially you have\nany kind of stability concerns I really\nwouldn't be looking at the shoe but even\nif don't I'd rather been a shoe with a\nslightly more stable base myself it's\nnot hard to find those shoes that are\nalso a lot lighter cheaper you know\nequally energetic and all that kind of\nthings there's just too many good shoes\non the market for me to really say this\nis a standout if you love The look\nyou're going to get a pretty decent\nrunning shoe as well if you're going to\nuse it for casual use but overall I'd\nsay the other Pegasus shoes are better\nbuys or indeed the zoomfly 6 though I\nwill be interested to see what happens\nwith all this Tech in the future of Nike\n[Music]\nshoes have review of the Nike Pegasus\npremium let us know what you think in\nthe comments below please do like and\nsubscribe ring the

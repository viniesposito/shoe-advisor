  "text": "hey this is mar the rant testers this is\nthe new Brooks gin 22 a new brook shoe\nthat's actually launching an early 2025\nin the UK and I'll put a precise date\nwhen that is up on screen now for\nglycerin fans there's one pretty big\nchange from the glycerin 21 there's also\nsome smaller changes which we'll get\ninto in this video as well now myself\nand Tom have both had some early running\ntime in the new glycerin what we're\ngoing to do as I said take you through\nthe key differences and what's new from\nthe glycerin 20 1 they get into some\nearly running thoughts and let you know\nwhat we're thinking of the Brooks\nGlycerin 22 so\n[Music]\nfar so let's run you through those key\nBrooks Glycerin 22 details first price\nand Brooks is sticking to the same \u00a3165\nand $165 price as the gliserin 21\nputting it below the new gin Max and\nabove the ghost Max 2 in terms of\npricing Weight Wise a UK size 8 dropped\nin on the GS at 292 G making it heavier\nthan the glycin 21 in the same size\nBrook sticks to a 10 mm drop and these\nsame stack Heights and swaps its DNA\nLoft V3 Cushing technology for its new\ndual siiz cell DNA tuned foam that\ndebited on the glycerin Max that new\nfoam puts larger cells in the hill for\nplush Landings for Hill Strikers and\nsmaller ones in the 4ot for a more\nresponsive feel above that is a new\ndouble Jack on it upper which provides\nprovides plenty of ping throughout\nincluding more around the hill collor\nfor additional support and comfort\nBrooks has added more rubber to the\noutsole with notably more coverage at\nthe 4ot to boost durability and make\nsure the gisen 22 is fit to clock up\nplenty of running\n[Music]\nmileage so the fit for me and the brook\nglycerin 22 I'm a size eight in the UK\nuh this is very similar to the fit that\nyou get in previous versions of the\nglycerin there's plenty of space in the\nfor foot uh plenty of space for the big\ntoe uh the space around the side of the\nfront section of the shoe is pretty good\nso there's a lot of space for your toes\nto move around and the mid midfoot is\npretty average as well so uh it's not\nit's not the widest shoe out there but\nit's definitely a shoe that's designed\nto be a bit more accessible um I've got\nfairly average WID feet and I found it\nto be very very comfortable and had lots\nof space in it as well there's loads of\npadding around the ankle color of the\nshoe it's a very very comfortable shoe\nquite a plush suo to wear um so yeah all\nin all very able good shoe and I didn't\nhave any issues so I definitely stick to\nmy size in this shoe so fit has looked\nsolid for me so far in the Glen 22 I've\ngot it in a UK size 8 the same size I\nhad the glycerin 21 I've gotten the\nstandard width fit option and expect to\nsee alternative you know options if you\nwant something a little bit more roomier\nlike you did on the glist 21 to be\nreplicated on the 2T but for me it's\nfelt very good in terms of that fit very\ngood in terms that space up front of the\ntoe box you know opening up into the\nmidfoot as well you know is still going\nto be a roomy accommodating shoe and\nthat's kind of what I'm seeing so far in\nmy time in the 22 I would say the\nbiggest differences for me is that you\njust getting a slight leveling up in\nthat padding you know there's a bit more\npadding in that tongue to improve things\nin the comfort side of things I think\nit's most noticeable in the hill collar\nparticularly the inside of that Hill\ncollar you're getting a little bit more\npadding in the 22 compared to the 21 and\nVisually you can just see there's a\nlittle bit more going on there around\nthe hill collar to add that you know\nadditional level of support and comfort\nbut for me I think going true to size\nshould be absolutely fine I wouldn't be\nlooking to you know sizing up or down in\nthis shoe and pretty much sticking to\nthe shoe size of the GL 21 I think you\nfor most people it's probably going to\nbe the right way to\n[Music]\ngo so my first run in Brooks F 22 was an\n8 Mile Run and I was averaging 83 minute\nmile Pace in that run dropping it\nslightly less than that but not much\nless definitely kind of utilizing the 22\nin the same way that I would use the 21\nso you know easy runs recovery kind of\nrelaxed runs you know this isn't a shoe\nI'm expecting to run my faster sessions\nin now the first thing I would say from\nthat first run that I really noticed was\nyou know there's a whole lot of shoe\nhere just like the 21 you know this\nisn't the shoe you're going to go and\nforget that it's on you know it is a big\nshoe to kind of running and you know\nyou're reminded about it throughout the\nrun or I was you know definitely that's\nprobably one of my criticisms of the 21\nyou know I would have liked to be a\nlighter shoe for me and it's now got\nheavier and the 22 and you know I think\nyou know for me I slightly disappointed\nto see that has jumped up a little bit\nin weight I can see why it has you know\nthere's more padding there there's a you\na bit more rub on that alol and that's\nobviously contributed to that addition\nin weight that you're getting in the\nglycin 22 I think the other thing here\nis obviously the ride you know you're\ngetting a change in Cushing technology I\nthink I felt for me the ride on the 21\nwas a little bit lackluster for me I\ndon't think I got a really memorable\nexperience from it I think particularly\ngiven what else was happening\nin Brooks's range with it cushion shoes\nI think they were shoes that I had a\nmore memorable experience in I think\nwith the changes here I do think the\nride so far feels a little bit nicer for\nme I think the biggest thing I notice is\nthat there's a slightly higher rebound\ncompared to the 21 I think there's you\nknow there's a little bit more bounce\nit's not know massively elevated it's\nnot massively Lively in a way that I\nthink the glycerin Max you know the\nexperience M Max was but I do think the\nrebound and that higher bounce just\nfeels a little bit more noticeable I\nthink what that does it instantly makes\nthe ride again feel a little bit more\nmemorable than it did on the gon 21 I\nfelt like it could roll through very\nnice in the shoe it still has all those\nqualities of the glycerin shoe it's very\nstable it's very controlled I think you\nknow as I said the qualities of the\nglycerin is still very much there but I\ndo think that bounce is just a little\nbit more pronounced for me you roll\nthrough a little bit nicer still you\nknow very you know kind of smooth\nfashion but yeah there's just a little\nbit more there for me you know is it as\nsoft and plush feeling as the this Max\ndon't think for me it is and I think you\nknow does that mean that the DNA tuned\nhere gives it the same level of\nVersatility I'm not quite sure when I\ndid try to pick the pace up in this I\njust think there's a lot of shoe it's a\nwider shoe as well compared to the Gin\nMax and I think that probably counts\nagainst it being a shoe that you\nprobably want to run a little bit more\nat Tempo and even more moderate Paces so\nI think yeah the qualities of the gliten\nare still there I do think that the ride\nfor me and the change of the midell make\nit a more memorable or definitely made\nit more memorable experienc in that\nfirst run compared to my first run in\nthe glisten\n21 but it is a heavy is shoe there's a\nlittle bit more rubber and the outsole\nyou know which for me was fine it was in\ndry conditions and it was absolutely\nfine you know as I said there's more\nrubber and I think you can get more\ndurability in life out of this shoe\nwhich I think from a GL already going to\nget good life out of it from a gripping\npoint of view it's fine but I'd like to\nsee how it fed in wetter conditions and\nyou know see whether it holds up from\nthat point of view so yeah I would say a\ngood first run in the Gin 22 does feel\nvery similar to the giten 21 but I do\nthink that DNA tuned you know I'm\nintrigued to see how that's going to\nfeel over more running time because I\nthink right now I'm definitely seeing a\nmore memorable ride and experience is it\ngoing to soften up maybe is it going to\nstill have that liveliness over kind of\nmore testing those are things I want to\nfind out whether I can kind of maybe\nforget about that or you know would help\nto forget about the added weight that\nyou're getting on the glycerin 22 which\nis probably the quality that I'm not\nloving most in that first run so my\nfirst run in this shoe was a 15K run at\nquite comfortable pace for me it's two\ndays before Christmas I can't be\nbothered to do any fast intervals or\nanything like that this week uh so I\nwent out and did a 15K at my easy pace\nwhich is about 5 minute kilom and what I\nfound on that run is it's very similar\nto what I've experienced in the previous\nversion of the shoe and quite similar to\nthe earlier versions as well it's uh the\nthis new uh DNA tuned midsole which is\nthe same one you get in the Brooks\nGlycerin Max in the Brooks gin Max\nthere's more of it and it does feel a\nbit softer uh a little bit more uh\nenergy returning um than it does in this\nshoe to me this feels very similar to\nthe previous version of the shoe the\nglycerin 21 um which is essentially a\nvery balanced uh midsole it's it's very\nstable it doesn't feel really soft\nthere's not loads of energy returning it\nbut it does feel very comfortable out on\nthe run but that 15K it felt absolutely\nfine didn't really think about it on the\nfeet um felt very solid no issues at all\nwith it equally it didn't it's not an\namazingly bouncy shoe or amazing soft\nshoe or anything like that it's just a\nvery balanced shoe which a lot of people\ncan can run in and that's really what\nthe glycerin range is always really gone\nfor a slightly more expensive version of\nsomething like the the ghost range where\nit's really trying to tickle those boxes\nyou want a nice Balance shoe that's\ngiving you stability and comfort um but\nit isn't going too far off the rails and\ngiving you loads of softness or loads of\num engy return it's just very much\ndesigned for to to make everyone happy\nand it and it does that very well it's a\nvery comfortable solid reliable shoe uh\nand definitely over that first 15K I\nthink it's much much of the same of what\nyou would experience from this line it's\na shoe that's very much um just designed\nto just tick off the miles I think it'd\nbe a very good shoe if you were doing\neasy runs recovery runs and long runs as\nwell at nice comfortable pace so yeah\nvery much uh found it to be a solid ride\non that first first run that I did\nnothing particularly Spectacular from it\nbut that's not generally what you you\nyou look for in the um in the glycerin\nrange you're looking for that sort of\nreliable um that ride that gives you a\ngood level of comfort um wasn't that wet\nout there today or at least it wasn't\ntoo slippy or anything like that um this\nout soole seems absolutely fine though\nfrom from that first run um there is\nquite a bit of exposed midsole on it I\nhaven't seen any signs from that first\nrun of any sort of wear or tear this\nrubber on the out soole is really thick\nso I think it take a while to wear it\ndown to the point where you start uh\ngetting to that mids sole but the\nmidsole is actually seems relatively\ndurable um it doesn't it doesn't seem\nlike a delicate midso foam so um yeah\nnice outs Soo on it as\n[Music]\nwell to my early verdict on the Brooks\nGlycerin 22 very much what you would\nexpect from the glycerin range solid\nsturdy stable comfortable um and nicely\nbalanced the Midol phone isn't a massive\ndetraction from what you would have\nexperienced in the Brooks glit in 21\nit's may be a tiny bit softer but not\nmassively um and you're getting a very\nvery similar ride so uh it's definitely\na shoe that if you are looking for s a\nshoe that just gives you a good level of\num everything really a bit of cushioning\nbit of stability this is a good shoe for\nthat doesn't particularly have any\nperformance elements to it it doesn't\nfeel like it's pushing you forward\ndoesn't feel like U it's giving you\nenergy back it's just a solid um just a\nsolid shoe for eating up the miles in in\nComfort um and that's if a lot of people\nare probably looking for so I think\nafter that first run nothing surprising\nfrom it um but looking forward to doing\na few more miles in it to see if I get\nanything else and that mid so maybe\nmaybe softens up a little bit more so\nsome other thoughts of that first run in\nBrooks Clon 22 and I would say this\nstill feels like a glycerin shoe so for\nanyone worried I think or cautious about\nthe changes here particularly from a\nkind of cushioning technology point of\nview I still feel like this is going to\nbe a shoe that's going to work for the\nsame types of runs and give you a\nsimilar experience know this is going to\nbe a good long run shoe this is going to\nbe a good shoe to spend a lot of your\nkind of training time if you're doing a\nmarathon and really not massively fast\nabout your kind of speed but just\nwanting to kind of make sure you're\ngetting that running time in your legs\nthis is still going to be a Shue to do\nthat and it's going to be very\ncomfortable very controlled very\nreliable very stable all those qualities\nI think are still going to be here in\nthe gliten\n22 I look at the changes the big changes\nfrom the 21 I think see it's a heavy\nissue I really would have preferred a\nlighter shoe than the glistan 21 and\nthat's not what we've got here in the\nGan 22 so I'm a little bit disappointed\nabout that I like the fact that it is a\nlittle bit more padded in places\nparticularly around the hill collar you\nknow I take more Comfort but obviously\nhas come at expense I think along with\nyou know a bit more rubber in the out\nsoole you know adding that weight over\nthe previous shoe which wasn't a light\nshoe either then you get that DNA tuned\nmidsole which is inevitable we're going\nto see it rolled out to other brick\nshoes the glycerin 22 is the next shoe I\nthink it worked really well in the\nglycerin Max and I think with the\nglycerin Max it was a a really kind of\nwell-rounded you I think it had a little\nbit of a versatility about it and you\nknow it worked very nicely I think for\nme I think am I seeing the best of it\nhere off that first run but I do think\ncompared to the my experience in the\nglisten 21 I do think the ride is a\nlittle bit more memorable a little bit\nmore bouncy a little bit more rebound\nthere which I really like and I think\nyou can roll through a little bit nicer\ncompared to the glycerin 21 so there's\ndefinitely some positives here there's\ndefinitely some things here that I think\nover longer term testing I really get a\nsense of whether that Cushing technology\nchange is going to make it a\nsignificantly better shoe so all things\nto kind of work out there with longer\ntesting you know it's good to see that\nthe price has stuck to you know you know\nthe glycerin 21 price is it going to be\nI think the shoe that I would probably\ngo from the Brooks range or that what\nI'm seeing I think probably I think the\nG Max is probably that shoe that I would\nprobably pick over those cushion shoes\nbut I think in terms of the changes I'm\nseeing here of that first run I think\nthey are going to be positive ones and\ncrucially it's not going to detract from\nwhat the glycerin is about and what it\nreally kind of delivers so yeah I say a\nvery good first run in the glycerin 22\none that I'm intrigued to spend more\ntime in to really get a sense of what's\nyou know how that DNA tuned kind of\ncushion technolog is going to feel over\nmore testing okay so they have it some\nearly first run thoughts on the Brooks\nGlycerin 22 now obviously plenty more\ntesting to be done in this shoe over the\nfestive period and early 2025 when this\nshoe will be launching in the UK we\nexpect Nick and Kieran to get hold of\nthe shoe so we'll have a full\nmultitester review for you then until\nthen if you've got any questions about\nthis shoe other shoes you're desperate\nto see it compared to or want to know\nhow it compares to do let us know in the\ncomments as always like And subscribe\nhit that little bell to find out about\nlatest videos and yeah we'll see you for\nnext round test this video\n[Music]",

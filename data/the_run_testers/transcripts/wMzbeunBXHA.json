  "text": "hello there Tom here from the Run\ntesters with a best running shoe solo\nguide so what this video is is a guide\nto the best shoes that I have tested\nover the past year in the next week\nwe'll be um publishing our Awards so\nwhat happens in the awards is that we go\nthrough everything that we've tested\nover the past year all of the shoes some\nwatches some headphones and we vote on\nwhat we think should be uh the winner of\nevery single category like cushion shoes\nor round of shoes issues things like\nthat um and we then go through all of\nthe numbers and work out what the\nwinners are but the problem with that is\nthat we often don't get to cover shoes\nin the awards that some of us really\nreally like because it's based on voting\nso the reason we do these videos is that\nwe can have an opportunity to talk about\nour own picks so we're all different at\nthe Run testers obviously Nick is a lot\nfaster than than me he runs in different\nshoes uh I favor cushion shoes and uh\ndaily shoes that sort of uh thing so\nthis gives me the opportunity talk about\na lot of things that I like and each of\nthe other in testers are going to be\ndoing these videos as well let's dive in\nand find out what the five running shoes\nI picked for this\n[Music]\nvideo okay so it will come as no\nsurprise to you if you're a fan of the\nchannel That one of the shoes that I've\npicked is the New Balance Mo V5 now my\nrunning issues do tend to skew a little\nbit more towards those easy runs daily\nruns uh because that's the bulk of what\nI do even though I train for marathons\nand I train for sub three marathons the\nway that I train for them is largely uh\nabout distance and comfort and getting\nthe Wilds in and I do have speed work in\nthere but I do spend a predominant\namount of my time in Cushing shoes and\ndaily shoes uh because I'm not uh going\nall out all the time I'm doing a lot\nmore distance um so the New Balance Mor\nV5 uh I probably about 100K in this now\nI really like the shoe the New Balance\nMo V4 and the New Balance Mo V3 were two\nof my favorite shoes this is a big uh\nupdate because it has a new tweaked mid\ncell phone in it so it uses the same mid\ncell phone that's in the ten v13 which\nis a bit softer um and in the ten v13 it\nmakes it really really soft and it means\nthat that shoe is essentially just a\nvery very easy day shoe and Recovery day\nshoe you wouldn't use it for anything\nelse more V 5 it has more of that foam\nin and I don't think it's exactly the\nsame as the foam you get in the 10 v13\nso it is a bit softer than the more V4\num but it's a little bit bouncier as\nwell so you do get the same benefits um\nthat I think you get from the mo V4 it's\na very comfortable shoe to run in it's a\nvery um uh enjoyable shoe to roll\nforward for longer sessions at a nice\ncomfortable Pace recovery runs easy runs\num and it's for me it's one of the best\nshoes out there for just ticking off\nMiles when I go out and run and I've got\na hour and a half easy run or recovery\nrun or a long run run at a nice\ncomfortable Pace this is the shoe that I\nwant to take out I'm not going to go\nfaster in it I'm not going to uh be\ndoing intervals in it or anything like\nthat I just want a shoe that I know is\ngoing to be really comfortable and just\nmake that run as enjoyable as possible\num because I'm I'm doing a lot of miles\nat the moment and I want those those\nmiles to be very very nice and\ncomfortable so the Mori 5 is one of my\ntop picks this year definitely my my\nfavorite pick for um cushioned easy run\num recovery day shoes\nmy next pick is another shoe that I tend\nto use quite a lot for easy days longer\nruns um just ticking off the miles but\nit's a shoe that has a little bit more\nto it so it's the Muno Neo Vista now\nthis shoe I really really like this shoe\nit's a very um it's such a fun shoe to\nwear the midle in it is really really\nbouny it's it's got a nice softness in\nit if you do an easy run in it it just\nfeels really comfortable um and just\nbounces you along just feels great uh if\nyou're doing a faster session it can\npick up the pace in it it's got a nice\nbounce to it it has this plate within it\nthat just gives you a little bit of\npropulsion as you're running it's not\nthe fastest shoe in the world but if\nyou're um I probably wouldn't use it if\nI was going for all out intervals uh and\nI needed to really hit hard Paces um but\nif I'm going out for a consistent uh\ninterval session consistent Paces where\nI may be doing like kilometer reps or\nsomething like that and I'm running at\nhalf marathon pace marathon pace this is\na great shoe for it it just makes it\nreally enjoy enjoyable just bounces you\nalong really really comfortable um only\nthing I would say about it is I'm not\nmassive fan of the oper it really like\nthese booty uppers but I've never really\nhad a a problem with this shoe um and\nI'd definitely say if I was go if you if\nI had to pick one shoe to to go on\nholiday with for a month and I I was\ndoing a mix of runs there this would be\none of the top ones on my list there are\nother shoes that are versatile like the\nsoing Dophin speed 4 but I find that\nskews a lot more towards the faster\nsessions wouldn't really like to use\nthat shoe for loads of easy stuff cuz\nit's a little bit too firm for me and I\ndon't really get the comfort that I want\nout of it this sits the other side it's\nmore more of on that sort of comfy\nsofter side but you can do quite a lot\nmore stuff in it and and when you\ncompare it the price of it compared to\nsome of the other shoes out the market\nso things like the super blast this is a\nreally really good value shoe at the\nmoment so well worth picking up if you\njust want a really nice comfortable\nbouncy enjoyable daily shoe but also if\nyou just want an easy shoe as well\nbecause it can do that absolutely\nperfectly okay so this pick is a bit\ntricky one because um I've actually got\nI'm going to mention two shoes here uh\none because I've tested it quite a bit\nand one because I started testing it but\nI think it's comparable with this shoe\nso the uh asex met speed Sky Paris um\nthis shoe is uh definitely the shoe that\nI would have said is the best Ray shoe\nthis year that I've tested um it is very\nvery very fast very propulsive you can\nreally feel it bouncing you forward as\nyou're running it feels very lightweight\nas well it is just it a fantastic carbon\nplate race Sho uh and really does the\ndoes the job um this shoe is uh I'm\ncurrently deciding what shoe to wear uh\nfor Valencia I'm not going to use the\naly3 I'm not a massive fan of that shoe\ndidn't really like using it when I ran\nBoston earlier in the year and I haven't\nreally got anything else apart from this\nand another shoe um that I'm choosing\nbetween so the reason I'm picking this\nis because the cushioning is really good\nit feels very comfortable feels like\nit's supporting you but giving you a lot\nof bounce back it's got a fairly\naggressive um C plate in it so you do\nfeel that propulsion that and that toe\noff when you're running and when you're\npicking up the pace and trying to\nmaintain that pace it really helps you\ndo that um only downside to the shoe is\nis a little bit of a thin shoe um which\nmakes it a tiny bit unstable uh if\nyou're landing on uneven surfaces um but\nhopefully if you're\nrunning Max Pace at various distances\nyou probably going to be running on a\nflat surface anyway so you don't need to\nworry too much about that um but it is\nfor me probably the best car plate racer\nthat's that's that's come out this year\nuh and I really really like this shoe\nthe other one which um I've only just\nrecently started testing um because\nwe're doing the awards and I wanted to\nmake sure that I cover everything uh\nthat should be covered is the Hawker\ncell X1 and I've used this only three\ntimes now I've RAC on it today um doing\nthe bright and 10K um and I've an\ninterval session and longer running it\nand I really like this shoe it be feels\nlike the sort of shoe that I really\nenjoy running fast in um it it's a\nlittle bit aggressive uh I'd say it's\nmore aggressive than the um the aex\nmeted sky Paris um it's got a good level\nof cushioning in it reminds me a little\nbit of a more subtle version of\nsomething like the sakon and dorphin\nElite which a shoe that I have a bit of\na LoveHate relationship with I think\nit's a the fastest shoe I've ever I've\never raced in but I also think it's the\nmost awkward shoe I've ever raced in I\nwould not want to run a marathon that\nshoe just because of the way that it\npositions your foot this this shoe I\nthink has some of the elements of that\nshoe um but just feels a little bit more\nwelcoming and a bit more comfortable um\nespecially based off the long run that I\ndidn't it so um the cx1 is my uh second\npick for this this area but I don't want\nto give it the the wiim because I don't\nthink I've tested it enough to to\njustify it yet um maybe if I use it for\nValencia um then I'll see if it really\ndoes compare with the um met speed Sky\nParis\nokay my fourth pick for best shoes uh\n2024 is the New Balance balos now this\nshoe uh we talked about quite a lot this\nyear um and was ever since I heard about\nthis shoe when it was at the running uh\nshow in the in the US I was very excited\nabout it because it's a shoe that it's\nessentially a shoe that's designed for\ndaily runs but it's got a lot of\ncushioning in it's got a lot of Bounce\nin it it's very soft shoe um but that\nmid cell pH doesn't suck away energy\ngives you it back whereas some of the\ndaily shoes that have a lot of\ncushioning in do tend to sa your energy\na little bit um but this is really good\nuh for so many different runs uh it's a\ngreat easy day shoe um it's expensive\nfor an easy day shoe so you wouldn't\njust buy it as an easy day shoe um but\nif you you run easy in it it's\nabsolutely fine the the main reason I\nuse this shoe tends to be more for um\nlonger efforts as part of my marathon\ntraining block where I need to maintain\na pace uh maybe my marathon pace maybe\nslightly slower than my marathon pace\nwhich would be like 4 minute 20 kilomet\num for an extended period of time and I\nwant to do it in comfort and I want to\ndo it um and protect my legs uh but I'm\nnot going all out uh so I wouldn't use\nthis shoe for Interval sessions um I'd\nuse it for consistent sessions where I'm\njust going out and I'm running fairly\ntaxing rate um for a consistent period\nof time um and that's it's a bit of a\nKNE shoe for that um there when I'm\noutside the marathon season I'm probably\nnot going to use this shoe as much um\njust cuz are more likely to use the more\nV5 as an easy day shoe and um I'm more\nlikely to use other shoes as interval\nshoes but for that specific purpose\nwhere you're just running for a long\ndistance and you want something that\nreally makes that easy to to maintain\nit's a really enjoyable comfy shoe and\nhas a lot of feelings to it like the\nmore V5 it is it has a similar vibe to\nthe to the midell foam and the softness\nand the Comfort but it's just it's just\ngot more to it you can definitely pick\nup the pace in this shoe and maintain it\nwell okay so my final pick for 2024 it\nwill come as no surprise to anyone which\nis why I've left it till the end of this\nis the super Blast 2 uh Mike still got\nmy Sul 2 um and I really need to get it\noff him because um I'm desperate to go\nat running in it again supl 2 is a\nreally nice progression of the super\nblast I know that it's a very hard shoe\nto get uh there's probably going to be\ncomments uh on this video about how it's\nalmost impossible to get hold of that\nshoe hopefully at some point they will\nhave more of uh the super blast uh to\navailable um but it is a fantastic shoe\nso it's it's a nice development of the\nsuper blast super blast was a fantastic\nshoe you it was the sort of shoe a bit\nlike the BOS where it really excels at\nmaintaining a really uh taxing pace for\na long period it's a sort of shoe that I\nuse for uh Marathon efforts where I'm\ngoing out and maybe I'm doing 28k as\npart of my long runs I need to do some\nof that or all of that at my marathon\npace um and I need something that's\ngoing to consistently allow me to do\nthat but without being being too\naggressive without slowing me down\nanything like that just lets me do that\npace super Blast 2 um is very similar to\nsuper blast one as you'd expect but it's\njust got a little bit more to that\nmidell fo it just has a little bit more\nuh responsiv in it for me um little bit\nsofter I find the super Blast 2 and all\nin all it's just a nice Improvement on\nthe super blast in fact because Mike's\ngot my super Blast 2 I've actually been\nrunning the super blast one quite a lot\nrecently and that shoe still is\nfantastic um but Zas 2 is just a nice um\nupgrade to the original super blast\nfantastic shoe definitely one that is\nvery expensive so if you're buying the\nsuper Blast 2 and you're using it for\neasy runs it's probably not worth doing\nthat you can do it in there but it's a\nlot of money to spend on a shoe that is\nreally designed much like the BOS for\nthose long um training runs where you\njust want a consistent comfortable Pace\num and you want a shoe that's going to\nallow you to pick up that pace nicely\nand just maintain it for a nice long\nperiod of time again I probably wouldn't\nuse the super blast two for racing it\nhasn't really got the proportion it\nhasn't really got the Bounce That I Want\nfrom a uh from a race shoe um I could do\nit I could race in the super Blast 2 but\nI just don't think it has that the\nbenefits That I Want from from a Rao but\nit's really good for that sort of 85%\n95% training um where you're just\ngetting to the point where you're almost\nat race Pace but you just need to\nmaintain it for for a good period so\nthat's my five top picks for the best\nrunning shoes of\n2024 thanks a lot for watching each of\nthe other R testers will be doing their\nown versions which may be very similar\nor may be very different from from my\none and we'll also have our full Awards\nwhere you'll find out how all of our\nchoices have gone in to make the final\npicks for our 2024 winners right thanks\na lot for watching catch you next time\n[Music]",

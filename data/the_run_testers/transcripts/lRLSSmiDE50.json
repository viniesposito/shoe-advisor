  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name\nis Nick in this video I'm going to be\ncomparing the Nike zoomfly 6 and the aex\nsuper Blast\n[Music]\n2 so the super blast and the zoomfly are\nnot necessarily directly comparable\nshoes because the zoomfly has a plate in\nthe midsole whereas the super blast\ndoesn't but they are both super trainers\nthat are designed to do a wide range of\nruns they're both very popular shoes and\npeople are quite Keen to see this\ncomparison so so here it is the zoom fly\nis the cheapest shoe it cost \u00a3155 or\n$170 the super Blast 2 is \u00a3200 or $200\nthe zoomfly is a little bit heavier is\n266 G or 9.4 o in a uk9 whereas a super\nblast is 252 G or 8.9 o in the same size\nthey both have an 8 mm drop and the\nstack height on the superlast is a\nlittle bit higher it's 45 mm at the heel\n37 at the 4T whereas the Nike Zoom fly\nis 42 mm at the heel and 34 mm at the\n4ot comes to the design with the Nike\nyou got two layer woven mesh upper with\na fair amount of padding around the heel\nsignificant internal heel counter as\nwell to add some structure at the back\nof the shoe you got a duel density\nmidsole the top layer is made from Nike\nzoomx foam there's a carbon plate\nrunning the full length of the shoe in\nbetween that it's a fairly flexible\nplate a little bit more so than on their\nRacing shoes but still a stiffening\nagent to add to the midside to add a bit\nmore propulsion and then you have Nike's\nsr2 carrier foam on the bottom of the\nshoe there which is little bit less\nlively than the zoomx foam above it but\nadds a bit more kind of durability and\nstability to the shoe got a waffle full\nout sole coverage at the forefoot and\nheel big cutout in the middle that shows\noff the carbon plate in the mids soole\nand then with the super blast you also\nhave a dual density mids soole but most\nof it is made from asx's FF turbo plus\nfoam their best foam the bounciest foam\nthe most responsive foam used in shoes\nlike the metas speed Paris racing shoe\nseries and then you have some FF blast\nPlus ecofoam on the bottom of the shoe\nthere as well got a pretty simple\nengineered mesh upper thin tongue bit of\npadding at the back bit of structure at\nthe back you nothing too much going on\nwith the upper there and then you've got\nreasonable outsole coverage there on the\nbottom you these patches of the ahar\nplus rubber which is pretty good in\nterms of grip lots of exposed phone but\nyou know the key areas are covered there\nnot any problems with grip with either\n[Music]\nshoe comes to the fit I've got a uk9 in\nboth of these shoes which is a us10 for\nboth of these Brands that's the size I\nuse across the Nike and aex range and\nI've had no problems with the fit of\neither both have enough room around the\ntoes good hold around the heer mid foot\nthey're both pretty comfortable uppers\nall around I would say know four super\ntrainers that can do very fast running\nas well as easy running they do have\nvery accommodating uppers that make them\ncomfortable to pull on every single day\nNikes are probably a little bit more\ndialed in around the toes you know it's\na slightly more cramped fit I'd say than\na super blast but not in a way that was\nunpleasant at all it just gives it maybe\na slightly racier feel at times but\noverall I was very happy with the fit of\nboth shoes yeah great uppers good\ncomfort and I would stick to your normal\nrunning shoe\n[Music]\nsize onto the run test then and I think\nthese are two excellent shoes two of the\nshoes I've really enjoyed running in\nthis year the superl 2 more or less just\npicked up where the super blast one left\noff in being pretty much the standard\nSetter for plate free super trainers\nlike it's a pretty unique shoe and one\nthat I don't think any other brands\nreally been able to emulate in terms of\nthat very versatile plate free design\nwhereas the Nike zoomfly 6 was a big\nupgrade on previous models of the shoe\nwhich were heavy clunky not that good\nand the zoomfly 6 is now very good it's\na plated super trainer that can match up\nto the best in that category including\nshoes like the Sak endorphin speed 4 or\nthe H max2 and indeed it's a pretty good\ncompetitor for someone like a super\nblast as well if you don't mind training\nwith the plate so super Blast 2 we had\nin for testing first did a lot of\nrunning when we initially had it in and\nI actually took it away last week for a\ntrip and just used it for everything you\nknow just walking around all my runs one\nof those trips where you only have a\nvery small bag on a budget Airline so\nyou have one pair of shoes for\neverything and it's perfect for that\nbecause it is such a versatile shoe it\nis comfortable it's bouncy it's fast it\nyou know does everything really well\nit's also quite a nice looking shoe I\nthink in this colorway although some\nwill disagree it's also just amazingly\nlight for its size which really helps\nyou pick up the pace in it so I did like\nkind of a progression running the shoe\nwhile I was away I've done some full\nsessions in the shoe as well and while\nit is quite a big shoe something I\nalways noticed because of the way I am\nquite a high Cadence Runner quite a\nshuffly runner and a big kind of\nboatlike design like this sometimes\nfeels a bit big on my foot but if I kind\nof get over that I can run fast in the\nshoe without any problems got a lot of\nresponse from the foam and you know it\ndoes feel good for those fast Paces but\nreally excels I think for kind of\ncruising around daily runs like\nprogression runs you're moving to kind\nof steady Paces kind of quick but not\nfast I guess how I describe those kind\nof runs where you are moving with a bit\nof effort but you're not really going\nfor it and long runs in particular just\nreally good shoe for eating up a lot of\nmileage and just amazingly light for its\nsize like all these super trainers that\ncome out with plates designed very\nexplicitly for fast running things like\nthe Nike and other shoes like that are\nall heavier than the super loss despite\nthe fact has a higher stack just because\nthat foam is so light and that does\nreally help it be a more versatile shoe\nthe Nike is also a very versatile shoe\nthough and that certainly wasn't the\ncase with previous models of The Zo\nflight like this is now isue you can go\nand do fast runs in I've done a couple\nof hard sessions in it I've gone down\nthe track and done a 10 times one mile\nsession a nasty progression run on the\nroad done a pretty decent steady run\nagain quick but not fast over about 90\nminutes where I was running pretty well\nand you know at the back end of marathon\ntraining this was a shoe that I really\nenjoyed using for all the runs I was\ndoing around that time so pretty good\nworkouts lots of long runs of\nprogression runs and it just felt really\ngood for them like it's an exceptionally\ncomfortable shoe given the speed you\nhave here I would say it starts with the\nupper which is really nice to slip on\nand then the underfoot feel is really\nquite relaxed and cruisy for a shoe that\nyou can run very fast in and that's a\nbit similar to the super blast but I\nthink you have a slightly smaller and\nmore Nimble design with the Nike and\nalthough it's know heavier does feel a\nbit more kind of fast and direct than\nthe super blast because it has a I think\na slightly more aggressive 4 foot rocker\nlike kind of you know you get pushed off\nthe toes a bit more on the Nike I would\nsay and it just has a slightly smaller\ndesign around the heel which has a heel\nStriker with a high Cadence I do notice\nif I'm trying to run fast so I tell you\nlike when it comes to you know really\nallout sessions or trying to hold a fast\npace for a long time if you're looking\nfor a stand in racing shoe I think\nthat's where the Nike excels a little\nbit more than the super blast just\nbecause it does have a bit more of a\nracy feel a faster feel I find it easier\nto sustain Paces in the Nike than the\nsuper blast super blast really for me\nfits more in the daily trainer mold\nwhere you know can do everything and it\ncan go fast but I think it excels more\nat kind of slightly more relaxed places\nthan the Nike both I would also say are\nsurprisingly stable for such big shoes\nlike they both got pretty wide bases\nboth got designs that you know are not\nnecessarily going to be inherently\nstable with those big stacks of foam on\nthere but they're welld designed I had\nno concerns about running in them kind\nof on any terrain uh and certainly no\nconcerns in terms of pronation or\nanything like that so I did do a short\nrun wearing both shoes at the same time\nyou actually have a softer feel with the\nNike I think it almost feels a little\nbit more flexible like the superlast is\nquite renowned for being quite a stiff\nshoe despite the fact it doesn't have a\nplate which does help it run fast but I\nknow not everyone loves that for kind of\nmore relaxed Paces like I quite like it\nfor those relaxed Paces that stiffness\nkind of pushes you through and rolls you\non it's not uncomfortable at all but\nit's surprising actually that even\nthough the Nike has a plate it didn't\nreally feel that much different in terms\nof stiffness when you comparing these\ntwo shoes directly on the run and you\nget I think a little bit more pop and\nlift off the toes with the Nike with\nthat plate in there and the way the\nrocket I think just works a bit better\nfor me rolling me through my foot strike\nwhere youve got the quite sharp tapered\nrocker on the super blast I think that\nhelps a lot in terms of like a big\namount of Bounce and if you're a bit\nmore of a loping runner I think you'll\nprobably engage that and enjoy that a\nbit more than I do but I do think just\nget yeah a bit more punch off the Nike\nsuperlast feels a bit more relaxed it's\nkind of a strange to both of these shoes\nactually I would say feel quite similar\nat a range of Paces like there are some\nshoes where you really feel that they're\na bit more direct and firm and\naggressive when you start running quick\nin them but both of these feel like oh\nyou can run in these at very relax Paces\nRun them at fast Paces they still feel\nquite similar which is nice like it's\ngreat for a training Sho to be able to\ndo lots of different runs in like that\nand they always feel quite comfortable\nand have stability but you can run nice\nand quick in them as\n[Music]\nwell so verdict this is a really tough\nchoice I think these are both excellent\nshoes that do a range of jobs really\nwell they're really versatile shoes\nthey're comfortable I like wearing them\nboth for easy runs and then they do both\nhave Pace you can go and do fast\nsessions in them and you can even use\nboth as standing Racing shoes especially\nfor longer distances because there is a\nlot of pace there as well as protection\nand comfort with all the foam you have\nUnder Foot so when it comes to picking\nbetween the two shoes there a few things\nyou could look at to help you on that\nfront I mean one is just simply the\nprice the Nike is cheaper so that's an\neasy objective win for the Nike and\ngiven that both these shoes are quite\nsimilar in performance that is quite a\nbig deal you know you could certainly\npick up the Nike make a saving and have\na really good shoe then the ride field I\nthink you've got a slightly more cruisy\nfeel with the super blast it's a bit\nbetter for kind of loping through those\neasy runs relaxed runs it's a shoe I'm a\nbit more comfortable pulling on for\nevery single day because it doesn't have\na plate in there it's got a nice relaxed\nupper it feels really good at easy paces\nand you can step up the pace when you\nwant to and the Nike is a bit nimbler\nbit more punch from the plate if you are\nlooking for more of an explicit fast\ntrainer to add to your rotation I think\nit does the job a little bit better but\nit is also very versatile for sure got\nchoice about whether to plate or not to\nplate like not sure it makes a huge\ndifference in this case myself like\ncertainly there's a nice feeling in\nrunning a shoe without a plate and\nrunning fast and all that but superlast\nhas got a big old super foam in there\nit's a stiff shoe I think it acts in a\nsimilar way in many ways as having the\nplate that said I do think it's a bit\neasier to maintain you know fast Paces\nover long distances in the Nike so maybe\nthat's a mental thing or maybe that\nactually is the plate coming into play\nso if you don't want to use a plate to\nshoot obviously a super Blaster is an\neasy winner there so that is something\nthat you know some people want to\nconsider so obviously if you're looking\nfor one shoe to do it all I'd probably\nget the Nike myself if you're quite keen\non racing because I think it's a\nslightly better racing shoe and it does\nthose easy runs well if you're looking\nfor a shoe to add to rotation just to\nhave with like a carbon plate racing\nshoe to do to do those really fast\nworkouts in I think the super blast\nworks really well I think that's the\nFantastic that's probably the best two\nshoe rotation out there I think at the\nmoment is to get the super blast for\npretty much all your training and then a\ncarbon plate racing shoe for races and\nthe odd really hard session super blast\njust does that role so well and if\nyou're looking for like a fast trainer\nto slip in the middle of a rot I think\nboth work pretty much equally well so\nit's more whether you want the kind of\nlighter but bigger design of the super\nblast the slightly punchier kind of\nplated Nimble design of the zoom fly\nlike again it's really close here so I\nthink I'd really struggle to pick\nbetween them I think I'd probably just\nlean towards the Nike myself I just\nsuits my running style a little bit\nbetter just because I have a high\nCadence I said I really enjoyed just\nhaving the super blast as my only shoe\naway on a trip it was really nice to put\nit on every day it's a shoe you can\nreally fall in love with by using over\nand over again so yeah very hard to call\nprobably the Nike just as it for me\nespecially as it's a little bit cheaper\nbut certainly very case for either shoe\nboth very much stand out of\n[Music]\n2024 that's our comparison of the zoom\nfly 6 and the S6 superlast 2 let us know\nwhat you think in the comments below\nplease like And

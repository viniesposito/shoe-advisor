  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand to our head-to-head review of the\nASX Nova blast 5 and the New Balance\n1080 v14 both of these shoes have had\nsome interesting updates over their last\nGenerations that arguably have brought\nthem closer together in terms of what\nthey deliver you could say that both\nthese shoes are shooting for a little\nbit more versatility do they deliver\nwhich one's the best which one's our\nfavorite which one would we recommend\nhow would you use both of these shoes\nWe're going to tell you that in the\nupcoming video so watch on for our\nhead-to-head between the asex Nova blast\n5 and the New Balance 1080\nv14 details then the ax no blast 5 stack\nheight has 412 m in the 4 foot 33 1/2 in\nthe hill for an 8 mil drop meanwhile the\nnew balanc 1080 v14 has 38 m in the heel\n32 m in the 4T for a 6 mil drop when it\ncomes to weight aex managed to shave a\nlittle off the Nova blast 5 in our UK\nmen's 8 and a half test sh It Now tips\nthe scales a pretty impressive 8.9 o or\n251 G the New Balance 1080 v14 has put\non a bit of weight in its generation in\nour men's UK 8 and a half It Now tips\nthe scales at 10.1 o or 285 G on price\nthe RRP for the new balance is $165 or\n\u00a360 the NOA blast 5 drops in at a cheap\n$140 or\n\u00a3135 let's give you a quick shoe\ncomparison starting with the midsoles\nwith the novablast fire sticks largely\nto the Nova blast blueprint with a Max\nstack midsole but uses a new bouncier\nfoam flight foam blast Max there's a\nlarge rocker a wide 4ot platform But A\nreduced heel extension here meanwhile\nthe New Balance 1080 v14 has a more\nconservative stack of fresh foam X also\nwith a rocket midsole now while the Nova\nblast 5 is softer this generation n v14\nhas gone the other way with a slightly\nfirmer feel than the 1080 v13 up top the\nNew Balance 1080 v14 has engine near\nmesh uppers which are More Hugging than\nthe looser fit of the Nova blast 5's\nmore premium jackard mesh they're\nsignificantly less Flex in the toe box\nof the 1080 making for a more wrapped\nless Airy fit overall both shoes have\nplush padded heel colors the 1080s have\na little more the gusted tongues on the\n1080 are also much more padded than no\nblast 5 which saves some weight with a\nthin nicely wrapping design if you flip\nthem over the new Bal 108 v14 has a\nhorseshoe around the midfoot single pad\nof protective rubber in the middle of\nthe 4 foot then rubber patches on the\nheels which are thicker than more\ndurable than we saw on the last\ngeneration meanwhile the overlast five\nout soole sticks to a relatively\nstandard covering of AIX ahar low rubber\nyou're still not getting that top level\ngrip of the ah plus that you got on the\nax super Blast 2 but it is sort of\npretty well covered for the\noutsole so when it comes to fit I ran in\na uk8 and a half which is my regular\nshoe size in both of these shoes the\nbiggest thing to note on fit here is\nthat the New Balance 1080 v14 fit really\nsnug it makes for good hold and security\nbut they're not that roomy at true to\nsize they're ATT Tad cramped across the\ntop of the midfoot something that you'll\nnotice if like me you've got quite high\nfeet some people found they might be a\nbit shorter on the length as well the\nNOA plus 5 is cavernous by comparison\nit's really spacious and Airy with the\nRoto box on the flip side of that though\nsome people have found the Nova blast 5\na little bit too spacious but I've got\nwide feet and I like spacing shoes that\nI'd use for longer easier miles but\nstill aside from that I'd still go true\nto sizing both shoes but I think some\nmight want to consider half a size up in\nthe new balance for a bit more of a\nroomy fit so in terms of fit these two\nshoes have been absolutely spot on for\nme no issues to report I've got them\nboth in a UK size which my typical\nrunning shoe size and I would say they\nare or have been true to size fitting\nshoes for me I wouldn't be looking to\nkind of size up or size down at either\nof these shoes I think in terms of\nthings like space in the toe boxes it's\nvery similar for me you know pretty\nroomy and spacious there similar level\nof kind of padding throughout the shoes\nmaybe a touch more on the heel collar on\nthe new Bon atv4 I think the biggest\ndifference for me is just how those\nuppers feel and what that kind of does\nfor the fit I think on the Nova blast 5\nit's a little bit more relaxed feeling I\nwould say a bit more snug feeling I\nthink with the 1080 v14 there's a bit\nmore structure to that up and if that's\nsomething you prefer in terms of fit and\nI think that's what the 1080 v14 is most\ngoing to give you over the uh Nova blast\n5 I think that more relaxed fit as well\nthe Nova blast 5 just feels a touch\nbroader a little bit more spacious in\ngeneral throughout the shoe if you're\nlooking for a roomier fit I think the\nNOA blast 5 is going to give you that if\nyou're looking for a shoe that's going\nto be very comfortable very padded uh\nand give you good space up front in the\ntoe box then I would say that both these\nshoes are going to serve you well the\nfit for me in these two shoes I'm a size\neight in the UK these are both size\neights very similar fit to both of them\nthey're both shoes designed for Comfort\nthey're both shoes designed to offer\nplenty of space in the for foot um and\nthey're both very comfortable I got\nfairly uh average width feet and I've\nhad no issues at all with these straight\nfrom the off they're very very\ncomfortable plenty of padding on them uh\nI would say that the Nova blast 5 is\nprobably slightly roomier it's a little\nbit wider than the 1080 uh v14 but not\nmassively there's not loads in it I\nthink if you if you can wear one you're\nvery likely to be able to wear the other\none very very comfortably there's also\nplenty of space before uh the big toe as\nwell so definitely would stay to my size\nin both of these shoes it's very able\nupper very easy to lace up uh I haven't\nhad any issues at all in either of these\nshoes so when it comes to the fit of the\ntwo shoes I've got a uk9 in both of\nthese shoes which is a us10 with the ax\nno blast 5 it's a us99.5 with the new\nbalance that kind of difference in US\nsizing is reflected in the way they fit\nyou have got a more dialed in fit with\nthe New Balance but actually even if\nthey're the same US size I think You'\nhave a more kind of dialed in fit around\nthe toes in the New Balance because the\nupper on the no blast 5 is very roomy\naround the toe box like you got a lot of\nvolume in there and there's someone with\na narrow foot you know I do have a bit\ntoo much room but it's not something\nthat's been a problem at all the fit's\nbeen very secure around the heel and\nmidfoot I've got the right length in\nterms of the room in front of my toes\nand with a new balance I've had no real\nconcerns at all with the fit you've got\na certainly a plumper and a more padded\ntongue on the New Balance compared to\nthe no blast but you know it's a nice\ncomfortable feeling it hasn't felt too\nhot or oppressive although I have been\nrunning in pretty cold conditions in\nboth of these shoes overall I would\nstick to your normal size with both of\nthese shoes when it comes to the fit and\nI've had no concerns at all with rubbing\nor anything like\nthat now in testing I've run more than\n40 m a New Balance 1080 v14 that's\nmostly been easy plotting with some runs\nup to 90 minutes I've covered well north\nof 50 mi in the no last five including a\nfull 4our solo Marathon test I've tested\nboth shoes across the range of Paces\nthat we usually do covering slow and\neasy long runs right up to faster\nintervals and progression runs and as\nusual I've run mainly on road but with\nsome light off-road uh runs in there as\nwell just to test the stability now a\nquick take on both shoes and the story\nhere really is that these shoes are\ncoming closer together I think in terms\nof the ride while the novablast five\nruns softer the 1080 v14 is back to\nbeing Snappy with this generation so\nthey're now much close in terms of the\nride and you've got from the previous\ngenerations of both shoes new balanc\n1080 v14 has a marginally stiffer\nmidsole outsole combo that offers some\nextra resilience and immediacy I think\nthat Smooths the transitions uh the\nresponse is much quicker now and the\nfoam returns FAS than you've got the\n1080 v13 so it's a bit snappier and a\nbit more versatile round I think the as6\nno blast 5 offers a nice smooth smooth\nride that responds well on toe off and\nfeels springy but controlled it's a bit\nsofter though than I think you got from\nthe previous generation when you're\nfeeling good running in good form and\npushing the pace no class five feels\nenergetic though there's a bit more\nbounce but it's also cushioned enough to\naccommodate slower Paces though\nsometimes on heavier legs because of\nthat added softness I did find that it\nfelt a little bit soggy now I also did a\nside by side mile to see how these two\nreally compare when you got them both on\nyour feet and here's what I found so\nI've just done my side by side mile I've\ngot the no 5 on the left foot I've got\nthe New Balance 1080\nv14 on the right foot and while I\nthought these shoes might be quite\ndifferent in terms of the types of run\nthat they would do and the ride that\nthey deliver I think actually there's a\nlot more similarities than I'd expected\nbetween the two shoes the fact is I\nthink the over blast five have come sort\nof towards the softer end than they did\nwith the no blast 4 which were a little\nbit firmer a little bit snappier while\nthe New Balance 1080 v14 has added a\nlittle bit of extra stiffness which\nbrings them a little bit up from the\nreally soft end into something that's a\nlittle bit firmer and a little bit\nsnappier so they've now much closer\ntogether in terms of the type of ride\nthey deliver type of Amy that you get\nall the softness and cushioning all of\nthose things it's much more even over\nthose two things although they do feel\nquite different on the foot one of them\nis a big roomy Airy loose fitting shoe\nthat's the NOA blast 5 plenty of room in\nthe toe box they just feel really\nspacious really nice the kind of shoe\nthat I would happily sort of think about\nokay they got the room here for going\nUltra and really long long hours on feet\nthe new balanc 1080 v14 by contrast are\nvery compact very snug fitting there's\njust not as much clearance there's a bit\nof flex across the top of the toe box\nbut yeah they just feel a lot more\nhugging now than over the last five a\nlot more roomy so depending on how you\nlike your shoes and true to size that's\nthe difference one of the main\ndifference and then you come to the ride\nand this is something I'm finding hard\nto kind of put into words the different\nsensations of the shoes I think they\nboth probably cater for sort of similar\nruns I think they're both going to be\nbetter towards the easier end of your\nPaces I think the overlast 5 being\nslightly lighter they feel lighter on\nthe foot I think they're a bit more kind\nof Bounce a bit more energy they might\nbe a little bit more versatile overall\nbut I actually I think these shoes would\nprobably cater for the same kinds of\nruns for me and I would use them more\ntowards the sort of lower and slower up\nto kind of midling and and maybe a\nlittle bit beyond that kind of\nrun they come about this will get there\nin a slightly different way though I\nthink the foam in the New Balance 1080\nv14 it compresses less it's much more\nimmediate in its return it kind of leads\nyou to sort of roll through a lot\nquicker the transitions feel a little\nbit snappier and a bit more smooth I\nfind a bit more consistent the Nova\nblast achieves its kind of energy a\nlittle bit more from a bounce so it\nsinks a bit more and then it returns and\nbounces and sort of almost kind of\npropels you a bit more with kind of\nBounce and spring rather than this kind\nof smooth slightly stiffer roll through\ntransition that you get they both offer\noodles Oodles of comfort and cushioning\nthey both really well protected under\nthe road I I feel like the stack is\nquite similar in terms of the amount of\nRoad field you get I think they're both\npretty similar in terms of the stability\nthat they offer they both got good\nplatforms to run off nice and soft\npretty reliable I think actually maybe\nthe new balances is touch more reliable\nparticularly if I'm landing 4 foot\nrather than further back but they're\nboth nice and protective but they're\nboth really comfortable on the foot and\nI would happily do long slow and easy or\nshort slow and easy in this shoe I think\nif I was picking an uptempo shoe maybe\nI'd be inclined to go for the Nova blast\njust because it feels lighter in area\nand roomier on the foot if I was going\nfor really really long miles I think\nalso I'd go Nova blast 5 just because\nyou've got that extra wiggle room or\nmaybe i' have to go half a size up in\nthe New Balance 1080 v14 but when it\ncomes to sort of the ride that I enjoy\nthe most actually I think just for\nclipping along and cruising at maybe\nmiddling Paces I didn't think I was\ngoing to say this but I actually feel\nlike the new balanc 1080 v14 might be\nthe better shoe so in terms of my\nrunning time in these two shoes I would\nsay it's been solid overall these are\nvery good cushion daily trainer shoes\nthese are shoes personally I would be\nusing for kind of easy to moderate Paces\nthese can work great for short runs\nthey're going to be great long run shoes\nI think if you're looking for a\ncomfortable Marathon shoe both of these\nshoes will fit that profile in terms of\nthe key differences one of the smaller\nones there is a small weight difference\nthe Nova blast 5 is the lighter of the\ntwo shoes for me my UK size eight I\nthink the 10804 about 20 G heavier but\nthe grand scheme of things hasn't had a\nmassive influence but if you wanted the\nlighter shoe it you know it's the Nova\nblast 5 what's going to have more\nbearing on your running experience is\ngoing to be the midsole Foams where that\nmidsole foam lays how it works in terms\nof you know what you're getting in the\nout soole as well which I think\ndefinitely has a part to play in terms\nof these two shoes we're starting the\nover blast 5 which is the new of the two\nshoes it's got the FF blast Max which\nhas been using one other shoe so far in\nthe aex range now compared to the fresh\nfoam in a 10804 it definitely feels\nsofter definitely feels a lot more plush\nit's not overly plush but compared to\nthe Fresh Foam which I think has changed\nfrom the Fresh Foam in the 1080 v13 it\nhas a little bit more resilience to it\nit's a little bit more Hardy compared to\nthe FF blast Max now with that FF blast\nMax it is definitely spread across a\nwider kind of broader platform which I\nthink you know what that dictates really\nis you know it's Comfort first and I\nthink that's really what I've\nexperienced in my time no blast fight\nwhen you get out on it it's smooth\ncontrolled stable and very comfortable\nfirst and foremost in terms of a lively\nbounce I think I got it in the initial\nruns it wasn't really replicated for me\nin successive runs I think with the new\nbalance 10814 in contrast I think you're\ngetting moderate bounce there but it's\nbeen consistent throughout my runs and\nagain you've got a nice kind of gentle\nrocker there like the ax shoe just kind\nof you know nudging you forward just\nenough and helping you to kind of tip\nthat running time off so from you know\nfrom a point of view I think you know\nthe the runs and the types of Paces I've\ndescribed I think both these shoes were\nwork very well I think the experience if\nyou know of those Foams and where\nthey're set really kind of dictate you\nknow how it's going to feel and I do\nfeel that on the no blast 5 it's a\nsofter more comfortable feeling I think\nwith the 108 b14 it's still a\ncomfortable shoe but I think as I said I\nthink there's a harder Edge or slightly\nfirmer Edge to the feel of the midsole\nfoam and a more moderate notable balance\nthroughout my running time in that shoe\nI talked about the out soes and I said\nwith the no blast 5 I think you know\nyou've got a kind of big kind of wide\nout soole here and I think that really\ncontributes to that kind of very\ncontrolled feel in the in that shoe and\nI think it's a similar story with the\n108 v14 it's not as wide but it\ndefinitely I think helps to counter that\nkind of controlled kind of protective\nfeeling in that shoe from a gripping\npoint of view I think you know you're\nprobably going to get a little bit more\nkind of grip and performance out of the\nno blast 5 um outsole that's kind of\nwhat I found they're not perfect outsole\ngrips particularly in kind of wetter\nconditions but General dry Pavements and\nRoad that's where you're going to use\nthem durability I think you you know the\nlayouts are very similar they're kind of\nfocusing on the lateral areas really of\nthese shoes a bit more on the four foot\nof the shoes and I think that maybe it's\na little bit more rubber than the um ax\nout sole so for me I'd probably get I\nwould say getting a bit more life out of\nthe no BL see less wear or signs of wear\non that shoe so yeah for me solid\ncushion daily trainer shoes across the\nboard definitely some experiences or\ndifference in in experiences\nparticularly around the midell makeups\nbut yeah very good overall in my time\nokay so these two shoes are daily shoes\nthey're designed to be used for all of\nyour runs can also be clust as the sort\nof shoe that you'd buy if you were maybe\njust buying one pair of shoes and you\nwanted to take off all your miles in a a\nnice comfortable shoe that could\nprobably do a little bit more um but\nthese are two these two new versions of\nthe shoes are slightly different than\nprevious versions um because they have\nchanged the foam in both of these shoes\num the 1080 v14 um the 1080 v13 was a\nreally really soft shoe they had\nmassively changed the midsole of that\nshoe and it changed the ride\nsignificantly and a lot of people didn't\nlike it I liked it I thought that shoe\nwas really nice cuz I like soft\ncomfortable shoes when I'm doing easy\nruns um but it lost a little bit of\nstability in that shoe so they um have\nupdated the midell foam and it's a bit\nmore like what you had experienced from\nan earlier version or a mix of an\nearlier version of the 1080 range and\nthe 108 v13 so what you get in the 108\nv14 is a much more balanced uh midsole\nit's soft enough um but it isn't overly\nsoft it's not really squishy um but it's\nvery comfortable to run in and it's\nprobably a little bit more versatile\nthan the 1080 v13 not massively it's not\nI wouldn't say it's an amazingly\nversatile shoe it's definitely a shoe\nthat firmly sits in that that world of\ndaily comfortable miles you're probably\nnot going to do a lot of um interval\ntraining in this shoe probably not going\nto race in this shoe um but you can do a\nbit more in it if you to buy one shoe if\nyou're a beginner or if you're just sort\nof General Runner who just wants one\nshoe to just go out and tick off miles\nin and then in Comfort uh this is a very\ngood shoe for that it it tis a lot of\nboxes I very much enjoy testing this\nshoe um and I can see uh why they have\nmade those changes on the 108 v13 which\nwas a little bit of a a Marmite shoe um\nthe other thing as well is by um\nupdating that midell foone it's a little\nbit more stable which is something that\na lot of people didn't like about the\n108 v13 um and all in all it's a very\nsolid comfortable enjoyable daily shoe\nthat really veers more towards the\neasier or longer distance comfortable\nmiles as opposed to picking up the pace\na lot in this shoe but if you wanted to\nrun a bit faster in it you can it's just\nnot perfectly designed for doing that\nit's very much a an easy or long run\nshoe L blast 5 now this shoe has um a\nbig update on the previous version so it\ndoes have this new FF blast Max Mido\ncushioning in it the Nova blast 4 I\nreally like that shoe the nobl range\nvaries quite a lot every time they\nrelease a new version of the shoe and\nthey seem to tweak it quite a bit and it\nhas quite a polarizing um experience for\nsome people who are used to earlier\nversions of the shoe this version of the\nshoe is softer than the no blast 4 noas\n4 was a really good shoe uh because it\nwas really versatile the midso in it\nwasn't too soft it quite a big stack of\nmidell foam but it also was quite\nresponsive um and gave you quite a bit\nback it wasn't necessarily loads of\nenergy in the shoe it was just\nresponsive and and didn't sink in and\nand take away any energy so great shoe\nif you wanted to do a little bit faster\nsessions if maybe you're training for a\nmarathon you want to do your long runs\nin a shoe that a consistent Pace uh not\nnecessarily an easy Pace um but the Nova\nblast 5 it's this FF blast Max is is\nnoticeably softer than the Nova blast 4\num and I have a a mixed reaction to this\nshoe I have used it for um about 70k so\nfar uh and that's varied uh over various\na number of different runs on my during\nmy marathon training for Valencia so\nI've done easy runs in there I've done\ninterval sessions in it and I've done a\nlonger run in it and what I found is\nthat that mid sole it works sometimes\ndoesn't work other times um it it does\nfeel to me like it's on certain runs and\nspecifically um on those sort of\nconsistent Pace runs where you're maybe\nrunning at uh near your Tempo Pace or\nsomething like that it might it works\nquite well you sort of it gives you a\nlittle bit back there's not loads of\nenergy return in the shoe that I'm\ngetting from it um but it definitely\nfeels like it's a shoe that's designed\nfor a certain type of run I think\nideally it's it's a it's a shoe designed\nfor easier runs um it's definitely very\ncomfortable I really like that midsole\nwhen you when you're just like ticking\noff the miles and you want something\nthat gives you a little bit of bounce\nback but not loads um but just feels\nvery very comfortable on the feet on the\nother end of the spectrum when you're\nrunning faster in it I don't think this\nhas the versatility of the Nova blast 4\num so it's definitely a shoe that uh is\nis is a different experience than what\nyou you would get from the previous\nversion of the shoe um I think now it's\nvery much sits in that realm of daily\nshoes but but more for the easy runs as\nwell easy runs recovery runs maybe easy\nlonger runs where you want to just run\nat a consistent Pace um but definitely\nnot shoe that You' use for intervals or\nanything like that it just feels like\nsaps mind you a bit a little bit and and\nI sink in a little bit too much to the\nground when I'm trying to run a bit bit\nquicker so comparing these two shoes\nyou're probably going to look at buying\nthem for the same sort of thing and they\nare very similar in a lot of ways\nthey're really both shoes designed for\nthe easiest side of ticking off the\nmiles the um that sort of comfort aspect\nwhere you want to do a few runs uh maybe\ndoing 10ks 15ks 20ks um and you just\nwant to just go out there and and and\nget the miles done and you're not\nnecessarily doing any intervals or fle\ntraining or anything like that because\nthey they do they are a bit limited when\nit it comes to that they really sit on\nthat easy comfortable side of daily\nrunning shoes however having said that I\ndo think the tv14 has got a little bit\nmore to it I think that midell is just a\nbit more um resilient to running at a\nfaster Pace it just gives you a little\nbit more responsiveness back um and is\nprobably a better all around shoe um\nwhen it comes to ticking off all those\ndifferent types of runs that you'll do I\nthink the no blast 5 is solid shoe for\nComfort um I just don't think this is a\nversatile as the 10x v14 it's not\nthere's not a massive difference in it\nI'm not comparing a really fast\nversatile shoe with a a really slow uh\ndaily training shoe I'm comparing to\nvery similar daily training shoes but I\nthink the 108 v14 just just just gets a\nlittle bit more out out of it when\nyou're running at a faster Pace um and\nespecially if you're maybe doing Tempo\nsessions or something where you're\nrunning at a consistent pace which is\nprobably faster than your your normal um\neasy run Pace I think the tv14 is better\nfor that no blast 5 um I prefer the nol\nlast Forge because it was more versatile\nI think the no blast 4 was more\nversatile than the 1080 v14 um so\ndefinitely it really comes down to what\ntype of run you're doing and if you're\njust looking for Pure Comfort over those\nsort of easier runs as opposed to having\na shoe that you can do everything\nin other thing I'd say about these shoes\nis the outsole uh is very similar on\nboth of them actually there is a bit of\nexposed rubber on there um they're not\nthe best outsoles I've ever seen um I've\nnot had any issues in running in either\nof these shoes but the grip isn't\namazing it's quite smooth on the Node\nblast 5 and on the teny v14 it doesn't\nhave any major grip on it it's not like\npummer grip or something like that they\nit's fine I've not had any problems on\nit I've not been slipping around on the\nwet ground or anything like that but um\nI would say they're both fairly average\noutsoles on these shoes comes to run\nthese are two shoes that I did enjoy\ntesting this year I find them both\npretty impressive cushion daily trainers\nthat do offer you know a lot of foam\nunderfoot in terms of protection and\ncomfort but are still fairly light do\nhave fairly smooth rides that tick over\nwell so I have enjoyed running both of\nthese shoes this year tested the New\nBalance 1080 v14 first I wasn't a huge\nfan of the 1080 v13 which I just found a\nlittle bit too soft for my taste like it\nfelt like I was just kind of getting\nlost in the foam in it and the extra\nresiliency you have on the newer shoe I\nis something I certainly appreciate it\njust means I can roll through my foot\nstrike a bit more naturally and I get a\nbit more of a platform to push against\nwhether I'm running at easy Paces or\nfast Paces or anything like that I just\nfind it a more natural shoe to run in\nnow it disappears on the foot a lot more\nI do find it really comfortable you\nfairly versatile for a day train like\nthis it's not a shoe that I'd be using\nfor lots of fast runs myself but it is\nreasonbly versatile as a cushion shoe\nfor sure and I do think you've got a\nbetter foam in the New Balance than you\nhave in the no blast 5 I think you know\nthis version of fresh foam X which gets\nchanged all the time you never know\nexactly know what's going on with it but\nI do think you've got a bouncier feeling\na softer feeling than with the no blast\n5 which has got this new FF blast Max\nfoam which is good like it's a decent\nbalanced neutral foam it gives you some\ncomfort it gives you a little bit back\nif you're going to run at speed but\nmostly I think if you're going to try\nand use the nose blast or anything kind\nof faster the benefit you get with it is\nthat it's a pretty lightweight shoe a\nlittle bit lighter than the new balance\nand you've got a nice rocket there so\nyou can move through your footstrike\nquite smoothly at a range of paces and\nthe foam while soft and comfortable it\nagain isn't too soft just like with a\nnew balance so you can push against it\nand get a bit of pace there I found it's\nnot a shoe again that I'd be using for\nlots and lots of fast running myself but\nI do think know kind of newer Runners\nRunners who just want to cushion day\ntrain to do a nice range of runs both\nthese shoes do fit the bill pretty well\none thing I like about the not blast 5\ncompared to the previous version of the\nshoe is that they've shaved down this\nheel bevel a bit which gives it a\nslightly more natural rocker feeling\nfrom the back it's quite similar to the\none on the New Balance actually and as a\nhill Striker definitely appreciate that\nin both shoes it makes it feel a lot\neasier to roll through my foot strike\nand in a comfortable and kind of natural\nway so I did do a short run in both\nshoes at the same time and that for me\nwas when it was really apparent that the\nfoam I think on the new balance is\nbetter like before that very much I had\nquite similar feelings about B shoes I\nlike them they both had good Foams they\ndid a similar job but actually when I\nran in B at the same time I did really\nnotice the benefit of I think the better\nfoam in the New Balance 1080 with that\nFresh Foam X you've got softer feeling\nat the heel like I say and it does have\na bit more kind of lift off when it\ncomes to the toes you get a bit more\nbounce back and while I don't think that\nreally changes uh too much in terms of\nhow versatile these shoes are in\ncomparison to each other I do think it\ncreates a slightly nicer feeling on the\nrun it's a shoe I probably prefer even\nthough it's a little bit heavy it also\nfeels just a little bit nimbler and\nsmaller almost because there is still a\nlot going on at the back of the no blast\n5 but you do have that nice light\nfeeling with this shoe it does roll\nthrough well I think if I was picking\none of these to really try and pick up\nthe pace in I probably would still lean\ntowards the NOA blast but yeah I think\nthe ride on the 10804 is a little bit\nbetter and uh kind of more premium you\nget a slightly more premium feeling from\nthe better foam you have in the\nmidsole but then these are both capable\ndaily trainers at the more cushioned end\nboth probably do better at the slower\nand easier Paces than the faster end\nboth shoes can handle similar types of\nrun overall I think but if I had to\nchoose one shoe I think it would\nprobably be the Nova blast 5 based on a\ntouch more top Pace potential a bit more\nversatility as a result and the price\nit's just cheaper when I'm running with\nenergy than overlast 5 I think returns\nmore than you get with the 1080 v14\nhowever if all you want is a smooth ride\nfor your easy miles with guaranteed Road\nprotection and comfort New Balance 1080\nv14 offers that and it's very good at it\ntoo I can't kind of prefer the slower\nmiles in the 1080 but the no blast 5\njust Shades it for me on this one so if\nI had to pick between these two shoes I\nwould be going for this one now what I\nput that down to is that you know for me\nthey are designed for the same types of\nruns these are comfortable cushion daily\ntrainer shoes and given that this does\nit for less money than this shoe it\nmakes sense to go for this shoe I'd also\nsay this is probably going to be a more\naccommodating fit and shoe in general\nfor more people that's not to say that\n1080 v14 is going to work for a lot of\npeople as well too but I just think\ngiven you know what I've experienced in\nthe Nova blast 5 and you know\nprioritizing Comfort which both of these\nshoes do I think that you're going to\nget that Comfort here for less money on\nno blast 5 I think the biggest reasons\nto go for 10814 as I said it is a very\nsolid cushion daily train as well as I\nthink the bounce in this year which is\nmoderately bouncy has been more retained\nin my time in this shoe but I think for\nme the Comfort side of things and just\nbeing one not the the Lively bouncy\nnovablast shoe that I thought it was\ngoing to be is going to be a shoe that's\ngoing to be great for kind of handling\nshorter and longer runs that those easy\nto moderate places just like a 1080 v14\nbut it will do it for less money okay so\nmy ver on these two shoes is uh pretty\neasy um I think really uh it's the\ncomparison now really comes down to the\ntype of running that you're doing I\nthink that the 108 v14 is an all around\nbetter shoe I think it's a balanced\nsolid uh stable uh daily cushion shoe\nwhich can do a little bit more if if I\nwas a beginner and I wanted one pair of\nshoes and I might go out and do some\nfaster runs and maybe I'm training for\nsomething and I want some a shoe that\ncan allow me to just maybe do a bit more\nand I don't want to buy loads of other\nshoes for training i' go for the TT v14\nuh no blast 5 uh I think it's a solid\ncomfortable shoe but the problem with it\nis that uh unless you are the sort of\nRunner that isn't ever going to do\nanything faster um it's a bit limited um\nfor those sort of faster training\nsessions um so for me if it if I was to\npick one of these shoes I would\ndefinitely go for the 10v for\num but I don't think the no blast 5 is a\nbad sh I just think it's it's lessened\nthe um spectrum of what it can do at if\nyou could still pick up a version of the\nNova blast 4 I'd say that that is a\nsuperior shoe to both of these shoes I\nthink it's a far better shoe for most\nRunners um and just gives you a little\nbit more is a bit more versatile and you\ncan also look at shoes like maybe the\nsocony ride 17 which is a really solid\num daily shoe which isn't too expensive\nbut is is quite versatile as well so i'\nsay that's up there with the Nova blast\n4 wouldn't look at the trium 22 cuz I'm\nnot a fan of that shoe uh I don't think\nit's particularly well designed uh for\num easy runs or for uh more versatile\nfaster training so yeah I'm going for\nthe 108 v14 on this versus comes to the\nverdict I find the 1080 v14 and no blast\n5 pretty similar overall I think I've\nenjoyed them to a similar extent I think\nI'd be using them for the same kind of\nruns which like I say is mostly easy\nruns relaxed daily training long runs\nthat kind of thing both shoes do have a\nbit of Versatility to them if you are\nlooking for a cushion daily trainer\nprobably similarly versatile maybe the\noverlast 5 has a slight Edge there but\ndo think the overall ride feel is better\nin the 1080 v114 because of that uh\nbetter foam you have in the mid the\nFresh Foam X I think is just a livel\nfoam a nicer foam bit softer bit\nbouncier just a bit more fun to run in\nlike that said it's not an absolutely\nhuge and massive upgrade here on the\nnose blast VI like the price is very\nsimilar I'd probably look at picking up\nthe New Balance 1080 if I was looking\nfor a nice cushion daily trainer if I\nwas looking for a shoe to do quite a\nwide range of runs I'd probably get the\nno blast 5 anyway and it's also the\ncheaper shoe and you know in general as\nit is the cheaper shoe it's probably the\none I'd go for overall because like I\nsay I think they're mostly pretty simp\nIL in terms of performance if you're can\nto make a saving so was good to make a\nsaving and the overlast 5 you know does\na really good job it's a shoe I really\nlike it is a good cushion shoe I think\nthat will appeal to lots of Runners but\nif the price was equal I would look at\ngetting the 1080 v14 myself for the kind\nof runs I'd use it for those easy runs\nthose daily training runs I think the\nride is just a little bit better because\nof that nice phone in the\nmidso so you have it that's been our\nhead-to-head between the ax over blast 5\nand the New Balance 1080 v14 hope you\nfound it useful don't forget to hit like\nAnd subscribe do all that ring the bell\nto hear about more videos when we've got\ncoming up on the channel we got loads of\nhead to heads planned for both of these\nshoes so you'll know when those land if\nyou ring that Bell if you're interested\nin both these shoes I'm going to pop a\ncouple videos up on the channel now that\nyou should go and watch otherwise as\never thank you very much for stopping by\nand watching the videos and uh yeah in\nthe meantime until we see you again\nhappy running people",

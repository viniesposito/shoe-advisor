  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers I am Dan\nBrighton today and I've just done the\nBrighton 10K wearing the Hilo x1's uh so\nI'm going to go back now to my house and\nI will record the rest there cuz it's a\nbit windy it's a bit loud um and I'll\nget in people's way so I will see you in\nbit\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay so I am back now and I had a Fant\nfantastic day out at the Brighton 10K\nI've done it probably I think I've done\nit four times now um and I really like\nthis race it's just positioned right the\nperfect point of the year because a lot\nof people have finished the marathons\nthat they've been training for so you\nhave this down period where maybe you're\nnot training for your spring Marathon\nyet and you don't want to do loads of\nlong distance because you've got Bor of\nthat by training for the Autumn\nmarathons um it's a bit of a mix bag\nwhen it comes to weather because\nsometimes on the coast if you've ever\nbeen running down on the coast you'll\nknow that uh if the weather is bad then\nit really affects um the time and the\nspeed that you can run um and I've done\nquite a few 10K races uh around the same\narea as this and sometimes I get nowhere\nnear my PB because the wind and the the\nrain is is just making it impossible uh\nbut today was absolutely perfect there's\na little bit of a breeze but nothing\nthat would affect um winning a fast time\nand a lot of people I know who ran the\nrace got PBS so uh it was a really good\nday for it um and I always think that\nit's a good position in the year as well\nbecause a lot of people have trained for\nmarathons over uh the Autumn and now\nthey still have that Fitness um but\nthey're not tired from doing all of the\nlongdistance training so it's a really\nnice opportunity to sort of use all that\ntraining that you've done um with fresh\nlegs and start looking at some short\ndistance PBS the course is really nice\nit starts at HOV Lawns you do a little\nLoop um the other way uh towards like\nshorum way um but that's only like 1 km\nso you do 2 km around and then it goes\nall the way down to Madera Drive you\nturn around down there and you come back\ndead simple it does have closed roads on\nsome sections which is really good cuz\nit means you've got a lot of space\nsometimes when you do the races on the\ncoast there can be sections where it's\nquite congested and there are a lot of\npeople doing the race today um so with\nthese closed Road sections it makes it\nreally good you can go fast you can\novertake people and there's not really a\nlot of congestion at any point um of the\nrace it's organized by Brighton hve AC\nwhich is a great Renning Club down here\nin Brighton and it's really well\norganized so there are the the start\narea is fantastic you can very easily\nget into the area that you want to start\nrunning in there's loads of Pacers uh\nit's really well organized really well\nplanned very easy to get to um and just\na really well pulled together start area\num there's plenty of marshals on the\ncourse but it doesn't really need that\nmany because it's such a simple course\num and it's pretty hard to go the wrong\nway or uh need any assistance along the\nway so uh well worth checking out if\nyou're coming down to the coast or you\nlive down here uh definitely one of my\nfavorite short distance races um around\nthe Brighton area just because some of\nthem are a bit more expensive this is uh\nthe 2024 edition cost uh 20 about \u00a325\nwhich is really good considering you get\na medal um you get to run around the\ncentral pit of Brighton that's got\nclosed off sections you get Flap Jack\nwater bananas other food and stuff\nafterwards so it's a really nice uh\nlarge scale feeling event that isn't as\nexpensive some of the other events that\nyou can find um in the UK um which are\nquite high profile so it's good event um\ntoday was I said really good weather for\nit sometimes you can get really lucky in\nBrighton and the weather conditions are\nabsolutely perfect this is one of those\ndays there were loads of PBS um from\npeople who are running the race in fact\nI think most of the people I know that\nthat that took part ended up getting a\nPB so well done to all of you guys it's\nalso a race that attracts a lot of quite\nhigh level Runners so a lot of the\nrunning clubs take part in this it's\norganized by Brighton ho Athletics Club\nso it's uh a bit of a meeting of a lot\nof the running clubs in the area but\nalso outside the area as well there were\nso many fast Runners at the start um but\nalso more General Runners as well\nbecause it's a nice place to go to if\nyou're looking to do 10K and you want to\nspend the rest of the day in a nice city\num and see some of the sites going to\nhave an ice cream that sort of thing so\nall in all it was a really good race so\nmy performance today was actually really\nreally good I was I was quite surprised\nbecause I went out last night uh to a\ngig and um I've also not done a 10k race\nfor quite a long time so um I have no\nidea what my speed would be like of a\n10K distance I actually expected to\nstruggle to get um under 40 minutes for\nthe 10K but uh I started off and I\nbasically just went all out from from\nthe start I almost ran a 5k PB at the 5K\nMark and I just held on for the rest of\nthe race so I ended up getting a 37 uh\n45 which is um 10 seconds off my PB from\nlast year which is on a similar course\nso really pleased with that because I\nwas not expecting to have that level of\nspeed um at the moment I actually felt\npretty good by the end of it so that\nbodess pretty well for for Valencia uh\nnext week um but hopefully I've got the\nthe stamina as well as the speed as well\nso that I think it's going to be the\nstamina that lets me down during\nValencia but all in all it's a really\ngood race well worth doing uh if you're\nlooking for a race around that time of\nyear but also if you're just looking for\na nice 10k race that um is in a location\nthat you can come and visit and um you\ncan spend the day there\nso the kit that I was testing today um\nI'm a bit of a late coming to this but\nuh recently I've been testing the Hawker\ncellow X1 now the reason I've been\ntesting these is because we're doing the\nawards in the next few weeks and this is\na shoe that um I wanted to test in order\nto make sure that when we did the voting\non the shoes I had a good understanding\nof the shoe because everything I've\nheard about it from the rest of the\ntesters and other people is that it's a\nvery very good shoe and a sort of shoe\nthat I uh would probably like um so I've\nused this for about 40K now um I've done\na longer run in it I've done an interval\nsession in it and now I've done a race\nin it and I really really liked it for\nthe interval session and for that race\num what I would say about the shoe is\nthat it is for me it's a bit of a mix um\nof something like the so endorphin Elite\nand something a little bit um more\nrelaxed like the most comfortable um\nbouncy shoe around like something like\nso endorphin Pro 3 which is a very\nnatural feeling shoe very comfortable to\nrun in uh very unobtrusive I do think\nthis is a slightly more Awkward shoe you\ncan really feel it pushing your foot\ninto position it does feel a little bit\nmore aggressive when you're running in\nit um but I found it absolutely\nfantastic on that run today uh I wasn't\nexpecting to enjoy it that much cuz I\nhaven't really tried that many race\nshoes this year that I've been really\nimpressed with things like the Ali 3 I\ndidn't really like and at the moment I'm\ntrying to choose my shoe for Valencia so\nit's a bit of tossup at the moment but I\nthink this is probably one of the\noptions that I'm going to go for um for\nValencia um just because I think it\nworks very well with my running style I\nlike the level of foam that's in here um\nI like the aggressiveness in it it's not\ntoo aggressive so the Endorphin Elite\nthat shoe I got my half marathon PB in\nit is very aggressive it makes me run\nvery fast but there's no way I can run a\nmarathon in that shoe it's just too\nuncomfortable for my feet it just feels\nlike it's pushing my foot into a\nposition that I don't want it to be in\num but it it does feel propulsive this\nfeels like a slightly less versions of\nthat so I didn't feel uncomfortable at\nall on the run that I did today um and\nI've done a longer run in it and it\nabsolutely fine um so I think this may\nbe the shoe for Valencia but I'm still\nstill deciding if that's going to be the\ncase um but over the course of that run\nthe first 5k I did I did pretty much at\nmy 5K pace so um I was going all out on\nit it felt very quick on that at that\npace um really helped me pick up the\npace nicely um and just felt very\nefficient the kind of feeling that I\nassociate with shoes like the vaporfly 2\nthings like that that really just make\nthat that fast pace feel easier and you\ncan maintain it for long\num the second half of the race which the\nbit I was struggling a little bit out I\nstill managed to maintain it under 4\nminute kmers um but still felt very good\nat that as well I definitely didn't feel\nlike um it was a problem as I slowed\ndown a little bit it definitely felt\nlike I had a bit consistent propulsion\nin it and it was helping me just tick\nover U at that pace Up Until the End uh\nand then in the last kilometer I picked\nit up again and it felt really good for\nthat as well so really impressed with\nthis shoe off of that race um I was\nalready quite impressed impress of it\nfrom the interval session I did it the\nother day but I think for race for race\nthere I think this is a really really\ngood option at the moment and definitely\ngood for this the sort of running that I\nlike to do uh when I'm racing um because\nI just I don't want it too aggressive\nbut I do want to have a little bit of\nproportion in there that sort of forces\nme to to speed up as well um the other\nthing I'd say as well is that um it it's\nnot unstable uh I wouldn't say it's the\nmost stable shoe around but I didn't\nfeel like it was necessarily unstable uh\nthere's certain shoes like the A6 met\nspeed Sky Paris which um I really like\nthat shoe I was it's the other shoe that\nI might choose for Valencia I'm still\ndeciding between these two um but I\nreally like the shoe uh but it's\nprobably a little bit more unstable feel\nis a little bit thinner on the feet than\nthis shoe so there's a bit more to this\nshoe and if feels a little bit wider so\num big fan of this shoe from that from\nthat run looking forward to doing some\nmore runs in it and then maybe using it\nfor blena the other thing I tested today\nwhich uh I really liked is these monkey\nsocks now we talked about monkey socks\non the channel before um and they're in\num some of the guides that we've done\nover the past few months um and I've\nI've only just got around to to giving\nthem a test uh and they're really really\nnice they just have a really um a good\nlevel of padding in them they do feel\nquite padded uh but when you're wearing\nthem with a race shoe they don't feel\nreally thick so I do have some running\nsocks that I would never wear with a\nshoe like the uh cellow X1 because it's\nreally hard to get the clo X1 on it's a\nvery tight fitting shoe um so it once\nyou've got it on but it's hard to get it\non um and if I was wearing really really\nthick padded socks I think I'd struggle\neven more um so this these socks are\nthey just a really good balance really\nuh I know these haven't been opened yet\nI I put my other ones in the wash um but\nthese they just a really good balance\nthey they've got padding in them they\nfeel very comfortable to wear but they\nalso feel lean enough to wear with with\nra shoes and things like that as well uh\nthey also I like the design of them\ndon't normally talk about the design of\nthings but I do like the design of these\nquite a lot so um yeah big fan of these\nmonkey socks um and looking forward to\nusing them more okay so that's it from\nme from the Brighton 10K thanks a lot\nfor watching don't forget to like\nsubscribe click that little bell and big\nthanks to all the people that came up to\nme and talked about the channel uh it\nwas really nice to meet you all and talk\nabout your race I think some of you did\nquite good times today as well so\ncongratulations to all of you who who\ncame to speak to me um right I will\ncatch you later\n[Music]",

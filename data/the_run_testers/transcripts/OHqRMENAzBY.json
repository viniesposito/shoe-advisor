  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand in this latest video breaking down\nthe best running watches you can buy\nright now we're looking at high-end\nrunning watches from each of the big\nBrands including Garmin coros Po and\nsunto we're going to be talking about\ntopof the range watches here that tends\nto mean devices with the best specs\nbiggest battery lives along with the\nmost comprehensive Suites of features\nfor training navigation and Smartwatch\ntools now many of these premium running\nwatches pack bigger higher quality\nscreens they also have the latest sensor\nand Hardware more rugged build with\nramped up durability often they're using\nmore premium materials like sapphire\ncrystal displays and titanium or\naluminium cases to be more resilient but\nalso to give them a more stylish finish\nand to offset the size in a bid to stay\nlighter on the wrist these are the\nwatches that increasingly come with eye\nwatering price tags too we're talking\nrunning watches costing north of 500\ngenerally and some getting perly close\nto ,000 pounds now we've tested and\nconsidered names you might recognize\nfrom the Phoenix the Enduro from Garmin\nto the Vantage V3 and the grit X2 Pro\nfrom Polar the choros vertic two s is in\nthere and I caught up with run testers\nNick and Mike to get into the pros and\ncons and to pick our favorite so watch\non to find our top picks of the best\nhigh-end running\nwatches so then we're going to kick off\nwith the Garmin and in this we've got\nthe Garmin 03 we've got the Garmin\nPhoenix 8 with all its Myriad options\nbetween solar and AMOLED and we've got\nthe Garmin 4Runner 965 Nick do you want\nto kick us off with the first of these\nlet's have a look at the Phoenix 8 to\nbegin with why is this one made it to\nthe list and I think I guess we should\naddress the fact that there are lots of\ndifferent options within this category\nas well yeah I think we've all tested\nthe Phoenix 8 AMOLED there were three\ndifferent sizes we actually all tested\nthe largest size I think but you're\ngetting a similar experience across the\nAMOLED ranges and then the solar ranges\nprobably are more similar to the Phoenix\n7 Pro and the Enduro 3 but with all\nGarmin in this highend category you're\ngetting some features here that you just\ndon't get from other watches and Garmin\nhas been I think quite dominant in the\nhighend category for quite a while as a\nresult because it has I think the best\nnavigation tools it's got exceptional\nmaps with loads of nifty features like\nKlein Pro you're getting really\nintensive training analysis which is the\nsame across these three Gins and then\nthe phoenix8 then stands out by having a\nmic and speaker and a dive proof design\nnew user interface that you're also\ngetting the uro 3 but not on the 4un 965\nI don't think it's kind of an in between\nan old 4Runner and a Phoenix Software\nbut yeah the Phoenix 8 is the top watch\nin the line now with the AMOLED or the\nnon AMOLED option with those extra\nSmartwatch features and that's basically\nwhat Garmin is creating with the Phoenix\nI think is the aiming for the ultimate\nWatch the watch that can do everything\nyou've got the best sports tracking they\noffer the best navigation the best\ntraining analysis the best smart\nfeatures they offer Allin one watch at\nan incredibly high price but you're\ngetting everything and it does stand\napart I think from the crowd within the\nsport watch Arena because of that it's\njust whether it stands apart enough to\njustify you know spending the extra on\nit compared to other high-end watches or\neven older watches we have picked this\nas one of our best watches of the year\nso clearly it's a standout but Mike\nwithin that kind of feature package what\nis it that you think sets it truly apart\nfrom the watch like the Enduro Al the\nfour and a 965 I think it's it's\nfundamentally giving you the best of\nwhat Garmin has to offer that's ultim\nand if that is what you want from a\nrunning watch then ultimately this is\nthe watch that's going to give it to you\nand I think we've spoken about the fact\nthat you know with this move to Amo\ndisplays you know that compromise you\nultimately may think you you you're kind\nof making on kind of full kind of\nfully-fledged SmartWatches that have am\ndisplays you're not really making that\nwith the Garmin Phoenix a and if you are\ngoing for the solar charging version as\nwell what we're seeing with that is that\nyou know G is able to kind of you know\nenhance and improve the ability of that\ntechnology as well too so there's\nInnovation happening in the Phoenix\nrange as well as well as kind of\nconsolidating it's already done very\nwell in its Phoenix watching watches you\nknow giving you that very good core\nexperience but ultimately making sure\nthat you're you know you're not making a\nlot of compromises here and that's\nultimately why it's going to really\nstood out for us I I suppose then the\nstep up on something like the 4965 is\nthe design you're getting this steel or\ntitanium watch a really rugged watch of\na sapphire screen if you get the\nSapphire model and you know it's heavier\nit's biger but it gives you that more\nAdventure proof watch and then compared\nto uro 3 gin hasn't brought the smarts\nto that and you don't necessarily get\nquite the top end experience of the\nPhoenix 8 well still getting a top end\nexperience but he's almost like gar is\ntrying to give you those three options\nand then Juro 3 then extends the battery\nlife a little bit although fenix8 is\npretty much a monster on that front as\nwell but yeah there's like it's like\nthree little niches Within These\nhigh-end watches for G you've got the\nlightweight 965 that's a bit cheaper\nlike much lighter much smaller very\ngeared up for lots of sport and then the\nmore adventurous Phoenix and uro and\nthen the Phoenix then adds in all those\nsmarts as well I guess at times when you\nactually sit down to kind of review this\nand you go through the list of features\nand how comprehensive it is for the\nPhoenix 8 there is so much that you\ncould kind of test and compare for me\nthe standout thing for the Phoenix 8 was\ngetting battery life that you're not\nsacrificing too much for that AMOLED\ndisplay which has always been a bit of a\nconsideration for me but running them\nside by side at the uro 3 and the\nPhoenix 8 AMOLED 51 mil there wasn't\nreally that much difference in terms of\nthe sort of weekly training drop off now\nif we move on to the Enduro I think one\nthing I do like about the Enduro is the\nsort of slightly more lightweight build\nthat it just feels a little bit more\ncomfortable on the wrist if you're\nlooking for all of those kind of mapping\nand navigation you're looking for that\nkind of full Suite of of tools outside\nof the Smartwatch tools but you want\nsomething that's kind of lighter and\nslightly more easy to wear 24/7 with a\nlittle bit of extra battery life that's\nwhere the Enduro really has the appeal\nfor me I don't personally necessarily\nhave to have the AMOLED screen I think\nit's a really nice to have so if you're\nwilling to forgo that and you don't mind\nhaving some of the extra Smartwatch\nsmarts the voice activation the uh The\nVoice tools the voice notes all of that\nkind of stuff then I think the Enduro at\nthe price actually now kind of for me\nrepresents potentially the best value\nGarmin in within this kind of top end\nbracket yeah I think Garmin did exactly\nwhat they needed to do with the uro line\nwith the third version they kind listen\nto what people want from the uro people\nwant that battery life they want a\nrugged but ideally lightweight design\nthey're not looking for smarts I think\nthey could even go further with the uro\n4 and strip out music entirely and\nthings like that and just really focus\non you know Maps battery life accuracy\nyou know reliability in tough conditions\nand then they brought the price down\nwhich you just don't see anywhere you\nknow watch is certainly not with the\nPhoenix 8 so yeah I think thejo 3 was a\na real you know win for the year for\nGarmin because it did all those things\nwhich is the right thing to do for that\nline and actually now makes it different\nto the Phoenix where I think the\nprevious model was kind of oh it's like\nthe Phoenix 7x plus you know now it's\ndifferent and then obviously we've got\nquite a drop down to the Garmin 4 and a\n965 in terms of\nprice Mike what what kind of things\nwould people be buying the 965 for over\nand above the other two I think\nfundamentally what you look at at 965\nand we've talked about design and it's\nyou know if you are not the kind of\nperson that wants this kind of big\nhulking watch on your wrist but you want\nthe functionality of a phoenix or an\ninjury that's ultimately what you're\ngetting you're obviously getting the am\ndisplay was the first one of the first\nGarmin Foreigner watches to have an Amal\ndisplay as well too and despite it being\nan older watch it still very much kind\nof holds up and I think will hold up for\na lot of people in terms of the level of\ntraining and the mount you know they're\ngoing to be using this watch it's giving\nyou that good mix of Smartwatch and\nsports watch and running watch\nfunctionality now it is running on\nslightly older software which uh you\nwe're now seeing on the new Phoenix and\nthe injo 3 and you know fundamentally\nwon't be roll backed but I don't think\nin ter in essence you are going to be or\na lot of people are going to be missing\nmuch from what we're seeing from those\nchanges with those two watches and I\nthink if you wanted things like mapping\nand navigation that you're going to get\non those more expensive watches and I'm\ngoing to play very good again core run\ntracking experience and that kind of mix\nof Smartwatch and sports watch and\nthat's kind of what the 965 is going to\ngive you in a slightly less durable\ndesign But ultimately at probably a more\nlikable um price that's you\nfundamentally is going to probably be a\nlot more affordable going forward as\nwell too so you're sacrificing the\nscreen's not quite as um as durable as\nyou'll find on the the Phoenix 8 and the\nEnduros right but you'll also sacrifice\nquite a chunk in battery life I think\nthe max accuracy battery life for the 4\nand a 965 19 hours in that mode so a big\ndrop actually that's one of the I think\nfor me is one of the major sacrifices if\nyou're going to come down to this I do\nthink for some people this will be a\nwatch that has a styling that'll appeal\nmore to them than the kind of big Hench\nkind of rugged looks of the adventure\nwatches and I think it's actually a\nreally goodlook watch it's it's one of\nmy favorite within the 4Runner range\nNick what what do you think yeah I love\nthis watch and I would say on the\nbattery live drop off I think that\nreally differentiates it between them\nbecause I think if you're looking at\nday-to-day use the 965 last pretty good\nit's like six or seven days as named\nwatch it's that single activity where\nprobably You're Expecting the people who\nare looking at those Ultras to be\nlooking at the more rugged watches that\nthen have that single activity you know\nmassive time even in the most accurate\nmode like the Enduro and the Phoenix and\nthat's kind of different the 4 965 feels\nmuch more like you know more a marathon\nas watch you know doing lots of training\nyou want a lightweight watch it's still\ngot the biggest screen the same size\nscreen in a in a small design I love it\nit's probably the one I prefer at all of\nthem because it is so lightweight and I\nhave skinny wrists and stuff like that\nbut yeah and what you lose you know you\ndo lose on that single activity but day\nto-day the battery life drop off is\nstill there because the Enduro and the\nphoenix8 now lasts so long but for the\nsize of watch you get a pretty good kind\nof day today amount of use out of it and\njust really yeah feels like a Road\nRunner's Watch you know I have scratched\nthe screen and running an ultra vit and\nI did Venture onto the trails with it\nbut only a little scratch it's still\nusable but you do you do sacrifice that\nkind of thing with it but you get a lot\na much lighter watch that's easier to\nsleep with for sure so that's the Gins\nwe've also got two polers on this list\nwe've got the polar Vantage V3 which was\nthe first uh polar to bring an AMOLED\nscreen and then we've got the polar grit\nX2 Pro obviously a slightly more rugged\ndesign essentially what you're getting\nwith these two watches is the same Suite\nof uh software and features and tracking\nacross kind of your training performance\nnavigation and the kind of slightly\nlimited sort of Smartwatch tools that\nyou'll get you're just differentiating\nthese by the design the build the\nmaterials and the battery life so Mike\ngive us a quick run through of uh how\nyou kind of split these two up if people\nare thinking about them well I think you\nkind of mentioned it there I think I\nthink which which is good actually and\nwhat we're seeing in Polo's range\nparticularly this year is that it's\nreally trying to offer a consistent\nsoftware experience across its watches\nwhich I think you know that's something\nthat you want to see you want to see as\nmuch as you see in that kind of Cheaper\nwatch you do in these kind of more High\nyou know expensive high-end watches so\nyou know it's h it's playing a bit of\ncatch up ultimately in terms of the\ncompetition so you know we're finally\ngetting kind of mapping the M mapping\nsupport we've kind of wanted\nfrom these watches you're obviously\ngetting the Amed display there as well\ntoo and ultimately giving you that as we\ntalked about that battery life that you\nknow feels like it's it's worth having\nam a display and you're not having you\ncharging it on a regular basis I think a\nlot of things that polar has doing\nreally well outside of its um kind of\nrun you know core run tracking\nexperience which is very good and very\nsolid overall I think we've we've all\nkind of shared a very good experience\nwith it is that it starting to look a\nlittle bit more you know from a training\nanalysis point of view looking in terms\nof recovery you know looking a little\nbit more on sleep I I think for me it's\nprobably the most reliable in terms of\nsleep tracking you know no device is\nperfect from that point of view but I\nthink in terms of running watches I\nfound for me personally the the sleep\ntracking has been very good in terms of\nusing that information to guide you in\nterms of you know recommendations you\nknow there's a lot happening from the\ntraining analysis point of view I think\nultimately you are just looking at the\ndesigns from these two watches very as I\nsaid it's it's very much about being\nthat having that consistent experience\nfrom a software point of view and a\nperformance as well too you obviously\ngetting that new Elixir um kind of\nsensor array which for me I don't think\nit's quite delivered that you know\nupping in kind of performance overall\nbut I think in terms of it bringing in\nnew metrics that Polo can look at from a\nday-to-day basis and allow that to\ninform what you you know better and\nguide you in terms of what you should do\nand what your data might be telling you\nI think you know it's a step in the in\nthe right direction for Polar ultimately\nand that's kind of what we've seen with\nthe vage V3 and the kind of more rugged\ngrit X2 Pro and we've also got a little\nbit of boosted durability with the grit\nX2 Pro obviously it's a built to be that\nkind of more rugged in some ways it's\nsort of designed to feel like a\ncompetitor to the Phoenix 8 but maybe\ndoesn't have that kind of full capacity\nor full capability that that watch does\nNick if you're thinking about the\ndifferences between these two what what\nare the preferences that you found\nwithin the Vantage V3 or the polar git\nX2 Pro that would sort of make you\nchoose one of these above the other yeah\nit is really that difference design it's\nit's a bit like the 4 a 965 versus the\nPhoenix 8 you've got that lighter\nVantage I think it's a nice design for\nme it's not so chunky on the wrist it's\nmaybe a little bit less durable but it's\nstill you know pretty pretty long I not\nany problems with durability on the\nPolar I think other than that kind of\nbuild quality and this little bit\nticking battery life with the uh with\nthe gex pro it's it's really very much\nthe same experience and that is a little\nbit you know good thing but I do think\nthat is where polar lacks a little bit\nin this high-end category is that the\nit's a bit slightly tired I think their\nuser interface and their General\nsoftware I think needs a bit of a\nrefresh just slightly award watches to\nuse a little bit more than other brands\nwhich are updating quite a lot quicker I\nthink they're releasing software updates\nand there lot of little things I find\nwhen I use a polar watch that are just a\nlittle bit harder to do than on other\nsports watches um so I do think uh they\nthey need to catch up a little bit on\nthat and refresh it a little bit and\nlike I said I think problem more I think\nthey have now is they've really got the\nfundamentals in place now the maps are\nthere they they've now got accurate dual\nband GPS which they didn't have or they\nintroduced it with the ignite line and\nthey've got you know an impressive\nbackup software system that people have\nliked for a long time in poaf flow I\nthink they do need to refresh that as\nwell a little bit though but I do think\nthey don't have all the features that g\noffering and they are resolutely\nsticking to quite high prices polar and\nI think that is their problem in this\nhigh end category is if you go\ntoe-to-toe with the Phoenix 8 or you\nknow even the Phoenix 7 frankly you've\ngot to produce the goods and I still\nthink they're struggling on that front a\nlittle bit other things there are some\nfeatures that I think that are quite\nunique to PO that I really like you know\nI like the fuel wise fueling\nrecommendations for sort of planning and\nracing strategy particularly for Ultra I\nthink it kind of simplifies that process\nI quite like Hill splitter as a feature\nwhere you get to see your you know your\nHill um segments broken down after the\nevent to see your climbing descents and\nyour speeds and that broken down there\nare little bits of kind of unique kind\nof polar features which I think are\nsmattered in there but overall it does\nfeel they are like they're a little bit\nlightweight and I think that also\ntranslates over into the Smartwatch\ntools you know you're there's no offline\nmusic it's got music controls and\nthere's just a few bits that at these\nprice points you now kind of expect to\nhave yeah and and the battery life is\nvery good for singal activities but they\nthey polar Watchers just do drain fast\noutside this activity so even if you you\nknow can go and knock out one of these\nMega Ultras you run Kieran you're still\ngoing to have to charge it you know\nevery five six seven days so um it's\nyeah that that I think that longevity\ndoesn't you know help with the kind of\nagain comparisons to other brands which\nis that's the hard thing of all these\nthings like you're being compared to\nvery best watches in this price bracket\nso it's hard there's one other thing\nwhich I've noticed as well which I only\nspotted this time around polar when you\nget to 9% it stops you doing a workout\nright yeah that's bad that's really\nannoying yeah yeah that's really\nannoying so you've already got 90%\ncapacity it might be I want I want to go\nback and ask them whether or not the\nbattery life estimates are based on that\n90% equals the amount they've they've\nclaimed otherwise you're just losing but\nanyway that's a bit that's a bit\nannoying they kind of just slowly shut\nthings down and stop you using it a\ncertain point 9% on the ver on the vertx\n2 is like three or four days well yeah I\nme this yeah yeah exactly you can still\ngo for long so anyway yeah speaking of\nthe vertx 2 we do have the choros vertx\n2 s on the list now I think one of the\nmain things about this when it first\ncame out was we thinking going to get a\nmore compact vertex but the S doesn't\nmean small what it probably means is\nthat it's done a small step up from the\nvertic to so it's pretty much the same\nwatch we've lost Mike Kieran we've going\nto make that clear now Mike's gone he uh\nhe will not talk about these last two\nwatches he ran out of battery ironic\ngiven the watch you're about to discuss\nactually he's he's out of battery we we\ncan't record again we've got to go I\nthought he threw his mic against the\nwall and just strolled out he's done\nenough two watches left to go we've got\nthe coros vertx 2s got the sunto rose C\nup the coros verx 2s I think one of the\nmain things to say about this straight\noff the bat is when it first came out\nthe S we all thought was going to mean\ncor was going to produce a slightly more\ncompact rugged watch which I know a lot\nof people would actually like they want\nsome of the same features they want the\nsame rugged build but in something that\nfeels a bit lighter on the wrist that is\nnot what happened the S kind of stands\nfor in my head like a small step on from\nthe chorus vertic too but essentially\nwhat you're getting is pretty much the\nsame with a few upgrades Nick what are\nthose what are those key upgrades that\nwe've got just a little accuracy boost\nyou know mainly in the GPS the vertex 2\nwas I think the first multiband watch we\ntested certainly the first one I tested\nseemed like it was be very exciting\ndidn't really deliver the kind of GPS\nleap that I was hoping for they then saw\nwith things like Garmin watches and\nsunto watches and now vertx 2s is a very\naccurate multiband watch on GPS I think\nthe heart rate accuracy was meant to\nimprove as well I didn't notice that so\nmuch in my testing um and other than\nthat you have pretty much the same kind\nof package and that is one thing corus\ndoes across his whole range is you get\nthe same kind of package in all of its\nwatches uh really like even right down\nto the PACE Pro and the pace 3 you're\ngoing to get very similar kind of\ntraining analysis and software it's just\nthe vertx 2s is the Beast the one that\ncan survive in all conditions take it up\nmountains Smash It repeatedly against\nrocks and nothing will happen and and\nthen Mega battery life right I think I\nis this the most long-lasting it's just\nfor me it did Outlast the injo and\ntesting but it's it's pretty close but\nit's crazy longlasting isn't it it's got\nyou'll get 43 hours for this in Max\naccuracy mode so it's not quite in Duro\nbut it's still really good and if you\nput yeah it's one of those if you stick\nit in a Cupboard it's got that Nokia\nthing where it just won't die the other\nthing it the battery life actually does\ncome down a little bit against the\nvertic to which is interesting they've\nlost a little bit like other things that\naren't here obviously there's offline M\nor something there is here but there's\noffline music but it's a bit of a faf\nthere's no support for Spotify or dieser\nif you're looking for those things\nthat's a bit of a question there is no\nflashlight as well so if you're thinking\nabout being out there hasn't got that\nGAR kind of fedix sort of flashlight but\nit's a solid solid kind of reliable\nwatch for the most part I yeah I really\nlike it is definitely a step on for me\nfrom the vertic 2 though again I think\nif you want you know you can look back\nfor deals of the vertic 2 and you're\nprobably not going to be that\ndisappointed yeah I I think it's it's\nit's good one I think what you're\ngetting in terms of value with the\nvertic to us is incredible materials\nlike it does come in a bit cheaper than\nyou know the other watches in this\ncategory if you're looking at titanium\nSapphire models in particular unless you\nfind what is on the sale and yeah I just\nthink it doesn't really offer the same\nfull experience you get from Garmin in\nparticular you can certainly find\nprevious models of the Phoenix and that\nkind of thing at the same kind of price\nthat that that I think it's just a\nstruggle here I think corus is much more\ncompetitive at the lower area but if you\nare this is a really good watch it does\nthe job it's very Hardy it's longlasting\nlike again this is one that on\nday-to-day battery life will just\nOutlast other watches because it doesn't\ndo so much in between activities and you\nknow it's really good watch deserves its\nplace in this category but it's one that\nI think the full package isn't there to\ncompete with G you've got Maps but the\nnavigation tools aren't as good you've\ngot music but you can't link up to\nSpotify like you say so you always end\nup I always end up finding like albums\nfrom when I had digital files so in my\nteam it's like the Arcade Fire like\noriginal album gets brought out to test\nand stuff like that so not quite there\non those kind of features but there on\naccuracy long lasting and rugged design\nI guess last but not least we have the\nsunto race which I think in many ways as\nout choros choros and what it does you\nknow it's coming with a really good all\nround package you know outad screen dual\nfrequency GPS it's not the lightest\nwatch but it's got quite you know sort\nof nice s premium build and it comes in\na really competitive price point which\nis dropping even in the deals as we\nspeak which is making it even more you\nknow difficult to dismiss again it's not\nthe most fully featured it's not the\nmost capable watch on this list there\nare gaps uh the UI I think for the\nsoftware it's not as smooth or as easy\nto use as some of the other devices but\nwhen you start to factor in the price\nand what you're getting turning this\nwatch down is becoming more and more\ndifficult right yeah I mean we gave suo\nlike they didn't win brand of the year\nor get runner up in our recent Awards\nbut they got a nod because they just\nbrought out really cheap amazing watches\nand it's like the thing that we've been\ncrying out for Browns to do is like you\ncan't go toe-to-toe with Gino features\nbecause they've been doing it a lot\nlonger and they're just nailing all\nthese features so you need to pick some\nfeatures the essentials the key ones\nnail those coming at a lower price and\nthat's how you compete and it's exactly\nwhat sunto did they got incredible GPS\naccuracy like really good multi accuracy\nthey've got good maps on there they've\ngot good training analysis it's really\nlike very much the training Peaks style\ntraining analysis that's familiar to\nlots of people and it's a watch that\nit's not actually my personal style but\nI can see it's a good-looking watch and\nsome people really like the look of it\nwith that kind of beveled like metal\nring and a really really you know rugged\ndesign at that lower price so it's\nticking a lot of key features and really\ngood B life as well I think both in\nterms of single use and day-to-day use\nit is like going to do the job so if\nyou're looking for a really focused\nwatch in all those key areas which are\nmy key areas like I'm not so worried\nabout the music and stuff like that then\nit does it really well and sunto has\nstarted to really up the pace of its\nupdates to improve things like things\nlike the little bits of lag they had in\nthe software and in general just little\ncomplaints there are certainly still\ncomplaints with the UI for sure the way\nthey do things like guided workouts is\nbeyond me I don't know why they do it\nlike that but it's all there and it's\nnow really competitive price again less\ncompetitive when you start looking at\nreduced garments but you know on RP it's\nthe one that is offering tremendous\nvalue in this category and it's just\nit's just great to see Brown doing this\nbecause we I think we agree this is what\nyou what have to do like until you can\nput the years of work Garmin has put\ninto all these features to make them\nvery easy to use and all their smarts\nand stuff you've got to try and compete\nin other ways and price is one of them\nit was a welcome return for sunto like a\nbit of a return to form in many ways\nit's kind of brought them back into the\nequation they desperately needed\nsomething and I think with the you know\nthis and the the race s which is the\nsmaller one there we should also say\nthere is a titanium version of this so\nyou can go even more kind of Premium\nmaterials if you want to and a bit more\ndurability and kind of rugged build if\nyou want to sort of scale up for that\nbut they've they've definitely kind of\nrein inserted themselves into the\nconversation in a way that I think is\nreally commendable and hopefully we're\ngoing to see more from them so there you\nhave it that's been our Deep dive into\nthe best high-end watches the premium\nwatches those top price watches that you\ncan buy from all the brands hope you\nfound it useful give us a like if so if\nyou're not already subed to the channel\nwhy not get stuck into that if you're\nafter a more affordable watch I'm going\nto pop our guide to those sort of more\nwallet friendly watches up on the\nchannel right now go and take a look at\nthat otherwise thanks for stopping by\nand until next time happy running people",

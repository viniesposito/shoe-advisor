  "text": "hey Tommy for the Run testers with\nanother running shoe versus in this\nvideo we are going to be looking at the\nnew Balan 10v 14 and the sakon Triumph\n22 let's have a look at what we all\n[Music]\nthought the New Balance 1080 v14 costs\n\u00a3160 or\n$164.99 it weighs \u00a3287 G or 10.1 Oz for\nmen in a size 8 and the drop is 6 mm the\nso 22 cost \u00a3170 or $160 it weighs 306 G\nor 10.8 o for men in a size 8 and the\ndrop is 10\n[Music]\nmm the New Balance 1080 v14 is a daily\nshoe built for comfort and accessibility\nin the previous version of the shoe New\nBalance modified the fresh FX midsole to\nbe noticeably softer but with that came\na dip in the stability and the\nversatility of the shoe the Tennesse v14\naddresses that with a slightly f version\nof the foam and the overall Mido\ngeometry in addition there's an updated\nengineered mesh upper to improve the fit\nand provide better breathability that\nalso includes a good level of padding as\nwell as a soft gusseted tongue on the\noutsole is a modest layer of rubber\nacross the key areas of the shoe\nalthough this doesn't cover the full\nlength of the midell foam the sagon\ntrium 22 sees some major updates to the\nline the biggest of those is a new\npoweron PB foam midsole a peber based\nmaterial replacing the poweron plus\nfound in the Triumph 20 1 that aims to\nimprove cushioning energy return and\nresponsiveness the same phone is used in\nthe sakon Endorphin Pro 4 and speed 4\nthere's also an updated upper that's\ndesigned to be even plusher and more\ncomfortable than its predecessor and a\nnoticeably wider base across the full\nlength of the shoe to improve stability\non the out soole there's a generous\nlayer of rubber to provide grip and\nprotect the midsole\nphone I ran in my regular UK running\nsize which is 8 and 1 half that is a\nnine in New Balance in the\nus first thing I when I first put them\non is they do feel quite snug this is a\nclose fitting shoe I find all New\nBalance shoes nowadays can be a little\nbit problematic on sizing I have to work\nquite hard to make sure I get the right\nsize but having run these in overall I\nthink there's just about enough room\nthere's a decent sort of bit of room at\nthe end of the toe box there's a nice\nkind of amount of wiggle room across the\ntop here and the flexible up has really\nhelped out the only point I really find\nthey do hold snug into the kind of tone\nup and across the top of this midfoot\npartly because of this big padded tongue\nthat really sort of holds there back\ninto the hill collar everything is super\npadded super plush I get good heel hold\ngood stability back there flipping over\nto the sakon Triumph 22 it's not a\ndissimilar story to be honest there's a\nbit more room up the end of the toes you\ncan see so there's you know this is\nbasically the same uk8 and a half but a\nUSA 9 and a half so slightly different\nif you're buying in the US but overall\nnice Airy fit across the toes uh again\nthe flexible uppers is a bit more\nstructure to them so there's not quite\nas much kind of knitted wiggle room that\nyou get here but there is still plenty\nof wiggle room plenty Airy there with\nthe space around the toes when you come\nback into the toe Knuckles this is where\nthere's just a bit more give and a bit\nmore room compared to the New Balance\n108 v14 in my kind of true to size the\nback of the shoe is very similar to the\nNew Balance padded tongue that just\ntakes the lace pinch off covers all the\nway down under the laces you've got\nthese big big padded heel collars\nthey're probably marginally more padded\nthan the New Balance 1018 they still\nhold really nicely keep everything\nlocked in place I'd recommend going true\nto size in the sakon Triumph 22 I think\nwith the new Balan 1080 v14 if you like\nit really roomy you might want to\nconsider looking at the wide fit in that\nshoe but I think I can get away with\ngoing true to size just with a slightly\nmore snug fit when it comes to the fit\nof the two shoes I've got my normal UK\nsize in both which is a uk9 with sakon\nthat's a us10 with New Balance it's a US\n9.5 both of them fit me really well in\nthat size the normal size have for both\nof these Brands I think obviously the\nnew balance is maybe a little bit more\ndialed in because it is a smaller shoe\nin the US but I actually had enough room\nin both shoes but not too much room good\nhold around the heand midfoot so I would\nsay stick to your normal running shoe\nsize for both of these Brands s is\ngenerally very consistent across its\nrange is fair to say New Balance can be\na bit more up and down with it sizing\nbut the 1080 fit me really well and it's\nthe same size I've used across all\nprevious models of the shoe as well so\nter of fit has been very good for me\noverall in both of these shoes no major\nissues to report I would say these are\ntrue size fishing shoes have had them\nboth in a UK size8 and that's been\nabsolutely fine for me uh what I would\nsay is obviously these are kind of very\nwell kind of padded shoes I think with\nthe tri 22 is a little bit more liberal\nwith that padding throughout the shoe i'\nwould say the tri 22 has a little bit\nmore volume as well overall there's a\nbit more room in that kind of toe box as\nwell uh so if that's something that you\nwant then I think the tri 22 is going to\nget you that now that's not to say that\nthe 1080 v14 is snug by any uh stretch\nof the imagination it's good good room\nthere in that toe box as well too the\nmidfoot holds are very similar the kind\nof lacing and tongue combos are very\nsimilar as well a lot of padding in that\ntongue it's the same story for the hill\ncolors so for me I think if you want the\nkind of slightly roomier more spacious\nuh kind of cushion shoe then it would be\nthe trip 22 to go for But ultimately\ngoing through to size you shouldn't have\nany problem on either of these shoes\nokay so I have a size eight in both of\nthese shoes uh I found them to be very\ncomfortable shoes to wear um I there's\nplenty of space in the for foot of these\nshoes they're both shoes designed for\ncomfort really um there's there's plenty\nof space for my big toe and around the\nfront side of uh the trium 22 same goes\nfor the 1080 v14 uh there's plenty of\npadding there's more padding in the\ntrium 22 in fact it feels like a very\nplush shoe to wear um but there's still\nplenty in the 1080 v14 uh overall I\nwould definitely say stay to your size\nin both of these shoes I've had no\nissues at all in these fan to be um very\ncomfortable and well fitted uh with nice\ncomfortable uppers as well\nso the New Balance 1080 and S Triumph\nare both very long running and popular\ncushion daily trainer lines they've both\nundergone I think a pretty big change\nthis year I would say and if you were\nasking me about these two shoes last\nyear I'd have picked the Triumph 21 over\nthe 1080 v13 myself but I think the\nupdates made this year have definitely\nskewed me in favor of the 1080 v14 which\nis one of my favorite cushion shoes all\naround this year whereas the Triumph 22\nis one that haven't got on with all that\nwell so with the Triumph 22 sakon\nobviously completely revamp this Mido\nputting in power run PB a very exciting\nchange on paper bringing that PEB based\nfoam to this cushion shoe a big slab of\nit big wide base to make sure it's still\nstable sidewalls of foam and all that\nand you thought you should have a nice\nLively but stable and cushioned ride but\nwhile it is protective and cushioned for\nsure it's actually not a very Lively\nshoe at all you get a little bit of a\nroll through from The Rocker but I found\nit just quite a bit dull and lifeless\nrunning at easy paces and I found it way\ntoo heavy and big to pick up the pacing\nas well so I don't think it scores that\nhighly on either versatility or the fun\nof the ride with this I mean it still is\ncertainly a comfortable protective shoe\nand that's his primary job is to Hoover\nup a lot of miles and protect the legs\nbut it doesn't do it in a very engaging\nor fun way and although it is protective\nI don't think it's especially soft like\nit is quite soft at the heel for sure\nbut I don't think it's as soft as the\nnew Balan 1080 v14 the previous model of\nthe shoe the 1080 v13 was really soft it\nwas too soft for me it was very squishy\nI found that I was almost wading through\nthe foam and it kind of sapped the\nenergy out of me even at easy Paces on\nlong runs like for short easy runs it\nwas okay it was really soft and fun but\nI it was a shoe that I didn't really get\ninto sink with and enjoy ticking over\nlong miles in it was just a bit too\npresent on my foot I think New Balance\njust basically made the foam a little\nbit more resilient with the 1080 v14 and\nthat's make a huge difference for me in\nterms of my enjoyment of the shoe on the\nrun it's still certainly a very soft\nshoe and softer than the Triumph in my\nopinion but I think now I get a much\nmore natural transition from Heel To Toe\nI get a little bit more ping off that\nfoam in the for foot and the shoe just\nfeels a bit more lively and fun while\nstill having that really soft and\nprotective element to it as well I\nwouldn't say the 1080 is a particularly\nfar shoe but I think it is a more\nvertile shoe than the Triumph 22 if you\nare looking for one of these to use as a\ndaily trainer to cover a lot of\ndifferent runs which is helped by the\nfact it's a bit lighter and just feels a\nfair bit nimbler on the foot because it\nhas got a much smaller design that isn't\nquite so wide and maybe the Triumph is a\nbit more stable as a result of that but\nI didn't have any stability problems\nmyself with the 1080 v14 even with a\nfairly soft foam underfoot did a short\nrun in both uses at the same time and\nyeah the difference is really quite\nStark on the run for me like the 1080\nreally feels a lot more Nimble soft fun\nlike just turns over a bit more easily\nwhereas the Triumph just feels like a\nreally big shoe to me a heavy shoe and\nyou know it has that rocker it works\nokay but just don't get a lot from the\nfo you don't get a really nice soft feel\nlike I said it's definitely a protective\nshoe it's going to do the job and like\nprotecting the legs on easy miles and it\nis cushion but it doesn't feel very soft\nand it doesn't feel you know like a very\nfun shoe to pull on it feels a lot\ndenser underfoot than the 1080 which\njust feels a bit more lively and fun\nwhile still being nice and soft and\ndisappears on the foot a bit more like\nI'm going out for an easy ride I just\nfeel like I can tick over in the tenat\nand not really think about it too much\nwhereas the Triumph it's a little bit\nintrusive in how large it is so turns my\nrunning time in these two shoes I would\nsay first and foremost these aren't\nnecessarily my favorite versions of\nthese respective lines I think they have\nbeen changes here from the previous\nversions of these shoes I think have\nthese changes necess made them better\nshoes I'm not necessarily convinced but\nI think in terms of taking those key\nboxes of Max cushion shoes it really\nprioritize comfort and protection they\ndo that uh very well these are going to\nbe shoes that you use for easy runs\nrecovery runs longer runs where you are\nnot running your hardest or fastest and\nyou just want something to tick that\nmileage off and you just want those kind\nof training modes in the bank these are\ngoing to be shoes that are going to do\nthat they definitely do it in slightly\ndifferent ways I think the first way I\nwould say or thing that's kind of really\nstood out for me has been the weight of\nthese shoes now obviously these are Max\ncushion shoes they're not going to be\nsuper light shoes but I would say the\ntri 22 has felt like the bigger shoe to\nme I talked about the level of padding\nmore notable padding in the shoe and it\njust feels like a lot more shoe when\nI've been running in the tri 22 compared\nto the 10814 well I think the the\ndistribution of the weight feels a lot\nmore balanced in this shoe ultimately\nand I think that really has a big um say\nin the experience of running these shoes\nthe other aspect here obviously is the\nmidsole and it's not just about the\nmidell sensation what it feels like it's\nyou know the formation of it you know\nwhat's surrounding it to kind of deliver\nthat kind of ride as well too the tri 22\ngetting power R PB a big stack of it\nobviously we loved it in the Endorphin\nline you know it's a big stack at the\nhill and then you get down and kind of\nNarrows obviously in the forfeit which\nkind of generally that's what we expect\nto see you're getting a similar stack of\nthis kind of fresh foam X foam in the\n1080 v14 what I would say is that it\ndoesn't narrow as much and I think it's\na bit more consistent in terms of that\nspread of that foam now I think what\nthat does ultimately it creates\nsomething that is you using that phone\nto create a quite stable feel you know\nthis is a very stable shoe as well too\nand I think the outsole contributes to\nthat but ultimately that's I think what\nthat foam kind of does in one aspect I\nthink the try turn into the power on PB\nwhile you know we've loved it in the\npower um kind of endorphin line I think\nyou know for me it doesn't feel as you\nknow bouncy as I would expect it to be I\ndidn't find it as plush either kind of\nFalls in between something of that and I\nthink ultimately just feels a bit\nlaborous to run in the shoe e\nkind of easy and Recovery Paces I just\nfelt like a bit of an effort to roll in\nthe shoe I didn't feel like it was Mak\nor helping me in any way to really get\nthrough that time where maybe I didn't\nwant to be out\nrunning I think for me the 1080 v14 you\nknow I really like the 1080 v13 this mid\nso is not as soft and plush but it still\nhas a plusher element to it and a little\nbit more resilient I would say and I\nthink what that does is it makes it more\ncomfortable I think and more protective\nover longer distances I do still think\nthat it's a easy run um shoe or recovery\nrun shoe I think it can handle moderate\nPaces as well uh particularly compared\nto the Triumph 22 and I think the key\nthing for me is not just the midsole\nit's also The Rocker The Rocker is just\na bit more prominent uh it's not overly\naggressive but it's enough to kind of\nroll you through from Hill to toone just\nkind of really get you through those\nkind of um those running miles\nparticular those longer ones as well was\nI feel like that kind of lacked or was\nlacking for me in the trium\n22 I think from an outside point of view\nnot a huge amount in it I think there's\na bit more rubber and coverage on the\ntri 2 2 outs soole compared to the 108\nv14 these are going to be shoes\nultimately going to spend a lot of time\nin I think from a traction and grip\npoint of view Pavements and Roads\nabsolutely fine I think kind of lighter\ntrails are absolutely going to be fine\nthere as well too um I just think maybe\nyou're getting a little bit more rubber\num on the TR to but it's not a huge\namount here so ultimately these are Max\ncushion shoes I think as I said tick\nthose key boxes in terms of the one that\nI would go for I'll get into that next\nokay so two shoes that are designed for\nsimar purpose they're both daily shoes\nthat Veer more towards that cushioned\ncomfortable side of running um they are\nshoes that have had uh a few\ndevelopments from the pr the previous\nversions of both of these shoes some not\nnecessarily welcome ones uh let's start\nwith the 108 v14 so uh 10 v14 big fan of\nthis shoe um the 108 v13 uh I was a\nreally I was really keen on that shoe um\nbecause 1080 V12 v11 was wasn't really\nkeen on those found them to be a very\nboring design of shoe uh the Mido just\ndidn't really do a lot for me it just\nfelt a little bit dead um it was quite\nwell balanced so you it was quite\naccessible for a lot of people because\nit wasn't too soft um and also\nrelatively stable uh for for for those\nsorts of shoes uh and then the ten v13\ncame along and the new MID is really\nreally soft so it suddenly uh polarized\nthe audience quite a bit because some\npeople didn't really want it to go that\nsoft and if you're a really heavy Runner\nor you don't really like running in soft\nshoes ten v13 was a little bit of a\nMarite shoe um for me I really like soft\nshoes so I very much enjoyed it but um\nit had limitations in that shoe you\ncouldn't really run a long distance in\nit because it sap a lot of your energy\nbecause it was really soft it's great\nfor Recovery runs and easy runs just cuz\nit dead in the impact just felt very\nsoft nestled your feet into the ground\num but a lot of people didn't didn't\nlike that shoe because of that um the 10\nv14 has rectified that a bit um one of\nthe other problems with the 10 v13 is\nbecause of that softer midsole it lacked\na little bit of stability which the\nprevious versions had 10 v14 fixes that\nby making it bit more stable through the\ndesign of the midsole and the midle uh\nitself uh the foam in there um and as a\nresult it is a nice balance between the\nV12 and the v13 it's not as soft as the\nv13 but it's definitely softer than the\nV12 uh and as a result um it's a great\ndaily shoe it's really solid um you for\neasy runs recover runs great for longer\ndistance efforts anything like that\nwhere you're running at a nice\ncomfortable Pace very very good and it's\nprobably a bit it's definitely a bit\nmore versal than versatile than T v13 um\njust because it's got a bit more of a\nresponsive midsole in it all in all\nreally solid daily shoe no problems at\nall with this I've I've been using this\nfor about 70k so far I've been doing a\nlot of marathon training sessions in it\nthe sort of one um 1 hour run my um\ncomfortable pace which should be like 5\nminute kilm great tick in the Box really\nenjoyed it nothing amazing about it it's\nnot like I finish a run in the shoe and\nthink that was a phenomenal uh\nexperience nice and bouncy it's not like\nthe Mizuno Neo Vista or something good\nsolid shoe and definitely a very\naccessible shoe because you're getting a\nnice balance midso now the S trium 22 um\nthe S trium 21 and the 20 I was a\nmassive fan of both those shoes they\nwere like my perfect running shoe they\nwere uh quite soft a little bit of\nenergy returning them very enjoyable to\nrunning very comfortable uh but also you\ncould pick up the pace nicely in them as\nwell they were like the perfect holiday\nshoe that you could take away with you\nbecause you could just do loads of easy\nones in it but if you really wanted to\ngo and do intervals or something you\ncould do a bit of them in that shoe so\nit was a great daily shoe that really\nticked a lot of boxes uh and um yeah it\nwas a big fan of the 21 22 um there's a\nfew changes to this shoe which I really\njust don't get along with the Midol foam\nit just feels um a lot thicker to me and\na lot denser and I don't get a lot a lot\nof cushioning out of it I'm 69 kg so I'm\nnot getting the best out of this midell\nphone probably I think if you're heavier\nyou're probably going to get a little\nbit more compression out of this um but\nthe way the shoe is designed um I I'm a\nmid foot Striker and I hit the shoe\nright in the middle and um it I just\ndon't get anything out of it it's like I\nhit the ground and just stops and then I\nlift my foot up and go again and I don't\nreally get any rolling action from it I\ndon't really get any um com cushioning\nfrom it I it doesn't sort of compress\nwhen I'm running in it it just feels\nvery clunky to me as a shoe and I uh I\nused this shoe actually um because I ran\nBoston Marathon and London Marathon six\ndays after I ran Boston in alphafly 3es\num but because I was doing London as a\nsort of comfortable run at my easy run\nPace I decided to use the try 22 because\nI was such a big fan of 21 I thought\nI'll give it a go and it would see how\nit was over the marathon didn't enjoy\nrunning London marathon in the shoe just\nF felt like a lot of hard work for me I\ndidn't feel feel like it was comfortable\ndidn't feel like was rolling me forward\nat all it just felt like a bit of a slug\nit would have felt like a slug anyway\ncuz i' just done a marathon the week\nbefore but it it just didn't seem to\nhelp me at all this year as in said I've\ndone a lot of other runs in it and it\njust doesn't work for me this year it\njust feels like it's lost the magic that\nI got from the the previous uh Triumph\n21 um for easy runs for Recovery runs I\nthink it's fine but even for those I\nwant a bit more softness in it and I\nknow some people will say there's a lot\nof softness I think Nick notices it a\nbit more softness in that that heel of\nthe shoe um because he's a heel Striker\nI don't hit it on the heel I hit it in\nthat mid mid midsection and I'm getting\nnothing um so yeah not not really warm\nto this shoe at all uh I'm very rarely\npick it up for any any sorts of runs\nunless I'm testing it for for some\nreason uh the other thing i' would say\nabout these two shoes is the outsole is\nvery very good on the trium 22 really\nsolid rubber outsole great level of grip\nin it very similar to something like pag\ngrip uh so that's a really good plus\npoint for the trium 22 uh I'd also say\nit's a very stable shoe as well um\nshould have mentioned that earlier when\nI was not talking about grip the outso\non the 1080 v14 absolutely fine what\nyou'd expect from the 1080 range um it\ndoes have some exposed sections but I\nhave not seen any wear or tear on any of\nthis at at the bottom uh but I would say\nthe grip is much better on the tri 22\njust the way it's designed and the\ncoverage that you get on that shoe now\nI've probably run slightly less miles in\nboth of these shoes than the other\ntesters they came in a bit later for me\nbut I've managed to rack up around 40 km\nin both and I've put them through a good\nrange of paces though in most cases I've\nended up dropping back to a very easy\nPace because that's really I think where\nthese shoes run best for me there's an\nupper Pace limit on both essentially\nwhat you've got are two soft cushioned\npretty pillowy shoes that work best for\nthe easiest miles they're best at that\nend of running Paces now I like the\nprevious generations of both shoes for\nwhat they offered the 1080 v13 was a\ngood highly cushioned slow recovery run\nshoe with a soft rried but not much by\nway of Versatility for me and the 1080\nv14 offers more of the same though it's\nto having a slightly stiffer more\nimmediate feel Under Foot it's still\nhighly cushioned but I would say it's\nnot quite as soft that brings a bit more\nimmediacy to the ride which I'm a big\nfan of now when it comes to the Triumph\n22 there's much more marked difference I\nthink between this and the old\ngeneration and I don't think sakon has\nimproved things it now feels much softer\nto me more squidgy a bit more labored\nit's a bit heavier on the foot so some\nof the sprightliness I think that gave\nthe tri 21 a bit more versatility and\nrange well that's kind of gone to me it\nnow feels much more like an easy run\nshoe only\nthe Triumph 21 had a bit more about it\nthan the 1080 v13 but now the Triumph 22\ngoes much more directly head-to-head I\nthink with the 1080 v14 I'm not in love\nwith the 22 there's sort of too much\nwork to get through the touchdown to toe\noff I much prefer the ride 17 from sock\nand even for my easier runs but both\nshoes offer good stability both shoes\nlook like they'll enjoy well and last\nlong miles I've also did a sidebyside\nmile in these two shoes to really tease\nout those finer detailed differences so\nI've just done my side by side M I've\ngot the so Triant for 22 on the left\nfoot I've got the New Balance 1080 v14\non the right foot from doing go side by\nside like that in my head from the run\nthat I've just done these shoes are very\nvery very very very very similar they\nare almost the same shoe in many many\nrespects you've got the kind of same\nplush padded heel collars kind of thick\npadded tongues got the same kind of\nuppers they're quite thick boring on the\nprobably too hot if you go into kind of\nsummer months but there's nice and\nflexible lots of room in the toe box\nthere lots of wiggle room they feel soft\nthey feel kind of roomy nice and snug\nnice and comfortable all of that kind of\nplush comfort that you want from an easy\nday shoe is here in both of these shoes\nfrom the fit and the uppers so when it\ncomes to the ride I think the nuances\nhere essentially boil down to the fact\nthe New Balance 1080 v14 come in\nslightly stiffer slightly they're not\nfirmer but it's a stiffness to that kind\nof midsole and it creates a little bit\nof a smoother transition than I get from\nthe Triumph 22 which it's just a bit\nsofter I think it's a little bit\nsquishier I don't quite get quite as\nmuch kind of consistent roll through or\nconsistent move on sort through that\ntransition there's a slight disconnect\nthat I feel there a little bit of\nsinking in the middle a bit more than\nyou'll get with a new balance 1080 v13\nthat said I'm really splitting hairs\nhere and I would happily run in either\nof these two shoes for the same kinds of\nruns and that is essentially your easy\nrecovery steady they are both the same\nweight in terms of the way they feel on\nthe foot I think they both offer pretty\nmuch the same when it comes to that\ncushioning and Road protection well if\nanything maybe the New Balance 1080 v14\nfeel a bit more immor whereas the socy\nTriumph for 22 feel just mildly more\nbouncy if you want to call it I don't\nfind them particularly bouncy I don't\nreally get as much energy as I would\nlike even though they've got that same\nfoam that you'll find in the speed for I\ndon't find that much energy in them I\nfind them a little bit soggy and a bit\nsinky overall\nyeah so having done the side by side\nreally the upshot of it is I didn't\nreally learn very much from it because\nthey do to me on the foot feel like they\nrun very very similar if that's the\nthing I think you could choose between\nthese two shoes you wouldn't be\ndisappointed with either of them for\ngoing on kind of easy sort of very easy\nruns the only downside I think is that\nthe Triumph 22 has lost a bit of\nVersatility over what it had from the\nTriumph\n21 so my take with you should go for the\nS Tri 22 or the new B 108 v14 now as I\nsaid these aren't my favorite versions\nof this shoe but I think if I had to\npick one I'd be going for the New\nBalance shoe I think ultimately my time\nin this shoe has just been a lot more\nmemorable than my time in the Triumph 22\nwhich I think is just slightly Mis Mark\nfor me this year you know especially\nwhen I've kind of really liked the\nprevious Triumph shoes I think if you\nare looking for the shoe that you know\nultimately is very comfortable um you\nknow offers a very kind of stable kind\nof smooth kind of gently rocked ride\nthat's going to really kind of nudge you\nforward um and you know really help you\ntick those running miles off then I\nthink you know the new B shoe does it in\na lot more effective way and it's a\nslightly more versatile shoe as well too\nit's a little bit cheaper than the\nTriumph 22 it's about10 difference in\nthe UK so I think for me from a kind of\nprice point of view and in terms of\nperformance I'd be going for the 1080\nv14 I think for me the Triumph 22 is\njust not being the Triumph that I've\nwanted it to be even with that power on\nPB in there so yeah for me it's a\nno-brainer go for the New Balance shoe\nwhich just feels a lot more balanced in\nterms of a Max cushion shoe and how it\ndelivers that okay so my ver on these\ntwo shoes pretty easy I mean I'm not a\nmassive fan of either of these shoes I\nlike the 1080 v14 I think it's a solid\nshoe it's definitely not one of the\nshoes that I'm picking up very often for\na lot of my training sessions or\nanything like that um but in testing\nthis shoe absolutely fine absolutely\nenjoyed it because I like softness I\nlike a bit of Bounce I'm going more more\nlikely to pick up things like the Muno\nNeo Vista uh the New Balance BOS stuff\nlike that for a lot of the training that\nI'm doing whereas this just doesn't it's\ndoesn't do things like those shoes does\nit's not giving you bounce ory return or\nanything like that it's just a solid\nshoe and I think uh that's what a lot of\npeople need uh it's accessible it's\nstable uh it's comfortable it's got a\nbalanced midsole it probably works for\nlots of different weights of people\nthings like that great shoe um\ndefinitely the sort of shoe that a brand\nneeds because you know when people come\nin especially when new Runners and stuff\nit's a very reliable option for people\nto buy uh tr22 equally it's quite a\nsolid shoe for that level of Runner um\nbut I do think the Midol is just not\nquite right in this shoe uh it doesn't\nreally feel as comfortable as the T v14\nit might just be largely my style of\nrunning because I'm a midfoot runner but\na lot of people are midfoot Runners so\nthey're probably going to have a similar\nissue with it um so it it just doesn't\ndo a lot for me and even on easy runs or\nrecovery runs I'm not enjoying it um so\nthere's no run that I really find this\nshoe works really well for and I think\nit's just the geometry of the shoe um\nwhich which doesn't work for me so very\neasy decision for me at these two shoes\nI'm going to go for the 108 v14 uh just\ncuz it's a great all round shoe and you\ncan't really go wrong with it verdict\nthen and if you're looking for pillowy\nsoft guaranteed cushion comfort for easy\nmiles both of these shoes definitely\noffer that and I honestly think that you\ncould choose either and get roughly the\nsame experience for me these two will\ncover the same kind of runs neither shoe\nreally gets out of second gear for me\nthey perform well in first or second\ngear though but I find that limits their\nversatility and I'm kind of split on\nwhich one I like the most I prefer the\nfit of the S Triumph 22 I marginally\nprefer the slightly stiffer ride of the\nNew Balance 1080 v14 it's just a shade\nsmoother in the transition for me but\nbecause I find the rid so similar I\nthink if I had to choose one it'\nprobably come down to price and the New\nBalance 1080 v14 probably just about\nedges it though I honestly think that\nyou could take either of these shoes and\nget largely the same experience from it\nso Verdi is a very easy one for me these\nare both cushion shoes that you're going\nto use for daily runs easy runs I just\nthink the 1080 v14 is a lot more\nenjoyable for any of those kind of runs\nI think it feels a little bit softer to\nme which is nice when you are on tied\nlegs but it has got a nice level of\nresiliency so you can kind of roll\nthrough nicely and get a bit of pop off\nthe forefoot and it's also just lighter\nnimbler just feels better on the foot to\nme than the Triumph 22 because like I\nsaid just kind of forget about it when\nit's there it doesn't feel like a very\nintrusive shoe whereas the Triumph is\nthis big block at the end of your foot\nand you know it's doing the job there\nit's got dense foam it's going to last\nforever it's going to protect the legs\nbut it doesn't really bring a lot of\nlife to the Run whereas the 1080 is\nquite a fun shoe to run in I'd think\nmaybe if you're a heavier Runner than me\nthe Triumph 22 might just have a little\nbit more to it you might get a bit more\nbounce back from the phone cuz you're\nputting a bit more Force into it or\nsomething like that but all around I\nwould certainly recommend the 1080 over\nthe Triumph myself just a shoe I've\nenjoyed more for really any kind of run\nthat's it from us on this versus thanks\na lot for watching don't forget to like\nsubscribe click that little bell and if\nyou're going to catch

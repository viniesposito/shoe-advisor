  "text": "hey Tommy for run testers and another\nversus with the New Balance morv 5 this\ntime I'm comparing it with the Brooks\nghost Max 2 let's have a\n[Music]\nlook the New Balance more V5 cost \u00a3140\nor\n$154.99 it weighs 306 G or 10.8 o for\nmen in a size 8 and the drop is 4 mm the\nBrooks ghost Max 2 costs \u00a340 or $150 it\nweighs 308 G or 10.9 o for men in a size\n8 and the drop is 6\n[Music]\nmm the fifth version new balance's Max\ncushion shoe receives a number of\nupdates aiming to improve on the popular\nV4 the biggest of those is a new midso\ncomposition using the same soft foam\nfound in the 1080 B13 and a slightly\nincreased stack height to counter the\nupdates there's a noticeably wide base\nto ensure plenty of stability in the\nshoe the more 5 also sees modifications\nto the engineered mesh upper design to\nimprove both the breathability of the\nshoe and the padding around the ankle\ncollar and tongue and the outsole sees a\ncomplete overhaul with less rubber\ncoverage which does leave more exposed\nsections of the midsole the more V5 also\ncomes in three different width sizes the\nghost Max 2 is a Max cushion shoe\nfocusing firmly on cushioning and\ncomfort for daily training miles like\nthe ghost Max it uses a wide base to\nprovide a stable ride and combines that\nwith a Glide roll rocker design to\npromote a smth smooth Heel To Toe\ntransition for cruising through miles\nthe biggest update in the ghost Max 2 is\nthe new nitrogen infused DNA Loft V3\nmidsole working alongside the rocker to\nimprove the softness and comfort of the\nride as well as decrease pressure in the\nheel and forefoot the upper is made from\na flexible breathable mesh built for\ncomfort and breathability and there's a\ngenerous layer of outso rub for grip and\nto improve durability the shoe also\nfeatures raised sidewalls for additional\nsupport\nhe so the fit for me in both these shoes\nI'm size8 in the UK these are both shoes\ndesigned for Comfort they're both shoes\nthat have plenty of space in the\nforefoot very comfortable uppers uh\nplenty of padding more padding uh for me\nin the Brooks ghost Max 2 than the mor 5\nbut both have a good level of padding\nand they're very very comfortable to\nwear I've had no issues in either of\nthese shoes uh in a lot of uh running\nthat I've done in them um and I would\ndefinitely stay to my size in both of\nthese\n[Music]\nshoes okay okay so let's start with the\nNew Balance more V5 so the New Balance\nMo V5 is a shoe that I've been looking\nforward to for quite a long time I've\nbeen a massive fan of the V3 and the V4\num and the morvi 5 has a few changes to\nit which I was a little bit worried\nabout when I heard about the new shoe um\nbut I am a big fan of this I've done a\nlot of running in it you can see it's\nquite muddy because I've been doing a\nlot of my marathon training longer\nsessions and easy runs and stuff in this\nshoe um the biggest change of this shoe\nis that it uses the same M foam um\ndesign that is in the 108 v13 now in the\n108 v13 that midsole is very very soft\nand some people don't like that shoe\nbecause it is too soft um it the problem\nwith making it soft means that it is\nless stable uh but also is not as good\nfor longer runs because you end up\nsapping a lot of energy and it doesn't\nreally give it you back it's not like a\nbouncy midell fo it's just a soft um\nmarshmallowy midell foam that sort of\nsinks you into the ground and just\ndeadens the impact of the run it's very\nnice for easy runs and Recovery runs\nwhere you're not going too far but if\nyou were to do like a half marathon in\nit you'd really feel the the lack of um\nany sort of responsiveness or bounce or\nenergy return in that shoe um so I was a\nbit worried about the midell foam in the\nmo V5 because I thought if they're using\nthis the same mid cell foam or a similar\nmidell foam design um I'm going to lose\nwhat I liked about the more V4 um\nthankfully even though it does have this\nnew Midol foam it doesn't deliver like\nthe 10 v13 and very mind I love the T 10\nv13 um I just don't think it's very\nversatile and I can see why some people\ndon't like it um the midso in the morvi\n5 it doesn't feel like that midso f it\nis a bit it's denser it definitely feels\nlike you get a little bit more back from\nit um I have done uh about 90k in this\nshoe so far and uh I've done a\nthree-hour running it as part of my\nmarathon training and it just felt great\nit didn't feel sluggish it didn't feel\nlike it was making me work harder to run\nin that shoe I definitely wanted another\n3-hour run in uh the 10 v13 this felt\ngreat I just didn't really think about\nit on the feet it just very comfortable\nrolls you forward nicely it's not got\nthe most pronounced rocker in it but it\nhas got a very comfortable uh sort of\ntransitional um design to it so uh it's\na shoe that if you put it on and go for\na run you're going to enjoy that that\nrun that's that's why I like the more V5\nI'll go out for um a run and I might not\nwant to go for a run but I'll take this\nshoe out because I know that it will\nmean that I'm at least it's comfortable\nand I'm not going to be out running in a\nshoe that is I'm not enjoying so it's\nvery much a comfortable enjoyable uh\nshooter to run in but it also gives you\na little bit more a little bit of energy\nreturn in it really like the mid it\nconfesses really nicely and comfortably\nbut still gives you a nice um um\ntransition and and smooth uh run when\nyou're out in it so really big fan of\nthe mor V5 and um the update to that\nmidsole I think is a really good one uh\nthe Brooks ghost Max 2 now I wasn't a\nfan of the ghost uh Max one uh I just\nthought it was really just felt like a\nreally solid shoe I didn't feel like I\nwas really getting anything back from it\nthe Mido was uh a lot firmer than what\nYou' find things like the mo V 5 um and\nas a result I just didn't feel like it\nwas really helping me uh run comfortably\num for easy runs it just just felt a\nlittle bit too clunky for me uh and for\nlonger runs just just didn't really feel\nlike it was giving me anything back so I\nwasn't a fan of the Brooks ghost Max one\nthe Brooks ghost Max 2 has been updated\na bit so it feels different out on the\nRun uh and I'm I'm I'm I like the Ghost\nMac to a lot more than the original\nversion so I I do enjoy running in this\nshoe now um it the Midol foam is a\nlittle bit more forgiving um it's it's\ndefinitely still a lot firmer than what\nyou're going to get in the mo V5 it's\nnot the firmest Mido out there but it's\ndefinitely in comparison to the more V5\nit's it's more on that solid stable side\nof midell Foams uh which is good for a\nlot of people I think it's a shoe that's\nprobably very accessible to new Runners\nRunners that are very just want to go\nout and take off the miles and want\nsomething that's nice and solid and\ngives him a little bit of stability in\nthe shoe um and uh that's a good thing\nto have in a shoe uh so um I've I've\ndone as many kilometers in the Brooks\nghostb 2 just because I don't enjoy it\nas much as the the mor V5 um but the\nruns that I've done in it I think it's\nreally solid shoe for easy runs recovery\nruns and longer sessions as well I think\na lot of people want a little bit more\num responsiveness in from that midsole\nthey want a little bit more firmness in\nthe mid soole um when they're running\nlonger distance this is a good shoe for\nit um and uh I think I can't really um\ngive it any sort of bad bad comments\nabout this shoe I think it's very good\nfor everything that it does I think it\nreally just comes down to the Mido that\nyou're looking for in the in those shoes\nnow the outsole on both of these shoes\nvery very good on the Brooks ghost Max 2\nthere's a lovely layer of rubber on here\nit's very tacky uh rubber so it feel\nfeels very sticky on the ground um and\nI've not had any issues with grip out on\nthe Brooks ghost Max 2 at all uh there's\nnot really any a lot of exposed mid cell\nfoam either but even so that mid cell\nfoam's quite a sturdy mid cell foam so I\nwouldn't be worried about it anyway the\nNew Balance Mori 5 doesn't have as much\nrubber on the outsole it's fine these\nbits are fairly thick but there is a lot\nof exposed rubber on there as a said\nI've done about 90k in the shoe so far\nthere are no signs of the uh exposed\nsections in the Mido having any issues\nand the rubber still holding up fairly\nwell it's rubbing off a bit around there\ncuz that's that's the main bit that I\nrun on U so it's it's coming away a\nlittle bit there but it's still looking\npretty good after 90k and I've had no\nissues with that that more delicate mid\ncell foam so um good outsoles on both of\nthem but definitely far superior on the\nBrooks um ghost Max\n[Music]\n2 okay so my verdict on these two shoes\nyou can probably guess because I think I\nprobably said it in the um in the Run\nsection but more V5 is the shoe that I'm\ngoing for just because I like a softer\nshoe uh even if uh I was going for the\nmore V4 which was not as soft as the mo\nV5 um I'd still found it to be a more\ncomfortable shoe and more enjoyable to\njust shoe to just sort of tick off the\nmiles in a nice smooth um motion um but\nthe more V5 does that just a little bit\nsofter so for me CU I like soft shoes\nit's going to be the more V5 all the way\nI just very just found the shoe so\nenjoyable to run in um for the type of\nruns that I've been doing in it it's not\nthe most versatile shoe in the world\nyou're not going to buy either of these\nshoes if you're looking for a really\nversatile shoe um but it's definitely\nfor me the more comfortable shoe\nespecially if you like a little bit more\nsoftness in your uh midsole in your\nshoes um the Brooks ghost Max 2 even\nthough I haven't picked it as my shoe\nout of these two um I still think for\nsome people it is better because uh it\ndoes have this more solid sturdy Midol\nfoam little bit more responsive because\nit hasn't got the um the softer Mido in\nit uh and I think it's more accessible\nas well I think some people if you're a\nnew Runner and maybe you're you might\nget the more V5 and not quite enjoy the\nthe level of softness in there uh it's\nnot it's not an unstable shoe but i'\ndefinitely say the Brooks ghost Max 2 is\nmore stable so it's a more accessible\nshoe for people a bit safer shoe if you\nneed stability um and definitely just\nfeels a little bit more solid on the\nfeet um as opposed to the more V5 um so\nit really comes down to that but for me\nand it's me doing the versus I'm going\nto go through more V 5 because of that\nComfort level and I really like that new\nmidell foam in there that's it for me on\nthis versus thanks a lot for watching\ndon't forget to like subscribe and click\nthat little bell and if you go the catch\nbelow you can

  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers with\nanother running shoe review in this\nvideo I'm going to be doing my full\nreview of The sakon Exodus Ultra Trail\n[Music]\n3 so Exodus Ultra 3 costs \u00a3150 or $160\nit weighs 311 G or 11 oz for men in the\nsize 8 and the drop is 6\n[Music]\nmm socony Exodus Ultra 3 is a trail shoe\nthat's designed for tackling longer\nsessions in the outdoors it does that by\ncombining cushioning stability and a\nresponsive foam to produce a balanc ride\nthat takes a lot of boxes if you're\nplanning on running for a long time the\nmidsole is a dual layer of the brand\nspeed Focus power on PB foam alongside a\nmore supportive and durable power run\nframe a wider base and sidewalls add\neven more stability to the ride on the\nout soole is s's power track rubber to\nimprove traction and protect the midsole\nand the upper is made from a closed mesh\nthat aims to be both breathable and\n[Music]\nprotected Fit For Me In The Exodus Ultra\n3 I'm size eight UK this is a size eight\nfound it to be quite a a well width shoe\num and there's plenty of space in the\nforefoot as well for a trail shoe um\nyeah I definitely found it to be uh very\ncomfortable it's quite a High um toe box\nas well so plenty of room for your feet\nto move around tape is a bit at the end\num so you know if you're used to using\nshoes like Ultra or something like that\nyou're probably going to notice that\nthere's a bit of a taper but uh I've got\nfairly average width feet uh and my feet\ndon't taper massively at the end but I\ndidn't have any problems with it I found\nit to be very comfortable um even over\nlonger sessions so I definitely say to\nmy size in this shoe there's plenty of\npadding around it as well very\ncomfortable upper um nice and breathable\nas\nwell okay so the Exodus uh Ultra 3 um\nI've done a few runs in this now um uh\nlong run I've raced in it I did 10 Mile\nracing it over with the Downs uh and\nI've done a few easy runs in it as well\nuh and I found it to be a really solid\ncomfortable all round Trail shoe um the\nfact that it's designed or that talks\nit's it's in its name it's called an\nUltra Shoe and the brand talks about it\nbeing a shoe designed for a long\ndistance um I think it's not necessarily\nyou have to buy it if if if that's the\nsort of shoe you're wanting I think it's\nactually very accessible Trail shoe for\na lot of reasons the reason why uh it's\nthe brand and people talk about it being\ngood good for longer distance is because\nuh it's very comfortable there's a good\nbalance in this shoe between comfort and\nthe more technical elements that you\nwould want if you're running for a long\nperiod of time so it's got this dual\nmidell it's got the power on PB foam in\nit and it's got power on as well power\non PB foam is the sort softer bouncier\nmore race orientated Pham which is\ndesigned to give you a bit more energy\nback um and if you just had that that's\ncan be tricky for a trail shoe because\nyou want stability and that other power\non foam adds stability in it as well so\nover over all it is a very solid stable\nshoe you do feel a little bit of nice\nsoftness from that Midol from that power\non PB but it does feel very stable as\nwell which is one of the major reasons\nwhy it's good for for longer distance\ntraining one of the things about running\non the trails if you're um going out for\na long time is that when you get tired\nand you don't have stability in your\nshoe you're going to notice that because\nyou want stability so you don't trip\nover um and it does a good job with that\nso it's that's that's the main reason\nwhy I think it's really classed as an\nUltra Shoe but those benefits don't\nnecessarily mean that it's just good for\nUltras um you can definitely use it for\neasier runs shorter distance runs I've\nused it for all sorts of runs and I\nfound it to be a very very comfortable\nshoe for all of those um what I would\nsay is that I don't necessarily need the\nlevel of balance uh and it might be a\nlittle bit too firm for me over easier\nruns over harder harder terrain um but\nfor most people I think it'd be\nabsolutely fine uh and it's very\ncomfortable to run also say about the\nshoe is that it does feel quite um quite\nquite poppy on the run it does feel like\nyou can pick up the pace nicely it's not\nshoe that I would use for um really fast\ntraining I don't normally do interval\nsessions or anything like that I don't\ntend to race very much when I'm out on\nthe Trails um I much prefer to use the\ntrails as a more comfortable long run um\nto to um accommodate my uh faster\ntraining that I'm doing uh on the road\num but it does feel like a pretty pretty\ngood shoe for for running at a\nconsistent Pace quite well when I was\nrunning the 10 mile race the leis\ndownlands 10 Mile um it felt like a good\nshoe for that I wasn't going all out I\nwasn't r at my race pace foot that I\nwould on road but I was consistently\nrunning at a a taxing pace and I felt\nthe shoe did a really good job at it uh\njust feels quite nice light on the feet\nand you do get a little bit of nice\ncomfort in there but it's nice and\nresponsive as well because you've got\nthat duwel layer of midell foam in so\nall in all a very solid uh shoe if\nyou're looking for something a little\nbit more performance orientated but you\nstill want those elements of comfort in\nthere as well um other things I would\nsay about this shoe uh the out soole\nisn't great uh it's okay it's got this\npower track outsole um I've never really\nbeen a fan of of of power track on some\nshoes what it's not as good as things\nlike a vibr outo that you'd get on some\nof the hoker shoes um it's fine um but\nwhat I did notice is it's quite hard um\noutsole uh and it doesn't doesn't feel\nvery tacky and when I was out running on\nthe downs and I hit some uh wet rocks\nand things like that I did feel like it\njust didn't have the the grip and um the\nability to sort of hold on to those\nthose rocks nicely so I was really\ncareful when I was out running on the\ndown in the wet in this shoe uh if\nyou're on muddier terrain uh it's okay\nuntil you get to a point so if you're\nrunning across really wet boggy uh\nslushy mud those outsole logs aren't\nmassive so it's really not designed for\nthat as well um that might actually be\num uh where it's that sort of ultra\nthing comes in as well so I think for a\nlot of people uh running those sort of\nlonger distances you're going to be\nlooking at running along uh maybe more\ncomfortable Forest paths public foot\npaths um and on those sorts of terrain\nmaybe in the warmer months uh where it's\nnot really really water logged I think\nthat's probably the sweet spot for this\nshoe so you're not going too far away\nfrom um that sort of hardened um that\nsort of hardened ground that you would\nget on those Trails but definitely I\nwouldn't use it for really technical\nterrain on the mountains when it might\nbe wet or slippy I definitely wouldn't\nuse it on wet bogy terrain I wouldn't go\nup the late districts in this year and\nstart trying to run up the hills because\nI just don't think the grip would be\nwould be good enough for that uh but\nother than that I've really enjoyed\nusing the shoe I think it's a solid all\nround balanc shoe that a lot of PE\npeople could really enjoy you don't have\nto be an ultra Runner to to to get the\nbenefits out of this shoe um and all in\nall I very much enjoyed running it I\nthink a lot of people could use this\nshoe and and and see the benefits of\nit so my final verdict on the uh s\nExodus Ultra 3 I think it's a great all\naround Trail shoe it's not necessarily a\nshoe that you need to be an ultra Runner\nto use\num but it definitely has some benefits\nfor people running ultramarathons um if\nyou're just a long-distance Trail Runner\nand you're really focused on chugging\nout the miles and you want something\nthat's comfortable stable um and just\nreally does the job on a certain type of\nterrain I think it's a really really\nsolid shoe um I definitely don't think\nit's a shoe that has loads of\nVersatility when it comes to terrain I\nthink it's really designed for those\nlighter Trails or the trails that um are\nmore what you're going to expect from um\nuh more the nicer climats uh in maybe\nthe winter or the spring or the Autumn\nuh you're not going to be wanting to use\nthis in really wet soggy conditions icy\nuh conditions or um if you're running up\nin the mountains and the rocks and\nthings like that I don't think it's got\nthe the outso for that um but for more\nGeneral conditions if you're running for\na long time through public foot pass and\nthings like that I think it's a really\nsolid balanced stable shoe and I think a\nlot of people are going to like it uh\nother options that you might look at\ninstead of this shoe would be something\nlike the HW tecton range I haven't tried\nthe three um and that's obviously got a\nplate in it as well so you might not\nwant a plate in it but those shoes for\nme just have a little bit more to them I\nlike the midsole in those shoes um same\nas something like the speed goat range I\nhaven't tried the most recent version of\nthe speed goat the speed goat is very\nsimilar in a lot of ways of the shoe but\nI think the out soole and the midsole\nare just a little bit better than than\nwhat you get in the uh Exodus little bit\nmore comfortable for me um and also\nbetter grip from from the outso as well\nso I think there are better options but\nthis is probably the best balanced\noption if you really want stability as\nwell because I think stability is a big\nfactor in the uh benefits of this shoe\nthat's it from me on this review thanks\na lot for watching don't forget to like\nsubscribe and click that little bell and\nif you're going to catch them below you\ncan find link to our podcast which comes\nout a couple of times each month thanks\na lot for watching catch you next time\n[Music]",

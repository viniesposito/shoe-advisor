  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand in this video we've got a first run\nlook at the new Adidas Supernova rise 2\nnot a huge amount has changed between\nthis shoe in the first generation but\nI've had them on my feet for a few miles\nand here are my first impressions of the\nchanges that have happened so let's get\ninto\nit quick details then the Adidas\nSupernova rise sticks with the same\nrelatively conservative stack at least\nby today's standards the stack I comes\nin at 36 m in the heill 26 and the 4T\nfor a 10 mil drop it weighs in at 9.6 o\nor 272 g in my men's UK and a half\nAdidas said it has shaved 4% off the\nweight versus the first gen but those\ncome in at 9.7 or 275 G in the test shoe\nso I'm not quite seeing that but coming\nin under 10 ounces I would say sort of\nkeeps Supernova rise fairly competitive\non weight price-wise things stay the\nsame with the Adidas Supernova rise to\ncoming at \u00a3130 or $140 that's now\ntowards the cheaper end of the daily\ntrainer shelves\nlet's give you a quick shoe whip round\nand Adidas pitches the Supernova as a\nneutral everyday shoe a starting point\ndaily training that could be good as an\noption for beginners the updates to the\nAdidas Supernova rise to are minimal and\nlargely restricted to the uppers where\nAdidas has tried to boost comfort and\nsave weight that includes new mesh\nuppers less padding in the hill though\nthat's quite hard to see versus The\nOriginals thinner tongues and some\nsofter eye stays here the midsole unit\nstays the same it sticks with PE based\ndream strike plus midsole foam that's\nmade from a small percentage of recycled\nmaterials that dream strike plus has\nsome of the bounce of a performance foam\nbut not the full energy of a super foam\nthere's also a highly rocked 4ot and\nwhat Adidas calls a support Rod system a\nset of visible rods that follow the\nmetat tassels and add some stiffness and\nspring up top the Supernova rise has a\nnew mesh upper that's marginally thinner\nand a little less structured across the\ntoe box for an upper that's not unlike a\nnimbus 26 the heel collar are still\nreally well padded particularly at the\nback they're are quite stiff heel counts\nto enhance the support and heel hold\nyou've also still got pretty well padded\ntraditional tongues with no gussing if\nyou flip them over there's a generous\ncovering of durable adwar Rubber and\noverall this is a shoe that screams long\nmile\ndurability when it came to fit I ran in\nmy regular Adidas running shoe size\nwhich is a UK 8 1/2 us 9 and 1 half and\nI found these fit well true to size\nthey're not the roomiest shoes but\nthey're roomy enough just about enough\nwiggle room in the toe box was easy to\nlace them up and get them locked in\ncomfortably midfoot lock down was\ngenerally good on that first run the\nrise held my foot nicely in place plus\nthe big padded heel Coler secured my\nheel well and in good comfort with no\nheel slipping So based on that first run\nI'm going to suggest going true to\nsizing\nthese so I've just ticked over 4 and 1\nhalf miles my first run in the Adidas\nSupernova rise to and in those first\nfour miles I think unsurprisingly\nbecause the midsole unit is largely the\nsame or in fact identical to the rise\none not much has changed here you're\ngetting a very similar ride to the rise\none big change Al talks about really\nhave come in the uppers where they've\nchanged a few things to the heel package\nand the tongues mainly in effort to make\nthe shoe lighter but as you see on the\nscales it's not a huge amount to choose\nin terms of the weight and I don't\nnotice anything on the foot to be honest\nthat's not to say these I don't find\nthem a particularly heavy shoe I know\nsome people wanted them to offer the\nride they offer but with a lighter\npackage and that's why and it has have\nmade some changes but I'm not noticing\nsubstantial here from that point of view\nso if you already own the rise one I\nwouldn't say it's worth upgrading to the\nrise to thinking you're going to get a\nlighter shoe with the same ride what you\nare going to get is the same ride and\nwhen it comes to that ride this is a\nshoe that basically packs a more\ntraditional feel underf foot there's not\na huge amount of soft cushioning there's\njust enough sort of softness to take the\nedge off the road but you will feel\nquite a lot of ground contact coming up\nthrough I still feel like this is a shoe\nthat I'm going to have to break in it's\nfelt a little bit firm to begin with\nthere is a stiffness and I quite like\nthat if you like that sort of more\ntraditional ride you're going to get\nthat with these shoes now having come\nfrom the Nova blast 5 and other shoes\nlike the super Blast 2 even the New\nBalance 1080 v14 shoes like that you\nknow I think one thing you will notice\nabout the Supernova Riders 2o it's the\nsame with the one they feel a little bit\nmore compact it's a little bit less shoe\non the foot this a bit of a narrower\nplatform and although they probably feel\nabout the same way they don't feel\nquite so big overall on the foot but I\nthink for me the most important\nSensation that I've got here is kind of\nan imy that comes from the midsole so\nthis isn't a daily training that's going\nto come with a big stack of soft bouncy\nmidsole foam what you're getting instead\nis a phone that compresses a little has\nquite a firm feeling under foot and then\nreturns back quite quickly it's a more\nkind of Snappy and responsive ride it's\nanother of the shoes where I think it\nbenefits best from you picking up your\nfeet quick and you're Landing mid to 4\nfoot rather than further back on your\nheels and when you're moving at a\nslightly faster Pace or at least with\nlighter feet where your turnovers quick\nso you're not actually putting too much\nenergy down into the ground but you're\nsort of balancing that that when you're\ndoing that it kind of softens the\noverall impact and the shoes kind of\ncome to life if you're Landing a bit\nheavier and you're W to go a bit slow I\nfind maybe there's not going to be as\nmuch cushion that some people are really\ngoing to want particularly at the easier\nend I think what's most interesting\nabout that is that I did is kind of peg\nthis is a good shoe for beginner Runners\nwho want kind of like a Workhorse daily\ntrainer that can do a lot of runs and\ndefinitely soak up that 80% of your easy\nruns and I think actually in a world\nwhere we've got a lot more kind of\nsoftness and cushion from shoes that do\nthat for easier runs I'm not sure that\neveryone's going to like that there is\nan upside to that though what you've got\nhere is a much more connected ride and\nthat brings with it a good stability\nthere's a good reliability to the land\nLandings and the way the the ride feels\nUnder Foot so it's consistent even if it\ncomes up a little bit stiff and a little\nbit firm which I think for some people\nparticularly if you're looking at\nrunning slow and easy I think a lot of\npeople maybe want more cushion if you\nlike a shoe with a little bit less\ncushion relies a little bit more on Fast\nfoot turnover then I think this could be\na good option the Comfort on foot is\nexcellent heels of held well fit is good\noverall I find the fit really nice and\ndisappearing all of that stuff is a big\ntick in the box and actually this is the\nkind of shoe that I don't mind you know\nI put it in ballpark alongside maybe\nlike a night Peg 41 or even like a\nBrooks ghost 16 those kind of shoes that\nif I'm thinking about whether or not\nit's actually like a Kara if it's got\nthat kind of feel to it maybe not quite\na canara not quite as direct there's a\nlittle bit more softness and cushion but\nit's in that kind of ballpark it's\nmoving back to that kind of world so\ncoming up to the 10K mark close to an\nhour on feet I think the way I describ\nthis best it's like controlled connected\ncushion you are going to feel some of\nthe ground I think that's probably going\nto limit how long some people would\nreally want to run in it but if you can\nget light foot and you start to clip\nalong and cruise it cops quite well but\nit's going to be for a particular type\nof running I think you know I think even\nwhen you're going slower you're going to\nwant to land in this with lighter feet\nquicker turnover to really\nbalance out the fact that there's maybe\na little bit less cushioning flip side\nof that it's one of those shoes that I\nthink if you're if you do pick up the\npace there is some potential here for it\nto go a bit faster one of the shoes that\nit'll deliver the fastest but you're\nstill going to be doing a lot of the\nwork you can't expect the cushioning to\nbe kind of bounding you forward as it\nmight do in some other sort of daily\ntrainers that try to have a range and a\nbit of Versatility to them\nso I've just finished 7 miles just over\nan hour First Impressions in this we'll\nsave a verdict for the full review but\nfirst impressions are this is pretty\nmuch more of the same as you would have\ngot with the original rise what I find\nwith that is you've got a\nconnected comfortable lightly cushion\nbut not really spongy firmer stiffer\nride that relies more on response and\nfast turnover for that comfort then\nyou'll finding some kind of bigger\ncushion softer bouncier shoes the energy\nis going to come from you delivering the\nthe high turnover there's a little bit\nof spring not a huge amount it is\ncontrolled it is stable it's nicely\nbalanced there's a good Comfort on the\nfoot I find the weight okay I think I'm\nhappy kind of clipping along sort of mid\nPace in them uh I think if I'm landing\ntoo heavy too far back on my heels I\nfeel like there's too much ground coming\nup potentially if I'm low like slower\nand heavier basically but there's a\nreliability to them which I quite like\nand actually once you kind of just get\nflowing in them they will turn over\nquite nicely quite well I feel like with\nthe generations of shoes that we've got\ncoming on now with a lot of people I\nspeak to they like to have a bit more\ncushion they like to feel a little bit\nless of the road if that's you and you\ndon't want much of the road coming up\nthrough I think the Supernova rise 2 are\ngoing to follow the Supernova rise and\nbeing a little bit too much kind of\nground feel coming through and you might\nwant to go for a softer shoe if you like\nthe sort of slightly more traditional\nmore direct ride underfoot then these\nare going to deliver that and they it\nreally well actually I don't mind them\nat all for that I like a shoe which has\na little bit more ground feel um you\nknow it's chalk and cheese when you come\nup to shoes against shoes like the Nova\nblast 5 which I've tested recently or\nyou're even thinking about something\nlike a new balance 1080 v14 now which\ncomes in much softer and as I said on\nthe run there I put this in the the\nmarker shoes bit more like a ghost or\neven maybe a glycerin that kind of area\nand yeah I think you'll just going to\nlike to have a shoe that feels a little\nbit lower stack feels a little bit more\nconnected like these but we will do more\ntesting obviously put more miles in them\nand uh we'll bring you the full review\nonce we've done the requisite amount of\nMiles start to rain here so I'm off back\nhome so there you have it that's been\nour first run look at the new Adidas\nSupernova rise 2 certainly tweaks rather\nthan a revolution in the shoe pretty\nmuch the same as you're going to get\nwith the rise but I hope you found that\ninteresting if you want to hear about\nthe review our full verdict when we've\ndone the requisite test miles then don't\nforget to hit subscribe and ring the\nbell if you like this video hit like if\nyou think someone else might find it\nuseful share it all of that stuff really\nhelps us here on the channel and we\nalways appreciate you guys stopping by\num but until next time uh Happy running\npeople",

  "text": "cheers Tom here from the Run testers\nwith another monthly Roundup this one is\na little bit different it's coming up to\nChristmas now so I asked the Run testers\nto pick their favorite bits of Kit from\nover the past year that they think would\nmake good Christmas gifts some of them\nwe have featured before but we're\nputting them in again if we really\nreally like them and we still like them\nso let's dive in and see what we picked\nfor the December Roundup\n[Music]\nso my first pick in this extra special\nmonthly Roundup at of Christmas is an\nitem that I think will make a great gift\nfor a runner for sure it's the rebook\nhow Sports trunks so these are\nlightweight and breathable trunks you\nget a pack of three from the cathlon for\nabout \u00a335 I think won't be surprised if\nthat price comes down somewhere at some\npoint they have you know a really long\nfit which goes right down the leg which\nis what I like reason I like wear half\ntights is I like to have a lot of my\ninner thigh covered just to the\npotential for a chafing risk down there\nand these are very soft and comfortable\nbeen wearing them for lots of long runs\nat the back end of marathon training\nsupportive comfor I generally wear\nsports underwear myself under my half\ntights or shorts just I like the feeling\nof having another layer there a little\nbit of extra support you know you don't\nhave to there are certainly some half\ntights I don't have to bother with that\nbut I still like wearing them and so I\nuse a range of underwear brands for this\nthe Under Armour box of jocks have been\nvery good for me for a long time and\nyeah a really big fan of these House\nSports Trunks from rebook as well like I\nsaid you get a pack of three solid thing\nto under the tree if you're a runner and\nwe be providing a little bit of extra\ncomfort and support on long runs my next\npick this month is the Silver S mini fly\nheadlamp uh this is40 it is an\nincredibly lightweight and easy to use\nheadlight which it probably wouldn't be\nthe one you'd pick as your main light if\nyou're going to go do a mountain Ultra\nor something like that but as an extra\nlight for to help you see things or be\nmore visible when you're running on the\nstreets and as a light that you could\nuse as your only light for running in\nsomething like the forest near me eing\nForest is where I've used it and the\npaths are pretty good there you know\nit's enough it goes under 250 Lumen so\nyou get enough light there in a really\nlightweight easy to adjust package\nthat's very comfortable on the run as\nwell it weighs in under 40 G you've got\nthree light settings the top one of\nwhich goes up to 250 lumens there's also\na red light setting you can switch\nbetween those modes easily it's very\neasy to adjust the size with this strap\non the back so you can wear it tilt the\nheadlight down to see what you need to\nsee on the Run battery life you know if\nyou use the lowest light mode is like 20\nhours but I think you'll probably be\nusing the higher light mode and if you\nhave it in the max light mode it's only\nabout an hour and a half obviously\nthat's something you sacrifice for the\nsmall size here but yeah it's just a\nreally convenient little light I do not\nlike running after the darks so I've\ndone a couple of runs to test this I've\nalso lent it to my friend who's in the\nforest quite a lot after dark and yeah\nsays it works really well for him as\nwell so yeah I do think it's a really\nnice little headband if you're not\nnecessarily going for something that's\ngoing to be an allout very long lasting\nvery bright mountaineering style\nheadlamp good for dog walking as well\nand Hiking so just a really nice pretty\ngood value light in a lightweight\npackage that's like I say easy to use\nand it's rechargeable as well with a\nUSBC cable so you're not swapping out\nbatteries or anything like that and then\nmy third pick this month is the striper\nor streer watch strap that's St r i p a\nthese guys reached out to us over\nInstagram they want to try and you know\nsend the strap to test it's quite a\nunique design so it's like a two layer\nstrap you have a soft and stretchy\nelastic layer then a Firma layer and the\nstraps are made to measure not only your\nwrist but also your watch so you measure\nthe distance between the lugs on the\nwatch and the top and bottom lugs also\nyour wrist size and then the strap is\nsent made to measure it only comes in\nBlack right now like the Ford Model T\nbut it's a pretty nice and simple design\nthat will work for most kind of styles I\nwould say and it's really comfortable\nand you know you obviously it's made to\nmeasure you can tighten it very slightly\nby slipping your finger One Way along\nthe band and loosen it by going the\nother way is tight enough for exercise\ndries off fairly quickly after a workout\nas well as doesn't feel like it's cold\nand clammy against your wrist and it's\nresistant to stuff like sea water as\nwell so you know all in know just a\nreally nice watch band and if you do\nhave one watch you're very settled on un\nlikee us constantly swapping stuff\nyou're testing you know you can get a\nreally nice MTO measure band that's\nreally good for sport as well it's tight\nenough running watch won't move around\nand helps keep that heart rate monitor\nin place if you are using the optical\nheart rate monitor cost \u20ac39 they do ship\neverywhere and like I said you can\ncustomize it closely to your wrist size\nyour preferences and also the watch\nyou're going to use there's also Apple\nwatch variants as well so I just got one\nthat's designed for 22 mm lug watches\nthat will fit most of the ones I test as\nlong as the lugs are roughly similar in\ndistance apart which they tend to be\nobviously the ideal way to use it is to\nhone in on exactly the one watch you use\nI think it's probably in terms of style\nit works better with the slightly bigger\nchunky watches Something Like a Phoenix\nor even a 4 and a 965 no slapping on a\nlightweight watch like the cor you might\nwant to stick with an even more\nlightweight nylon band but this is still\nfairly light and like I say it's really\ncomfortable nice and secure and just an\ninteresting idea and something new with\nstraps with this kind of two band design\nwith the elastic strap on top of that\nFirma strap to give you both kind of\ncomfort and security and then my last\npick for this month I'm wearing right\nnow it's the saw rainbow long sleeve tea\nnow as of all s products it's pretty\nexpensive but I do love this tea both in\nterms of looks and how it feels on the\nrun it is \u00a3 105 people are always very\nangry about s prices but s gear is\nreally really nice and if you're looking\nfor you a splash out gift I really like\nthis t-shirt I love the design and I\nlike the feel of it on the run I first\npulled it on it a little bit tight\naround the chest I was wondering about\nthe fit a little bit but actually that\nhasn't been the case I've used it a\ncouple of runs now you've got really\nnice freedom of movement in the arms you\ngot the classic sleeve design where\nyou've got complete Freedom there for\nfast running I say a fairly close fit\naround the chest but a comfortable one\nand one that you know it's great for\nruns of any distance as we hit long\nsleeve season I've used this as a top by\nitself and under a jacket so you can use\nobviously as a layering option or as\nyour only top when it's slightly milder\nas you'd expect breathes really well is\nvery comfortable fits good and has this\nfantastic design so really your main\nreason you're buying this one is for the\nrainbow design which I think is one of\nthe nicest ones saw has done and as like\nI said a really big lavish gift to give\nto someone at Christmas if you are\nreally looking to treat the runner in\nyour life so that is a saw long sleeve\nprinted te te definitely go for the\nrainbow version there's another color\nwhich is fun but yeah the rainbow one is\nthe one to go for for\nsure now a relative newcomer to my kit\nis this jacket 114 G it's lightweight\nit's got taped waterproof seams it uses\nan ultra thin triple layer fabric system\nand it kind of beads off all but the\nvery worst downpours it's a really nice\nwelcome barrier Against the Wind now\nit's not going to keep you warm in the\ncoldest conditions but it is an\nexcellent kind of backup layer for when\nyou're moving with purpose on your runs\nit packs down small enough to stash into\na running belt it comes with a strap for\nEasy carry and it's waterproof to the\n20,000 hydrostatic rating which meets\nmandatory race equipment requirements\nwhich a big thing it's sadly missing\nPockets so it lacks a bit of stash space\nand you need to watch the age and sizing\non this which comes up small I've been\nrunning in an extra large when I'd\nusually be a medium I think I probably\ncould get away with the large this one\ncomes up even a bit baggy in the extra\nlarge next up I've got the body light\nnight vision light now my runs will\noften take me from the city streets\nwhere it's lit onto dark off-road River\npaths I also lead the fortnightly hid\npar runners run club for the Mandarin\nOriental in Hyde Park which right now\nwe're running around pitch dark hide\nPark in London for those pitch black\nsessions I tend to be a head torch\nwearer but you can look like a little\nbit of a Wally running around London\nstreets with your head torch on and I\nthink this is a really good alternative\nI think it will also suit a wider group\nof Runners much better too perap don't\nwant to wear a head torch they want\nsomething that's a bit more comfortable\nnow the body light night vision light\ncan be attached to clothes to bags it's\nit's velcro it can be linked to a\nrunning belt it's a bit like kind of\nsticking your head torch around your\nwaist one of the biggest things it's\nincredibly bright with a strong fixed\nbeam beam out ahead the beam will burn\nfor 2 hours on high or 9 hours on low or\n14 hours with the Blinky red light it's\nUSBC rechargeable it weighs around 78 G\nso it's not too heavy the added bonus\nhere as well is that it doesn't get\nsweaty like a head torch can so it's a\nbit nicer if you want to give it to\nother people to use you can kind of swap\nit between Runners everyone I've seen\nuse one of these has really loved it we\nhave lots of people comeing to the Run\nclub and we've never used one before and\nthey're all kind of impressed by it now\nI've always done a lot of run commuting\nin these days if I'm going to a meeting\nup to 10 km away if I can get away with\nit I'm going to run to it I've tested\ndozens of running packs over the years\nfor runners World men's fitness stuff\nmagazine all those titles and the Run\ntesters of course and hands down one of\nmy all-time favorites is this omm Ultra\n12 liter pack such a well balanced bag\nwith just enough space to take a laptop\nand a change of clothes but doesn't feel\nbaggy and floaty if you haven't got that\nmuch kit in there the harness is really\ncomfortable it's got nice padded straps\ndoesn't bounce locks in Nice in place\nthat's made easy with the adjustable\nsternum straps there's not a huge amount\nof got of pocket space overall you get\none at the top here and you get one side\nzip pocket with some stretch mesh stash\nPockets to the side as well uh ideally\nI'd really like two zipper Pockets at\nwaist level I'd like them a bit further\naround the front there's also no upfront\nbottle storage so I wouldn't use this I\ndon't think for an ultra for racing at\nleast but for the everyday commute or\nlong day Adventures on the trails where\nyou're going to stop and take your bag\noff this bag is my go-to and I think\nit's pretty reasonably priced too I've\nbeen using mine for close to 3 years\nlonger now and it's still going strong\nnow I've mentioned cxp run XP running\nunderwear or Bas layer shorts before and\nall the cxp gear I think is excellent\nbut I swear by the cxp endurance XP for\nmy very longest runs like the 100 mile\nBerlin Wall Ultra need to follow the\nsame cxp blueprint you get this\nincredibly light soft smooth pliable\nfabric that has a supportive second skin\nfeel without feeling restrictive the\nwaistband is kind of pretty wide but\nit's really flat and soft and it stays\nput while being flexible and enough to\nkind of avoid cutting in you've got\nchafe beating Flats seams on the inside\nplenty of support for all your important\nbits the other benefit of the thin\nfabric is that you can wear them under\nalmost any shorts they dry fast these\nones come in five and 7in legs the 7in\nhave um silicone grips on the legs to\nhelp them secure them a bit as well and\nthen finally I've got a few stocking\nfillers first one I've got is two Tom SP\nShield excellent anti-chafe roll on Lube\nthe best going in my opinion Runners\nwill love this keep them cha free I've\nalso got these Precision Fuel and\nhydration chews I love these little\ncubes good texture that's a bit chewy\nbut not too much hard work easy to carry\nand you're packing 30 G of carbs in each\nlittle belt friendly block which is Ace\nthen finally we've got the chorus HRM\nheart rate strap which goes on the arm\nyou can wear on the bicep it's a good\nalternative to a chest strap pretty good\naccuracy bit more convenient for some\npeople to wear and Link in with their\nwatch if they don't want to wear a chest\nstrap and that would make a really handy\ngift for someone who wants to increase\nthe accuracy of their run\nstats I've stolen the first idea from a\ncouple of friends of mine who've got\nthese they're called Notch bracelets you\ncan get them for all different sports\nbut they have um a kind of a rope type\nbracelet or ankler or however you want\nto wear it you can get them as key rings\nas well and you choose your color of\nrope it looks a bit like climbing rope\nand then you get these little notches or\ncircles which go around the edge of the\nrope and you add them in um as you get\nachievements so you pay originally for\nthe bracelet and then you pay extra for\nall the different little notches that\nyou get and there's official ones for\nlike Park runs various marathons you can\nalso get them personalized and it's one\nof those things where um the actual\nprice of it feels maybe like you know\nnot that cheap for what it is although\nyou pay a lot more for bracelets um but\nit's something where it's like a little\nbit different and it's something that\nyou can keep adding to and giving so it\nmakes a nice thing that you can carry on\ngifting them as well and it's one of\nthose things where it's just like it's\nsomething that you can kind of want to\ntreat yourself so it's a really nice\nidea as a Christmas present something\nmaybe you wouldn't buy yourself but\nsomeone might buy for you and you can\nmake it as masculine or as feminine or\nas whatever as you want and you can\npersonalize it as much as you want and I\nreally like it cuz it kind of to me is\nlike the runner version of those\nPandora's bracelets that some ladies\nlike with like the little charms and\nthings where you have like different\nlife events and stuff and my teammates\nyou have it it's great because every\ntime they do something which they think\nis a big enough achievement they add it\non and then they've got that and it\nstays on they can run with it on it's\nreally durable you can shower with it\neverything like that it's not um it's\nnot delicate at all it's very durable\nand it's very easy to put on and off so\nI think it's a great idea because it's\njust something to celebrate what you've\ndone it's a little bit of a treat and\nit's a bit different as well something\nelse something new I always like to\nrecommend a book for the christm gift\nguide cuz I just think like there's\nalways moments at Christmas when you\nwant to sit around and read a book um\nbut also something that you can kind of\nkeep coming back to so this year is uh\nLucy watero is The Ultimate Guide to\npark run um Lucy is a qualified running\ncoach um and I think this is great\nbecause there's bound to be people that\nyou know who are into parkrun and if\nyou're a super ke Runner and you've been\ndoing park run for years and you're\ngetting like crazy Fast Times there\nstill stuff about like the history of\npark run like how it started with just\n13 runners in Bushy Park and it was all\nmarketed just on emails and things like\nthat and how moof far won one of them\nbefore he became famous um things like\nthat and then there's all the kind of\nstuff from part run around the world\ndifferent things that have changed over\nthe years the benefits of volunteering\nand all the different volunteer roles\nhow people have set up new part runs and\nhow you go about that if you're\ninterested in that and then also at the\nback because the lady he's written is a\nqualified coach um she's got a bunch of\ntraining plans as well so for sort of I\nthink it's like a sub 30 a sub uh 25 and\na sub 20 as well um and I think it's\njust it's just a really interesting read\nit's kind of one of these ones there's\nlots and lots of different sections of\nit so it covers so many different things\nlike a day in the life of park run as\nwell so you can kind of get a behind the\nscenes kind of vibe if you've just\nalways rocked up and run it maybe um it\ncovers so many different bits but it\ndoesn't go into like massive detail on\nanything so it's a lovely kind of one\njust to like chip in and out of and it's\njust really enjoyable it's got a lovely\nkind of presentation nice color photos\nall that kind of thing so it's like a\nbeautiful book to give to someone but\nit's also really interesting on various\ndifferent levels so that is by Lucy\nwatero she's um a ghost writer she's\nwritten like Neil McAndrews book and\nvarious other things as well um and a\nqualified running coach and it's about\n12 to 15 pounds depending on where you\nbuy it from if I hadn't already shelled\nout my own C Cold Hard Cash for one of\nthese I'd be ask for this for Christmas\nit's a choros armband heart rate monitor\num it's great for people who love data\nbut it's also good if it's someone new\nwho needs to run to heart rate to make\nsure they don't go too hard too soon or\nmaybe someone you know who is prone to\novertraining and they need to learn to\nmodify their efforts it's great for that\nit switches itself on when you put it on\nyour arm um it's not restrictive like a\nheart uh like a chest Bas one and so\ntherefore you're more likely to use it\nmore which is therefore more useful it\ndoesn't have any of that kind of like\ncold with a drop off like you get on a\nwrist based one it's just much much more\nreliable it recharges on this little\nmagnetic setup and it's got a battery\nhour of 38 hours in activity mode 80\nDays in standby mode 2 hours to fully\ncharge that's fine it's got like four\ndetectors so it's pretty you know as I\nsay it's pretty reliable um and I just\nthink it works really well I've been\nusing it like every day and I would\nhearly recommend\nit and finally my honorable mention cuz\nI've banged on about this so many times\nbut it is the body light waist light\nbelt which I just love so much and I use\nall the time and I just think it's one\nof the most useful things you can have\nyou charge it by USB it's got various\ndifferent brightnesses and flashy lights\nand it's just so useful and unless\nyou're running in the mountains and you\nneed like a super high Lumen um head\ntorch this is perfect and it doesn't\nbounce around and give you a headache\nwhen you're running in the dark\n[Music]\nmy first pick this month is socks socks\nalways make great Christmas gifts\nespecially if you're a runner because\nthey can be a bit pricey and a lot of\npeople don't want to spend loads of\nmoney on socks but it's really great to\nget them as a gift because they're the\ngift that keeps on giving and they're\nnot that expensive if you're buying them\nas a Christmas gift these are monkey\nsocks we have featured monkey socks in a\nprevious video I've only recently\nstarted testing Mony socks and I\nabsolutely love them the designs are\nfantastic there's loads and loads of\ndifferent designs on the website uh\nthey're really comfortable they have a\nlittle bit of compression in the top so\nit holds on to your ankles nice and\ncomfortably they're quite breathable\nthey've got a nice level of padding\naround all of the of the key areas of\nthe foot um but they're also fairly lean\nin most areas as well so I'm going to be\nusing these to race Valencia on Sunday\num because quite often when you wear\nraay shoes they're a little bit um more\nuh restrictive on the feet so it's nicer\nto wear thinner sock with uh some raay\nshoes and these are absolutely perfect\nfor that but they're still very\ncomfortable and they have plenty of\npadding on them as well also if you buy\nmonkey socks 50% of the profits go to\nmultiple curosis uh Charities uh which\nis a nice little added bonus um from a\nrunning sock brand they've got loads of\ndifferent versions on the website\ndifferent lengths um of material on them\nuh and you can also get a subscription\nand you can get um packs of socks as\nwell so well worth looking at if you're\ngoing to buy a runner something but you\ndon't want to break the bank with it but\nyou want to buy something really good\nthat's going to last them a long long\ntime my next pick is a pricey one but\nit's a pricey one for a reason it's the\nuh saw wtech top it's fairly new to um\nuh being available on the saw website uh\nI've had similar versions of this in the\npast and I absolutely love this top the\nreason I like it so much is that uh it's\nquite it's quite a thick material on\nhere but it's very very breathable it\nkeeps you really really warm when you're\nout running it's very very very\ncomfortable to wear it's got a nice zip\non the front so when you get hot you can\nunzip it a bit but the idea behind this\nthis top is that the fabric is really\nreally warm when you need it to be but\nit's also breathable as well it's one of\nmy favorite running tops to use in the\nwinter and what I always say about so is\nwhen my friends my friends birthdays or\nanything I always try and buy a sore\nitem for them because they keep it for\nabsolutely ages uh I've got friends who\nwe've got sore um kit for for a birthday\n3 years ago and they still use that kit\nas their as their kit so it may seem\nexpensive um but it's the sort of kit\nthat a runner in your life will just\nlove to use all the time and it will be\nin their wardrobe for a very long time\nso uh even though it's pricey it does\nlast it's very well made um and very\ncomfortable it has other features as\nwell it's got a a pocket on the back\nwhich isn't massive but very useful if\nyou want to put your cards in or your\nkeys or anything like that it also has\nantibacterial properties which is very\nuseful if you do a lot of running and\nyou're sweating a lot and you forget to\nwash things um and also a big plus point\nfor me not a major um design Innovation\nbut it has um thumb hooks in it and I\nmuch prefer tops with thumb hooks on\nwhen I go out running in the cold okay\nmy last pick isn't that pricey but I\nabsolutely love this I bought this\nearlier on of the year it's the keni uh\nwindproof uh sleeveless jacket now this\nis\n\u00a315 um I bought it back in February I\nuse it all the time it's like a really\nthin gilet um and it's got this sort of\nmesh covering under the arm as well it\njust takes the edge off when you're\ngoing out for a run quite often when I\ngo out for a run in the autumn in the\nspring I open the door and I think oh I\nneed a jacket it's a bit it's a bit\nchilly and then when when I actually get\nout I realize that I really shouldn't\nhave worn a jacket at all and I'm just\nsweating the whole way this because it's\nsleeveless you can put a t-shirt on with\nit put this over the top arms may be a\nlittle bit chilly when you just go out\nthe door um but by the time you get out\nthere and you warm up it's really good\ncuz it really keeps the wind off the\nchest but it doesn't make you really hot\ncuz it's quite a thin material\nuh it's got hood on it as well so it\nreally takes the edge off when you get\nout there um just until you need it then\nyou can pop the pop the hood down open\nthe open the zip up and it works really\nreally well it doesn't overheat you too\nmuch um so really really like this\nreally rate this for \u00a315 it's one of the\nbest pieces of Kit I've ever bought and\num yeah well worth well worth buying it\nfor somebody if you're looking for a\nsort of stocking filler uh or or just a\nreally good top that isn't that\nexpensive in comparison to a lot of the\nother items that are out there at the\nmoment and my last pick and I did this\ncouple of months ago but it's an amazing\nChristmas present if you're looking for\ngetting something for a runner who wants\nto show off their Marathon medals or\nhalf marathon medals it's they're\nactually stuck on my wall so you'll see\na cutaway of these but these are uh\nwooden medallions which you can get from\nvarious places you can get from Amazon\nyou can get them from Etsy um and you\ncan build them into whatever shape you\nwant on the wall as long as you're using\nthe hexagonal shapes um you can buy them\nin packs of uh two packs of six uh I've\ngot quite a few cuz I'm trying to build\nup all of my medals into this this big\num wall uh wooden thing but um it's\nquite nice if you only got six you can\njust do a nice row of six or design them\nhowever you want but they're a really\nnice way to uh to put up medals and you\ncan interchange them as well so you can\ntake the medals out when you've got a\nnew PB or you've done a new marathan and\nyou only want to have a certain number\non the wall so are worth picking those\nup as a gift if you have somebody who\nwants to show off their medals that's it\nfrom us thanks a lot for watching hope\nyou found something useful whether\nthat's a gift for somebody for Christmas\nor you just want to buy something for\nyour yourself if you're go to the catch\nbelow you can find a link to our podcast\nwhich comes out a couple of times each\nmonth and we'll catch you next time we\ndo a video\n[Music]",

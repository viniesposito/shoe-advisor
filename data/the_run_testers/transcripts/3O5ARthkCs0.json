  "text": "hello and welcome to the it might seem\nnever ending series on best running\nwatches that we are doing on the Run\ntesters which seemed like such a good\nidea and uh here we are four videos in\num this one will be quick we're going to\nkeep this one to the point I promise\nanyway it's mid-range watches today\nwhich I think right now is the hottest\nplace in the market it is so hot right\nnow there are four fantastic watches in\nthis area three came out this year\nyou're getting a whole load of value\nhere which I think is what makes them so\nexciting to me you're paying between 300\nand \u00a3400 \u00a3450 sometimes but yeah 300 to\n400 generally and you're getting now\nwatches that have nearly all the best\nfeatures across the Brand's range but\ncompared to high-end watches you\nprobably just miss out on really super\nlong battery life and then materials\nlike a lot of highend watches will have\nmetal bezels that kind of thing you're\nmore looking at plastic builds here\nthere always some bit of metal in play\nhere and there and there four watches in\nthis area that I think are worth\nshouting out we're going to talk through\neach of them ter that's the coros pace\nPro the Garmin for 2 65 the sunto race s\nand the polar Vantage M3 Kieran and Mike\nare here I didn't introduce them earlier\ncuz this point if you watch the other\nvideos you know we're here you know you\nknow they're always here and we're going\nto go for each of these watches in turn\nbasically try and highlight what the\ndifferences between them are why you\nmight go for one over the other because\nthey do have pretty similar feature sets\nthe price is all quite similar we'll\nstart with though the most expensive one\non paper which is the Garmin forigner\n265 this has been around the longest\nit's been one of the best running\nwatches on the market market for a while\nit's about 100 quid more I think on RP\nthan the other watches no 50 Quid 50 to\n100 more than the other watches in this\nvideo but is now often on sale because\nit is an older watch guys the Garin 4265\ngoing to come to you first Kieran why is\nthis such a great watch yeah I mean\nfirstly I've just seen today that the\nprice has dropped I think it's around\n\u00a3390 in the UK which makes it even\ngreater or more competitive with the\nother watches in this kind of lineup now\nbut for me it's just to watch the it\nkind of hits The Sweet Spot in terms of\nof the training recovery uh performance\nfeatures that you're going to get in a\nlightweight package with a pretty\ncompetitive battery life um you've got\nreally good kind of um General Health\ntools Amed screen is excellent I think\nwhat you're looking at here in a 265 is\na watch that generally speaking has\nenough Firepower to cover what most\nRunners would need you know you are\nlacking Maps um but there's most of the\nbells and whistles that you're going to\nwant to go and do I reckon sort of\ntraining for a mar\nin a compact package that I think also\nlooks quite good for the price as well\nwhat do you think this watch Mike what\nwould you single out about it compared\nto some of the others maybe yes I think\num in comparison to some of the other\nwatches we're going to be talking about\none of the key things here are the size\noptions you've got two size options for\nthe 265 so I tested 265s which is a\nsmaller version and and unlike some of\nthe other watches we talk about you've\ngot those kind of size options if you\nlike something a little bit smaller you\nhave the option here with the 265 range\nnow k has spoken about it you know the\n265 launch with the 965 it's one of\nthose first 4Runners with the AMOLED\ndisplays and I think what it's it's\ngiven us is a 4Runner with an amalo\ndisplay where the battery life is not\nhugely compromised and I think that's\nthe key thing for us and a lot of the\nthe other watches will be talking about\nyou're getting a you know a vibrant\ncolorful display you're getting things\nlike that kind of dual band kind of\nmultiband mode is as Garmin will call it\nand you know really good performance\nthere and you're getting you know a rich\narray of kind of Garmin smartwatch\nfeatures there as well so as a package\nif you like the idea of a running watch\nthat has that kind of Smartwatch\nfunctionality I think you know the 265\nand the 265s really kind of represents\nthat good kind of overall package in\nterms of what you're getting yeah\ndefinitely yeah so compared to the more\nexperience of gments maps is the big\nfeates you lose which you do get on the\nother mid-range watches in this video\nthey all have Maps but the 4 and a 265\ndoesn't but I think where it stands out\nmaybe compared to its competitors in\nthis video is I think the training\nanalysis and fact you get training\nreadiness on the 265 it's a really\nreally good level of training last you\nhave this watch it's all quite clearly\npresented it all makes sense intuitively\nit looks good on the watch as well and\nthe smart features are definitely A Cut\nAbove what you get from other brands you\ncan link up to streaming services with\nyour music storage if you want to do\nthat you have NFC payments you're not\ngetting that on your other watches in\nthis video and design I think is really\nnice I think this is probably my\nfavorite looking of the four watches\nwe're talking about here although it's\nall very personal because there are some\nprobably slightly more elegant watches\nto come but I really like the all\nplastic design of the 4Runner it's\nlightweight it looks good and you are\ntapping into basically the Garmin\necosystem which is really well\nestablished probably a little bit more\npolished than maybe the other brands and\nyou know regularly updated so that's a\n265 that's been around for a while the\nother watches have all come out this\nyear and basically undercut it on price\nand have added color maps and they're\nall you know really going at the king in\nthis area they've gone at the Garmin and\nthey haven't missed they're all very\ngood watches let's go on to the chorus\nPace Pro that's the one we're just\ntesting at the moment review to come\nsoon this is chorus's first AMOLED watch\nit's got maps on it it's also got a new\ndual band chipset compared to some other\nchorus watches in general it looks like\nall corus's best watch yet I think it's\nfair to say we recently gave an award in\nthe Run tester Awards we're all big fans\nof the watch but what you're getting\nhere maybe compared to other watches I\nguess is classic coros stuff like longer\nbattery life and you know a really\nlightweight design so who wants to go\nfirst on this one Mika we go to you\nfirst on this what do you like about the\ncoros pace Pro yeah I think it really\nkind of represent I think we've you know\nwe've seen with the pace three a really\nkind of strong good value watch now this\nis kind of moving away from a price\npoint of view in terms of what you're\ngoing to get with the pace Pro but I\nthink in terms of that that extra money\nthat you're getting on the P3 the\nfeatures that you're getting in return I\nthink you know it's worthy of paying\nthat extra amount of money I think\nsomething that's really stood out for me\nand you know talked about in in in our\nreview is the kind of performance side\nof things it's not just the performance\nin terms of the kind of run tracking I\nthink in terms of how the software kind\nof runs and I think that's kind of been\na key kind of difference for me in terms\nof my experience with the other\nmid-range watches that we've spoken\nabout and you just that software just\nrunning very slick very kind of smoothly\nyou know really no it when I've been\nkind of using the mapping support and I\nthink while the chorus watch maybe has a\nlittle bit of kind of catching up to do\nin terms of the presentation of kind of\ntraining analysis and the training\ninsights which we kind of really like on\nthe Garmin watch I think it's going it's\ngoing in the right direction and I think\ncrucially with that AMOLED display as\nits first watch the battery life it's\nvery good you know we've kind of really\nassociate that with corus's watches that\nyou know don't have an display and I\nfeel like it's really delivered strong\nbattery life I think they always on\ndisplay mode and kind of rais to wake so\nI think as a package it's a watch that I\nreally like using this year and I think\nthere's a lot to like from a tracking\nand a performance point of view yeah on\nthat bachel I've looking about of five\nsix days with the ORS on screen on\nactually longer at the moment because\nI'm not running so much CU spray my\nankle Kier what have you found about the\nbattery life and about the pace Pro in\ngeneral yeah I mean this has always been\na thing with me and ameds is just\nwaiting to the point where the battery\nlife is you know is almost it's\ncomparable with the older watches and\nthat's something that corus have really\ndone I think on outside of training so\nwhole day um without any training it was\nsuper stingy it burnt around 2% for the\nwhole day got 2% overnight burn as well\nwhich is really low for most watches go\na bit higher than that and a 1H hour run\nfor me in Max accuracy mode on this burn\njust 2% which is the best performance I\ngot out of any of these watches on test\nsuper stingy so if you look at the Gin 4\n265 that was around 5% for an hour so it\ndoes deliver that got Amed screen with a\nreally stingy performance which is great\nyou've also got a much longer overall\nGPS battery life so if you want to think\nabout doing crazy Ultras this one will\nprobably take you a bit further with an\nAMOLED screen I also I mean I it has\nsome limited sort of Smartwatch features\nI think that's one thing that you are\nlacking when you compare it to the 265\nthe other things I'm not entirely\nconvinced by the watch faces on there\nwhich are you know there's not many to\nchoose from they're not so customizable\nand I think they're not going to float\neveryone's boat you get more of there's\nmore kind of uh when it comes to the\nGarmin watches I know you guys really\nlike this and I'm I'm being a bit\nnegative here but when I compare it to\nsome of the other watches I do feel like\nit is a bit plastic and this is a kind\nof it's a two-sided coin right this\nbecause it makes it maybe feel a bit\ncheaper than some of the high end\nwatches for sure but it makes it really\nlightweight which I think of all the\nwatches on this it's it's super\ncomfortable to wear 24/7 so it's a bit\nof swings and roundabouts on that um\nyeah I 100% agree on that design thing\nso I even said it in the review we're\njust doing at the moment which is like I\nreally like the corus pce Pro Design but\nI think objectively it's probably not\nquite as nice as Des design as something\nlike the sunto or the polar in this\nvideo which just do have a slightly more\nelegant look and feel to them but yeah I\ndo like a very very you know lightweight\nplastic watch me\ntoo but that's the pce pro I like like K\nmentioned there like the Smartwatch\nfeatures are limited on this you got\nDrag and Drop Music which I think is\nalmost less useful than just having the\nmusic controls you get on the polar and\nthe sunto and yeah you can't customize\nthe watch faces enough that's a big bug\nb for me they won't shown weekly mileage\nwhich I like to see but otherwise I do\nthink is a user interface that I quite\nlike you know it is\nI think it's quite easy to use because\nthere's not as much on the watch as some\nothers so it does mean actually it's\nquite easy to navigate the menus but\nlet's move on now to the suto race s\nwhich is the cheapest of these watches\nin the UK I think their pric is more\nequal in the US but it's just a little\nbit cheaper with the sun race s you're\ngetting a steel bezel so you have got a\nlittle upgrade there you are getting you\nknow I think what feels like a slightly\nmore sturdy and well put together watch\nperhaps than the all plastic designs\nalthough you know none of these watches\nare broken for us or anything like that\num you're getting really good uel band\nGPS uh the heart actually I didn't find\nquite a good but you are getting maps on\nthis watch and this was the watch I\nthink that led the charge in\nundercutting Garmin in this area and it\ndid a really good job I think this is a\ngreat watch Kieran you've also been\ntesting the titanium version which is a\nbit pricier but both these watches have\nsimilar features and just nice designs\nright yeah I mean I've just literally\nbeen out and run with it just now I I\nreally like this and I think it's you\nknow I sort of said this in our other\nsort of highend watch is this cor sunto\nhave basically done a coros to you know\nthey've come in with a really kind of\nrich full featured watch but undercut\nthe price and made it definitely more\nattractive it's one that it's much more\neasy to recommend because of that\nbecause you're getting really good value\nhere I really like the looks I think it\nfeels nice on the wrist uh you've obious\ngot the big bright AMOLED screen the\nbattery life is good and competitive you\nknow that burned around 3% for for an\nhour long run for me which is kind of\nnot far off the choros as well uh music\ncontrols no offline Spotify that maybe\nsets it apart from the four and a 265\nI've had really good performance from\nthe Dual fre frequency GPS not hit and\nmiss with the optical heart rate but I\nhave that with all of the watches on\nthis list some works for some runs\nbetter than others I also just find the\nUA the UI sorry on sunto watch is not\nthe most intuitive compared to the\nothers but once you do dive into some of\nthe training analysis and stats I think\nthey're fairly well presented\nparticularly in the app comparatively so\nyeah I think there's a lot of plus\npoints here for this watch at a very\ngood\nprice yeah I agree with that Mike what\nyour thoughts on the RAC s yeah I think\nwe know we kind of saw it first with the\nc race which was really aggressively\npriced and then we got which I think was\na bit of a surprise with the cin race s\nand it's kind of brought that kind of\nprice down even more but still kind of\nretained that performance that we saw\nand we really liked on the S race I\nthink I agree with Kieran in the sense\nthat you know I think there's elements\nthat you know I'm not absolutely loved I\nthink it's got a little bit of work to\ndo in terms of presentation in terms of\nthe user interface it's not the only one\non this list that has things to probably\nwork on from a software point of view\nbut from that core performance it's all\nvery very good and I think there's areas\nto improve on I kind of quite like the\ndesign I think cinto before the race was\ngetting towards a design where where I\nthink you know you can tell that is a\nsunto watch it very much feels unique\nfrom that point of view and I kind of\nlike that that Soto's kind of tried to\ndo something a little bit different on\nthe design front and I think you're\ngetting a really good quality Amo\ndisplay I think mapping is is really\nstrong in terms of that support and yeah\nthe battery life for me with that AMOLED\ndisplay is very good good the Dual Band\num you know that best accuracy mode the\nbattery life performance is very good\nlike we saw with the cinto vertical the\ncinto race as well you know this has\nreally kind of changed the state of play\nwith mid-range watches and I think it's\nbeen a good thing because it's made the\nother watch brands that we've talked\nabout kind of act and you know bring\nother options and bringing those\nfeatures down from those High kind of\nPremium end watches into a more\naffordable package because you know we\ncan't all afford to spend 500 600 on a\nwatch but you're getting a lot of the\nfunctionality from a top end since a top\nend watch in something like the cinto r\ns now yeah fantastic watch actually one\nthat is on sale as well during Black\nFriday already which makes it even\nbetter value I think that is a key thing\nhere it is the best value of these\nwatches in the UK and you're really not\nlosing anything in terms of performance\nI'm not 100% sold on the user interface\nstuff like that find it a little bit\nmore Awkward to use and the design is\nyou know I think very very nice but like\nI say I like a all plastic watch but um\nI do think sunto is moving very fast to\nwork on upgrades and stuff like software\nas well so I do think it you know keeps\npushing forward you know really really\nstrong watch in this category as well as\nis the last watch here which is the\npolar Vantage M3 which again came out\nfairly recently was priced at exactly\nthe same price point I think in the US\nas the choros and the sunto but and then\nobviously the g a little bit more\nexpensive so in the UK they're all quite\nsimilar as well again got a really nice\nbright AMOLED screen you've got Maps\nyou've got a lot of the stuff you're\ngetting on the Polar Vantage V3 higher\nend watch which maybe has slightly more\nbattery life and slightly better\nmaterials but again you've got a metal\nbezel on this watch a really nice\nlooking watch I think really screen\nreally pops for me and yeah I think best\npolar I've tested forever the V3 and the\ngrit X2 Pro are great but they are not\npriced competitively I think compared to\ntheir Rivals whereas I do think the M3\nis priced exactly where it should be for\nsuch an impressive watch let's go to\nMike first on this one yeah I think you\nknow for me from the polar watches and\nthe polar range if I was picking a polar\nwatch this is the one that I would be\ngoing for now while you are I mean I\nthink the difference between this and\nthe volage 33 are not huge enough for me\nto say well I'm going to be going for\nthe volage 33 from a value point of view\nI think all the features that I would\nwant from a watch whether that's kind of\nyou know really good dual frequency\nsupport but getting that mapping which\nmaybe isn't the most detail and most\nfeature Rich in terms of mapping and\nnavigation support compared to some of\nthe other options here but as a package\neverything that I'd want from a\nmid-range watch is here with a polar I\nthink you know I really There's real\nelements of the training analysis and\ninsights that polar offer that I really\nlike I think again it's a little bit\nabout that presentation I think on the\nwatch and off the watch as well which\nthere's a lot of good stuff there but I\nthink ultimately have to dig around a\nlittle bit and I think you know it could\ndo a better job in terms of you know\nmaking that stuff a little bit more\nusable a little bit more readable\nglanceable but I think you know it's\nit's getting there and I think you know\nit you know if there if there wasn't any\nof these other watches that we talked\nabout it was just a POA you know it\nwould be a standout watch for us but you\nit's come out at a time where there are\nother very competitive mid-range watches\nand that is up against and you know\ntrying to pick between them is is\ndefinitely a challenge but polar's for\nme this is the best watch that I've in\nthe watch that I would be going for its\nrange yeah great definitely a stand out\nwith in po Kieran maybe if you could\nlook at how it compares to the other\nwatches in this video and where you\nthink it it excels or on on excels I\nreally like the the the polar Vantage M3\nI think this is kind of almost pushed\npolar on a bit and I one thing I really\nlike about it is that unified platform\nthat they've got now so the software is\nthe same as the Vantage V3 and the g X2\nPro so and I it sounds like polar are\ngoing to develop whatever new watches\ncome out on that platform and all the\nfeatures that are developed for those\nwatches will roll down across into the\nM3 so the one thing that you should be\ngetting with the M3 is almost like a\nfutureproof watch that's going to get\nbetter over time as other new features\narrive that's a big positive I I really\nlike some of the things that polar does\nthat are different and unique from other\npeople Hill split is one where you can\nsee you know time and and your\nperformance on different sort of\ndescents and climbs are like fuel wise\nthat helps you put together a fueling\nstrategy uh I really like the um the the\nrest and uh work feature for strength\ntraining that tells you based on heart\nrate when it's good to go again and do\nthe next set I think all those things\nare quite unique and quite interesting\nfrom Polar I had good performance from\nthe GPS the one area where I found a\nlittle bit sort of not so good was in\nthe heart rate again sort of struggled\nwith some of the runs particularly\ninterval runs it was quite a way off for\nme and that's a bit of a problem uh\nbattery life was not quite as good as\nyou get from the corus or the CTO as\nwell it was a bit higher I think it was\nbetween 4 to 6% for that kind of 1 hour\nrun\nin Max battery mode so or sorry Max\naccuracy mode so yeah I think there's a\nreally there's a lot to like here I do\nthink that you the polar flow tool as\nwell I think is really really capable\nbut I think it does feel intimidating to\nsome people they like Mike said I think\nthere might be a way of making that feel\nlike it's less for a coach and more for\na user yeah I think po had definitely\nsome work to do on presentation and the\nsoftware and it's my fear is it's work\nthat I think has been needed to be done\nfor a couple of years and actually it\nhasn't been done they're not really as\nfast as rolling up updates I think\nsometimes their software feels a little\nbit behind and the user experience is\nslightly negatively affected by that\nthere little things that I do find quite\nannoying about using a PO day today as\nmuch as I like this watch I just find it\nslightly more annoying than the others\nso I would probably put it behind them\nif I was ranking the four in this video\nbut you know a lot of stuff is that is\nobviously quite personal and most people\nbe using this watch in a vacuum they\nwon't be using it in comparison but I do\nthink it's slightly less well presented\nand you know a little bit um you know\nnot as fun and enjoyable to use as the\nothers but still a very good watch as\nare all these watches in this video\nhopefully there's a bit more clarity\nthere or maybe how you go about picking\nbetween them like you're not really\ngoing to go too far wrong this is lots\nof personal preference involved in this\nwhen we're talking about the ones that\nwe like more or less and that's really\nthe main watches in this area you could\nalso quickly look at the Apple Watch\nseries 10 which is a smartwatch in the\nmid-range area which obviously has a\nreally nice design a really nice\nSmartwatch design with Smartwatch\nfeatures that you don't get the level of\non these watches but isn't quite as good\na sports tracker without the extra\nbuttons and the Dual Band GPS you're\ngetting here and so yeah that's another\none chucking at the end there but we're\nnot going to talk about that it's\nalready too long we got we've talked\nabout the Apple watch 10 a lot in our\nbeginner's V video and I'm sure we'll\ntalk about it in our Smartwatch video as\nwell but I think we can wrap this one up\nthere guys yeah um unless you've got\nanything burning to say about these\nmid-range watches we talked about the\nmeril mo flight Nick that's the only\nthing I'm wondering yeah meril Mo flight\nis actually cheaper than all of these\nwatches you could actually buy two or\nthree or four pairs of Mer morph light\nso maybe maybe maybe consider that\neither way I think my favorite group of\nwatches at the moment these are the ones\nI'd probably be shopping in if I was\nbuying watch myself uh and they're\nreally good so cheers thanks bye see you\nlater see you perfect",

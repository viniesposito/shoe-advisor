  "text": "hello and welcome to the Run testers my\nname is Nick and this is our early\nreview of the Nike Pegasus\n[Music]\npremium so the Pegasus premium is an all\nnew addition to the Nike range the\nPegasus premium will sit at the top of\nthe Pegasus line above the Pegasus plus\nwhich is kind of a lightweight\nresponsive allrounder shoe that has a\nzoomx midsole and then the Pegasus 41 is\nthe entry level model the classic\nPegasus which has a mix of react ex and\nAir Zoom pods in its midso now if you\nremember all those phones that's\nimportant because the Pegasus premium\nuses all of them in its Mido which has\nthree layers it's a very high stack shoe\nit's the most expensive Pegasus shoe\nit's the heaviest Pegasus shoe and it's\nthe shoe with the highest stack in the\nrange and all around it's very very\ninteresting on paper so excited to get\nout for a couple of runs in it so far\nit's set to launch next year at the end\nof January in the UK it's going to cost\n18499 not sure on the US price as yet\nNike gives the weight as 320 G which\nwhich is kind of an average across the\nline my UK size 9 which is US size 10\nweighed in at 328 G or 11.6 o so you\nfair bit heavier than the Pegasus 41 and\nthe Pegasus plus because of this big\nstack heite which is 45 mm at the heel\n35 mm at the 4ot so the kind of classic\nPegasus 10 mm drop but a higher heel\nheight than we've seen before in the\nline obviously the main interest in the\nshoe is definitely much in the midsole\nbut looking at the other parts of the\nshoe the upper is an engineered mesh\nyou've got a bit of padding around the\ntongue and heill actually it's quite an\ninteresting almost duvet style tongue I\nfound it's quite soft and and thick but\nit's quite lightweight as well and\nyou've got fairly substantial heel\ncounter and a lot of padding around the\nheel of the shoe and the outside you got\npretty good rubber coverage aside from\nlong section down the middle of the shoe\nwhich is a slight cutout that shows off\nthe Air Zoom pod but at the heel and\nforef foot of the shoe you've got rubber\nin Nike's kind of typical waffle outsole\npattern in the midsole there are three\nlayers to this so the top layer is Nike\nzox foam this is the bouncy peber foam\nthat introduced on shoes like the\nvaporfly and alphafly Racing shoes is\nnow used in the Invincible and the\nPegasus plus as it's kind of bouncy\nlightweight responsive foam then you\nhave a fulllength Air Zoom pod running\nthrough the shoe which is the key\nInnovation I guess with the Pegasus\npremium Nike's been using this Air Zoom\ntechnology in pod form across lots of\nshoes for several years like you see in\nthe alphafly the hidden within the\nPegasus midsole as well the Pegasus 41\nthat is but now they've been able to\nform this continuous unit that runs the\nlength of the shoe that gives you that\nresponsive feeling all the way from heel\nto 4 foot also stabilizes what is quite\na high stack of foam underneath that you\nhave some react X foone which is the\nphone used in the Pegasus 41 and the\nInfiniti rn4 perhaps to try and\nstabilize the back of the shoe a bit\nmore and also give a bit more durability\nit's quite hard wearing Pham react X so\nPegasus premium was announced earlier\nthis year very exciting looking sh was\nvery interested to get out and tested it\nI have tested the Pegasus 41 and the\nPegasus plus as well done a couple of\nruns in the Pegasus premium so let's\ndive into how I found\nit first have a quick look at the fit\nand there's not much to say here it was\nall good in in my normal running shoe\nsize got uk9 here us10 that's the size\nI've used across Nike's range ever since\nI've been testing Nike shoes the same\nsize I have across the Pegasus and the\nPegasus plus and yeah got a good amount\nof room in the forf foot it's quite\ntapered design but that fits me quite\nwell I've got quite narrow foot I don't\nthink it's an especially narrow shoe\nthough good hold around the heel and\nmidfoot on my run so far so yeah no\nconcerns with the fit I would stick to\nyour normal running shoe size with the\nPegasus\n[Music]\npremium so far I've done two hourong\nruns in the Pegasus premium I've done\nboth of them at fairly easy Paces the\nodd pickup here and there the first one\nI did I've got a fairly fresh leg so I\nwas running a bit faster than the second\none when it was a full recovery run on\nvery heavy legs and yeah the shoe\ncertainly has a very interesting ride\nlike you do really feel the high stack\nand the combination of Foams in the mids\nsole in a way that is quite different to\nthe Pegasus plus and the Pegasus 41 so\nfeels very much like a shoe that is\nbuilt for cruising and just bouncing you\nalong like it doesn't feel like a super\nSpeedy shoe to me and you can feel the\nweight if you try and pick up the pace\nor when I was running uphill even at an\neasy pace you start to feel the weight\nof the shoe a little bit but if you are\non the flat or on a downhill you can get\ninto a really nice Rhythm hitting that\nbig stack of foam getting a nice amount\nof spring off and you know just really\nmoving along quite nicely and it feels\nfairly effortless at times despite the\nfact you know it is quite a big shoe of\nthe Foams in the Mido the one that I\nfelt the most was definitely that Air\nZoom unit which adds a bit of firmness\nfor sure and you stabilizes the rer it\ndoesn't feel like a for a high stack\nshoe like this doesn't feel like a very\nsoft and Squishy shoe to me like you're\nhitting that Zoom X which does compress\na fair bit then you hit the Air Zoom pod\nwhich you know gives you a lot of kind\nof bounce back and response as we've\nseen it in other shoes like the alphafly\neven when you hit the zoomx into the Pod\nyou then get that bounce back and now\nthat's running the full length of the\nshoe you don't get a really soft feeling\nat the heel but you do get moved quite\nsmoothly onto the forefoot and get a\nfair bit of response from that Air Zoom\nunit you do get a little bit of the\nnoise you kind of expect from Nike shoes\na pods in and you know Nike shoes in\ngeneral can be a bit Slappy it does have\nthat slight feel to it the one thing I\nnoticed with it compared to the Pegasus\nand the Pegasus plus was that these are\nall 10 mm shoes as a heel striker\nsometimes get a bit slap through when\nI'm running in a 10 mm shoe kind of\nslapping down on the foref foot you get\na little bit less of that at the Pegasus\npremium because of the high stack of\nFoams that kind of compressed together\nit almost feels like a slightly lower\ndrop shoe and you kind of get moved\nthrough a bit more smoothly onto that\nforefoot one thing I definitely noticed\nwith the shoe is it feels quite narrow\naround the midfoot of the shoe so for a\nreally high stack shoe like this with\nlot of Brands you'll get quite a wide\nbase on the bottom to make sure that\nthey're stable and hasn't happened with\nNike it's got quite a tapered midfoot on\nboth sides and your foot overhangs a\nlittle bit on the inside now the Air\nZoom unit does do I think quite a lot to\nhelp stabilize the shoe but I definitely\nthink if you are someone who uses a\nstability shoe or in general is a bit\nworried about it you should probably\nstay clear of the shoe because there's a\nlot of foam there and it does roll a\nlittle bit inwards like I'm a neutral\nRunner and didn't really notice it too\nmuch on the run but I feel like when I'm\nlooking at the cutaways of me running in\nthe shoe and that kind of thing it does\nfeel like yeah that's quite a narrow\nmidell for such a high stack shoe do\nthink stability might be a little bit of\na concern for people in the shoe again\nbecause of that high stack and narrow\nmidfoot so of the two runs I did in the\nyearo like I say one was on quite fresh\nlegs and one was on very heavy legs and\nI definitely prefer the Pegasus premium\nwhen I was a bit fresher it feels like\nyou can engage all those Foams a bit\nmore run a bit more with purpose get a\nbit more bounce back and when I was on\nvery heavy legs tired legs after a lot\nof like hard workouts I was using it as\na recovery run shoe it just felt you\nknow a bit too much shoe I wasn't\nturning over so well and as someone has\ngot a high Cadence I'm not the heaviest\nrunner in the world I wasn't really\nengaging all of those phones that well\nand I was just kind of plodding along so\nthat might be a bit different if you are\nsomeone who puts a bit more force in\nyou're slightly heavier Runner or\nsomeone who bounds a bit more you might\nget a bit more engagement from all those\nphones at kind of any Pace but yeah that\nthat on that run it a bit more just like\na big shoe still fine you know seems to\nprotect the legs pretty well but doesn't\nfeel like a shoe that's built for\nFlatout recovery like you might expect\nfrom a big high stack shoe like this\nwith this weight it feels more in the\nline of things like I guess the Puma\nmagmax or even the Hocus SC X like big\nheavy High stack shoes that are built to\nbe quite versatile though still like\nwith lots of stuff in the mid I'll try\nand help you bounce along and if you're\nnot getting all that bounce which I\nreally wasn't on that kind of recovery\nrun then then it doesn't feel so good\nbut when I was on like I say when I was\non kind of a more of a classic daily\ntraining run and just moving along a\nfairly relaxed pace it did feel like I\nwas getting a bit more spring back from\nthe\n[Music]\nshoe so very early verdict on the\nPegasus premium mostly is that I'm not\nexactly sure where I stand on the shoe\nstill like it is an interesting shoe it\nis got a bouncy ride it's got a very\ninteresting combination of Foams but\nit's a heavy shoe has that slight\nstability issue I think around the\nmidfoot with that narrow design but it\nwas fun to run in but I'm still not\nconvinced this a kind of shoe I would\npick myself for any runs compared to the\nother Pegasus models which probably suit\nmy running style a little bit better as\nmore lightweight shoes with kind of\nslight more Snappy design to them but\ncertainly an interesting shoe it\ndefinitely has a little bit of the ultra\nboost vibe to it in that it's a very\ngood looking shoe an interesting looking\nshoe that you want to wear around a\nstreet wear but then you can also run in\nI'll probably do a comparison of those\nshoes in time but the ultra boost for a\nlong time was very similarly heavy has\nnow come down a bit in weight but\ndoesn't really have I think the same\nlevel of kind of Bounce in it because it\ndoesn't have you know such impressive\nphones in the midy as you get on the\nPegasus premium but again two kind of\nsimilar shoes cool shoes can run in them\nas well so will be of interest to\nsneaker heads as well as Runners but\nwhen this shoe was initi announced there\nwas a little bit oh is this going to be\nNikes you know super training you've got\nthat Big Air Zoom pod you've got some\nzoomx foam in there is this going to you\nknow fill a gap in their lineup but\nthat's not really what I'm getting from\nthe shoe myself like the zoomfly 6 which\njust recently came out fills that Gap\nthat's an excellent super trainer I put\nin a lot of miles in that shoe over the\nlast week and a half and I'm really\nenjoying running it the Pegasus premium\ndoesn't feel like a fast versatile super\ntrainer like that shoe which compares to\nthings like the Hoka ma X2 or the\nEndorphin speed 4 doesn't really feel\nlike the ax super blast either which is\na plateless super trainer with the mega\nstack as well the Pegasus premium to me\ndefinitely feels more in line with shoes\nlike the Puma mag Max the hookus Skyward\nX maybe even like the Brooks Glycerin\nMax that are you know big Mega stack\nshoes designed to play more of a daily\ntraining role for people who maybe don't\nget on with those lower attack shoes and\nhave a lot of Bounce have a lot of\nprotection you know do a good job for\nthat and actually are quite versatile\nbecause all the stuff in the mids soole\nbut I think one thing that might count\nagainst it there is what I've been\ntalking about that midfoot stability\nwhereas you look at something like the\nglycerin Max it's very wide pum mag Max\nis very wide so is the Skyward X because\nwith a high stack they want to give\nstability as well as well as all that\ncushioning underfoot and that's not\nsomething Nike's gone for so much with\nthe Pegasus premium which is more of the\nclassic kind of Pegasus silhouette\ncertainly interesting shoe one I like I\nliked running in those first two times\nI've been looking forward to getting out\nand again but be interesting to see how\nit ends up being received elsewhere and\nhow it ends up comparing to the Pegasus\n41 and Pegasus plus which feel much more\nclassic daily trainers that will work\nfor lots more Runners the Pegasus\npremium probably will have slightly more\nNiche appeal I think in terms of the\nrunners who enjoy it the most and also\nthen there's people who might look at it\nas a nice crossover lifestyle running\nshoe\n[Music]\nthat's our first look at the Nike\nPegasus premium let us know what you\nthink in the comments below please like\nsubscribe ring the

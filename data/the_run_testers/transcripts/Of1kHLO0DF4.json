  "text": "hey this is M for the Run testers these\nare the sunto Sonic sunto second pair of\nopen air bone conduction headphones now\nmyself and Tom have both been long\ntesting the Sonic which are the\nfollow-up to the sunto wing which we\nreviewed on the channel last year now\nwith the Sonic there definitely are some\nchanges it definitely has paired down\nslim down those features and the design\nas well I'm going to take you through\nwhat you need to know about the Sonic\nhow it Compares and how it differs to\nthe wing get you into those important\nrunning thoughts and then let you know\nwhether you should buy the sunto Sonic\nwhether these are a good option for\nrunners and whether these are a good\nalternative to shock's extensive bone\nconduction open a\nrange so here's your load down on those\nkey cnos Sonic stats it's priced at \u00a3129\nin the UK or $149 in the US but can\ncurrently be found for \u00a385 in the UK\nfrom cino's own website that launch\nprice put sit up against other bone\nconduction headphones like the shocks\nopen run which is also dropped below its\n\u00a3130 launch price these are neckband\nstyle headphones with an IP 55 water\nresistant rating and weighing just\nslightly lighter than the pricier sunto\nWing you've got a set of physical\nbuttons and dual microphones to handle\ncalls with a mode to help combat windier\noutdoor conditions they use bone\nconduction with CTO adding in a new\ntransducer to boost base and reduce\nsound leakage overall there's two sound\nmodes available from the companion C app\nwhich also lets you enable pairing to\ntwo Bluetooth devices at the same time\nbattery life is up to 10 hours at 60%\nvolume with a quick charge mode included\nthough lacks the portable charging setup\nfeatured on the sunto\nwing so there's definitely going to be a\nlot of similarities with the shocks bone\nconduction headphones in this review the\nuh sunto Sonic very very similar to the\ndesign of most of the shocks headphones\num I as a result I really like it I'm a\nbig fan of the shocks Design This is\nalmost identical to the shocks design\nthe feel of them on the head the shape\nof them the way it fits against the ears\nand everything the design is very very\ncomparable uh and is a good design it's\na very it's a very nice design for Mo\nconduction headphones I've not had any\nissues with the fit or anything like\nthat found to be very comfortable um so\nno issues at all I think it's very very\ngood and if you're used to wearing\nshocks you'll you won't be surprised by\nthe Des design of these the controls\nequally very very similar to what you'd\nexpect from the shocks almost identical\nuh you've got this multifunction button\non the left hand side which is works\nreally really well I like it as it's\njust the right size it's very easy to\nfind when you're running um click it\nonce to pause it click a couple of times\nto skip the track works very well no\nproblems at all with that control the\nother controls on the other side they\nsit underneath um they're quite easy to\nfind I quite like the uh the shape and\nthe design of these buttons so you can\nturn it off quite easily and turn it on\nquite easily easily so for me controls\nare absolutely perfect for what you want\nfrom me it's very simple but you can\nactually use this um button on the left\nto do a lot more if you want to learn\nhow to do it um but really for most\npeople you can stick them on it's very\nvery easy to work out how to use these\nheadphones so in terms of design fit\nwhat it's like to wear the sunto Sonic I\nthink it's been very good for me overall\nno major issues to report these are kind\nof neckband style design headphones\nwhich are you know typically what we see\nfrom bone conduction phones in general\nit's kind of that wraparound style it's\ngot titanium in terms of that build and\nthen you've got some silicone to kind of\nmake sure it sits comfortably and not\nputting metal against the sides of your\nhead you've got some buttons here\nphysical buttons there's some on the\nunderside of the arms you've got ones\nfor kind of a volume rocker and the kind\nof onoff and pairing button and then\nyou've got a multi-function button here\nso very similar to what we see on\nshock's headphones in terms of his\ncontrols and I think from a shock's\npoint of view it's very similar in terms\nof experience of using those buttons\nslower and faster runs they're well\nposition and I think they're easy to\nkind of use\noverall they are pretty light and\ncomfortable I think the weight is very\nsimilar to what we got or get on the\nshocks open run they're a little bit\nlighter than the sunto wing headphones\nthere are some changes from the sunto\nwing from a design point of view you are\ngetting a downgrade in terms of the kind\nof overall durability so they're dust\nand sweat resistant you can't kind of\nrun them under a tap like you could with\nthe cin wing and they get a bit sweaty\nyou are I think probably more\nimportantly or a little bit more\ndisappointingly I would say is that\nyou're losing out on the kind of\nportable charger that we got with the\nsun wing which just made it a little bit\neasier to kind of charge it was still\nobviously a proprietary kind of charging\nsetup but just nice to kind of drop them\nin with the c wing and charge them and\nyou can charge them on the go it's a\npropriety charging cable but similar to\nwhat we see on um a lot of shock's\nheadphones so you know you're going to\nhave to have a carrier cable around to\ncharge these but from a design point of\nview been absolutely fine I think I said\nvery much keeping with other kind of\nopen a bone conduction neck band style\ndesign headphones you're just going to\nsee a downgrade and durability and\nlosing out on that charger or that kind\nof portable charger that you get with\nthe c\nWing okay so the sound quality of these\nthe sound quality of bone conduction\nheadphones recently has got a bit better\nand louder um it's not necessarily got\nbetter in terms of the the sound being\nsignificantly uh more enjoyable when\nyou're out the run but they have got l\nwith the shocks open run Pro I found\nthat I can actually listen to podcasts\nand things on those um with those\nheadphones now and it's fine unless I'm\non a ridiculously busy road uh so they\ndo uh these are comparable with the\nshocks open run Pro when it comes to\nsound levels I can listen to podcast\nwith these absolutely fine no issues at\nall uh I don't think the sound quality\nis as good as the open run Pro open run\nPro is more expensive so you would\nexpect that it's not not miles away I\nthink it is pretty comparable with the\nopen runs um but to be honest when it\ncomes to things like bass and stuff like\nthat I don't think it's got particularly\nimpressively wide range of sounds on the\nSonic but it's absolutely fine if you're\nlooking at this level of headphone uh\nyou're going to get you're not going to\nbe disappointed by the sound quality\nthat you're getting from the sunto Sonic\nI think it's very good um and definitely\na lot louder than I was expecting from\num from the headphones the other thing I\nsay as well is that because I'm always\nlistening to these at top volume because\nI'm whether I'm listening to music or if\nI'm listening to um audio books or\npodcasts uh I do get a lot of tickle and\nI don't get a tickle from the the recent\nopen run Pros uh which it's a bit\nannoying when you start off for the\nfirst uh maybe five minutes it's a bit\nannoying and you're sort of scratching\nyour ear a little bit because it's\ntingling uh it stops after a bit I\ndidn't notice it after on a longer run\nbut you do get a little bit more tickle\non these than you get on the shocks\nequivalents into that all important\nsound quality now these are bone\nconduction headphones so you're not\ngoing to get the best Sound Performance\nthat you would get from a you know an\ninair set of headphones or a kind of\nclosed a set of headphones you know\nwhere you're really going to be able to\nneutralize that sound you know going to\nbe battling with exterior sounds as much\nas you would do with a pair of bone\nconduction headphones this is about\ngiving you a balance keeping you aware\nof your surroundings and you know that's\nwhat the sunto Sonic like a lot of bone\nconduction headphones want to\nachieve now I think it's fair to say\nwith the cin Wing we were a little bit\ndisappointed with the Sound Performance\nparticularly considering how much those\nheadphones cost now the cnto Sonic is a\nbit more competitively priced against\nother bone conduction headphones there\nare some changes here in terms of how it\ndelives that bone conduction sounds\nthere is a change in terms of the\ntransducers that sunto is using here\nthat is integral to the process of\ndelivering that bone conduction and how\nthat bone conduction technology works\nyou know TR translating vibrations up\nthat go up towards your cheekbones up\ntowards your ears and you know\ndelivering or converting that into sound\nso with that new transducer cnto is\npromising enhanced base performance and\nalso reduced uh kind of noise leakage as\nwell compared to the sunto wing they\nalso get into different sound modes\nwhich was similar to what we had on the\nwing so you've got a normal mode which\nis generally for that kind of everyday\nscenario mainly for using them indoors\nif you're going to use them indoors then\nyou've got an outdoor mode which is\npretty self-explanatory what that does\nis kind of elevate the overall loudness\nand you should see a little bit more in\nof That Bass Performance as well well\nnow in terms of the sound quality here\non the sunto Sonic I would say that it\nhas been better for me than the sunto\nwing I think it's a bit more in keeping\nwith headphones like the shocks open run\nthere's a few other cheaper Brands like\nHalo which I've used and I think it's\nvery much in keeping with that sound is\nit as good as those headphones in terms\nof over sound quality I wouldn't say\nthat I would say that it definitely is a\nlittle bit more balanced than the cinto\nwing I definitely think when you are\noutside you need to to use that outdoor\nmode it does give you that kind of\nnotable kind of uptake in terms of\nvolume I think there is a little bit of\na better kind of Base performance as\nwell there is a little bit more of that\nRumble terms of that base you're getting\nthat bone conduction kind of vibration\nand kind of tickle that you do get a\nlouder volumes but it's you know not as\nsevere as I've experienced on other\nheadphones so that's that's a good thing\nas well here I think in terms of the you\nknow I you know I listen to a range of\nthings I run kind of more Tempo stuff I\ndo listen to podcast as well and I think\nin terms of handling those\nkind of things they've been absolutely\nfine for me would I say there has the\nsame level of clarity and finesse as\nthings like the shocks open run pro pro\ntwo the Bose Ultra open possibly not but\nI think it's not too far off probably\njust below that for me but overall it's\nbeen very enjoyable to use these I felt\nlike the have felt more balanced and\noverall just delivering a slightly\nbetter sound than the sunto wing\ndefinitely much in keeping with\nheadphones that sit around the price of\nthe cinto wing I think talk about\nconnectivity you are getting some U\nmultipoint um connectivities you can\npair them to two devices at the same\ntime you got to enable that in the app I\nthink connectivity across devices have\nbeen fine for me I've used it with an\niPhone I've used it with an Android\nphone I've used it paired to a Garmin\nwatch an Apple Watch and connectivity\nacross the board has been very good for\nme so you know no kind of issues for me\non that side of things in terms of\nthings like that reduced noise leakage\nyou are still going to get some at Le\nleakage here with these headphones you\nknow whether it is you know better I\nthink it's there's a small amount in it\nbut you know these are ultimately going\nto be headphones that you know are going\nto leak some sound I think the other\nthing to talk about here is the kind of\nvibrations you get all that kind of we\nknow it as bone conduction tickle so\nwhen you kind of listen at louder\nvolumes you kind of see the vibration of\nthe technology and I do think you still\nget that a little bit louder volumes\nit's not too severe or wasn't severe in\nthe sense that I you know it felt\nuncomfortable to use them but that's\nsomething to keep in mind with these\nheadphones I think in bone conduction\nheadphones in general but it you know it\nwasn't too bad but there definitely is\nsome of that vibration tickle to contain\nwith here on the cinto\nSonic battery life I have had a problem\nwith with these so um I've been using\nthese for quite a long time now probably\nabout two or three months um and I've\nused them for a lot of runs recently\nI've been training for Valencia Marathon\nso I've been doing a lot of long runs uh\nand the last one I did was a three-hour\nlong run um and what I found is even\nthough these were fully charged they ran\nout at about 2 and 1 half hours uh which\ngoes quite far against the 10hour\nbattery life that I was expecting um\npreviously when I've been out for the\nRun uh they haven't run out um but what\nI've heard is this uh it gives you a\nnotification saying the battery's going\nlow and I have heard that a few times\nwhen I've been out the Run even though\nI've charged it um so I'm presuming that\nthe reason for that or partly the reason\nfor that is that I've been listening at\nfull volume the whole time but that does\nseem like a pretty big drop from that 10\nhours that you'd be expecting from these\nbecause when it comes to the shocks ones\nI always listen to to those at full\nvolume as well and they're much closer\nto the full battery life that they\nstayed so battery life on the sunto\nSonic has been pretty good for me hasn't\nbeen outstanding hasn't been you know\nhasn't been groundbreaking in terms of\npushing the boundaries of what we can\nexpect from bone conduction headphones\nnow CTO promises up to 10 hours and that\nis with you know when you're listing at\nkind of 60% volume so not at your full\nvolume and why that is crucial is that\nwhen you are list at louder volumes and\nthis is kind of applicable to all bone\nconduction headphones is that you know\nyou will see a more severe drop in\nbattery life now when you are listening\nat kind of 60% volume which is not very\nloud and when I've done that for kind of\nan hour's worth of running the drop has\nbeen about 10% so that kind of does add\nup but you know a lot of the times I\nwould listen at much louder volume\nparticularly when you are using them\noutside for\nruns and it's definitely going to see\nthat battery life or overall battery\nlife drop to probably kind of 6 to 7\nhours so that is a bit further off that\nkind of 10 hours and that's something to\nkeep in mind here I think if you are\nrunning throughout the week then you\nknow it's probably going to be fine if\nyou're doing you know 30 minutes to an\nhour and maybe you know a few times a\nweek it's probably going to be\nabsolutely fine but yeah you know when\nyou are listening at louder volumes the\nbattery life drop is going to be more\nsevere crucially you do have a fast\ncharge mode which does help in terms of\nyou know when you are seeing that kind\nof um kind of more severe battery drop\nyou have a very good effective f\ncharging mode here as I said you don't\nget that kind of charging portable\ncharger that you do get with the sunto\nwing but if you can live with that and\nyou can use that and happy to use that\nkind of propriety charging cable you are\ngoing to get a fast charging mode which\nmeans and if you do forget to charge\nthem it's not going to take long to kind\nof power them up and give you enough for\na few hours of\nrunning so my verdict on the sunto Sonic\nI think they're very good I think if\nyou're comparing these with the more\npremium um bone conduction headphones\nare out the moment which would be the\nshocks open run the shocks open run Pros\na lot more expensive than these so there\nit's more expensive level of of quality\nand sound and everything that you're\ngetting but if you're comparing them\nwith the open runs very similar uh I\nthink if you're a big fan of uh sunto\nand you like the design of these the the\ngreen they do come in a couple of other\ncolors as well I don't think there's a\nlot you're missing out on by getting\nthese over the shocks open runs but the\nproblem is that is that battery life and\nand I I I don't even use these for my\nlong runs now because I'm having that\nproblem with with the battery life um I\nhad a pretty boring run when I was out\ndoing that three-hour run CU I had half\nan hour of just running listening to my\nown thoughts so um I would say that\napart from that battery life These are\ncomparable with shocks open run and I'd\nbe happy with getting either of those\nbut because of the battery life it's a\nit's a bit of a loss for me on these so\num it might be an issue with my ones um\nI'm not sure if Mike's had the same\nproblem but because of that I'm not a\nbig fan of using these for any run over\nlike an hour and a half so my view on\nthe sunto Sonic on whether these are a\ngood option for runners is that I would\nsay these are a better option for\nrunners than the sunto wing which I\nthink with the sunto wing sunto got the\nprice pretty wrong I think they were too\nexpensive and they didn't deliver enough\nin terms of the Sound Performance and\neverything else and all those kind of\nextra features that you got now with the\nsunto Sonic it stripped things back but\nI think in return you are getting a\nlighter more comfortable you know set of\nBon uction headphones I think the sound\nquality is a lot better and More in\nkeeping with the\ncompetition now are these better than\nshock's headphones things like the Bose\nUltra open which are obviously more\nexpensive than the sunto Sonic from a\nSound Performance I don't think they are\nI think they're just below things like\nthe shocks open run Pro open run open\nrun Pro two and the Bose Ultra open if\nyou want Balan kind of clear very\nversatile sound and I think those other\nheadphones are going to get you there I\nthink these sit just below below those\nheadphones but my experience has been\nvery good overall with them and as I\nsaid I do think it is a Improvement on\nwhat we got on the cin Wing the key\nthing for me here is the price now I've\nseen these drop to \u00a385 I think they're\nkind of sitting there \u00a385 at the moment\nif you can pick them up for below \u00a31\nthen I think they're well worth picking\nup particularly if you didn't want to\nspend as much money on a pair of shocks\nheadphones as I tell I think they're\nprobably closest to things like these\nshocks open run but if you can't get\nthose for less than1 and you looking for\nan alternative I think absolutely go for\nthese from a design comfort point of\nview the sound quality the battery life\nconnectivity side of things you're\ngetting a lot that's very good here on\nthe cinto Sonic so I do think these are\na good option for runners if you can get\nthem for Less than100 where they are sat\nout of the moment absolutely a good\noption are they better than the best\nhere in this category possibly not but I\nthink they are much better kind of\nalternative to those headphones\nparticularly when you see what we got\nwith the sunto win so there you have it\nthat is our multitester take on the\nsunto Sonic now if you got any questions\nabout these headphones or any other\nrunning headphones that we've tested on\nthe channel maybe want to see how this\ncompares to another pair do let us know\nin the comments as always like And\nsubscribe hit that little bell to find\nout about our latest videos and yeah\nwe'll see you for the next one Test's\nvideo",

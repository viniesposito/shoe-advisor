  "text": "hey this is mar run testers and it is my\nturn to pick my top five favorite new\nrunning shoe launches of 2024 now we\nhave recently just done our run testers\nAwards which is very much our Collective\ntake on our favorite running shoes I'll\nput a link to the winners up here now\nthis is very much the shoes that have\nreally impressed me these are the shoes\nthat I've Loved when we reviewed them or\nhad them in for review these are the\nshoes that I've Loved training in for\nraces these are the shoes I racing in\nthese are the shoes that I've been\ndesperate to get back out in when I've\nhad some spare time when we've not been\ntesting other shoes now it has been a\nvery busy year of shoe launches there\nhave definitely been some shoes that\nI've kind of considered for this video\nthat have just narly missed out but I\nhave now got down to my top five and\nthese are across a range of kind of uses\nand shoes that you know I think they\nreally impressed me over the past 12\nmonths so without further ado these are\nmy top five favorite new running shoe\nlaunches of\n2024 so in at number five is this the\nNew Balance Rebel V4 now this is a shoe\nthat I would describe as one that when I\nreviewed it you know I absolutely loved\nit and you know months later you know\nthe end of the year I'm still loving\nthis shoe and wanting to trade in it now\nthis launched in January I think in the\nUS first went Global a month later I\nthink it landed for me probably a few\nmonths out from doing London Marathon\nwhich I was going to or use the new B SE\nElite V4 and there's definitely more\nHallmarks of the SE Elite V4 in the new\nB Rebel V4 which I really like I think\nmakes it a good kind of training\ncompanion with that shoe and I think a\ngood training companion nonplaced\ntraining companion for other carbon\nRacing shoes as well what I liked about\nit first and foremost is the weight I\nlove a lightweight kind of daily Trainer\nshoe and that's absolutely what you get\nhere with the rebel V4 it's got that\nkind of phantom fit upper that we get on\nthe SE Elite V for as well which I\nreally liked I think makes it a very\neasy shoe to get on as well and I think\nyou know having that kind of very you\nknow thin kind of lightweight upper\nmakes a huge difference for me in terms\nof wanting to be out in this shoe now\nyou've also got that kind of fuel cell\nmidsole here as I said you're not\ngetting a carbon plate you're not\ngetting a plate at all but I still do\nthink you get a shoe that very much\nwants you to run a little bit more Up\nTempo and that's been my experience of\nrunning in these shoes a shoe that I\nwould use if I wanted to do a kind of\nfaster kind of training run and this is\na shoe that absolutely would do it now\nwhat I would say is it probably isn't a\nshoe that I would want to do massively\nlong mileage in but I think for kind of\nyou know mid distance runs and mid\ndistance training sessions it's been an\nideal shoe to get I think pricing wise\nit's pretty good as well too it's kind\nof1\n13040 and I think that's a very good\nprice foro that I think you could race\nin I think you could do a lot of your\nfaster sessions in and I think you know\nfrom a durability point of view it's\ngoing to be able to handle a lot of\nmileage so in at number five is the new\nBS Rebel V4\nso in number four is a shoe a little bit\non the new bounce Rebel V4 it's one that\nI really loved when we first reviewed it\nand it's a shoe that continued to use\nthroughout the year this is a shoe that\nwe described as being very comfortable\nvery protective and I think very fun to\nrun and I think that's a key thing for\nme because you know running should be\nfun and you should want to enjoy that\ntime you're out there running whether\nit's shorter or longer runs now that\nshoe is this one the Hawker skywood X\nnow the the other shoe that was in\ncontention for this spot was the saky\nhurricane 24 but this just edged it out\nfor me I think this has been a shoe that\nas I said as one I've you know I've\nenjoyed running out throughout the year\nand we talked a little bit about it in\nour kind of run testers Awards I think\nhawker's had a very good strong year and\nI think cruci is because and I talked\nabout it is that you know you know\nhaving shoes that are just fun to run in\nand I think that definitely applies to\nmy time in the Skyward X now this is a\nMax stack kind of cushion shoe and that\nhas definitely been a trend from all\nrunning Brands this year I do think this\nis a standout one in that category now\nis a heavy shoe but I've never felt it's\nbeen a cumbersome shoe to run in it's a\nmore accommodating roomy shoe than most\nother hacker shoes I think you know if\nyou've always found hacker shoes to be a\nbit on the narrow side this is one that\nreally is a departure from that kind of\nmore narrow fit I think you know it's\njust as I said it's a fun shoe to run in\nwhat Hawker has done in this mid there\nis a c plate in here I think you know I\nhave found it's being a good shoe I can\ngo out and run on really tired legs you\nknow I can do long runs I have done long\nruns and marathon training runs where if\nI've wanted to go run a little bit\nquicker maybe more moderate Paces this\nis a shoe that I found comfortable to do\nthat and again overall I think it's been\na fun shoe to run in it is a for me a\nstandout Max stack cushion shoe that I\nthink has a little bit more versatility\nthan most other shoes maybe not super\nblast versatility but I do think there\nis for easy recovery runs and moderate\nruns it's been a shoe that I've enjoyed\nrunning in so definitely one that I've\nenjoyed running throughout the year in\nthat is the Hawker Skyward\nX so into my top three shoes of 2024\nwe're getting into some Racing shoes I\nthink for me are the most exciting shoes\nto test and there's been a lot of good\nones throughout the year that have\nlaunched now it was a tossup between two\nshoes for me for this top three spot and\nI think the one that's just missed out\nfor me has been the diara gar carbon I\nthink for a couple of reasons it's more\nexpensive as a kind of top tier carbon\nracing shoe I've really enjoyed running\nthat shoe but I've done a little bit\nmore racing in the other shoe that I'm\ngoing to pick I'm definitely looking\nforward to seeing what diodora does next\nyear and I think the gar carbon has been\na really strong launch for diodora this\nyear but the one I've gone for my pick\nand in the third spot is this the Puma\ndb8 Nitro Elite 3 now as I said this is\na shoe that I've done a lot more racing\nI've done shorter distances I've done a\nhalf marathon race and myself and Tom\ndid the Manchester half in this shoe now\nthis is a very good shoe I think the\nprevious dvh shoes I think were good\ncarbon Racing shoes but I don't think\nthey really kind of sat with those top\ntier ones that is definitely a different\nstory with the Puma DV8 Nitro Elite 2\nwhat I also like is that it is cheaper\nthan those top tier carbon RAC shoes or\nmost of them it is below \u00a3200 and if you\nwere looking to spend on a high quality\nkind of you know Carbon racing shoe and\nyou didn't want to spend over2 200 this\nis the shoe that I would be going for\nwhat I like about it you know first you\nknow ticks those key boxes for me in\nterms of a carbon racing shoot it is\nsuper light it's super easy to kind of\nget on no issues in terms of comfort no\nissues in terms of heel rub you know\nthis you know just enough kind of\npadding in that Hill collar and just\nenough in terms of that wrap of that\nupper which you know still gives you\nthat kind of racing style fit but just\nfeels like a traditional kind of running\nshoot as well from that point of view\nthe change in the midsole really just\nelevates what you get from the P d89 TR\ncompared to its previous versions and it\njust feels like a lively propulsive\naggressive shoe to run in but also a\npretty stable controlled shoe to run in\nI think you know particularly compared\nto some other carbon Racing shoes I\nthink basicly when I did the kind of\nshorter distance races it felt very good\nat the shorter distances at the half\nmarathon kind of distance as well it\nfelt fantastic and I think if I had a\nmarathon coming up this would definitely\nbe a shoe that I would consider because\nI think right now pummer has got a\nracing shoe here that really kind of\ncompetes with the best there and as I\nsaid it comes in less than the\ncompetition and I think if you were\nlooking for a carbon racing shoe that I\nthink you know is light is propulsive\nand aggressive has a good outsole and\njust fits very well and you know is\ncheaper than the Alternatives P DV8\nNitro Elite 3 had really impressed me\nthis year com in later launch later this\nyear but I think you know it's been well\nworth the waight and I think it's a\nmassive Improvement for the DV8 Nitro\nElite 2 and now finally Puma has a\nracing shoe to compete with the very\nbest so in it number two is my favorite\ndo it all shoe that is the dream I think\nultimately if you can find a shoe that\ncan cover all of your runs that's you\nknow I think what everyone wants not\neveryone has the ability or the money to\nspend on a rotation and this is a shoe I\nthink for me that you know since I've\nreviewed it since I've had it into test\nit's shoe that probably I've used the\nmost and it is a shoe that I think can\nhandle easy recovery runs can handle\nkind of faster runs I've used for track\nI think this is a shoe I feel\ncomfortable racing in I think would work\nfor a marathon as well and half\nmarathons and that shoe and it's\nprobably going to be no massive surprise\nfor a lot of people is this shoe the ax\nsuper Blast 2 which I know is very\ndifficult to get a hold of and is very\nexpensive particularly compared to other\nkind of daily trainer style shoes but I\ndo think it's worth the money if you can\nget a hold of it now this is my second\nvers version of the shoe I had the\nallwhite version which unfortunately got\nstolen so I do have an additional pair\nand I've managed to very quickly kind of\nrack up the miles in the ax super my my\nsecond version of it and it as I said it\nhas just been a shoe which I think know\nticks a lot of the key boxes what I like\nabout it is that for a shoe that is a\npretty you know kind of well stacked\nshoe it is nice and light and it's kind\nof daily trainer style light in terms of\nthat weight I think in terms of that\nexperience of being out on it what aex\nhas done with the midsole with what\nyou're getting from the out soole as\nwell in terms that control in terms that\nversatility in the shoe and terms of\nbeing a shoe I think and I've kind of\nmentioned this in other videos though\nthe key for me with a a shoe like this\nwhich says that it can work for\neverything is that how for me it\ntransitions between different Paces I\nthink you know if I was out doing an\neasy Pace run I'm want to run more Tempo\ni' you know I feel most comfortable\ndoing it in this shoe I have done in\nthis shoe as I said I've done some\nracing this shoe this is a shoe if I was\ngoing away and I didn't really know what\nI was kind of running I was going to be\ndoing this is a shoe that I know I can\ndo it you know I've done want have gone\naway and wanted to do a quick park run I\nknow I could be wearing this shoe you\nknow traveling I know this is could be a\nshoe that I can race in or if I wanted\nto go and do a long Sunday run if I'm\naway from a weekend this is a shoe that\nI know is going to deliver a very good\nexperience now as I said I know this is\na hard to get a hold of shoe I know it's\nexpensive particularly compared to other\ndaily trainer shoes but I do think for\nme the as an all-in-one shoe a do it all\nshoe the best shoe that I've you know in\nthat category that I've used this year\nhas been this the Asic super Blast 2\nit's absolutely a standout shoe and one\nI've absolutely loved running in as I\nsaid it's the one that probably spent\nmost time running in post when we first\nreviewed\nit so we get to my number one pick for\ntop running shoe launch of 20124 and\nagain it was a tossup between two shoes\nfor that top spot and the shoe that has\nmissed out for me is the aex Met speed\nSky Paris which I think we can all agree\nin a team is a fantastic racing shoe and\nwhat it is in premium carbon racing shoe\nit is a fantastic one and it really\nrepresents the progress that aex has\nmade with the Met Speed Line and it's a\nshoe that absolutely I've enjoyed\nrunning in now the shoe that I've opted\nfor over the Met speed Sky Paris is a\nshoe that launched early in the year\nagain a little bit like the super Blast\n2 it's probably the shoe that I've\nreached for I've look forward to\nreaching for the most it a shoe that I\nthink represents Innovation for this\nbrand I think this is a shoe that\nrepresents a you know just being a fun\nshoe to run in as well and I think\nthat's been really important for me just\nfind really enjoyable fun shoes to run\nin and the shoe that I have picked for\nmy top spot is this and that is the haa\ncell X1 and this was the one of the\nfirst kind of carbon Racing shoes that\nlaunched this year very fortunate to\nhave them in two versions and I'm glad\nthat I do have two versions two vers of\nthis shoe because this is a shoe I think\nfor me that you know as I said I think\nHaw has had a really strong year and I\nthink it's had a strong year because\nit's really tried to do something\ndifferent with it shoes I think it's\nrecognized it's had to do things\ndifferently I think it showed good\nprogress in terms of the you know the\nmidsole technology that it's using in\nits shoes I think for me the cell X1\nreally represents that I think you know\nit isn't the perfect shoe you know\nthere's definitely some things to work\non and we know there is a an upgraded\nversion coming with the\nyellow the laces aren't perfect but I\nthink everything else about it makes it\na fantastic enjoyable shoe to run and\nwhen this landed I was you know getting\nto my kind of long training runs for\nLondon marathon and I did some of my\nfavorite you know long kind of 20 mile\nruns in this shoe it is bouncy it's\nLively you just roll through really\nnicely and I think you know the Hallmark\nof really good carbon you know shoe is\nthat you know your legs don't feel\nbeaten up that's really what it's about\nyou roll through really nicely and\nthat's what I've liked about the cell X1\nyou know I love it for long kind of you\nknow more uptempo faster runs I've used\nthem for track sessions I think you can\nRAC in this shoe if I had a marathon I\nthink this would be the shoe that I\nwould be looking to use I think it would\nbe a close one between the metas speed\nSky Paris and the pummer deviate Nitro\nLe 3 which I think for me are the\nstandout kind of marathon shoes that\nI've used but there's just something\nabout the cx1 that I just every time I\nput it on I just know I'm going to have\na good time in this shoe and I talked\nabout that fun element and that is\ndefinitely what I would associate with\nthe c X1 and my time in C X1 so yeah it\nis an expensive shoe a lot of the you\nknow Carbon ring shoes are but I think\nfor me the one that stood out for me\nfrom the first run that I've done to all\nthe runs I've done in it since and as I\nsaid being you Innovative being fun\nbeing a great long run shoe that is the\nshoe that I've enjoyed running in the\nmost this year so that is the Haw yell\nX1 a fantastic shoe I think again really\nmarks the strongly year that hawy has\nhad this year with its shoes and the\ncell X1 I think really represents that\nfor me and for me is my top running shoe\npick of 2024 okay so they have it those\nare my top five favorite new running\nshoot launches of 2024 and as I said at\nthe beginning of this video don't forget\nto check out Tom Kieran and Nick's top\nfive picks as well and

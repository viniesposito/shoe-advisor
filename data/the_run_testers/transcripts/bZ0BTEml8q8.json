  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand now I've done the requisite test\nmiles in the Adidas Supernova rise 2\nit's a daily trainer that Adidas says\nwould make a great work course it's\nbuilt to eat a wide range of your\nregular daily runs I'm here to give you\nthe verdict on this second gen shoe how\ndoes this stack up against the rest of\nthe day trainers out there let's get\ninto\nit quick details then the ads Supernova\nrise sticks with the same relatively\nconservative stack at least by today's\nstandards the snack comes in at 36 Ms in\nthe hill 26 and the 4T for a 10 mil drop\nit weighs in at 9.6 o or 272 g in my\nmen's UK and a half Adidas said it has\nshave 4% off the weight versus the first\ngen but those come in at 9.7 or 275 G in\nthe teso so I'm not quite seeing that\nbut coming in under 10 ounces I would\nsay sort of keeps Supernova rise fairly\ncompetitive on weight price-wise things\nstay the same with the Adidas Supernova\nrise too coming at \u00a3130 or $140 that's\nnow towards the cheaper end of the daily\ntrainer shelves\nlet's give you a quick shoe whip round\nand Adidas pites the Supernova as a\nneutral everyday shoe a starting point\ndaily training that could be good as an\noption for beginners the updates to the\nAdidas Supernova rise 2 are minimal and\nlargely restricted to the uppers where\nAdidas has tried to boost comfort and\nsave weight that includes new mesh\nuppers less padding in the heel though\nthat's quite hard to see versus The\nOriginals thinner tongues and some\nsofter eye stays here the midsole unit\nstays the same it sticks with PE based\ndream strike plus midso foam that's made\nfrom a small percentage of recycled\nmaterials that dream strike plus has\nsome of the bounce of a performance foam\nbut not the full energy of a super foam\nthere's also a highly rocked for foot\nand what Adidas calls it support Rod\nsystem a set of visible rods that follow\nthe metat tassels and add some stiffness\nand spring up top the Supernova rise has\na new mesh upper that's marginally\nthinner and a little less structured\nacross the toe box for an upper that's\nnot unlike a nimbus 26 the heel colors\nare still really well padded\nparticularly at the back there are quite\nstiff heel counters to enhance the\nsupport and heel hold you've also still\ngot pretty well padded traditional\ntongues with no gusting if you flip them\nover there's a generous covering of\ndurable adwar Rubber and overall this is\na shoe that screams long mile\ndurability when it comes to fit and\ntesting I ran in my regular Adidas\nrunning shoe size which is a UK and a\nhalf and I found these fit well true to\nsize they're not the Rous shoes there's\nsome of that Adidas narrowness that you\nget but overall they're roomy enough\njust about enough we them in the toe box\nfor good Comfort it was easy to get them\nlaced up and locked in and comfortably\nkind of held across the foot midfoot\nlockdown was generally good no problems\nwith the heel slipping they got pretty\ngenerous padded heel CS that hold the\nheel nicely in place I felt well held\ngenerally overall and ran in good\ncomfort with no trouble at all so based\non that I would recommend going true to\nsize onto the run test then in testing\nI've covered a good 50 km in the\nSupernova rise 2 across a range of Paces\nwith a majority of those miles on the\nroad now unsurprisingly because the\nmidsole unit is largely identical to the\nrise one not much has changed Under Foot\nthat's good news if you like the\noriginal shoe the big changes here have\ncome in the uppers with tweaks to the\nheel package and the tongues in a bit to\nmake the shoe more comfortable but\nlighter as well that didn't really\nregister me in terms of weight on the\nscales and I didn't really notice a big\nshift in terms of how they felt on the\nfoot with the weight though overall I\ndidn't find these a particularly heavy\nshoe in the first generation myself but\nwhen it comes to the ride the rice 2\nserves up a more traditional feel Under\nFoot with a dream strike plus Stack The\nBu comparison now is looking quite low\nparticularly when you're looking into\n2025 shoes it's getting higher the\nresult is just enough softness to take\nthe edge off the road but you will feel\nmore ground coming up than with a lot of\nthe bigger stack dieses that we're\nseeing there is also a bit of stiffness\nand snap to the shoe I quite like that\npersonally they also feel a little bit\nmore Compact and a bit less on the foot\nsome of the other bigger shoes that\nwe're seeing there's a kind of Puma\nvelocity or Brooks ghost glycerin\nagility to these shoes part that comes\nfrom the narrower platform that feels\nmore precise than the likes of the Nova\nblast or a nimus or a Triumph across the\nmiles I ran in testing though the most\nimportant sensation was that immediacy\nfrom the midsole the phone compresses a\nlittle it's quite a firm feeling\nunderfoot and then it returns back quite\nquickly it's a more Snappy and\nresponsive ride than a soft and bouncy\nenergy again that you might get from\nother daily trainers so the shoe runs\nbest I think when you're running with a\nquick foot turnover Landing mid to 4\nfoot rather than further back on your\nheels and heavy and when you're moving\nat a slightly faster Pace with lighter\nfeet lighter quicker feet that's when it\nperforms\nbest verdict then and I think the Adidas\nSupernova rise to is one of those shoes\nit's a competent fairly versatile shoe\nthat will happily eat miles at a range\nof Paces though I think it's best at\ncruising pace for me now Adidas has\npegged this as a shoe that's good for\nbeginner Runners who are looking for a\nWorkhorse daily trainer that can cover a\nlot of runs and sort of definitely soak\nup that 80% of your easy runs but in a\nworld where shoes now pack much more\nsoftness and cushion More Bounce and\nenergy from higher stacks and sort of\ncomfort overall for easy runs I'm just\nnot sure everyone is going to like the\nway this is a bit more traditional now\nwhen you put it up against some other\ndaily trainers like the Nova blast 5 or\nyou start looking at the really\nversatile super trainers that we're\ngetting now though they're much more\nexpensive this shoe does feel a little\nbit tame now in some ways I personally\nreally like that for me it's got SOC\nride 17 Vibes there's a sort of Safety\nand Security to it if you like a shoe\nwith less cushion more ground feel\nthat's a bit snappier then I think this\ncould be a good option it offers a much\nmore connected ride that brings with it\na good stability a good reliability to\nThe Landings and it's consistent even if\nit comes up a little bit more direct and\nit isn't the most exciting now \u00a330 the\nrise to I think also is quite\ncompetitively priced shoes are\nincreasing unfortunately but overall I\npersonally think the Adidas Supernova\nPrima it's a bit smoother it's somewhat\nmore lively it probably has a bit more\nversatility and for the extra 20 that\nyou'd pay I think it's probably worth\nlooking at the Prima over this shoe but\nagain if you like a traditional ride\nthen this one might fit the bill for\nyou so there you have it that's been my\nreview of the that's Supernova rise to I\nhope you found it useful let me know if\nyou've run in the one or the two and\nwhat you made of them tell us in the\ncomments below what's your go-to work\ncourse daily shoe if you're after a good\nallrounder I'm going to pop a video up\non the channel now that you should\ndefinitely go and watch otherwise thanks\nvery much for stopping by and until next\ntime happy running people",

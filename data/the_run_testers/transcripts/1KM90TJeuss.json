  "text": "hey this is Mike for the rers and it is\nthe day after my final race of 2024 the\nrun through batter SE Park 5K where\nthere was also a 10k race taking place\nnow we know this race and rout pretty\nwell we've done previous race tests\nthere and this was really my opportunity\nto do one last race test and a shoe that\nI've been desperate to racing but just\nhaven't had the opportunity to do that\nand that shoe that I'm talking about is\nthis shoe the deodora gar carbon\ndefinitely one of the surprise shoe\nlaunches of\n2024 now what I'm going to do is take\nyou through how I've got in in that race\nhow the deodor gar carbon fed and then\ntalk about some other kit that I was\nalso testing for that little run out\naround Battery Park now thanks to run\nthrough for providing the entry to the\nrace and as always an imly organized\nrace to take part in so let's get into\nit\n[Music]\nso a little bit about the route and the\nrace itself now as mentioned this is one\nthat we know pretty well and I think if\nyou race and run around London you\nprobably know the route very well now as\nI was doing the 5K variant of this race\nI had to do two laps of the course now\nthis was a run through chase the moon\nevent so it's an evening race like other\nevents at the evening at this time of\nthe year lighting particularly in Parts\ncan be a little bit challenging but I\nwould say overall it was very good for\nthis race and it hasn't always been the\ncase some races this is what I've done\nthese chase the moon events where some\nof these sections of the course you know\nprobably need or could do a little bit\nmore lighting but for this one it was\nvery good now the course itself is very\nflat and quick there's a reason why you\nknow a lot of people go and do the B SE\npar parkr which is recently being\nintroduced and it is a fast 5k 10k race\nto do now apart from a few turns they're\nreally kind of kind of straight so you\ncan really kind of kick on and hit your\nyou know your quickest Pace here now in\nterms of how I did I ran 2053 I think\nthere was a lot of quick 5K runners in\nthat race and you not my quickest this\nyear my quickest was back in April when\nI did the aex and 5K race out in Paris\nbut very happy with that time means\nthere's still some some kind of running\nkind of speed in those legs kind of\nwhere I need to be at this time of the\nyear so yeah you know it's a course that\nI've liked I know it's a one and yeah it\nfelt pretty good and my legs felt pretty\ngood and that race not my quickest but\ndefinitely happy with the time so into\nthe shoe testing now in terms of my kind\nof shorter distance running with the gar\ncarbon I have done some kind of kind of\nquicker Park kind of outings with it and\nit kind of FedEd very well from that\npoint of view now this was a good flat\nkind of quick course to kind of see what\nit was really made of and I feel like it\nreally held up from that point of view I\nthink what I like about the gar carbon\nparticularly at this distance is that it\nis a light shoe you know when you look\nat it against some other carbon Racing\nshoes but has a little bit more heft to\nthem it definitely feels more geared\ntowards longer distances the gar carbon\na little bit like the metas speed Sky\nParis a little bit like the pum dev8\nNitro Elite 3 has a very good weight for\nshorter distance running now in terms of\nthat feel of running at my 5K Pace in\nthis shoot it feels very good to do it's\nvery Lively when you look at how that\nmidsole feel just kind of squeezing into\nit it's very squishy and squash but it\ndoesn't feel like you know you're\nsinking into it too much there you've\ngot that c plate and I think the\nplacement of the C plate works very well\nthere and the riding it is very\ncomfortable I would say first and\nforemost but there's an aggression there\nas well too there's some propulsive\nfeeling there as well that's kind of\nwhat you want and you know I do feel\nlike you know it holds that well over or\ndid hold that well over that distance\nand never felt like it lost that and it\nnever felt uncomfortable it never felt\ntoo you know unstable for me uh in that\nrace and I feel like there's there's\nreal qualities I really like about the\ngar carbon and I feel particularly at\nthat shorter distance I think the key\nthings I probably don't absolutely love\nabout this shoe I think more so I\nprobably want to see tweak because I do\nthink the upper could be worked out a\nlittle bit more I think it could the\nprofile for it could sit a little bit\ncloser I think there's it's clearly a\nbalance to try and make it room and\nspacious for longer distances but also\ngiving you that kind of racing profile\nfit and I do think it kind of gets that\nbalance right but I think maybe it still\ncould refine things on that front\nbecause I think everything else kind of\nworks there for me you know I I feel\nlike it's you know a really nice fast\nlightweight shoot to run in I feel like\nthe ride really you know feels like it's\nbuilt for racing and that's kind of was\nmy experience and has been my experience\nin previous testing in this shoe as well\nso for me while it wasn't my quickest 5K\nrace time it definitely felt well you\nknow at home at that 5K race Pace or\nnear to my you know kind of best 5K race\npace and really enjoy running it in and\nracing in it in that race so yeah for me\nyou know definitely a shoe that I do\nfeel that can work those shorter\ndistances a one that I felt was a good\nmatch for that\n[Music]\nrace so some quick thoughts on some\nother kit that I was testing so the\nother big thing that was you know the\nfirst time I was testing were these\nheadphones and these are the new Sony\nlink buds open now we've tested the\nprevious link buds before and the\nare you know open ear kind of truly\nwirless airbuds that are about keeping\nyour listening safe and you know still\nkeeping you tune your surroundings now\nwe did really like the Sony link buds I\nthink for me you know once I got the fit\nto work for me I think the sound\nperforman is really good but you know\nwe've seen a lot happen in that space\nyou know since the link buds have come\nout you know we've got the bows Ultra\nopen you know the shocks open fit and\nopen Fit air and there's definitely\nother options out there outside of the\nSony link buds and the key difference\nfor me with the link buds open is that\nyou've still got that kind of ringed\nkind of donut shaped design but you've\nnow got an air hook to improve that fit\nand I always found that if you didn't\nget that fit absolutely fine with the\nprevious link buds then you know there\nwas a tendency that it could feel unsafe\nor unsecure and may have a tendency to\nfall out I think that's definitely been\na different case for me that first test\nnow I did have some initial concerned\nwhether they were going to stay put as I\ngot going but actually no issues\nwhatsoever in terms of the fit the Sound\nPerformance is actually really good for\nme now I was playing around with the U\nThe Sound Performance as I was traveling\nto the race and you know you have a\ncompanion app and I do think you need to\nuse that companion app well there's a\nlot going on in that companion app but\nthere's an EQ um or presets um for eqs\nthere that I do think are worth digging\ninto to get the most rewarding sound\nfrom the Sony link buds open because out\nof the box they don't sound you know\nparticularly you know better than some\nof those other um airbuds that I've\nspoken about but once I did do that and\nas I said the fit was very good for me\nin that race I'd be interested to see\nhow they' fair over longer distances\nwhether that you know Comfort is there\nover longer distances as well but for me\nfrom a fit point of view and the sound\nquality and battery life performance it\nall looked very good for me from the Sun\nlink buds open so in terms of other\nthings I was testing it was more a case\nof additional testing with the chus pace\nPro and the chus pace 3 now we've got a\ncomparison video with those two watches\ncoming up on the channel but this is my\nopportunity to do or use them for a\nracing scenario and what I found is from\na GPS point of view the carus pace Pro\nactually performed better for me it was\ncloser to that 5K distance and what that\nmeant was things like pacing was a\nlittle bit more accurate I think battery\nlife generally was pretty good the drop\noff I'd expect to see is a little bit\nmore drop off on the carspace pro simply\nbecause it's got that Amal display and\nthat's kind of what I'd expect to see\npretty short distance race so I wouldn't\nexpect to see a massive drop but there\nwas maybe a little bit more on the Pace\nPro really it was a kind of additional\nGPS test for me and the pace Pro came\nout on top so yeah generally some very\ngood testing uh from that race the did\norara carbon still you know a shoe\nthat's really kind of left a really good\nimpression for me this year in my\nrunning and now racing a good kind of\nfirst run with the Sony link buds open\nand more good testing with the chus pace\nPro against the caros pace 3 okay so\nthey have it a 5K race test with the\ndeor gar alongside a first run with the\nSony link buds open and some additional\ntesting with the cars Pace Pro versus\nthe pace 3 now if you got any questions\nabout any of that kit that I've talked\nabout in this video do let us know in\nthe comments as always like And\nsubscribe hit that little bell to find\nout about latest videos and yeah we'll\nsee you the next run test this video\n[Music]",

  "text": "hey people welcome to the run test as\nit's Kieran here now if you watch the\nchannel a lot you'll might know that I\nlike to take some shoes that aren't\ncarbon marathon Race shoes for a\nmarathon test to find out how they cope\nover the 26.2 miles there are some shoes\nthat some people who are just looking\nfor good reliability and comfort maybe\nwith a little bit of energy over the\n26.2 rather than a shoe that they're\ngoing to race all out in uh they'll be\nlooking for that kind of shoe one of\nthose shoes I've got on my feet right\nnow is the Nova blast 5 from aex I think\nthis is potentially a race shoe for a\nlot of people who be sort of cruising\naround Marathon so I'm going to now take\nit for a solo 26.2 around the Streets of\nLondon to find out what it's made of see\nhow it copes the way I'm going to break\nthis down is I will do some easy I'll do\nsome at marathon pace I'll do some slow\ntowards the end but the real aim is to\nfind out how these shoes cope when you\nget to mile 20 of a marathon when the\nrace really starts it's very easy to\ntest a shoe and think it might be a\nmarathan shoe and say that in the first\nsix miles but how does it COPE in the\nlast six we're going to go and find out\nI've also got a little bit of a hangover\nit was my Christmas drinks yesterday so\num yeah it's going to be a proper test\nthis one anyway let's go do it\n[Music]\nso I'm give you a bit of context it's\nSunday uh it's pretty mild uh I've got a\nbit of a hangover but the plan here is\nI'm running up to hide park I'm going to\nrun a route I would normally do I do 6\nmiles up to where the big end of year\nRun route starts I'll run the 13 miles\nthe big end of year run and then I'll\nadd on the rest of the on miles on the\nway home so it's going to be around the\nparks of London and the Streets of\nLondon I'm tired not particularly\nfeeling Marathon ready this morning but\nwe're going to give it a go anyway so\ntired legs tired brain be a really good\ntest for the no blast 5 to see if\nthey've got that energy that you need\nwhen you're in that kind of mode where\nthey're protected when I'm running a bit\nheavier and in terms of the pacing I'm\ngoing to start out around 8 Minute miles\nmaybe a bit slower for the first six\nI'll then crank it up a little bit maybe\nto a 7 and a half if I can for another\nsix at some point I'll hit some miles\nthat a marathon pce which for me would\nbe around sevens right now I think maybe\nbreaking into the\nsixes and then for the last miles I'll\njust see what's left basically I'm\nanticipating it's going to be a big old\nslog for the last 10 just the way I'm\nfeeling so that'll be a really good test\nfor the no blast 5 to see what you get\nthem do they give me a little bit extra\nwhen I need it or they protect me so\nyeah we're a couple miles in making our\nway up to hi Park yeah I'll be filming\nlittle bits along the way in intervals\nto tell you how the shoes are performing\nat different points how they've got on\nwith those different changes of pace so\nanyway currently digging in trying to\nget myself into a rhythm\n[Music]\nso I've run the first seven in about an\nhour and yeah taking it fairly easy in\nterms of the pace but I am struggling a\nbit it's finding it a bit heavy it's so\nfar for those miles where I've been\nrunning easy bit bit heavy I think it's\nwhat we said in the review what I found\nin the review is the shoes they do feel\na little soggy they're not giving you a\nhuge amount I don't find of energy back\nso I'm still having to do all the work\nhere I would like a little more I\nhaven't asked that kind of upper Pace\nquestion of them yet I will be doing\nthat very soon but for those first seven\nmiles where I've just been kind of\ncruising along easy the shoes have\nperformed\n[Music]\nso I've ticked over 9 and 1 half miles\nand what to say about the shoes in the\nfirst kind of third of that marathon is\nwell they've done pretty much what I\nthought they would do which is they've\noffered a lot of cushion protection and\ncomfort they feel quite light on the\nfoot I was pretty heavy in those first\nmiles I think it's going to be a pretty\nheavy Marathon overall and what I got in\nthe review I'm getting here from the\noverlast 5 which is when you're feeling\na little bit sluggish and a bit heavy\nthat cushion it feels like it's sort of\nacting as a bit more gravity I don't get\na whole load of Bounce the shoes do feel\nlight but they aren't really giving me\nanything extra they are basically taking\naway the impact from the road and making\nthose miles comfortable but a bit heavy\num I'm going to now go and see if I can\ntick up the pace see what I've got I'm\nnot sure I'm going to have a whole lot\nin the engine for this kind of middle n\nI'm going to try and hit some sort of\nfaster Paces to test out what they would\nbe like at around kind of marathan pace\nI might not be able to get to that today\nbut we will see\n[Music]\nso I've just let tick go over 18 miles\nhere in High Park and now I'm sort of\nturning for home hope you can hear me\nthrough the wind but yeah those sort of\nlast nine miles that I've done I tried\nto pick up the pace a bit at times I\ndon't think I did many miles under seven\nminute miles most of them were seven or\nover just on heavy legs and I think the\ntruth be told these shoes are not going\nto give you the extra I don't think that\nyou need when you're this tire they're\nbasically not going to save you you know\nsome carbon ratios will give you a whole\nload back and they might kind of spare\nthe legs and save you the Nova blast 5\nwhil they can be Lively when you're\nmoving with intent and where you've got\nthe energy I don't think they're\nactually sort of adding the energy\nyou've got to deliver it and it's going\nto return it whereas some shoes they can\nfeel like they're actually just giving\nyou that impetus an overlast five don't\nthe flip side to that though is I did\ntake along at those kind of Paces those\n7 Minute miles or I hit some sort of 650\nsections maybe a bit faster and they can\ncope at that pace they do run fairly\nsmooth like that and they do feel nice\nand light there is a little bit of\nBounce I just found it very difficult to\nmaintain that on tired legs I didn't\nfeel like they were helping necessarily\nso they can run that pace but you've got\nto be delivering the energy and then\nwhen you rock back like I am now I think\nwhat you're getting is a nice kind of\nreliable Comfort good road impact\nprotection there's no foot fatigue at\nall at the moment I just feel nicely\ncushioned nicely cradled nicely\nprotected it's all fair stable for me\ngenerally speaking there's not too much\nwobble and yeah I'm not worried about\ngoing into these last 9 miles how much\nroads coming up through that mids salt\nit's just softening that really nicely I\njust would like a little bit more\nimpetus coming back a little bit more\nimacy a bit more energy from the shoe to\nreally help me right now when I'm\nfrankly hanging out my ass here with 8\nmiles to go so yeah anyway we're going\nto go and slog on I don't know what kind\nof pace to be honest I'm just running to\nget it done now but yeah\n[Music]\n[Music]\nso that is the marathon test done in the\naex Nova blast five those last six miles\nwere a struggle slowed right down really\nlow on energy and then I ended up doing\nthat thing for the last three miles\nwhere I just didn't want to take another\ngel so I sort of running on fumes and I\nthink the key thing to say is in the\nlast six the shoes did what I needed\nthem to do they were protective\ncushioned reliable landing and I just\nfelt cushioned and looked after there\nwas no impact from the road coming up no\ncrazy foot fatigue no sort hardness they\nwere just taking the edge off the road\nand helping me kind of Glide home I'm\nnot sure Glide is the right word what I\nmean is sort of I guess sort of Shuffle\num but you know what I mean just get to\na pace and just hold it and and be quite\nsteady on the way back and that's what\nthey're good for I same throughout this\nwhole Marathon test they've basically\nperformed the same for me there when I'm\nrunning kind of heavy they're just not\nas bounced or as energetic as you know\nCarbon Ratio or the super Blast 2 in\nfact you know I think the super Blast 2\nis probably a better overall kind of\nmarathon shoe particularly if you're\nfancying your chance of going a bit\nfaster if you're looking for a marathan\nshoe just to get you round in Comfort\nthough that feels quite light it's got a\nreliable platform relatively stable big\nroomy uppers loads of space in the toe\nbox there's no trouble with that at all\nplenty of wiggle room Run for the toes\nto breathe all of that kind of stuff\nthen I think these are good if you're\njust going to try and finish them a\nmarathon just to get round and survive\nand you want something that's going to\nguarantee you a performance from start\nto finish then I think the overlast 5\ncould be a very good shoe for that it's\npretty well priced you can obviously use\nit for a lot of your training and then\ntake it on to race dat I think the\nsuperlast 2 is probably a better shoe\nfor that but I I did you know I do think\nthe NOA blast 5 has Marathon potential\nif you've got that particular effort in\nmind flicking on from that if you're\nthinking about things like the comrades\nMarathon or Road Ultra where you just\nwant a consistent performance and a big\nroomy toe box and a platform that's\ngoing to soak up the impact of the road\nwhil you're kind of moving slowly then I\nthink no blast 5 also has credibility in\nthat Mark too I would you know I'm not\nsure if I'm going to go back and do the\ncomrades this year but there would be a\nshoe that would be on my list for\nconsideration for that if so but I'm\nabsolutely beat now I need to get back\nI'm had a little wobble there to walk\nthe last point to cuz I'm nearly bonked\nso um I'm going to go back and eat but\nyeah the marathon just under 4 hours\n26.2 miles on a terrible hangover he\ndone\nso a really quick sum up now that I'm\nnot feeling like I might throw up that\nwas a bit of a struggle at the end of\nthat one but is the ASX NOA blast 5 a\npotential Marathon shoe well I think in\nsome circumstances for some Runners it\ncould well be if you're out there\nchasing a sub three-hour Marathon this\nis probably not your Rayo they're going\nto be faster shoes however if you're\nlooking to run a marathon in 4 hours\nplus 4 hours or more in reliable comfort\nwith good road protection no threat of\nblack tone nails and bruised toes then\nthe NOA blast 5 I think can do that job\nsome heavier Runners as well might enjoy\nthe higher stack and the protection that\nthat affords it's not quite as stable as\nthe lower stack options like the sakon\nride 17 it's not as energetic as you'll\nget from a super blast 2 but it is\nsofter and I think it affords a little\nextra long haul Comfort over the super\nBlast 2 you're getting great cushioning\nhere without having to lace up a bulky\nshoe as well and so I think it can do a\njob over the 26.2 I personally might\nchoose the overlast four over the five\nbut I prefer for a slightly kind of\nstiffer more Snappy ride rather than the\nkind of full-on cushioning that I think\nyou get here but the Nova blast 5 I\nthink will look after your feet from\nmile 1 to 26 so there you have it that\nhas been my Marathon test of the ax no\nblast 5 there's a few other Marathon\ntests out there shoes that you might\nconsider non kind of traditional kind of\nmarathon Race shoes I did this Nike\nPegasus 41 I've done the super Blast 2\num and there'll be more shoes coming up\nin this kind of test because I know that\nsome of you out there like to see shoes\nlike this tested for the marathon yeah\nso I hope that's been useful thank you\nvery much for stopping by and we hope to\nsee you again soon on the Run testers in\nthe meantime happy running people",

  "text": "hello and welcome to the Run testers my\nname is Nick and this is our full review\nof the choros pace\n[Music]\nPro the pace Pro is a new watch from\nchoros it is their first watch with an\nAMOLED display it sits in the range\nabove the choros pace 3 which is the\nentry level watch which has a memory and\npixel display take some cues from the\ndesign of that watch of course having\nthe aim of keeping the watch very\nlightweight whilst upgrading some of the\nfeatures on it it cost \u00a3349 or $349 and\nit comes in three colors black gray and\nblue with a silicon band and they're\nalso matching nylon bands which you can\nbuy which cost \u00a329 or dollar it has a 46\nmm case and it's 14 mm thick despite the\nfact it is a fair bit bigger than the\nchorus pce 3 it's still a very\nlightweight watch it's 37 G with its\nnylon band or 49 G if you Ed the Silicon\nband as mentioned this is chorus's First\nWatch with an AMOLED display it's a 1.3\nin screen and it's 1500 knits of\nbrightness you still got two buttons\nsame design as you have with the choros\npace 3 the top button is a digital dial\nthat is now made of stainless steel so\nit can take ECG measurements the watch\nhas a waterproof rating of 58m has dual\nband GPS with a new improved chipset and\nconfiguration to in theory improve\naccuracy got the same heart rate sensor\nas other corus watches but corus design\nmeans it now sits more snugly against\nthe wrist and can be more accurate as a\nresult then you've got the other usual\nsensors under the hood like an altimeter\nand a pulse oximeter and you have an\nupgraded processor which corus is their\nfastest one yet which improve certain\nactions in particular like zooming in\nand out of maps got 32 GB of storage on\nthe watch which is a big jump on\nsomething like the pace 3 you can use\nthat to add offline maps to the watch to\nuse during activities or to store music\nuh the music feature is still pretty\nlimited though it's just for drag and\ndrop files rather than linking up to\nstreaming services coros pce pro has a\nsimilar looking charging port to other\ncoros watches but it's set a bit deeper\nso you can't actually use other choros\nchargers with the watch instead of\ngetting a cable proprietary cable you\nget an adapter which you can use with a\nUSBC cable which also is a little\nkeychain a very neat little system if\nyou don't have a USBC cable which most\nof us do have if you don't have one of\nthose chorus will send you one though\nbattery life is obviously a little bit\nshorter than some chorus watches given\nthat you've got an houred screen but it\nis still pretty long it's listed as 20\ndays or 6 days if you're using the\nalways on screen and then when it comes\nto activities chorus only offers all\nsystems on or dual band GPS you can't\nuse a less accurate GPS only mode but\nthe battery life is still pretty strong\nwith those more accurate settings you\nget 31 hours of dual band or 24 hours if\nyou're using the A on screen and 38\nhours of all systems GPS 28 hours with\nthe A on screen those numbers will be\ncut in half or drop even further if\nyou're also using the music playback on\nthe\n[Music]\nwatch so start off with the good stuff\non the chus PST Pro and I will start\nwith the design and I would say that you\nknow I'm one of those people that\nactually really loves the look of the\ncars p 3 I love the fact it's kind of\nthis lightweight dinky watch um it is\nyou know comes in a mixture different\ncolors as well too and I think you know\njust is a little bit more fun to wear\nand I think the carus Pace Pro the\ndesign language is very much in keeping\nwith the pace for you obviously you're\ngetting a bigger case design you are\nstill getting the option of a silicon or\na nylon strap I've had it with the\nSilicon strap and I think I preferably\nwould want it with a nylon strap I'd\nprefer with a nylon strap but I think\nyou know generally it's been comfortable\nto wear it's been fine but I think you\nknow I think it's a better match with\nthat n strap and that's kind of what\nI've liked using the pace three um or\nmatching it up with the pace three the\nnylon strap obviously the headline story\nhere is the amlo display it's the first\nam display on a crosswatch and it is a\nvery good one you know this is from\nsomeone that has tested a lot of am\nwatches smart watches and sports watches\nand this is very much in keeping with\nthe best I've tested particularly around\nthis kind of mid-range price point you\nknow it is it has all the qualities of a\ngood Amo display those kind of Rich deep\nblacks the colors are very good it's\nvery vibrant you know the brightness is\nvery good as well here I think that's\nsomething I've really noticed up against\nother kind of um watches around this\nprice I think another thing that kind of\nfeeds into to that is also that the\ninterface you know obviously having an\namay we've seen this other watches as\nwell you know from Garmin and you know\nparticularly polar and suto where they\nhave those AMOLED displays and they have\nto re maybe think about how that kind of\nOsa interface kind of really sits on the\nwatches and I think in terms of you're\ngetting here on the choros watch maybe\nisn't sophisticated and slick as some of\nthe other watches I've mentioned but I\nthink it kind of fills the screen a lot\nnicer it feels a lot you know better\noptimized to this AMOLED display and I\nthink that's crucially what you you\nreally want to see you want to be able\nto look at that screen and feel like\nthat data belongs or those screens and\nthose menus just you know really belong\nat that am dis spay that's kind of what\nI found my time with the carus paace pro\nI think the other thing for me is\nperformance now I think performance is\nsomething that is generally overlooks I\nthink I'm talking about not just the\nkind of tracking performance but also\nthe software performance and what it's\nlike to interact and kind of move around\nscreens and I think for me the cor paace\nPro really kind of impressed me on that\nfront I think particularly when I've you\nknow you know recently used the sunto\nrace s and the race the polar V M3 which\nI think generally are fine to kind of\nget around on those watches but I just\nthink it's a step above on the pce pro\nin terms of interacting it's just a\nlittle bit Slicker just feels a little\nbit nicer and smoother I think the place\nI've most noticed it has been in the\nmapping support where I think it's even\nbetter some more expensive watches where\nyou know you're kind of just scrolling\nthrough Maps or getting around a section\nof a map it just refreshes a lot quicker\nit just feels a lot nicer to use those\nfeatures so I think performance is a\nreally important one that you know\nreally kind of stood out for me in my\ntime with a pace Pro I think from a r\ntracking point of view I think the GPS\nperformance has been very good for me I\nthink you know we've seen that dual\nfrequency support kind of spread across\nthe chorus range it's been good in\nplaces not so good in other places I\nfeel like this is a good example of that\nGPS performance and I've used it against\nother um dual band watches from Garmin\ncinto Polo the Apple watch as well too\nand for me it kind of stands you know up\nyou know in those kind of good uh\nversions examples of that dual frequency\nGPS and I think the other thing for me\nand I think the crucial one for me is\nthat battery life performance with that\nAMOLED display and that's the big story\nhere you know corus has really kind of\ndelivered really strong battery life\nwith its other watches in standby mode\nparticularly and then also kind of\nreally pushing the GPS battery numbers\nas well and I think the performance on\nthe pace Bo is very good I think up\nagainst the other mid-range watches that\nsit around it it performs very very well\nand I think that's even when you're\nusing the always on display mode when\nyou're using race to wake as well too\nand I've used a mixture in my testing\nand I found in both scenarios the\nbattery life has been very good and I've\nused some of my testing has been against\nthe polar Vantage M3 well I've had that\nas well and I've definitely found it's\nperformed better for me uh from a\nbattery point of view um compared to the\nM3 but all a lot of good positives for\nme with the carus pace Pro a lot to like\nhere on corus's First multisports Watch\nwith an AMOLED display so my likes with\nthe pace Pro start with the screen I do\nprefer having AMOLED screens on my\nwatches now definitely made that\ntransition with my sports watches and as\nmuch as I've liked chorus watches in the\npast I would always prefer to have an\nAMOLED watch as my daily driver and you\nnow have an AMOLED screen and it's a\nreally nice one it's really bright in\nall conditions it's clear to read yeah\ncorus has done a good job here and it's\na big upgrade in particular with chorus\nbecause their memory and pixel displays\naren't really the brightest of any\nBrands so yeah like the screen a lot I\nlike the design a lot in general\nactually like I was a bit worried when\nwe saw the kind of specs and it might be\na fair bit bigger and bulkier than the\nchoros pace 3 and while it is a little\nbit bigger it's not at all bulky it's\nstill a really lightweight watch feels\nreally thin on the wrist feels very you\nknow unnoticeable to wear throughout the\nday and all around I really like design\nlike I know it's not necessarily the\nclassist design people might prefer the\nmetal watches you get further up the\nchoros range or of other brands but I\nlike an all plastic watch like this I\nthink it's a good design I like watches\nlike the 265 and the 4965 as well and\nyeah I think it's a good looking watch\nand one I've enjoyed wearing I would\ndefinitely use a nylon strap though got\nthe Silicon one on here now and a nylon\nstraps just lighter and much more\ncomfortable accuracy has also been\nreally good for me so the GPS accuracy\nyou know I've been using this watch same\ntime as 4 and a 965 265 I've used it for\nlots of Hard workouts during marathon\ntraining you know pacing myself fire the\nwatch I've also done a twisty 10K in\nParis City Center and the GPS accuracy\nhas always been you know really good you\nknow matching or outperforming other\nwatches very happy to rely on it for all\nthe pacing during my workouts so don't\nhave any concerns GPS ACC I think it's\nyou know right up there it's dual band\nGPS and it's as good as you're getting\nfrom other brands for sure and when I\nmention pacing I know some people have a\nthing with chorus that the instant Pace\nisn't very good like it's laggy to\nrespond now I don't really use instant\nPace very much because I find that with\nall watches like I use lap pace and kind\nof pace myself over the course of a rep\nI find that much more reliable but did\nlook at the instant Pace on the watch\ncomparing it to the 265 during a couple\nof runs you know doing sprints to see\nhow quickly the pace changed and seemed\ncomparable and how fast it changed so\nyeah I would say the pacing is fine for\nme with the pace Pro and it's yeah it's\nbeen very good on GPS accuracy heart\naccuracy I say has also been good like\nnot perfect some troubles at the start\nof runs and sometimes the end of runs\nespecially as the weather's got colder\ntowards the end of my testing but for\nthe most part most of my workouts have\nlooked down and and it's been the same\nas the reading from an arm strap I'm\nlooking at on another watch or you know\ncomparable enough and you pretty usable\nlike I probably would link a chest strap\nor an armband myself for the ultimate\naccuracy especially during the winter\nmonths but the heart ratea sensor on\nthis and the way it fits against the\nwrist has been pretty good and I think\ngiven that I'm not huge fan of optical\nheart rate in general I would say this\nis probably just slightly above average\nyou know pretty good all round you could\nuse it I probably would still link a\nchest rat but has been fine throughout\nmy testing the maps are definitely a\nplus point on this watch that's now\nbecoming a standard feature in this area\nwith polar sunto and chorus all offering\nmid-range watches with maps that Garmin\ndon't like I I was in Paris for that 10K\nand I did a long run on the Friday\nbefore that and used the maps on the\nwatch to guide myself around the city\nand yeah it's always great having Maps I\nthink they're really quick to download\nand easy to get onto the watch via the\napp as well like to the point where the\nfirst time I put them on I was just\nstanding outside my house you I still\nhad my Wi-Fi on my phone and managed to\ndownload them apps to the watch really\nquickly and last life for me is the\nbattery life so it's obviously a pretty\nsmall watch of an AMOLED screen but I've\nstill been getting five or six days out\nof use with it pretty reliably during my\nkind of normal heavy use so that's\nrunning Every Day always on screen\nenabled you know that kind of thing I've\nalso so set the heart rate tracking to\nbe continuous rather than the standard\nCoral setting which is every 10 minutes\nwhich obviously extends the battery life\noutside of workouts that is and even\nthen I'm getting plenty of use out of it\nat the moment I'm not running the last\nfew days I've sprayed my ankle a little\nbit so it's it's lasting even better\nit's going to hit probably over seven\ndays I think even with the yours on\nscreen on which is you know better than\nchorus even says but you know with\nrunning involved and stuff like that\nyou're still looking at five or six days\nwhich I think is probably the longest of\nthe kind of mid-range AMOLED watches\nthat certainly outlasted the Garmin 4 a\n265 during my testing I think it's also\nAl bit longer than sunto race s and\npolar Vantage M3 lasted me they might\nhave you know equal or better single\nactivity battery life but in terms of\nday-to-day use the B has been pretty\ngood for an Amed watch I've been using\nthe coros pace Pro for just short of a\nmonth in testing I put it up against\nsome similarly priced and spec Rivals\nincluding the polar Vantage gem 3 the\nsunto race s titanium but I also\nbenchmarked it against the much pricier\nGarmin Phoenix 8 AMOLED and used the\nGarmin HRM Pro chest strap and the polar\nh10 for my heart rate accuracy tests now\nbefore we get into the pros and cons i'\ngot a quick word on the design the big\nheadline here obviously is the arrival\nof the AMOLED screen that's bigger and\nbrighter than the choros pace 3 screen\nit gives you a bit more real estate over\nthe pace 3 as well for not much extra\nweight on the wrist that's a thumbs up\nnow like all AMOLED that punched up\ncolor and brightness brings your stats\nto life really nicely and the offline\nmaps also are more vibrant it's been\ninteresting using this side by side with\nthe polar vage G3 as well and to my eyes\nI think the choros screen doesn't seem\nquite as sharp as the polar or indeed\nthe Phoenix 8 it's not a huge difference\nand I found the screen easy to read in\nall lights but it's just not quite as\ncrisp the other note on design aside\nfrom the lovely screen is that this is a\nbasic looking watch it's not that far\naway from the past through in terms of\nthe materials I think they kind of feel\ncheaper than the sunto races and the\npolance gem 3 the strap the casing the\nbezel even the crown it just feels a bit\nplastic it's not unlike the pace 3 and\nthere are benefits to this in that it\ndoes make it light on the wrist overall\nthe cir comtable watch to wear and I\ndefinitely swap the silicone strap\nthough for a nylon one to boost that\nComfort but overall it has a pace three\nstyle lightness to it that's comfortable\nfor 24/7 wear now the processor is\nsupposed to be two times faster than the\nP3 as well and so far I found the\ntouchscreen responsive in the navigation\non the watch Snappy enough I also like\nthat the touchscreen gives you a little\nhaptic feedback too into the things that\nI found positive then with the battery\nlife is always a priority for me and I'm\nreally happy to see choros delivering an\nAMOLED with enough single activity m Max\naccuracy GPS battery life to tackle\nUltra distances potentially even\nmulti-day adventures with always on\nscreen off the brightness seted normal\nthe average burn had choros trademark\nstinginess a 1H hour run using all\nsystems burn 2% a 2hour run in all\nsystems burn 6% a 1H hour run with a Max\naccuracy dual frequency mode burn 2% my\ndaytime burn without any training was\njust 2% while the average overnight burn\nwas just 2% as well I got 17 days\nGeneral usage with 7 and 1/2 hours of\nGPS training and 1 hours heart rate\ncardio that battery burn Rose by about\n30% when I switched on the always on but\nI didn't find I really needed to I think\nthe raise to wake on this is responsive\nenough that you can get away without it\nanother big thumbs up here is the\ninclusion of those color topo maps there\na welcome upgrade here on the pace Pro\nit sets that watch apart from the Garmin\n4r a 265 which doesn't offer it plus\nhaving that big AMOLED really helps\nbring those maps and the navigation\ntools to life you also get root planning\nhere and sync so you have to do the\nlatter manually plus there's turn by\nturn navigation with off course alerts\nyou're still lacking the really useful\nclimb Pro style feature that serves up\nuseful details on the climbs and\ndescents that you've got left on your\nroute and things like how long it will\ntake you to Summit that Ascent that\nyou're currently on both Po and Garmin\noffer these on their similarly priced\nwatches but the nav skills here on the\nchoros pace Pro are good for a watch at\nthis price another interesting unique\nfeature here is that you can use corus's\nextend mode to beam your watch screen to\na smartphone to get a better view if you\nwant more yeah easier to view the maps\nand bits and pieces another thing I've\nput in the positive pile here is that\nwhen it comes to GPS the coros pace Pro\nJoel frequency perform pretty well for\nme at least on the overall distances\nwhich is the thing that I'm most\nconcerned with on all my runs I had it\nup against the Garmin Phoenix 8 a lot\nand it was always within the margin for\nera against that and the other watches\nthat I tested against if you dig into\nthe tracks more closely like here on\nthis run versus the Phoenix 8 with both\nis using Max accuracy multiband they\nboth track closely at this level but\nwhen you zoom in more closely you can\nsee the chorus Pace pro has some\nstruggles like here on this bridge where\nit's got me very much not on the bridge\nbut then neither does the Phoenix eight\nthe pace Pro sometimes Cuts Corners like\nhere through an office building and you\ncan see here through a row of shops on\nthis other run up into London it's the\nsame story largely gets the overall\ndistance within 0.2 mies of the Garmin\nPhoenix 8 but then sometimes has wobbles\nwhen you dig closely into to the tracks\nthough in my testing of many many\nwatches I've not found a watch that\ndoesn't have some struggles like this if\nyou look at various different runs and\noverall I'd say the coral Pace Pro GPS\nis\n[Music]\nsolid some things I wasn't so Keen about\nthen starting with the charging adapter\nthis is an interesting Edition corus has\nchanged the size of the charging port so\nthat essentially none of your old cables\nfit the new watch without having to do\nsome fiddling with a knife so far so bad\nthey also included this little charging\nadapter that you hook into any USBC\nCable in theory it's as good because you\ncan carry a little thing with you and\nuse it anywhere you can find a USBC\nCable in practice it's a little bit\nfiddly these little adapters look very\nlosable and once it's gone you're going\nto have to pay 20 bucks for a new one\nI'm worried I'm going to lose this and\nthen looking at the heart rate\nperformance my experience in testing was\na bit mixed for the optical here you can\nsee from the data on a short interval\nrun that while the pace Pro optical does\na reasonable job of tracking the chest\ntrap on the steady warm-up Mile and it\nhits the averages on par with the chest\nstrap and polar it really struggles\nduring the intervals with some big\noverreaches and spikes on the effort\nsections at times it was reading at you\nknow 20 beats per minute higher than the\nGarmin HRM Pro Plus then on a\nprogression run the coros pce pro\nstruggles at the start and then has a\nfew moments where it's reading 5 BPM or\nso higher or lower than the chest trp\nbut tracks generally well against the\nh10 across the whole run so it's a bit\nof a hit and miss job with the optical\nbut that is pretty much Optical\nperformance for you now another thing to\nnote for whatever reason you can only\nbuy the choros pace Pro with the Silicon\nband with the coros pace 3 when you\npurchase it you get the option of nylon\nor silicon but you don't get that here\nyou'll have to pay extra if you want to\nbuy an additional nylon strap I much\nprefer nylon straps and I'd really\nappreciate having the option to choose\nbetween them at the checkout rather than\nhaving to load another one up and more\nexpense okay into the things that I\ndidn't like or maybe a little bit\ndisappointed about my time with the cars\nPace Pro and I think the first thing for\nme I think maybe it was kind of\nunavoidable thing and that is the price\nnow it is more expensive than the corus\npce 3 and what I think we all loved\nabout the corus pace 3 is that it really\nundercut the competition I think\nparticularly from a Garmin point of view\nand I think from a value point of view\nthe pace three is largely untouched in\nterms of you get in performance and\nfeatures and I think with a pace Pro I\nthink we're were all hoping that maybe\nit would kind of slightly be in keeping\nor a little bit closer to the pricing of\nthe pace 3 and ultimately that's not\nwhat's quite happened it is more in\nkeeping with other mid-range watches\nwhich is you know at least it hasn't\njumped too much in price I think the\nother thing for me I think it's kind of\na long running thing with the coros uh\nkind of Eco system in general and I\nthink ultimately you know it is a work\nin progress I think from the kind of\ntraining point of view I think the user\ninterface point of view and I think\nthat's on and off the watch on and on\nthe watch I think ultimately you know\nthat it's it's pretty good I think in\ngeneral I kind of like the more kind of\nsimplistic kind of approach there's\ndefinitely some Garing elements to the\nkind of user interface in terms of where\nthings live I think I think for me it's\nreally and this could ultimately be\nleveled at polar and cinto as well too\nand probably a lesser degree to Garmin\nbut just the presentation of some of the\ndata that I think is really useful I\nthink from an analysis point of view I\nthink you have to work to kind of find\nit it I think another thing feeding into\nthat and that kind of whole ecosystem is\nthe Smartwatch experience and now you\nknow applaud cars for trying to improve\nthe Smartwatch experience and it is I\nthink a little bit like polar a little\nbit reticent to go all in a bit like\nGarmin has um or you know offer a lot\nmore kind of in Terms that Smartwatch\nfunctionality you know you're not\ngetting payments here you're not getting\nkind of a fully-fledged app kind of\necosystem here as well too they plays a\nlot of third party apps so yeah just a\nfew things that I think are slightly\ndisappointed my time with the car Pace\nPro I haven't you know entirely ruined\nmy experience using this watch is a very\ngood watch but ultimately I think those\nare things that cars definitely probably\nknow and appreciate they they're still\nworking on and involving improving and\nmaking them better features and overall\nmaking the watches like the PST better\nto use dayto day onto my dislikes day\nand a lot of these are quite small and\nfairly nitpicking like overall I do\nreally like this watch for sure but the\ndesign so one it's not my dislike but I\nthink it will be disliked for some so\nyou can get you know probably slightly\nmore elegant looking watches in this\narea I do prefer the look of the Garmin\n4 a 265 for one the sunto race s has a\nslightly hardier design with better\nmaterials and a polar Vantage M3 you\nknow somewh prefer the look at that\nwatch as well I like all plastic watches\nlike I say so it's not a big negative\nbut for some people wearing a watch all\nthe time they maybe won't want an all\nplastic watch like this chorus might\nhave to look at AMOLED screens and it's\nkind of more expensive elegant Apex and\nvertx watches and another little dislike\nfor me is that you just don't get that\nmuch data on your watch face as you can\nYou Can't customize it as much like\ncorus has the set stats it can show on\nwatch faces and I guess this is\nsomething to do with stats that can be\nrefreshed you know only occasionally and\nnot affect battery life too much but you\ncan't put like a weather forecast on\nyour watch face and there's no weekly\nmileage option or anything like that all\nstats I can get on the Garmin 265 which\nhas a better always on screen as well it\nshows a lot more information when you've\ngot your wrist down and you can still\nsee it and has a lot more customization\noptions like when you've got an AMOLED\nscreen now I think being able to really\npush the boat out and customize that\nwatch face I think is important to\nreally enjoy it and you still can't\nreally do that too much with the pace\nPro training analysis is also a slightly\niffy area for me so it's fine like it's\nusable for sure you can definitely get a\ngood idea of your short-term and\nlong-term training loads and how your\ntraining relates to them and a good idea\nof your weekly load but chus does a few\nthings that don't feel that intuitive to\nme sometimes like they have the 7-Day\nload as the week rather than the past\nseven days and they give you suggestions\nabout where your training should land in\nthose seven days and those always\nhaven't really felt right to me and I've\nblown way past them and then even when I\ndo blow way past them and my you know my\nbalance between acute and uh a chronic\ntraining load seems really off like I'm\nat 140 or 150% it's still saying it's\nokay and it doesn't feel quite as\nintuitively spot-on to me as the advice\nand information you get maybe from\nsomething like a Garmin watch in\nparticular but you know it's still fine\nit's still very much usable I don't mind\nit but sometimes you just you look at it\nthat doesn't feel quite right to me\nthat's the race predictions are the most\naccurate of any watch brand I've tested\nlike they're very close to the times\nI've been running with the watch and\nwhat I could be running I think in\ngeneral and the last thing is the music\nfeature and the smart features in\ngeneral like it's not really got those\nsmart features for sure even things like\nthat watch face customization I was\ntalking about this is an area where\nGarmin is way ahead and especially the\nmusic storage being drag and drop like\nfor me that's almost less useful than\nthe kind of music controls you get on\nthe sunto or the polar and Garmin\nobviously has full music storage with\nlinks to streaming services so this\nisn't a big area for me and I know lots\nof people say oh I don't care about\nsmarts but you know people do care about\nsmart features like those and the ones\non the chorus watches just aren't up to\npar with other brands even if it's not\nsomething that necessarily concerns me\nthat much it's something to look out for\nso I think the choros paace pro is an\nexcellent watch it's one that's really\ndelivered on performance for me I like\ndesign I like pretty much everything\nabout the watch I think it's a really\ngood option to have in chorus's range at\nthe price that's very much comparable\nwith the other watches in its area like\nit's probably not a shock that we're all\nquite positive on this watch we just\ngave it our joint watch of the Year\naward at the r tester Awards and yeah\nlike I said it's watch I'll probably\nkeep wearing because I really liked\nusing it and want to keep using it so\nthere are four really good watches in\nthis area I'd say in terms of sport\nwatches AMOLED sports watches there's\nthe chorus paace Pro that gin for 265\nthe polar Vantage M3 and the sunto race\ns so they're all at roughly the same\nprice the sunto is a little bit cheaper\nin the UK the Garmin is more expensive\nconsiderably actually but it's usually\nin sales now to be the same price as the\nothers but let's run through some\ncomparisons of those four so the Garmin\n4 a265 is was the watch that stood out\nin this area for sure and I've been\ncomparing them side by side the pace Pro\nand the 265 the Gin is more expensive\nand that is a big deal if you find them\nwith the Garmin at its full price I'll\ndefinitely get the pace Pro but in terms\nof the features they do in comparison\nthe Garmin has a better design better\ntraining analysis better smart features\nfor me I like the user interface more\nand stuff like that I think it's a\nlittle bit more customizable all around\nand just the general experience of using\nit I think is slightly slightly better\ncorus has better battery life though it\nhas maps and it is considerably cheaper\nand you know it's still a really nice\nenjoyable watch to use so at the same\nprice I might still lean towards the\n4265 just as someone who's been using G\nin a long time you I'm very comfortable\nwith their system but I'm pretty much\njust as happy with the pace Pro and I'll\nget the pace Pro if there is that price\ndifference there and then I do prefer\nthe pace Pro straight up to the sunto\nrace s polar vage M3 so the sunto races\nis a really good watch and it is a bit\ncheap and it's great value it's got a\nreally good design and if you prefer the\nlook at that design which I think lots\nof people will I look at getting the sun\nress I actually prefer the design of the\nchorus myself because it is that thin\nlightweight plastic watch I do like that\nI prefer the chorus user interface I\nfind it just less fiddly and I find\neasier to use you know Maps workouts\njust generally navigating the watch just\nfinds all a bit easier on the chorus and\nI also have found the heart rate\nactually to be better on the chorus P\nPro as well if you're not using an\nexternal strap so yeah overall I prefer\nthe chorus myself the sunto but it's\ndefinitely one I can see a lot of people\npreferring to the corus especially if\nyou like the design more in which case I\nwould get the sunto and the polar\nVantage M3 is probably my least favorite\nof these four watches despite still\nbeing a really good watch design I find\nis just quite thick sticks out from the\nwrist a fair bit again I prefer the feel\nand look of the chorus myself much\nprefer the chus user interface find the\npolar one quite fiddly there's not much\ncustomization there it feels a little\nbit outdated not been updated very much\nI would say recently can't even have\nmore than four stats on a run screen and\njust there's a lot of little things that\ncrop up dayto day that just annoy me a\nlittle bit with the polar which I don't\nreally get with the choros I also think\nthe choros just has a slight Edge on um\nGPS accuracy and it was definitely more\naccurate on the heart rate tracking\nfront than the polar for me so again I\ntested those two watches the pace Pro\nand the Vantage M3 side by side and\ndefinitely deferred to the choros\nthroughout that testing as the watch I\npreferred using another option in this\narea is the Apple Watch series 10 if you\nwant a smarter watch it's got a much\nnicer design it's obviously got loads of\ngreat smart features goodl looking watch\npretty good Run Tracker as well but the\npce pro is obviously know a better\nsports watch you've got the buttons\nthere for like taking laps you've got\ndualband GP s which is more accurate on\nthe GPS accuracy I got from the Apple\nWatch series 10 you obviously got longer\nbattery life as well so they're slightly\ndifferent purposes but both good run\ntrackers but definitely the corus pace\nPro is better on the running whereas the\nApple watch is more of that kind of\nGeneral really good lifestyle Smartwatch\nand then comparing it to the corus PACE\n3 which is another watch I really like\nso you know you're paying a fair bit\nmore here for key upgrades for me would\nprobably be that analed display and the\nmaps you get on the cor space Pro and in\nparticular the AMOLED display around\nlike there are some other upgrades like\nthe processor and stuff like that but\nthe one that pretty matters the most day\ntoday is the design and that AMOLED\nscreen it's a big upgrade for me for a\nwatch I'm going to wear all the time I\nwant that AMOLED screen I really like it\nI'm prepared to pay a bit more for it\nbut if you're not too fuss about that\nthe pace 3 is still a really accurate\nand very good sports watch with a really\nnice and lightweight small design I'd\nsay if you're worried about the pace Pro\nbeing vastly bigger and bulkier on the\nwrist than the pace 3 which is so small\nI wouldn't say that felt like the case\nto me like this felt very lightweight on\nthe wrist it didn't feel like you know\nmuch bulkier watch than the pace 3 which\nI've also tested fairly recently so it\nreally comes down to that choice like\nthere are lots of little upgrades as\nwell as well but overall the ones that\nwould matter to me are that AMOLED\nscreen if you're someone who's use maps\na lot obviously that's a really nice\nfeature to have like I use it\noccasionally and I really like having\nthem when I do but for me mostly it's\njust I prefer the design for the pace\nPro enough and that extra brightness and\nreadability of the screen that I think\nis worth the upgrade but for lots of\npeople it won't be and you're still\ngetting a great watch with the pace 3 so\noverall really enjoyed testing the corus\npace Pro it's another really strong\nentry in this very strong area of the\nmarket this mid-range area of the market\nwhere I think you know you are getting\nreally good value and amazing watches\nnow and of those four watches in there\nall things being equal the Garment being\nat its full price I think the pace Pro\nis the one I'd pick verdict then andus\nhas produced a really good watch here\nthat will definitely go toe-to-toe with\nthe other Rivals at this price it crams\nin loads of features and track and fire\npower for the price and there's more\nthan enough you know insight and\npotential here to cover most Runners\nneeds it lacks some of the smarts and\nfinesse I think that you'll get from\nwatch is like the Garmin 4 a 265 and the\nsoftware that comes with it but if\nyou're in the market for an AMOLED watch\nwith excellent staying power and boosted\nnavigation skills the pace Pro I think\nrepresents really good value the GPS is\nsolid the heart rate performance is\npretty much Standard Optical heart rate\nperformance for me but coros has done\nwell to deliver an AMOLED watch while\nkeeping its nose in front of the\nsimilarly priced Rivals like the sunto\nrace and the polar Vantage M3 on battery\nlife it is more basic looking than the\npolar Vantage gem 3 and the sunto race\nand the Gin 4un 265 you could say it\nsimpler you might even say cheaper\nlooking but you're going to be swapping\nsome looks for the lighter build that\nyou get from the coros pace Pro if you\nwant a lighter build then that's a\nthumbs up if you want it more premium\nthen maybe a thumbs down but this is\ncorus's best watch to buy if you're\nlooking for a capable sports watch with\na great stream long-lasting AMOLED\nbattery life and better navigation if\nyou already own a pace 3 and you're not\nbothered about the AMOLED screen or the\nmaps then I don't think it's worth\nupgrading if you're on an Old Apex\nthough it might be worth looking and up\nagainst the pace three the pace throw is\nthe more accomplished watch but if\nyou're a newcomer and screen and Maps\naren't priorities I'd save yourself some\nand go for the cars Pace 3 so my take on\nthe cars Pace Pro is that it's probably\nbeen one of my favorite new running\nwatches I tested this year and I think\nif I look at it up against other new\nmid-range watches that have launched as\nwell then I would say that the overall\npackage on the pace pro has just been a\nlot nicer for me and I think as a debut\nAMOLED watch from carus I think there's\na lot to like here now is it the perfect\nwatch there's definitely things to work\non I think from a kind of corus\necosystem point of view but I definitely\ndo think the good outweigh the bad here\non the pace Pro now if you're looking at\nthe pace Pro you looking at the pace 3\nthey share the same name they've got\nsimilar feature sets and you probably\nthink what am I actually paying more for\nessentially now what really boils down\nto is that that am display costs a lot\nmore money cost a lot more money to put\non watches we've seen it from other\nwatch brands as well and it's the same\nstory here with the pace Pro I think\nyou're getting a little bit more of an\nupgrade in terms of the support and\nsoftware you know you look at things\nlike the level of mapping support you're\ngetting breadcrumb now navigation on the\npace 3 you're getting full kind of\nmapping support on the pace Pro and it's\nreally pushing more towards the Apex 2\nand Apex 2 Pro watches in car's\ncollection I think for me I think as a\nkind of day-to-day use um performance\njust you know just very easy to use and\njust really likable ultimately I think\nI've just liked more about the pace Pro\nfrom those other watches so I think yeah\nas a debut AMOLED watch I think there's\na lot to like about the pace Pro I think\nif you are be have been waiting for a\nchorus watch with Al a display hoping it\nreally retains a lot of the good\nfeatures from the pace 3 and getting\nsome of those features from those more\nexpensive chorus watches then I think\nthat's ultimately what you'll getting\nhere for a little bit more money but I\nthink ultimately it's worth spending a\nlittle bit more money if you want those\nkey features as\n[Music]\nmentioned that's our review of the corus\npaace pro let us know what you think in\nthe comments below please do like and\nsubscribe ring the little bell and we'll\nsee

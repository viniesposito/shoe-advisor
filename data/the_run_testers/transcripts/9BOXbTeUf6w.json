  "text": "hey Tommy from the r testers in this\nvideo we are going to be reviewing the\naex Nova blast 5 let's take a\n[Music]\nlook the aex Nova blast 5 cost \u00a3 135 or\n$140 it weighs 256 G or 9 oz for men in\na size 8 and the drop is 8\nmm the as6 NOA blast 5 continues the\npopular daily shoe line with the new FF\nblast Max Midol foam designed to be\nsofter and bouncier while still\nretaining the same weight as the Nova\nblast 4 the shoe features a new jacked\nmesh upper instead of the previous woven\nmaterial used in the Nova blast 4 the\naim being to improve the fit and ensure\na good level of breathability there's a\nsimilar trampoline inspired outsole to\nprevious versions to improve comfort and\ncovering that is a healthy layer of\nrubber for grip and\nprotection it comes the fit of the ASX\nnose blast 5 as I've had no problems at\nall with my normal running shoe size got\na uk9 here which is a us10 that's the\nsize I've used across asx's range for\nmany years and I've used for every\nsingle version of the over blast and\nyeah no problems at all fits me very\nwell enough room in the toe box good\nhold around the heeler midfoot nice\ncomfortable heel design that doesn't\nirritate my achilles and holds the heal\nin place so yeah no problems at all with\nthe fit I would stick to your normal\nrunning shoe size in testing I ran in my\nregular running shoe size which is a UK\nand a half in the ax no blast 5 and I\nfound the fit nice and secure in the\nheel but very roomy with decent wiggle\nin the toe box this is an area fit I\nthink in the no blast 4 but there is\ngood hold across the midfoot i' largely\na secure heel and unless you like your\nshoes very snug I'd recommend going true\nto size I personally like the room that\nyou get up into this kind of for foot in\nthe toe boox it opens up the potential\nto use this shoe for longer haul mileage\nUltras that kind of thing so I really\nlike a spacious toe box so fit for me\nhas been spot on in the Nova blast 5 no\nissues report in my running time I would\nsay there's very much hallmarked of the\nprevious over blast shoes here I think\nparticularly in the toebox where it's\nkind of you know roomy without feeling\noverly generous not too short similar\nlevel of padding in the hill collar the\nkind of you know similar tongue the\nlacing is all very kind of close to the\nprevious Nova blast shoes I think the\nbiggest takeaway for me is that the the\nway the upper feels around your feet I\nthink on the NOA blast 5 it definitely\nis gear to feeling a little bit more\nsnug and a little bit more comfortable\nand you know compared to the overlast 4\nwhich I think you know sits a little bit\ncloser particularly the middle section\nof that shoe and I think that's\nsomething that I've noticed has it kind\nof radically changed my experience of\nthe shoe not necessarily but I do think\nif you are looking for a more\ncomfortable feeling upper and fit and I\nthink that's what the no blast 5 is\ngoing to get you my biggest takeaway\nthough is that for me it does feel like\na true to size shoe and it has felt like\nyou know going the same size as previous\nshoes has worked well for me in the Nova\nblast 5 fit for me in the Nova blast 5\nI'm a size8 in the UK this is a size\neight uh found you you're very\ncomfortable um it's plenty of width to\nit um didn't find it in any way\nrestrictive um I've got fairly average\nwidth foot so I don't tend to have\nproblems with the width of shoes but\nthere definitely felt a little bit more\non the forgiving side uh there's plenty\nof space in the forefoot um for me it's\nprobably a little bit too much space I\nlike it to be a little bit more\nrestrictive in the forefoot um but for\nmost people it's probably that sort of\nthumbs width that you want um before the\nbig toe so I would stay to my size in\nthese shoes there's also plenty of\npadding I like the upper it's quite\ncomfortable quite forgiving there's a\nbit Flex to it all in all a very\ncomfortable solid shoe that I would stay\nto my size\nin now I've run a good 50 km in the ASX\nNova blast 5 in testing and I've used\nthem for all kinds of runs from the\nslowest easiest of recovery miles up to\nfaster pce efforts basically I've tested\nthe full gamut from easy to close to top\nspeed in the shoe I've also been using\nit a lot alongside the ax super blast\ntwo which has been a really interesting\ncomparison to put these two side by side\nbecause it's an argument to say can this\nbe a cheaper super blast now I've had a\nflip-flopping relationship with the ASX\nNOA blast over the generations as it's\nmoved from soft to firmer I like the\nNova blast 4 snappier ride that was\nslightly more dense underf foot than the\nsofter cushioned NOA blast 3s which felt\na bit sluggish to me at times now the\nchanges to the four gave the Nova blast\nsome faster Pace potential I think with\nthe new flight foam blast Max phone\nyou're getting in the Nova blast 5 I\nthink we're back to being slightly\nsofter again though with a touch more\nbounc and I think that depends really on\nwhen you're Landing with the shoe as\nwell now I'm a bit torn with the Nova\nblast 5 because it offers a nice smooth\nride that responds well on toe off and\nfeels springy but controlled when you're\nfeeling good running with good form and\npushing the pace I think the no blast 5\nfeels energetic but it's also cushioned\nenough to accommodate slower Paces\nthough sometimes on heavier legs I think\nit can feel a bit soggy I've had slow\nruns or at least runs where I felt tired\nwhere the softness certainly in a sort\nof slower Pace form makes it feel like\nthe shoe is working\nagainst me somewhat and then I've had\nthese runs where I'm full of energy\nrunning in good form you know I'm on it\nreally working off the forefoot where\nthe over blast 5 has felt more smooth\nand energetic and not a million miles\noff the performance of the super Blast 2\nthat's kind of cruising Pace\nparticularly now I want to say that it\nworks better when I'm moving at faster\nPace but the reality is I think it kind\nof feeds back better underf foot when\nyou're running well so not just fast but\nmoving with kind of good form and good\nenergy on runs where I've been heavy and\nsluggish it almost amplifies that kind\nof heavy and sluggish feel as well now\nthose where I felt light and Lively it\nkind of gives that back on the foot I\nthink you get a familiar overlast feel\noverall there's still a lot of shoe\nthough it does run quite light for the\nheft that you're getting for that big\nstack that you've got here it's a bit\nroomier than NOA blast 4 up front but I\nlike that the protection and cushioning\nis great there's a wide reliable\nplatform to run off and loads of comfort\nand though I sometimes feel like I have\nto work harder I think is a very capable\ncushioned option I can happily long call\neasy paac and overlast 5 I also plan to\nMarathon test T it at some point to see\nif this would make a good reliable race\nday shoe for people who just want to get\nround a marathon with guaranteed comfort\nand just a little bit of energy so in\nterms of my running time with the NOA\nblast 5 I've done well over 50k in this\nshoe and it definitely has been a very\neasy shoe to take over the running\nmileage and that's really what the NOA\nblast is about it's a daily trainer you\nknow a shoe for kind of really getting\nthrough that kind of weekly mileage and\nI definitely would say that this is a\nshoe that is capable still of doing that\nI think my biggest question mark\ndefinitely from my first run in this\nshoe is well my experience would be\nreplicated throughout my running time in\nthat first run it was a really bouncy\nLively enjoyable shoe something that I\nsaw in the Nova Blast 3 but wasn't\nreally replicated throughout my running\ntime in the no Blast 3 I think the no\nblast 4 was a very different proposition\nto the three I really like that shoe I\nthought it was a very versatile shoe\nparticularly had a more uptempo Edge to\nit compared to previous Nova blast shoes\nnow with the Nova blast 5 there\ndefinitely is a radical change here\nparticularly with that midsole from the\nnol 4 the 5 it's just a lot and you get\na little bit more resistance from the\nmids overlast 5 I think that really kind\nof Echoes what I've seen in my running\ntime now after that first run I did a\nlonger run in this shoe and I didn't\nhave that same kind of bouncy Lively\nfeeling from that midso was definitely\nsoft definitely comfortable I definitely\nfelt like I could roll through very\nnicely in this shoe it's been a shoe\nit's been a long time since I've had a\nshoe where I've had such an IND\ndifferent experience from you know a run\nto run and that's definitely been what\nI've seen in the Nova blast 5 what I\nreally wanted to see was how it would\nhandle some kind of faster running TI\nactually took this to the track I used\nit with the Nova blast 4 I um had a kind\nof a longer session I kind of spit the\nsession half was in the Nova blast 5 the\nsecond half was in the no blast 4 now\nthese you know the biggest thing to\ntakeway for me is that it could handle\nsome kind of more uptempo time it\ndefinitely felt a lot softer under the\nfoot compared to the Nova blast 5 which\nI kind of like that kind of slightly\nfirmer feel to it where you know it's\nnot overly firmed it does feel a little\nbit more responsive and that's kind of\nwhat I\nin that track session it felt a little\nbit more at home you know at that kind\nof slightly faster Pace would it be\nsomething that I use out for all out\nrunning absolutely not that's really not\nwhat the Nova blast is about but I do\nfeel like maybe it's lost something from\nthat kind of more temper ede that we got\nin the Nova blast 4 but has it got that\nsame versatility about it compared to\nthe previous you I'm not entirely sure\nit's maybe kind of moved slightly close\nto things like the GEL Nimbus I think\nfrom a kind of durability point of view\nI still think it's going to be a very\ndoable shoe I think probably more so\nthan previous shoes there's a lot of\nrubber here you know it might not be in\nin the center of the shoe but on the\noutside the shoe there's a lot of rubber\nand I'm not seeing a whole lot of wear I\nsaid over 50k in this shoe there's no\nreal kind of signs of kind of wear and\nthat's kind of what you'd expect to see\nfrom an over blast is it a better shoe\nthan the no blast what I think it's a\ndifferent shoe and that's kind of been\nmy experience but it is a good shoe and\nI do think it's another kind of NOA\nblast that is going to sit well on that\nkind of daily trainer range is it the\nbest one out there I'll get into that in\nmy verdict so the Nova blast is a really\ninteresting line of shoes it it changes\nquite a lot with each version of the\nshoe uh and sometimes I really like it\nsometimes I'm not a fan of it um I was a\npretty big fan of the no blast 4 I think\nit's a really good versatile shoe I\nthink it's really good for going to\nthose faster sessions uh but also you\ncan do easier stuff in it as well but\nreally the midle in the no blast 4 I\njust thought was very good at being a\nlittle bit more responsive uh and it was\na great all around shoe if you're\nlooking to buy one shoe and you want to\ndo training in it you can racing it if\nyou wanted to if you weren't going for\nlike a sub three marathon time or\nsomething like that it's a really good\nsolid allr rounder shoe NOA blast 5 um\nwhen I first put it on I really like\nthis shoe um I like soft shoes I like\nbouncy shoes if you know watch the\nchannel you know that I talk about that\nquite a lot um and this midsole this\nthis new um FF blast Max midsole that\nyou get in it it's definitely softer\nthan the Nova blast 4 when I put them on\nI really thought wow this is great this\nis reminded me of the Nova Blast One no\nblast mod is probably my favorite of the\nNova blasts because it just got the\nright balance between softness and\nbounce um with this shoe definitely sof\nin the no blast 4 and the first run I\ndid in it I thought I got a lot of\nbounce off of it I was really enjoying\nthat run since then I've done another\nfour runs in this shoe and that's varied\nbetween faster efforts um couple of easy\nruns and an interval session um in in it\nand it's been a bit hit and miss for me\nthis shoe really um I think it really\ncomes down to the fact that I'm it it by\nmaking it softer uh it does make it\nbetter for easy runs um if you're not\nreally trying to pick up a pace or\nanything like that um but it's also lost\na bit of that faster training as well so\nthe Nova blast 4 really did a good job\nat that it wasn't the the fastest\ntraining shoe out there but it's really\ngood sort of balance if you're looking\nfor a one shoe that fits all sort of\nrunning shoe um but the no blast 5 sort\nof loses that a bit um what I found on\nsome of the runs especially when I was\ntrying to maintain a faster pace uh in\nit is that it felt a little bit sluggish\nfor me on a couple of the runs not a bad\nshoe for those for for those sorts of\nsessions um but it definitely just\ndidn't feel like a shoe that I wanted to\npick the pace up in it felt like it was\nmore designed for the easier sessions\nthan picking up the pace um and as a\nresult I've not really enjoyed it as\nmuch as I did the Nova blast 4 um just\nbecause I think it's not quite it's a\ndifficult shoe to really really work out\nwhat the the benefits are um when you\npick up the pace in the shoe you do get\nnice bit of softness in it but it seems\nto to dull the effect for me a little\nbit you're not really getting the the\npickup that you're getting in the Nova\nblast 4 uh because that us is a little\nbit more responsive it's a bit firmer in\nthe midsole but it's still got a big\nstack of midsole in so it's still\nrelatively um you still got a good level\nof cushioning in it but with this CU\nthat that move towards a softer foam um\nit does feel like you you lose a bit of\nenergy um when when you're running in it\neasy sessions absolutely fine no issues\nat all you don't really get the Bounce\nfrom it but it's a very comfortable shoe\nso um it's not it's not giving you lots\nback but it is very comfortable to wear\nfor those sessions faster sessions as I\nsay it really saps your energy a little\nbit and you don't get loads back um when\nyou really want it so I have enjoyed\ntesting this shoe um I think uh it's a\ntricky shoe up when it's up against\nother trainers of a similar style\nbecause as an allrounder sort of daily\ntrainer um it's now for me sits more\ninto that cushion daily trainer realm\nwhere it's just a little bit more\ncomfortable a little bit softer to tick\noff the miles in whereas the No 4 was a\nlot more versatile so you could do a lot\nmore in it um I do think the Mido is um\nvery comfortable uh definitely feels\nnice on certain types of runs um and\noverall I would say that it's a solid\noround um daily shoe I just I just think\nthat it's it's minimized its um selling\npoints based on how good the four was\nrunning at faster pace so I've done\naround 55 60k in the aex no blast 5\nusing it for a nice mix of General daily\ntraining runs you know one slightly\nfaster run but mostly pretty easy runs\nprogression runs that kind of thing and\nit's done a really good job I've enjoyed\nrunning in it pretty much every time I\nhave I do think it's a really strong\noption as a daily trainer for me the no\nblast 5 is kind of the equivalent for\naex to shoes like the Nike Pegasus the\nscky ride the H of Clifton pum velocity\nNitro shoes that are designed to appeal\nto a really broad range of Runners be\npretty versatile shoes add a pretty good\nprice and I think it does that job\nreally well all of all those shoes I\njust mentioned I think the Nova blast 5\nis probably the standout one I'd\nrecommend to lots of people as a shoe\nthat's unlikely to offend them in any\nway and actually probably a shoe that\nmost people will enjoy quite a lot you\ngot a lot of cushioning here you know as\nmuch as any real max cushion shoe and it\ndoes protect the legs really nicely but\nit doesn't really give you that big\nclunky feeling that you get with some\nvery cushion shoes like it feels\nprotective but it still feels quite\nNimble lightweight like it's got enough\nwidth there to be quite stable I've\nreally noticed how stable the shoe is\nactually CU it's a shoe I've been using\nwhilst recovering from a twisted ankle a\nsprained ankle so I've been a bit\nworried about stability and it has felt\nyou know nice and secure under the foot\nyeah protective level of foam there but\nit's got a really smooth ride I think\nwith the redesign heel on the latest\nversion I have noticed that as a heel\nStriker it just Smooths out the ride a\nlittle bit and just means you can tick\nover really nicely and get all that\nenjoyable cushioning underfoot without\nit feeling too big or stodgy on the foot\nI've mostly been using it for easy\nmileage like I say I do think that's\nwhere it excels like it is a reasonably\nversatile shoe I did like kind of a\nsteady 10K in it and that kind of thing\nbut I'd prefer personally to be like a\nlighter shoe or more purpose built fast\nshoe myself at any kind of fast runs but\nyou know it has a little bit of\nVersatility there but I don't think\nyou're getting a really responsive ride\nfrom this midell like the foam is you\nknow quite well balanced it's not giving\nyou a load of sinking and bounce or you\nreally fiery poppy feeling off the foref\nfoot there you know just feels like a\nmore of a comfort Focus shoe which is\nhow I would use it myself but the ride\nis certainly quite smooth and you can up\nthe pace in it a little bit it's quite\nsimilar to the aex nose blast 4 in that\nregards and I think where the Pham isn't\nnecessarily giving you a whole load of\nkind of response but you are getting a\nnice smooth ride and you know a platform\nyou can push against and run a bit\nquicker if you like I think the ride is\na bit smoother than on the over blast 4\nmyself just because of that redesign\nheel like that's probably the main\nchange I've noticed between them I don't\ndon't think it's a huge step up really\noverall in performance or anything like\nthat but do think you get a slightly\nsmoother feeling from the heel and it\ndoes I think disappear on the foot as a\nresult of that so like I say it's got\nloads of cushioning here as much as Max\ncushion shoes but it doesn't feel like a\nbig shoe or a block at the end of your\nfoot there it just feels you know quite\nnatural and it does tick over quite\nnicely what it doesn't do though I think\nand this is relates to versatility is\ncompete with the you know really\nimpressive kind of lightweight daily\ntrainers that are on the market at the\nmoment things like the New Balance Rebel\nV4 the Hoka Max 6 maybe this new Addis\nAdis ZL we haven't tested yet but yeah\nit's not really built for that those are\nprobably purpose built to be a bit\nfaster and they end up being very good\ndaily Trainers for someone like myself\nwho likes that more lightweight feeling\nthat they have there still quite a lot\nof cushioning there I do think they're\ngreaters the no blast is more at the\nvery cushion daily trainer end of things\nI would say but it certainly has more\nversatility than a lot of the max\ncushion shoes out there while still\nproviding a lot of protection on the\nfoot as\nwell so my v on the ASX NOA blast 5 is\nthat this feels like another good\ninstallment for the Nova blast range it\nstill is for me a very good kind of\ndaily training shoe a shoe that you\ndefinitely can spend a lot of time in\nit's going to feel very comfortable very\nsolid very consistent um is it going to\nbe that you know the same shoes in no\nBlast for I don't think it is I think if\nyou like the idea of a softer feeling\nmore comfortable feeling Nova blast and\nthat's what you're going to get here if\nyou're looking for That Bouncy livelier\nkind of more excitable feeling of those\nearly Nova blast shoes I think there's\naspects of it but I don't quite feel\nlike it for me it's delivered that um\nand I feel it's somewhere between the\nkind of Nova Blast 3 and the Nova blast\n4 um and yeah I think it is a good daily\ntraining shoe a good shoe for kind of\nticking off that mileage is it the my\nfavorite Nova blast shoe I still think I\nwould prefer getting the Nova Blast for\nif I wanted a shoe that could do a\nlittle bit more um so yeah I think you\nknow the Nova blast 5 a different Nova\nblast I think maybe Nova blast that a\nlot more people are going to appreciate\nso I think about the other shoes that I\nprobably put or sit in the same category\nas the asex Nova blast 5 I think you've\ngot things like the Brooks Max the Haw\nMax 6 you got the new B reble V4 the\ncheaper pum ly Nitro 3 you could\nprobably put the N convincible 3 in\nthere as well I think compared to the\nGin Max I really like the Mido on the\nGin Max I you know I think it's a\nbouncier feeling to me I prefer the ride\nin general but is it as versatile as the\nNOA blast 5 possibly not I think the Max\n6 is probably the shoe I probably Veer\nto which I think you know works at kind\nof easier more Tempo Paces can work\nreally well for longer runs Maybe isn't\nas plush as the NOA blast 5 but I think\nthat's a very solid shoe at a slightly\nsimilar price the new B Ro 4 definitely\nfeels better at faster Paces is it a\nbetter longer run shoe than the Nova\nblast 5 possibly not the P velocity\nNitro 3 is a very versatile shoe again\nnot as plush as the Nova blast 5 but\nreally feels good across a mixture of\nPaces has a really good outsole as well\non that shoe and the night convincible 3\nnot a shoe that I've absolutely love but\nit has that kind of bouncy Lively ride\nmade not as stable as the Nova blast 5\ncan be a good long run shoe and the the\nzumex midell fs you know very Lively\nprobably a lot more lively than the one\nfor me personally compared to the Nova\nblast 5 so I do think it sits well with\nthose shoes they are definitely shoes\nthat I've mentioned that I'd probably\npick the Nova blast 5 over is it the\nkind of Stand Out option at that price\npoint and for that similar kind of\ncategory of cushion daily trainer um\npossibly not but I do think it's you\nknow in good company with those other\nshoes so my verdict I think you probably\nguessed from what I said in the run test\nuh I I like the no blast 5 I think it is\na solid all round shoe that veers\ntowards the easier sessions the midell\nfo is much more conducive to easier runs\ncom comfortable daily runs that sort of\nthing than the faster efforts now uh I\ndon't think it's a shoe that is really\nparticularly well designed for faster\nsessions Tempo efforts interval sessions\nthings like that it's more like the Nova\nBlast 3 for me it's a bit of a balance\nbetween the Nova Blast 3 and the Nova\nblast 4 I think it's it's trying to do\nthe Comfort side it's trying to do the\nsofter side but it's also trying to be\nversatile as well and I don't think it\ndoes the versatility that well I think\nit's it's more of a daily cushion shoe\nnow um problem is that no blast 4 was a\nvery versatile shoe and um you could buy\nit and do a lot of your training in it\nwith this I think it's now going up\nagainst easy day shoes and there are\nlots of really good easy day shoes out\nthere I think it is a very good easyday\nshoe but um I don't think it's one of\nthe best out there for the price it's\nactually still pretty good if you\ncompare it with some some of the other\num easy day shoes out there things like\nthe ax gel nimbers maxed stack shoes\nlike the Brooks L Max things like that\nthose are shoes that are firmly designed\nfor comfort and cushioning and they do\nit very well they probably do it a bit\nbetter than this because they're not\ntrying to be really versatile they're\ntrying to do cushioning and comfort\nreally well whereas this is trying to do\na bit of both and I don't think it quite\ngets the um The Versatile faster side of\nthe training but I do think it's a solid\ncomfortable shoe I think most people\nwill be happy with this as their sort of\nrecovery easy run shoe daily shoe K\nticking off the miles it's very\ncomfortable to run in I've had no issues\nin it I just think that the Nova blast 4\njust had a little bit more to it and\nthat responsive mid cell phone just\nmeant that you could use it a lot more\num than this shoe cuz I'm I'm unlikely\nto take this shoe out a lot if I'm doing\nfaster sessions intervals tempos things\nlike that so I think the aex no blast 5\nis a really good shoe and a standout in\nits category like I say of those\ngeneralist daily trainers that every\nbrand has in their lineup I think this\nis the one that stands out the most for\nme it's good value it's comfortable it's\ngot a little bit of versatility it ticks\nover nicely I think it will suit a lot\nof Runners really well and it's one that\nI imagine I'll be recommending to lots\nof Runners going forward and know if\nthey're looking for just a new Runner\nlooking for a shoe to do everything in\nor a runner who just wants to add a\npretty cushioned but not too heavy shoe\nto their rotation I think the NOA blast\n5 fits the bill really well and does it\nat a pretty good price I think terms of\nvalue you can certainly look at the aex\nno blast 4 like I slightly prefer the\nride of the five myself because of that\nslightly more smooth feeling I get from\nthe Hillel but even if you are a hill\nStriker the no blast 4 is a really good\nshoe one I enjoyed running in I think\nit's available in sales quite a lot at\nthe moment with the five coming out so I\nthink I'd probably look at that first I\ndon't think the change in foam here has\ngiven you a huge new feeling under foot\nit's still a pretty similar shoe and a\nreally good shoe but nobl 4 is also a\nreally good shoe and does the same kind\nof job and then comparing it to some of\nthe shoes I've mentioned already I think\nyou've got a couple of higher drop\noptions if you prefer that in a shoe\nthings like the Puma velocity Nitro 3 in\nparticular which is also a fair bit\ncheaper really good daily trainer it's\ngot a narrower design and you know has\nthat more traditional snap through ride\nwith a higher drop you got a slightly\nmore rocket feeling with the nose Blast\nfor sure but the Nitro 3 is a really\ngood shoe Pegasus 41 is similar I think\nof those I'd get the pum I think it's\nbetter than the Pegasus myself it's just\nlighter and has a bit more kind of\nresponse but the Pegasus is maybe a bit\nmore stable I think no blast 5 would be\nmy pick of those shoes myself because I\nlike the slightly more rocked ride you\nhave here which is probably a bit more\nsimilar to something like the sakon ride\nbut I prefer the feeling of the aex no\nblast 5 to the sakon ride 17 you've got\ndenser feeling foam with the rid a\nheavier shoe I don't find it as\nversatile as the no blast and I like the\nslightly lighter livelier feel I get\nfrom the no blast comparing it to that\nshoe if you want a lower drop shoe with\na more of a rocker in this category the\nhoker Clifton 9 is a really good shoe\nit's again not the most exciting shoe in\nthe world but it does a really nice job\nof rolling you through your stride and\nis reasonably versatile as a daily\ntrainer as well it's quite similar I\nthink to the New Balance 1080 v14 a shoe\nI did really enjoy testing this year I\nfelt like they performed quite similarly\nfor me and having quite fairly rocked\nand soft but not overly soft or rocked\nrid you know nice well balanced ride and\nboth shoes disappeared on the foot quite\nwell while still being really cushioned\nno blast 5 is a bit cheaper though so I\ngo for that ahead of the New Balance\nmyself I don't think there's I don't\nreally think there's a compelling reason\nto pay the extra money to get the New\nBalance 1080 v14 myself and then the\naexs lineup you've got a couple of shoes\nyou can compare it to like there is the\nGEL Nimbus line the GEL Nimbus 26 which\nis pitched more as the premium cushion\nshoe but I would always get the nose\nblast over the Gel Nimbus it's lighter\nit feels just as cushioned and\ncomfortable to me it's easier to run in\nat any Pace just it ticks over a bit\nmore smoothly so yeah I prefer it to the\ngel nimas for sure you know that and the\nKano have wider bases they're maybe a\nbit more stable and protective if you\nare a newer Runner or heavier Runner\nthan me maybe but no blast 5 I think\ndoes a really good job for the same kind\nof runs it's cheaper lighter bit more\nfun to run in there is the atic super\nBlast 2 as well which is a big step up\nin price and you are getting a step up\nin performance if you look at the super\nBlast 2 which is certainly a more\nversatile shoe a better shoe when you're\nrunning fast much livelier ride but\nyou're paying a lot more money for that\nshoe you know if you're getting one shoe\nto do everything in the super blast is\nprobably worth paying the extra for but\nif you're looking to add like you know a\nfairly lightweight and verstile daily\ntrainer to your lineup and already have\nmaybe a more speed Focus shoe to use\nwith it the no blast 5 is better Val and\nit's probably the one I'd get there but\nyeah super blast is a great shoe but\nmaybe a slight different category for me\nto the NOA blast so overall did really\nenjoy running the NOA blast 5 I think\nit's a really solid shoe one that will\nwork for lots of Runners it's not\nnecessarily one that's going to blow you\naway when you're run in it it's probably\nnot as exciting a ride even as the\noriginal Nova blast but it's one that\nnow is very well balanced and will work\nfor lots of Runners verdict then and for\nme there's still classic Nova blast DNA\nhere though the new softer phone means\nthat you've maybe lost a bit of that\nvery top speed potential that made the\nover Blast for arguably a better all\nround that said I still think this is a\nvery competent utility shoe that can eat\na lot of training miles even with the\nextra softness as a versatility here\nthat puts an overlast five into a group\nof excellent allr rounders that can cope\nwith most of your daily training needs\nparticularly when you're out there\nfeeling strong I think now it's not a\nmillion miles off the super Blast 2 in\nthose conditions and for some people it\nmay well suffice as a more affordable\nalternative to Super Blast 2 what you\ngetting now is a daily trainer that's\nsuper comfortable super plush Super\ncontrolled nice and roomy that has a mid\nPAC sweet spot with some potential for\ncruising a little bit faster but only\nwhen you're feeling at it it's not as\ngood as the super last 2 it's not quite\npacking The Punchy ride but at $140 \u00a3\n135 I think it represents pretty good\nvalue this is another of those shoes I\nthink you could buy to cover a lot of\nyour marathon training runs that's it\nfrom us on this review of the Nova blast\n5 thanks a lot for watching don't forget\nto like subscribe click the little bell\nand if you're going to catch me below\nyou find L to our podcast

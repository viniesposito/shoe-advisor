  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name\nis Nick in this video we're going to be\ncomparing the choros pace 3 and the\nchoros pace\n[Music]\nPro so the pace 3 and the pace Pro are\nthe two best watches in corus's range in\nour opinion they are both lightweight\nreally impressive sports watches that\noffer a lot of the features you get on\nmore expensive and larger devices in a\ncomfortable little package with the pace\n3 being one of our top picks for\nbeginners or just budget sports watches\nin general while the pace Pro is\nchorus's first AMOLED sports watch and\ncompetes in general with watches like\nthe Garmin 4 265 so in this video I'm\ngoing to run through the key differences\nbetween the two watches I've been\nwearing both for a couple of weeks and\nI've tested both extensively in the past\nas well and then we'll go straight into\na verdict where Kieran Mike and I will\nall say which one we'd buy if we were\ncoming to choose between the pace Pro\nand the pace 3 having tested both\nwatches so there's a lot of similar\nfeatures on these watches like corus\ntends to have the same features\nthroughout its entire range in terms of\nlike things like sports tracking and\ntraining analysis you're getting a lot\nof very similar stuff here but there are\nobviously some pretty big differences\nbetween the pace Pro and the pace 3\nstarting with the price the pace 3 is\nsignificantly cheaper at \u00a3219 or $229\nwhereas the pace Pro is \u00a3349 or $349\nPace Pro is also a bigger watch you've\ngot a 46 mm case a slightly thicker case\nas well and that makes it a bit heavier\nat 37 G with a nylon band compared to\nthe PACE 3 at 30 G with a nylon band\nthey are both still very lightweight\nwatches overall similar materials used\non both watches with plastic cases and\nglass screens but you've also got that\nbig AMOLED screen on the chorus Pace Pro\nwhich is probably the biggest reason\nyou'd look at upgrading from the pace 3\nit's a 1.3 in AMOLED screen whereas on\nthe pace 3 you've got a 1.2 in memory\nand pixel display so getting a much\nbrighter and more engaging screen on the\npace Pro got the same two button design\non both but on the pace Pro the back\nbutton a bit bigger and the digital dial\nis steel so you can take ECG\nmeasurements whereas it's a plastic dial\non the pace 3 they've both got the same\n58m water resistance and a similar slate\nof sensors under the hood things like a\nbarometric altimeter and pulse oximeter\nhowever you have a faster processor on\nthe coros pace Pro which makes it\nsnappier to navigate its menus and\nuseing like the maps on the watch and\nthat is a big feature you get on the\npace Pro which you don't get on the\nchorus Pace 3 Pace 3 just has breadcrumb\nnavigation with a line and pointer\nwhereas you get a full offline maps on\nthe chorus Pace Pro you've also got\nbigger storage on the chorus Pace Pro\nwhich has 32 GB of storage compared to 4\nGB on the pace 3 which gives you more\nroom to store things like maps and also\nmusic they both offer music storage\nalthough it's just simple drag and drop\nmusic files rather than connecting to\nany kind of streaming service then the\nlast difference you'll see on paper is\nbattery life and you'll see that in\npractice as well the battery stats\ndepend a fair bit on whether you're\nusing the rais to wake feature on the\nchorus Pace Pro or not but even if you\nhave the screen always on you're going\nto get 6 days of battery life with the\npace Pro or 20 days if you use the rais\nto wake feature whereas the pace 3 is\nlisted at lasting 15 days in watch mode\nso the pace 3 lasts longer outside of\nworkouts but during workouts you get\nmore battery life from the pace Pro\nwhich offers up to 31 hours of dualband\nGPS battery life that drops to 24 if you\nuse the always on screen whereas a\ncourse pce 3 just offers 15 hours of\ndual band GPS battery\n[Music]\nlife so I think the biggest pull to me\non the pace Pro over the pace V Lies\nfirst and foremost with the AMOLED\ndisplay which I do think makes it a\nnicer watch to use day-to-day when I\nthink about the Smartwatch features that\nyou have at your disposal I know you\nknow very very similar to the ones on\nthe pce 3 I just think having that\nbigger screen that color display just\nmakes them features that I want to use\non a more regular basis you've got that\nfull mapping support as well which I\nthink you know as we've seen with other\nAMOLED watches you know allows you to\ngive you you know a lot more detail in\nthat mapping and just make some features\nthat feel a lot nicer to use kind of day\nand night I probably had a couple of\nextra things on top of that I think the\nGPS performance has just been a little\nbit better for me in my test has not\nbeen a huge amount in it and I think the\npace three is very accurate but I think\nfor me the accuracy has just been a\nlittle bit better for me on the pace Pro\nI think the battery life as well I think\nyou know if you're using this watch in a\nkind of with a R to wake I think the\nbattery life is better than the pce 3\nit's got a really good standby battery\nmode that we've seen in all chorus\nwatches and I think you know if you're\nwilling to use it in the raise to wake\nalways on display mode battery life is\nvery good but I think as I generally use\nit with the raise to wake I think the\nbattery life is very good and better for\nme than the pace 3 now in terms of which\nwatch I would go for I still really like\nthe pce 3 and I think you know from a\nvaly point of view I think there's a lot\nto like about that watch I like the\ndesign I think the core run tracking\nexperience is very good I think the Dual\nBand GPS performance is good risk-based\nheart rate monting is probably a little\nbit better for me though would you know\npair it up with external heart R mon\nwith both watches but I think you know\nif you were you know for General runs I\nthink the performance has been a little\nbit better you know it has kind of\nbreadcrumb navigation which for me would\nbe enough you know I just want some kind\nof mapping and navigation support you\nknow I like having some mapping and\nnavigation Sport and I think having that\non the P3 is probably going to be enough\nfor me so as an all round package from a\npoint of view I would probably still be\ngoing for the pace 3 I do really like\nthe pace Pro and there's a lot that I've\nliked about this watch it's one of my\nfavorite watches I've tested this year\nbut if you can live without I would say\nthat kind of you know Amed display the\nkind of slightly Slicker software that\nfull mapping support there's a lot to\nstill like about the pce 3 and as I said\nit's a very good value watch that you\nknow still delivers in the key areas and\nit would probably be the watch that I\nwould go for despite really liking the\npace Pro and if I had a little bit more\nmoney to spend and I would definitely be\ngoing for the pace Pro but you know if\nyou're looking for Value I think the\npace three is the one that you should go\nfor and that's one I would go for I'm\ngoing to open by saying that these are\nboth excellent watches that I think\nrepresent good value in the whole kind\nof scheme of running watches probably\nthe most appealing watch is in the\nchorus lineup for sure so I don't think\nyou could really go wrong if you buy\neither but getting into which is best in\nmy testing the pace 3 and the pace Pro\ncome up a pretty close match in many\nareas I think the pace Pro is a bit\nsnappier to move around thanks to the\nfaster processor the big bright screen\ndoes elevate your stats insights and\nmake the most of that additional mapping\ncapability that's definitely a step up\nin the experience but it's like kind of\nturning left on a plane you might not\nnotice the difference until you've\nactually experienced it for yourself and\nthe pace 3 is perfectly good for most\nRunners needs if you've not experienced\nthe AMOLED you're not going to be all\nthat bothered necessarily but the\nexperience is a little bit up there on\nthe pace Pro on accuracy I tested the\naccuracy and heart rate reliability\nagainst a selection of Rivals including\nthe CTO race s titanium the polar\nVantage G3 I also used various chest\nstraps to Benchmark and I did the sort\nof GPS up against things like the Garmin\nPhoenix 8 AMOLED as another Benchmark\nand when it came to the GPS performance\nI think it was solid on both I didn't\nreally find that much to choose between\nthese two the optical heart rate can be\na bit fallible on both as well does well\nduring kind of easy steady runs mainly\nduring intervals it struggles but I\nwouldn't wait to say one is better than\nthe other beyond the screen the build\nfor me is largely the same too both\ndevices are a bit plastic with cheaper\nmaterials but that does make them nice\nand lightweight and wearable 24/7 pretty\nmuch the same the pce three is a smidge\nlighter but I wouldn't say that's\nnoticeable on the wrist the screen is\nalso a touch bigger but again I don't\nfind that makes a huge difference in\nterms of the use on the move it's the\nbrightness and color that really gives\nthe pace Pro the Boost not the real\nestate you get now on paper you're also\ngetting longer battery life in the most\naccurate GPS modes on the pace Pro and\nthis is some where where I did spot a\ndifference in my tests when I had the\nalways on screen set to off in the max\nGPS accuracy modes that's using the Dual\nfrequency GPS it use around half the\nbattery of the coros pace 3 that\nobviously becomes less pronounced if you\nhave the always screen on or the always\non screen on that said I'm not sure it's\na big enough difference to make me buy\nthe pro over the three now another area\nwhere you might be looking and thinking\nit's different the extra storage for\nmaps and music also sounds good in the\nspecs but the music is such a faf\ngetting the mp3s on there that I never\nreally I don't even own music files so\nit doesn't matter how much storage there\nis for it not bothered by that unless\nyou are then I wouldn't worry so then\nthe decision ultimately comes down to\nwhether you want that bright AMOLED\nscreen and those offline maps if you do\nI think the chorus pce Pro is worth the\nextra it's easily the best corus watch\nto buy if you're looking for a capable\nsports watch with a killer screen the\nlongest lasting AMOLED battery life\ngoing and those better navigation skills\nif you already own a coros pace 3 and\nyou're not bothered about the AMOLED\nscreen and the maps then I don't think\nit's worth upgrading even for the added\nECG and that little bit of extra battery\nlife if you're a newcomer and the screen\nand Maps aren't priorities I'd probably\nsay save yourself some dollars and go\nfor the choros pace 3 for me personally\nwhen it comes to bang for buck I choose\nthe pace three as the better value\noption if someone else was paying for it\nthough let's get someone else to pay for\nit I think I would choose the pace Pro\nso I've tested both of these watches a\nlot and I really like both of these\nwatches they're two of my standouts on\nthe market two I would cons consider\nbuying myself for sure if I was a new\nRunner or an experienced Runner they\nboth really offer everything you need to\ntrack your training I've not really seen\na big difference in the accuracy of\nthese two watches the chorus does say\nyou've got an improved satellite setup\non the chorus Pace Pro and the heart\nrate sensor is designed to sit more\nsnugly against the wrist but I've seen\nvery similar results from both watches\nwhen I've been testing them side by side\nover the past couple of weeks and in\ngeneral throughout my testing both\nwatches have really impressed me on GPS\naccuracy I can't really F them at all\ncompared to other watches out there and\nthe Heart Ray accuracy is about in line\nwith what you expect from an optical\nsensor in that it's been pretty good for\nme for the most part especially in warm\nconditions testing it lately in cold\nconditions I've had a bit more kind of\nvariability in the results compared to\nthose of a chest trap but overall I'd\nsay both of them offer pretty good heart\nrate tracking especially as they are\nsmall watches you can really you know\npull snuggly against your wrist and get\nbetter readings uh especially like I say\nin warm conditions like I said I have\nbeen wearing them both at the same time\nover the past couple of weeks and GPS\naccuracy have not really seen a big\ndifference the pace 3 tends to be\nslightly more generous when I'm doing uh\nworkouts especially on Loop courses but\ntalking a couple of seconds uh per rep\nthat kind of thing so no big difference\nso I wouldn't say that be a big reason\nto upgrade to the chorus Pace Pro the\nbig reason for sure is certainly the\ndesign though you have got that AMOLED\nscreen which is a big upgrade especially\nas the mirroring pixel displays you get\non chorus watches aren't the brightest\nin general and that's the case with the\npace 3 it is still clear enough to read\nit's not a problem but the chorus Pace\nPro screen is much brighter more\nengaging easier to use on the Run easier\nto use off the run and yeah that's\nprobably the killer reason to upgrade I\nwas also really worried that when I was\nlooking at the stats on paper that the\npace Pro would feel like a much bigger\nwatch on the wrist than the pace 3 but\nthat isn't the case at all although it\nis quite a bit thicker in in terms of\nthe stats actually the way it sits on\nthe wrist makes it feel pretty similar\nin thickness to the PACE 3 for me and\nit's still really lightweight and the\nfact that it's a bigger watch is only a\nbenefit because you get that bigger\nscreen I'd say it still feels really\nsmall and lightweight on the wrist Pace\n3 feels a bit smaller but the thickness\nis the big thing for me and actually\ndoesn't feel thicker to me the pce pro\nso I would say the design is a big\nupgrade all around you could say that if\nyou've never used an AMOLED watch and if\nyou never do use one you're not going to\nmiss it at all so you could just get the\npace three and never even try an ed\nwatch then that wouldn't be a terrible\nidea because it is pretty you know still\na pretty nice screen but certainly if\nyou do use them both side by side or try\nthe pce pro you will miss it I think if\nyou go for the memory and pixel screen\nafterwards then battery life side by\nside has been quite interesting they've\nbe lasting pretty much the same amount\nof time so in general if I'm running\nevery single day uh you know fairly\nheavy use with the screen always on the\nchorus Pace Pro will last me five or 6\ndays that's more like six or seven days\non the chorus Pace 3 however the battery\nlife during workouts is better on the\nchorus Pace Pro so the more you train\nthe kind of the closer in battery life\nthese two watches will be so over the\npast 5 days I've warned them both having\ncharged them both to 100% at this point\nthe past three is down to 34% and the\nchus pace Pro is down to 23% so it's\ndropped off a little bit more after the\nrun today they might be slightly closer\nin battery life again so but you are\ngetting you know overall quite similar\nresults and you always have the option\nto turn the raise to wake feature on on\nthe pace Pro which I think would push it\npast the pace 3 so even though it's an\nAMOLED watch I think actually it battery\nlife is probably a little bit better in\npractice because you really want that\nlonglasting General watch mode you can\ngo to race to wake and then during\nactivities it does Outlast the past\nthree quite considerably in jaw band or\nthe all systems on GPS mode so that's\nanother reason I would look at the pace\nPro surprisingly the AMOLED watch the\nbattery life is really good on it and\nthen the maps are certainly a bonus so\nthere are times when they're really\nuseful and for most the time they're not\nthat useful so like if I'm just running\naround the streets that have near my\nhouse I don't really need maps to\nnavigate or anything like that and the\nbreadcrumb line and point of navigation\nyou get on the pace stre is good enough\nto get you places but when I went to a\ntrip to Paris recently you know the maps\non the pace Pro were a really big\nbenefit to make it easier to navigate\nyou know those very tricky streets you\nget in Paris and the same would be if\nyou're someone who's regularly doing a\nlot of trail running I'm heading up to\nScotland over Christmas will map out\nsome nice trailer runs and having the\nfull maps on the pace Pro is an upgrade\nit's not one that would be an absolutely\nkey one for me to make me upgrade over\nthe pace 3 but for some people it\ncertainly will be so overall it's a\npretty big step up in price but I do\nthink the pace Pro is worth it just cuz\nof that screen especially if it's a\nwatch you're going to wear all the time\nit's just a more enjoyable watch to have\non like even now the the Christmas\nscreen I have on it is better than the\none on the pce 3 and it it makes me\nhappy to see that all the time and while\nit is a fairly big jump in price I think\nyou are getting you know an equivalent\njump in the quality of the watch because\nof that screen and then the bonus like\nthe maps and then the faster processor\nand extra storage I think will make it a\nlittle bit more future proof in terms of\ncorus's software updates as well that\nsaid if you're just looking for a watch\nto wear during workouts only pce 3 will\ndo that job really well and you can take\nit off and put on I know a dress watch\nor a smart watch or something outside\nthat then the P3 will be the one to go\nfor because it is so much cheaper and if\nyou're just not fussed about the am\ndisplay then I would get the past3\nbecause the other upgrades on the pace\nPro you know are good they're useful\nespecially the maps but they're not\nenough to make me pay that extra amount\nof cash for the pace Pro pace3 is such a\ngood watch still so yeah it's really\nwhether you really want that AMOLED\nwatch and you plan to use all the time\nin which case I do think the pce pro is\nworth the extra and that is the one I'd\n[Music]\nget that's our comparison of the coros\npace Pro and the coros pace 3 let us\nknow what you think in the comments\nbelow please

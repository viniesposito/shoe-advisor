  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand to our multi-tester review of the\nnew polar Vantage M3 this is the latest\nmid-range running watch to get a\nsmartwatch style AMOLED touchcreen it\npacks dual frequency GPS you've got\noffline maps an ECG sensor and a\ncomprehensive Suite of polar's training\nperformance and health tools we've had\nthe Vantage M3 on test for a while now\nand in this video we're ready to give\nyou our verdict so in the next 15\nminutes we'll share what we love what's\nnot so good where this watch fits into\nthe busy running watch landscape and\ngive our thoughts on whether it's worth\n349 of your hard earned pounds so let's\nget into\nit things have moved on a lot since the\nlaunch of the original M400 about 10\nyears ago polar has improved the design\nof its watches beyond recognition now\nthe polar Vantage M3 follows the Vantage\nV3 as a good-look polar watch with more\nsubtle styling that fits better into\ndaily life the features in the polar\nVantage M3 are exactly the same as\nyou'll get on the Advantage V3 and the\npolar grit X2 Pro so if you're choosing\nbetween these watches from Polar it's\nnow going to come down to a few factors\ndesign so size looks and styling\ndurability battery life plus how they\nperform the hero on the Polar Vantage M3\nis the new bright color Smartwatch style\n1.28 in Amal display that brings a\nnicely responsive touchcreen to the m\nmodels for the first time the Gorilla\nGlass 3 display is slightly smaller than\nyou'll get on the grit X2 Pro and the\nVantage V3 and doesn't offer the scratch\nresist istance of the sapphire crystal\nscreens that you'll get on pricey\nwatches like the grit X2 Pro however\nthat screen here on the M3 is brighter\nit's 1,500 nits compared to the 150 that\nyou get on the X2 Pro and the V3 now the\nVantage M3 comes in at 12 mm thick 44 Ms\nin diameter weighs in at 53 G that's\nsmaller thinner and lighter than the\nVantage M2 and the Vantage V3 with\nplastic front and back casings and a\nsteel bezel those are pretty standard\nmaterials on mid-range watch but it\ncomes with two sizes of standard 22 mil\nsilicone swappable bands Hardware wise\nyou get the same sensor Suite is the\nVantage V3 in the grit X2 Pro that\nincludes dual frequency GPS and the\nlatest polar Elixir bio sensing Tech\nwhich combines polar's Gen 4 Optical\nheart rate sensors with wrist ECG\nthere's also a skin temperature sensor\nand spo2 blood oxygen sensor on battery\nlife the polar Vantage M3 offers 30\nhours in performance mode 70 hours in\neco mode and 7 Days in Smartwatch mode\nthat's slightly shorter than the gr X2\nPro and Advantage V3 but the same as\nyou'll find on the Polar Pacer Pro and\nthe older polar Vantage M2 now the M3\nalso has a bigger memory and faster\nprocessor it's waterproof to 50 m which\nis the same as the V3 but the G X2 Pro\nis good to 100 m price-wise at launch\nand based on RP the polar Vantage M3\nlands at \u00a3349 or just shy $400 in the US\nin polar's lineup it drops in between\nthe polar P pro at 299 pound or 32995 in\nthe US and the polar Vantage V3 at 519\nor \u00a3599 in the US in the increasingly\nfiercely contested AMOLED packing\nmid-range it's up against simly priced\nwatches like the coros pace pro at 349\nin both us and pounds and the sunto race\ns at 325 in the UK or 449 in the US but\nit undercuts the price your gin 4 and a\n265 which has a RRP of 4299 99 in the UK\nand\n$449 in the US though that has been on\ndeal for Black Friday\nrecently polar Vantage M3 offers 150\nsport modes including multiport mode and\nall the familiar training and health\ntools that you'll get on the grit X2 Pro\nand the V3 that includes training load\nPro nightly recharge recovery sleep\ntracking Boost from sleep score fit\nspark workout recommendations that are\nBAS on your recovery fuel-wise fueling\nsupport there are also at rest Fitness\ntests and performance testing for\nrunning cycling and walking now the M3\nis built on the same software platform\nas the Vantage V3 and the gr X2 Pro so\nthere's the capability to roll all new\nfeatures across all three watches and\nnew features that come down in high\nwatches to this maps and navigation\nsmarts are also the same as the G X2 Pro\nand the V3 including full color offline\nmaps with pre-installed maps for the US\nand Europe with other regions available\nto download for free there's commute\ncompatible routing plus rout guidance\nback to start and trackback features\nbeline navigation to points of interest\nis coming in an update down the line not\nthere yet when it comes to Smartwatch\nsmarts the polar Advantage M3 is more\nlimited than the Garmin 4 a 265 there's\nbasic notifications but no contactless\npayments you've got music controls but\nno offline music or streaming support\nfor Spotify\n[Music]\nEtc comes to my likes for the polar\nAdvantage M3 uh the first one is\ndefinitely the design I think it's a\nreally nice screen this watch I do like\npolar's AMOLED they feel very close to\nthe top of the glass there and they\nreally pop and they're very bright and\nengaging and I think that's the same\nwith the Vantage M3 as it was with the\nVantage V3 or the git X2 Pro it's just\nyeah it's a really nice screen it's very\nclear to read in all conditions bright\nsunlight or tree cover or inside and\nyeah it's done really well I think the\ndesign overall is pretty nice as well\nit's got that nice kind of metal bezel\nto it it feels fairly premium for a\nmid-range watch and what I don't love\nabout how thick it is compared to other\nwatches in this area like the Cor Pace\nPro or the Garmin 4 and a 265 like it\nwas a comfortable watch for me to wear\nfor the most part occasionally it stuck\nout a little bit too much at night but\noverall yeah really nice design all\naround I'd say I also a big fan of the\nfact that polar brought maps to this\nwatch like that is a key selling point\nand a mid-range watch these days with\nthe choros pace Pro offering it the\nsunto race s and it's kind of a\ndifferentiator with the Garmin 4 a265\nthe maps are easy to get onto the watch\nthey're easy to follow and just makes\nlife a bit easier to follow routes on a\nmap I find compared to using a break\ncrumb Trail and yeah they're nicely done\non the Polar Vantage M3 the GPS is has\nalso been a plus point for me so po had\nsome teething difficulties with its dual\nband watches and like the ignite series\nwhen it got the Dual Band GPS but it's\nreally sort it out with the Vantage V3\nthe grid X2 Pro and now the Vantage M3\nI've been testing it against the chorus\nPace Pro the Garmin for 265 the GMA 4\nand a 955 throughout testing and in jaw\nband mode yeah the polar has been very\nclose to all those watches they've all\nbeen delivering really reliable tracks\nno concerns at all about the GPS\naccuracy on this watch and the pacing\nhas been nice and consistent on the runs\nfor me as well so yeah all around you\nknow lots of key areas very well\nexecuted on this watch I would say so in\nterms of things I've liked about the\npolar Vantage M I think the first thing\nI'll start about with is obviously the\nscreen and I think that's a really\nobviously the big deal here is an AMOLED\ndisplay that we're getting on the\nadvantage M3 which is a big upgrade from\nthe memory and pixel display that we got\non Advantage M2 now it's not just about\nhaving the Amo display I think it's also\nhaving about a screen that really kind\nof fills that case as well too that was\nreally my kind of major issue from a\ndesign point of view with the Vantage M2\nis that you had that screen and while\ncould you know generally be forgiving\nabout having a memory pixel display\nbecause they're still good displays\nultimately I just felt that it was more\nbezel than there was screen and that\ndefinitely has been addressed on the\nVantage M3 what you get is a very nice\nbright vibrant Amo display one that you\ncan keep on at all times as well too I\nthink the other thing obviously very\nimportant is that kind of core kind of\ntracking experience and I'm mainly\ntalking about the GPS performance\nobvious you're getting that dual\nfrequency GPS um support here which\npolar has kind of rolled out on its\nwatches already if you're looking for a\npolar watch that has that kind of strong\nGPS performance that's kind of what I've\nseen in my tests and I've been using\nthem against other kind of dual bands\nkind of um watches from Garmin and from\ntto and from corus as well too and it's\nvery much held up very well in those\ntests and I think if you're looking for\nstrong GPS performance that's kind of\nwhat I've seen here from my time with\nAdvantage M3 I think another thing\nobviously is battery life and that is a\nbig kind of consideration here when you\nare having an AMOLED display the AMOLED\ndisplay is going to drain a battery life\nquicker than a memory and pixel display\nthat's to be you know expected um I\nthink for me I think I've had this is\nthe best experience I've had from a\nbattery life point of view from a polar\nwatch with an amalo display I think that\nhas been with the alwayson display with\nthe kind of raise to wake and I've used\na mixture of both I think from a GPS um\ntracking point of view and obviously in\nthat mode you even when you're using\nthat best best accuracy mode you can\nalso you know keep the screen on all\ntimes so you can choose to use a race\ntow in that kind of tracking mode and\nfor me in general it's been a lot better\nthan my experience with other polar\nwatches I haven't seen the drain in the\nsame way I've seen on other polar AMOLED\ndisplay watches I definitely found it's\nbeen a lot more reliable and consistent\na bit more in keeping with the numbers\nthat kind of polar recommends basically\nand you know while I have probably been\ncharging it more than other watches in\nand around this price range I think\nultimately I've been very happy with the\nperformance that I've got from The Polar\nvarm 3 another thing for me would be the\nmapping you know it's not the most\ndetailed Rich kind of offline mapping\nBut ultimately is there it's there there\non a cheaper Polar watch I think that's\nreally important again this is really to\ndo with the fact that what else is\nhappening around the Vantage M3 you know\nand all those other watches are getting\nthat kind of free offline mapping\nsupport at this price and now polar has\nit as well too and it's a good\nexperience overall maybe isn't the most\ndetailed level of mapping and navigation\nsupport but the maps are pretty easy to\nkind of view you can see that kind of\ndetail you can differentiate different\nelements in maps and ultimately it's a\ngood addition to the vage empath 3 so a\nlot of positives there with my time the\nVantage M3 definitely a lot of things I\nthink that are a big upgrade from the\nVantage M2 um and almost feels like a\ndifferent watch ultimately so kicking\noff with the first of my likes then and\nthe first thing is the screen I found\nthe AMOLED bright and Punchy a definite\nupgrade on the M2 easy to read in all\nconditions the touch screen is Snappy\nand responsive I really like the fact\nthat rais to wake was also quick to\nrespond which meant I could switch off\nthe always on making it easier to eek\nout more staying power out of the\nbattery life now the Vantage M3 isn't as\ngood looking as the aluminium Vantage V\n3 but it avoids feeling or looking too\ncheap I think the Vantage M3 beats the\nmore plastic choros Pace proon looks and\nI found the Vantage M3 light and Compact\nand comfortable on the wrist this is a\npretty easy watch to wear 247 though I\ndesperately want Polar to offer a nylon\nstrap to really boost that comfort and\nsecond for me is the GPS when it comes\nto GPS the polar avantage M3 dual\nfrequency performed really well for me\nit struggled a little bit in tree cover\nbut at times it handled tricky under\npasses here in London better than the\nGarmin Fe Phoenix 8 and I saw nothing\nthat troubled me in my tests and one of\nmy regular 10 km runs that mix London\nstreets with River paths and its most\naccurate mode up against the Dual\nfrequency packing Garmin Phoenix a\nAMOLED a much pricier watch and the\nApple watch Ultra T watch that actually\nis really well known for being good on\nthe GPS accuracy the Vantage M3 was\nreally good on the overall distance the\nPhoenix 8 loged 6.4 miles the Apple\nwatch Ultra 2 logged 6.36 mil in\nAdvantage M3 came in at 6.39 mil and my\nfinal like and I'm going to put this in\nthe pros column even though the battery\nlife performance was a bit mixed at\ntimes but in my tests I ran through two\nfull to dead Cycles with one the always\non screen on one using the raise to wake\nwith always on I got around five days\nusage on a single charge that included\njust half an hour of GPS training in\nthat test and hours max accuracy\nperformance mode with always on used\naround 4% with the screen on the Polar\nVantage M3 is a thirsty beast overnight\nthough it watched at an average of 11%\nwhilst I slept that's not far off the\nburn rate of the Apple Watch series 10\nand it does let it down a bit with rais\nto wake that dropped to 7% or less and I\ngot around six days of General usage\nwith 6 hours of GPS training and four\nhours of heart rate cardio training\nthrown which is pretty good A 4-Hour\nmarathon in Max accuracy performance\nmode raise to wake and using Maps burn\n20% the upshot for hourong GPS training\nefforts the polar Advantage M3 is not\nquite as good but for me is a fair close\nmatch on battery life for the coros pace\nPro and the sunto race s and generally\nspeaking I think you're getting good\nbattery life here for an AMOLED\nwatch moving on to the things that\nweren't so good Nao Vantage g3's Optical\nheart rate performance was a bit more\nhit and miss for me on one 2 and a half\nmile easy run the M3 went High early and\nstayed High I had some easy runs where\nit was a good match for the chest trap\nduring another interval session it\nregistered all the efforts quite a lot\nhigher than the chest strap it was\nbetter on the progression run with just\nthe odd Spike so what you're getting\nhere from the optical is a bit of a\nmixed bag but you know I think that's\npretty standard for me when it comes to\nOptical performance maybe it was just\nslightly worse than some of the other\nwatches now another thing that I'm not\nkeen on at all is the low battery life\nshut down one important thing to note is\nthat polar's devices start to lock\ncertain features where the battery drops\nbelow 10% for example you can't start a\nworkout at 9% so in reality you're only\naccessing around 90% of the battery\ncapacity that's not the case on other\nwatches that let you risk it when the\nbattery drops low I get why po might be\ndoing this but it does cut short the\ntime you've got until you have to charge\nagain now when it comes to Smart Watch\ntools polar is also a Stell a long way\nbehind Garmin and nowhere near sport\ncapable dedicated SmartWatches like the\nApple Watch series 10 the polar Vantage\nM3 smarts are limited to notifications\nfrom a connected phone and music\ncontrols there's no offline music\nstorage or Spotify dieser uh support\nlike you'll find on the Garmin 4\n265 and the choros pace Pro there's also\nno no NFC payments or app store if\nyou're looking for a more complete\nbalance of sports tracking and\nSmartwatch capability the Gin 4 and a\n265 is maybe a better bet and for more\nSmartwatch smarts with your running\ntools the Apple Watch series 10 is worth\na consideration if that's something that\nyou're prioritizing it's all of dislikes\nand the heart rate monitoring for me has\njust not been very good like it's been\nnotably worse than other watches even at\nthis time of year it's a bit cold and\nyou know lots of watches start to\nstruggle with an optical heart rate when\nit gets a bit cold but the polar has\nbeen worse for me than the other watches\nI've been wearing at a similar time like\ncor Pace bro and those Gins I mentioned\nit just just tends to go on a little W\nnormally if a watch goes wrong for me\nit's cuz it's locking onto my Cadence\nbut the Vantage M3 just seems to go\nquite high but not too high occasionally\nit will do really well on heart rate but\nyeah for a lot of the time it's been a\nbit sporadic on heart rate and I would\ndefinitely pair an external sensor with\nthis watch like different people will\nhave different results with Optical\nheart rate moners and watches but yeah\nfor me it has been notably wrong on most\nof my runs which is not something I\nexperien so much these days like not\ngenerally a huge fan of optical heart\nrate tracking but actually lots of the\nwatches I've been testing recently been\npretty good for most of my runs but that\nhasn't been the case for me with the\nFant gem 3 next dislike is kind of\nGeneral usability I think polar needs to\nimprove its user interface a little bit\nthere's lots of just mild annoyances\nthere's not that many nice watch faces\nthere's lots of little things I find\nthat make it a slightly more annoying or\ntricky watch to use day to-day than the\nother watches in its area things like\nthe Garmin and the chorus which have I\nthink slightly better user interfaces\nobviously you get used to it but there\nare things that are just quite annoying\nso on some menus you can go up to go all\nthe way to the bottom of the list again\nbut then you click through to another\nmenu and you can't do that and if I\nchange from miles to kilometers which I\ndo quite a lot I then have to go into\nthe app to change the automatic lap\ndistance for runs and yeah things like\nthat it's a bit disconnected and it's\nsomething that's been you know a bit of\na problem for a long time but po hasn't\nreally gone out of its way to fix any of\nthose kind of minor issues and you can\nonly have four data fields on a on a run\nas well again like everyone will offer\nat least five or six these days so yeah\nthere's a few things that PO could I\nthink solve quite quickly with like a\nsmall software update but they haven't\ndone it for a long time and you know I\nthink other brands can release more\nsoftware updates quicker than polar and\nfix a lot of these little minor things\nthat people complain about so I'm hoping\nthat is something they will get to\nsorting out also say the training\nanalysis is a bit limited on the watch\nagain just looking at the other brands\nin this area a lot of the negatives with\nthis watch are not really that negative\nit's just that other brands are offering\na bit more at the same price or less\nyou're getting a lot more detailed kind\nof training analysis graphs over the\nlast week and you do get the information\non the polo you can obviously dive into\nmore detail on the web app or the phone\napp but you know could all be on the\nwatch again it's some where the polar\nhas had it the same way for a very long\ntime and I think they could probably\npush it on a bit and improve the\nexperience on the watch a little bit\nalso had some issues with sleep tracking\non the watch I find with polar if I wake\nup for any length of time in the night\nyou know even if it's just like 20 or 30\nminutes it will only track one period of\nsleep so if I go to sleep and then at\n1:00 a.m. I have to get up and go and\nsee to one of the kids and they go back\nto sleep from 1:30 through till 7:00\nit's not a bad night sleep and most\nWatchers will track it like that you\nknow I might have still got my 8 hours\noverall or whatever it is they might\nthey'll just recognize the fact I was\nawake for a period whereas Poland\ndoesn't seem to do that it always seems\nto just log either the first or second\nhalf of my night and say oh you had a\nterrible night's sleep you only slept 4\nhours but yeah I slept 3 hours before\nthat small awake period so I've noticed\nthat a few times with the watch and\nagain not a big deal just something that\nI think is a bit off for me and then my\nlast dislike would be the battery life\nwhich which is fine it's kind of three\nto four days if you have the or on\nscreen on you can push it a bit further\nwith the or screen off that's you know\nrunning with multiband mode and running\nevery day and doing a fair bit of\ntraining that's okay B life for an Amal\nwatch it's just again we're looking at\nthe competition here and that's the\nworst of this kind of quartet of watches\nthat are now really strong in this\nmid-range area which is the corus pce\nPro the sunto race s Garmin 4265 they're\nall going to offer you a little bit more\nbattery life in terms of you know real\nworld use the the Vantage M3 is strong\non individual activities it will last\nyou a good length of time even in\nmultiband mode but in terms of how often\nyou have to charge it I charge the polar\na bit more than those other watches I\nfind so into the things that I\nabsolutely love about my time with the\npolar Vantage M3 I think the first thing\nI'll start with is that I do think it's\nplay it a little bit safe on the design\nfront now I don't think there's anything\nnecessarily wrong with the look of the\nVantage M3 but I kind like the fact that\nthe volage M2 was kind of taking things\nin a slightly different direction trying\nto kind of straddle kind of more stylish\nkind of sporty uh kind of look\nultimately and there were aspects that I\ndid like I think ultimately I do like\nthe fact that now there is a bigger\ndisplay there is more screen ultimately\nas well compared to Advantage M2 but I\ndo think kind of Blends into the crowd a\nlittle bit more doesn't really stand out\nin the same way that some other watches\ndo it very much Falls in line with the\nlatest kind of Vantage um series watches\nand the grit watches which yeah\nultimately it feels like it it's a\npretty solid watch but I think in terms\nof General look I wish you know Poland\nmaybe kind of continued on that path to\ntry and do something slightly different\nwith the Vantage M series I think the\nother thing for me and it's a bit more\nabout that kind of presentation but this\ntime kind of on the software side of\nthings I think there's still some work\nto be done on the kind of user interface\nside of things on the watch I think\nobviously off the watch as well too I do\nthink it's still got a little bit of\nwork to do that I think particularly\nfrom her kind of delivering the training\nanalysis cuz there's a lot of good stuff\nhere from Polar um on and off the watch\nbut I think ultimately it's just trying\nto decipher and find what's going to be\nyou know useful for you day today and I\nthink ultimately I think Garmin\nparticularly does that a little bit\nbetter I think coros is working on that\nI think again cinto is a bit similar to\nPO in that respect as well too um I\nthink the other thing for me is that it\nis you know it's still a bit of a\nlimited kind of Smartwatch experience I\nthink you know ultimately it isn't a\nsmartwatch but I think ultim people do\nwant that and people want a better mix\nof that experience I think out of all of\nthe\nkind of mid-range kind of watches that\nyou know the polar vage M3 kind of sits\nwith I think ultimately probably it's\ngetting there you know you've got music\ncontrols you know you've got\nnotifications but I think in terms of\nyou know integrating that into the\nday-to-day experience I still think it\nneeds a little bit of work for me and I\nthink you know ultimately I think having\nthat amol display is an opportunity now\nto improve things on that front the\nbattery life with that amol display for\nme has got a little bit better uh on the\nadvantage M3 compared to other am polar\nwatches but I just think think now it's\nabout wrapping things together a little\nbit better particularly when you see\nwhat else is happening in and around po\nuh and around this price point that I\nthink it really you know it needs to\nkind of you know connect things a little\nbit better I think on and off the watch\nso you know not terrible things I think\nthings that can be worked on but those\nare the things that kind of really stood\nout for me that you know maybe I was\nslightly disappointed about um about my\ntime with the polar vage\nM3 so verdict on the Polar Vantage three\nis that this is a really good watch a\nwatch I enjoyed using a watch I would be\nhappy to use as my daily driver but I\nthink it is a watch that is just\nslightly outclassed by the competition\nin this very strong mid-range bracket we\nnow have of watches where I think\nactually most of the strongest value\nwatches on the market are now found like\nI say it's the Gin 4265 has been around\nfor a while sunto race s came out early\nthis year and then the choros pace Pro\nand the polar Vantage M3 have both come\nout quite recently you know three of\nthose watches are now offering Maps\nthey're offering AMOLED display you\ndecent battery life with AMOLED just\nnice designs all around and just\naccurate dual band GPS there's a lot of\nsimilarities between these watches so\nthe things that separate them are quite\nminor if I was to look at and rank those\nfour watches and How likely I be to buy\nthem and use them all the time I'd\nprobably have the polar at the bottom of\nthat ranking like I say it's all very\nmarginal and quite close people disagree\nbut I find it the least enjoyable watch\nto use all the time I think the designs\nare a bit Slimmer and lighter which I\nprefer although I think youve got a\nslightly more elegant look to the\nVantage M3 I think I just like the\nslightly thinner watches you get from\nthose other brands and then there's the\nstuff like training analysis and other\nthings I think are just done a little\nbit better on those other watches so\nalthough it is already close when you\nhave got these watches bunched up and\nvery clearly competing with each other\naround the price point you know it's\ntough for me to recommend the polar and\nI think the other ones just a little bit\nbetter I think quite a lot of this stuff\ncould be fixed by polo with some you\nknow well judged software updates that\ngive you stuff like more data fields on\nthe run and give you bit more\ninformation about training analysis on\nthe watch but those haven't really been\nforthcoming for a while so overall yeah\nI think it's a really good watch think\nPo's done the right move here they've\npriced it pretty much correctly it's\njust in a very competitive field it's\njust the one that doesn't stand out for\nme quite as much as the other options\nyou can get here verdict then and this\nis a huge upgrade over the polar Vantage\nM2 and one of the best polar watches\ntoday polar has delivered a good-looking\nwatch in a relatively Compact and\nstylish package that should broaden its\nappeal it's perhaps not as clean and\nstylish as the Vantage V3 it's not as\nrugged and durable as the grit X2 Pro\nbut with the same feature set as those\ntwo pricier watches I think this is\ndefinitely polar's best value watch it'\nbe the one that I would recommend most\nhighly the optical heart rate isn't\nperfect but the Dual frequency GPS\naccuracy looks to be solid and there's\nenough training tools here to cater for\nmost Runners needs Garmin offers more\nbreadth on the 4Runner 265 but you still\nget a lot of tracking Firepower for your\nmoney on Advantage M3 it comes at a\ncompetitive price for an AMOLED screen\nwith dual frequency GPS and offline maps\nand I think if you've never considered\npolar before this watch could be a good\nplace to start if you own one of the\nolder polar m models the Vantage of M3\nrepresents a significant step forward\nfor the design Hardware features and\nperformance the cheaper lighter more\ndurable polar Pacer Pro offers better\nstaying power it's got more battery life\nthey will sacrifice the AMOLED screen\nand the Dual frequency GPS for that\nbigger battery then compared to the\nrivals outside of Polo the mid-range\nAMOLED shelves are getting quite busy\nnow and if you're not bothered about\noffline maps and you really want offline\nmusic with a bit more breadth of kind of\ntracking and training features the\nGarmin 4 and a 265 is probably a more\nrounded watch it just comes with a\nshorter battery life no maps and\nobviously it's a bit pricier doto race s\nis another very capable good value\nAMOLED option with dual frequency GPS an\nexcellent screen and a longer battery\nlife that comes in slightly cheaper if\nyou want the Best of Both Worlds an\nAMOLED watch with longer battery life\nthen one to really seriously consider is\nthe corus pace Pro really fits that bill\nand also comes in at 349 the same as the\npolar Vantage M3 so my take on the Polar\nVantage M3 is that it's felt like a very\nshrewd and necessary move by polar\nparticularly when you look and see\nwhat's happening outside of polar at\nthis price point the price point of the\nAG M3 I think that's mainly leved at\nsunto because over the last 12 to 18\nmonths it's really kind of been making\nup for lost time and it's been really\naggressively pricing its watches and\nalso delivering really good performance\nfrom the sunto race and the sunto race s\nnow if we look at it from the point of\nview of it being a upgrade from the\nVantage M2 I think there is obviously a\nlot happening here it's almost a\nentirely different watch obviously\nyou're spending more money on the\nVantage M compared to the M2 I'm kind of\na little bit disappointed about the kind\nof move away from the kind ofes design\nkind of approach on Advantage M2 But\nultimately the good outweighs are bad in\nterms of the upgrades that kind of\nimprovements terms of GPS performance\nthe you know kind of offline mapping the\namalo display the battery life\nperformance as well too as a package it\nis just a better watch um you know from\na running perspective compared to the M2\nI think the other way to look at it and\nI've talked about it a little bit is you\nknow looking at that kind of mid-range\nkind of running watch Market which is\nvery competitive now you've got the sun\nraces which I've already mentioned\nyou've obviously got the corus pace Pro\nand you've got the G fro 265 which\ntypically as an anal watch is a little\nbit more expensive than these watches\nbut it has been seen to kind of drop\ncloser to the price of the Vantage M3\nand watches like the pace Pro and sunto\nr s now if I was to pick from those\nwatches I polar Vantage M3 probably\nwouldn't be my top pick I you know I\ndon't think it's far off but I think\nultimately I think particularly if you\ncan get the 265 at closer to the Vantage\nm 3 price I think it offers a better all\nround package I think the C races just\nfrom value just you know delivering a\nlot same things you're getting on the\nPolar watch as well too and maybe has a\nsimilar problem in terms of that\npresentation of the training analysis\nthe user interface but ultimately\nperformance is definitely very much\nthere and then you got the chus pace Pro\nwhich I think is you know first chus\nAMOLED we've had and it's really kind of\nimpressed me and I think ultimately that\nwould probably be a watch I would just\nkind of Veer to going for from a kind of\nGeneral day-to-day uh kind of\nperformance uh and I think maybe getting\na little bit more battery life as well I\nthink if you look at it in the polar\necosystem I think from uh kind of\nlooking at against the polar Vantage V3\neffectively it's pretty much the same\nwatch you're getting a bigger watch on\nthe Polar Advantage V3 a bigger screen\nultimately I think that would be the\nbiggest takeaway for me and I think if I\nwas picking a polar watch um or from the\nrange I would be going for the Vantage\nM3 I think from a value point of view\nunless you want those kind of very small\nextras I think that you're getting on\nthe Vantage E3 you're getting a lot of\nthat in the same package in the vant MC\nso I think absolutely this is a very\ngood watch and I think he are very much\nkind of you know drawn by the polar\necosystem love the kind of approach to\ntraining and Analysis as well and you\nknow wanting that kind of core kind of\nstrong R tracking experience then\nabsolutely Advantage M3 is going to give\nyou that if you're looking at that kind\nof mid-range kind of price bracket is it\nthe most you know impressive possibly\nnot is it a good upgrade on the Vantage\nM2 absolutely yes and is it the polar\nwatch that i' would be going for\nAbsolutely I'll be going for it over the\nVantage V3 and other polar watches in\nits collection so there you go that been\nour review of the new polar Vantage M3\nwe hope you found it insightful if you\ndid we'd love it if you'd hit that\nsubscribe button and ring the bell that\nwill make sure that you hear about\nvideos when they land in the future in\nthe meantime let us know in the comments\nwhat you think of the Polar Vantage M3\nif you're looking for a new running\nwatch I'm going to pop a couple of\nvideos up on the channel now that you\nshould go and check them out go and\nwatch them otherwise thank you very much\nfor stopping by and until next time\nhappy running people",

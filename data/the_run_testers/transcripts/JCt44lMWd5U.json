  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name\nis Nick and Welcome to our end of year\nrace test carbon shoe Extravaganza where\nwe will be talking about all the carbon\nshoes we've really raced in across the\nyear the ones that have really stood out\nfor us that we've used for our main\nraces to give an impression of what we\nthink are the best shoes on the market\nthat we've really put to the ultimate\ntest and using them for our biggest\nraces and how they performed on the day\nwe've got a lot of race test videos on\nthe channel which will have a lot more\ndetail on any individual shoes if you\nwant to go and seek those out and see\nhow they performed at stuff like the\nLondon Marathon or the vent marathan\nthings like that but in this video we're\neach going to go through some of the\nones that have stood out for us in a\nkind of Whistle Stop tour of our races\nthroughout the year and how the carbon\nshoes have performed and what has been\nanother you know very good year I think\nfor carbon plate running shoes with some\nreally exciting new launches so let's\ndive into some carbon this year I've\nraced quite a variety of races\neverything from allout PB chasing Road\n5Ks via half marathons for the London\nlandmarks half in the winter run 10K up\nto the Manchester Marathon as well there\nhave been Road Ultras I did my second\ncomrades an uun this year uh did the\ndown run last year I did the 100 mile\nBerlin Wall Ultra for the second\nconsecutive year then I also took to the\ntrails to do an ultra in the Lake\nDistrict did some mixed terrain\nmarathons like at the New Forest\nmarathon it's been a whole lot of fun\nI've logged PBS at 5K 10K marathon and\n100 mile distances the majority of those\nruns have been in carbon plate race\nshoes or plated shoes I'm going to start\nwith the road I'm not going to hold the\nshoes CU they're all in boxes and filthy\nso I will put cutaways up but anyway I\nran a new Marathon PB at the Manchester\nmarathon in the aex metas speed Sky\nParis I did a\n25440 then a week later I clocked a 5k\nPB in the aex Met speed Sky Paris as\nwell running 1759 at the dich Podium 5K\nwhich illustrates the range that this\nshoe has it's one of my favorite shoes\nof the year I put it in my top five\npicks the videos on the channel\nsomewhere for those it has all the\ningredients I want in a good carbon\nratio at pretty competitive price light\nracy Airy uppers a big stack of really\nbouncy energetic midso foam and a\nstiffness from the carbon plate that\nadds plenty of extra Pop I think it\ndelivers everything you want in a speedy\nshoe for going all in chasing the\nfastest times I like the stiffness in\nthe midso unit along with the just right\ncushioning that dampens the road impact\nwithout leaving your feet feeling\ncompletely disconnected from the road\neven towards the end of the marathon in\nManchester it looked after my feet it is\nyou know cushioned enough that it will\nprotect you and for the 5K it was every\nbit the light Punchy ra Sho that I\nwanted Nimble and agile energetic super\nlight and fast at the London landmarks\nhalf I also gave the sakon endin pro a\nrun out no PBS here for this this was a\nrace where I planned to run a section of\nit easier than up through the sort of\nGears a bit during the race and the\nEndorphin Pro delivered across those\nPaces I found it had me covered with a\ncushion when I was moving slower and it\nresponded well to the shift up in Gears\nbut I don't find it anywhere near as\nenergetic or Punchy as shoes like the\naex Met speed Sky Paris it's a bit Tamer\nthere is some Merit in that though I\nthink and in this race it proved it I\nthink it's a good accessible carbon\nracer one that you can lace up if you're\nhedging your bets a bit during a race\nand you want some backup if the wheels\ncome off it's a bit more democratic in\nthat point then onto the road Ultras and\nI set my 100 mile PB at the Berlin War\n100 mile taking 4 hours off my only\nother 100 mile finish did it in 22 hours\nand something I actually used three\nshoes for that race one not plated which\nwas the oncloud Monster hyper one pack\nplated the Hyperion Max 2 on n on plated\nwhich was the sock endorphin Speed 3 I\nknow it's technically not a carbon shoe\nI'm squeezing in here because I love it\nas a shoe and that's the shoe that I\nstarted the Berlin w 100 and it's the\nBrooks Hyperion Max 2 it's a shoe that I\nalso put as one of my top five it's a\nnon-aggressive pack plate shoe that\nworks at almost any Pace with a really\nRoad Ultra friendly wide toebox and\nroomy fit it took me to the 40 m Mark in\nthat race in Berlin wonderful Comfort I\nthink it was maybe like six hours or\nsomething seven eight hours and I would\nhave happily carried on in it but I had\nthe other shoes to test but I really\nlike the balance to this shoe it's not\nthe punchiest plated shoe but there's an\neasy control to it that worked well on\nthat Ultra it took the edge off the road\nspared my legs and feet and offered up\ncontrolled energy that I think really\nhelped me eat those first 40 miles and\nleft me in a good State for the rest of\nthe race the final 60 miles then onto\nthe trail or the road to Trail as well\nand I put the aex metap Fuji Trail to\ntwo very different tests one runnable\nmix to rain marathon where the\ncombination of the big stack and of\nlively foam and the carbon plate ran\nlike an absolute dream that's where I\nthink the meta Fuji excels on the less\ntechnical more runnable terrain I then\nchallenged it and myself to something a\nbit more tricky at the five valleys\nUltra up in the Lake District 55 km and\na more technical test with steep climbs\nsome very sort of technical descents\nthat was quite slippy and Rocky was in\nthe Lake District I found it a bit too\nLively unstable for my capabilities in\nthat race and I definitely wanted more\ncontrol on the desense I wouldn't\nnecessarily take this meta Fuji into\nthis more challenging sort of terrain\nthose kind of races again I would\nhappily lace it up for any mixed terrain\nrace where you're looking at it and\nthinking is this a race that could take\na road shoe if it's dry and it can then\nthis shoe would be good for that so it\nwas a bit of a mix bag for racing for me\nover the course of 2024 I've done quite\na few big races I did Boston Marathon I\ndid London Marathon also did Valencia\nMarathon I've done uh quite a lot of\nsmaller RAC as well so Brighton 10K um\nI've done Manchester half marathon uh\nloads of other ones as well but those\nare the big ones that I was really\nfocused on I didn't get any PBS this\nyear uh last year was a big year for me\nwhen it came to PBS and I got PBS in\nevery distance um but for this year\ndidn't really get what I wanted to do um\nbut I have been moving house and I've\nnot really trained as hard um as I did\nlast year so the races that I did um\nwhich are worth talking about so I did\nBoston Marathon I did train for that\nfairly well but I just wasn't quite\nprepared for it I did want to get a sub3\nin it but I ended up getting 3 hours 24\nand I really struggled on that race it\nwas a bit hotter than I'd expected um\nand also I just don't think I had the um\nthe stamina and the endurance um from my\ntraining to really hit it hard I think I\nwent out too hard at the start um but\nthe shoe that I wore for that was the\nNike Ally 3 um this shoe I was really\nexcited about one of my favorite shoes\nof all time is the Ally one I've got\nmost of my PBS in that shoe um and I\nstill rate it as one of the best carbon\nplight shoes out there Ally 3 I've never\nI've not really got on with it um in the\nraces that I've done I've done a couple\nof short distance races in this but\nBoston was the main one that I was using\nthis shoe for um for me it doesn't quite\nwork as well as some of the other carbon\nplate shoes that I really like uh it\nfeels a little bit more like the\nvaporfly to me then the alphafly one um\nand as a result it just doesn't seem to\ngive me a lot back uh it's very\ncomfortable shoe it feels like a very\nfast shoe shorter distances I don't mind\nit but for the marathon distance it just\ndidn't feel like it was helping me as\nmuch as I get from things like the\nalphafly 1 um or the S endorphin Pro 3\nshoes like that um it just felt like it\nwas wasn't giving me a lot of energy\nback really so I'm not a massive fan of\nthe alphafly 3 really um I think it's\nall right I know a lot of people do like\nit but for me it's too much of a\nmovement away from the the ride of the\nalphafly 1 um but uh yeah so alphafly 3\nnot my big biggest choice of the year um\nbut uh I had to enjoy for short\ndistances for the Valencia Marathon\nwhich I've just done about two weeks ago\nuh which I did train for but again I\nreally struggled with endurance I ended\nup getting a 3-hour 14 um which I wanted\nto get sub three but I wasn't expecting\nthat I thought that was that was a\npretty big hope based on the training\nthat I did I definitely kept speed over\nthe training but it was just the\ndistance that I struggled with uh I went\nfor the A6 semester speed Sky Paris for\nValencia um I really like this shoe uh\nbut not for Marathon distance that's the\nfirst time I've used it for a marathon\num when I've used it for short distances\n10K races um I really it's a really fast\nshoe\nreally allows you to pick up the pace\nquickly it's really nippy um and just\nfeels great for those faster efforts for\nthe marathon I just didn't get a lot out\nof it it the cushioning wasn't enough\nfor me um and the energy turn wasn't\nreally enough for what I want it feels\nSnappy I could definitely run fast in it\nespecially at the start of the marathon\nI I picked up the pace quite quickly um\nbut for the latter stages where my legs\nwere tired I just didn't get the um the\ncushioning and and bounce that I like\nfrom my carbon Pate shoes but I I really\nrate the A6 speed Sky Paris for short\ndistance um but not for Marathon\ndistance one standout shoe for me this\nyear is the Puma DV8 Nitro Elite 3 um I\nsaid in many videos that the previous\nversions of the DV8 Nitro Elite uh were\nfine but they didn't really match up\nwith the top tier car plate racing shoes\nthat were out um or the competitors that\nwere out at the time of their release\nthe Nitro Elite 3 is fantastic it's\ndefinitely one of the best carbon PL\nraces out I used it for Manchester half\nmarathon and I got a 125 which is pretty\ngood for me it's about 3 minutes off my\nPB um but I wasn't PB ready for that\nrace um so 125 I was really pleased with\nthis shoe just did a fantastic job it's\ngot a lovely level of UR return it's\nreally smooth run um quite similar to\nsomething like the vaporfly but um I\nfeel it's a little bit denser as well so\nyou just get a little bit more um\nresponse from from that mid cell phone\nfor me it's a really enjoyable shoe and\ndefinitely a shoe that really deserves\num being picked up as a top tier Caron\nplate racer now so really enjoyed racing\nin it for the Manchester half marathon\nand legs felt great by the end of it um\nand I probably should have worn this for\nuh Valencia and finally a shoe that I\nhave been wanting to pick up for quite\nsome time only only picked it up\nrecently and that's the CeeLo X1 the\nhoko X1 and this is I really like this\nshoe I ran a 10K in it a couple of\nmonths back which was the Brighton 10K\nand um almost got close to my PB about\n37 minutes 40 seconds which um is about\n10 seconds off my PB and I really\nenjoyed this shoe it it's got a lovely\num soft midsole in it it's very thick\nand wide it just feels to me very\nsimilar to something like the alphafly\none um and I again I probably should\nhave chose this for Valencia I decided\nto pick the\nSky Paris because it won our um carplate\nshoe of the year um but I think I think\nI would have been much better off with\nthis from my style of running just got a\nlittle bit more to this shoe definitely\na bit more bounce and it's a bit heavier\num but it's definitely a shoe that\nworked better for my style of running\nand I think it would have been more\nbeneficial in the latter stages of um\nValencia Marathon to have a little bit\nmore of the the bounce um and the Ury\nreturn from this shoe as opposed to what\nI got from the aex Met speed Sky Paris\nso I've definitely been a little bit\nmore cautious about the amount of racing\nthat I have done this year but I have\nmanaged to do eight races in total and\nacross those eight races I tested seven\nnew carbon Racing shoes now my first\nrace was back in January and that was\nthe Lee Valley Val Park 10K a looped\ncourse that you know for me if someone\nthat doesn't really like Loop courses\nfor some reason I quite like doing this\none that was my first opportunity to\nrace in this year the Haw cell X1 which\nhas definitely been one of my kind of\nstandout favorite new run shoe launches\nof this year now what I would say is you\nknow having tested what I've tested\nthroughout the year is this the shoe\nthat I would say is a great 10K shoe or\nthe shoe that I would use for a 10k race\npossibly not but I do think it really\nkind of gave me a good experience of\nwhat you know the C X1 is about it is\nbouncy Lively aggressive you know really\npropulsive you know and it does just\nfeel really enjoyable to run fast in\nthis shoe maybe a bit too much shoe for\nthat 10K distance but I do think as I\nsaid a good showcase for why I've like\nthis shoe so next up for me was The Bona\nHalf Marathon in February now that was\nmy first opportunity to race in the\nBrooks hyper and Elite V4 I wouldn't say\nhas been my standout shoe or carbon\nracing shoe that I've raced in this year\nI definitely think those qualities I\nlike about the hyperian elite V4 I\nreally like the upper on the shoe and I\nthink that's been a real standout kind\nof you know highlight for me from Brooks\nShoes particularly it faster shoes I\nthink what I've really found is that\nthey just lacked that pop for me over\nthat half marathan distance I just want\na little bit more now we have seen that\nthere is going to be a Brooks hyper and\nElite V4 PB it's going to have a peber\nbased foam and I think that's really\nwhat Brooks needs to do with this shoe\nand I think if it works with everything\nelse that it's done well with this shoe\nI think it's going to be more in keeping\nwith the other carbon Racing shoes that\nsit in around the price range of the\nHyperion Elite so in April had a couple\nof pretty big races to tick off the\nfirst was a 5K race in Paris while out\nwith aex for its Festival of running\nweekend which culminated in the Paris\nmarathon and I had an opportunity to\nrace a very cool race in the center of\nParis a closed off circuit and I had the\nopportunity to use the aex Met speed Sky\nParis and it was a nice fast course to\ndo I ran you know it's the the only time\nI've run sub20 this year and it you know\nwhat it proved to me about this shoe\nwhich I've kind of said in our review is\nthat unlike I think the previous metas\nspeed shoes which I've always found I've\nliked kind of half marathon Marathon\ndistance for me the Met speed Sky price\nis a shoe that can work across all\ndistances and for me that was it was\njust further proof that you can get that\nkind of you know lovely feel from the\nMet spe guy Paris over those shorter\ndistances and then it was over to the\nbig one for me my only Marathon that\nI've done this year and that was the\nLondon Marathon which I was meant to do\nlast year but I couldn't do because of\ninjury issues and I had the opportunity\nto race at the new B SC Elite V4 you\nknow it was very comfortable throughout\nthat Marathon distance it was very St\nable and very controlled to run that\nshoe there was just enough popping there\nto kind of roll through very nicely at\nthe pace that I was running at and it\nwas very stable I think more stable than\nsome of the other carbon Racing shoes in\nand around the SE Elite V4 so after\ntaking a well-deserved break after\nLondon I was back racing in June and\nback at the Lee Valley V Park this time\nfor a 10k race and it was my first\nopportunity to race in the Puma DV8\nNitro Elite 3 which I have used for two\nraces this year this is a shoe where it\nwas love at first s or first race you\nknow one of my favorite shoes to race in\ndefinitely up there with the best and I\nthink you know Puma has really made big\nstrides with the DV8 Nitro Elite 3 and I\nthink it's been a little bit for me you\nknow like I've had with the meta speed\nSky price where I think what Puma has\nhere is a carbon racing shoe that for me\npersonally is one that I'd be happy\ngrabbing for shorter distances as well\nas those kind of half mouth and the\nmarathon distances and that's really\nwhat that kind of race experience kind\nof showcase for me this is a shoe that\ncan work where maybe your legs working a\nlittle bit faster over that distance and\nit did feel well at home at a 10K\ndistance for me so in July it was more\n10k race action I did the sakon London\n10K alongside Tom and Nick and it was an\nopportunity to test out the S IND Dophin\nPro 4 which is one of the early kind of\ncarbon Racing shoes or big carbon racing\nshoe launches of the year now what I\nwould say is from my kind of review\ntesting the Dophin Pro 4 definitely felt\nlike a shoe that was great for cruising\nfor longer distances now what I would\nsay you know coming away from that race\nwhich I've done quite a few times and it\nis a kind of quick race to do is that it\nprobably is still for me a shoe to\ncruise in at longer distances I think\nthe power run PB power run HG\ncombination I think just lends itself to\nbe something that know definitely has a\nlittle bit of Pop about it but I do\nthink that it feels built to be more\ncontrolled and more comfortable and give\nyou that kind of faster feeling over\nlonger distances and you know really\nbalancing those things that you want\nfrom a longer distance shoe so after the\nS London 10K I took another little break\nfrom racing to do some non-running life\nthings and then I was back into racing\nin October and that was to do the\nManchester half marathon which I did\nwith Tom and I was racing in the pummer\ndevi8 Nitro Elite fee which I've spoken\nabout a little bit already and this was\na perfect kind of confirmation for me\nand on a flat kind of fast course where\nI kind of ran a sub 130 time that this\nis a shoe that I would feel confident\nrunning or racing at that distance and\nyou know given that this is a cheaper\ntop tier carbon racer shoe than most of\nthe competition I feel like you know for\na lot of people this is a good value\ncarbon racing shoe at that top end if\nyou didn't want to spend that big money\nand you know it's a shoe that you know\nI'd have no quarms using for a half\nmarathon again and so to my last race of\n20204 and a carbon racing shoe and that\nwas the run through baty Park 5K in\nDecember and that was testing or racing\nin the deodora gar carbon now it's fair\nto say I didn't think I'd be speaking so\nglowingly about a deodora carbon racing\nshoe at the end of this year but it's\nhappened and this is a shoe that kind of\njust narrowly missed out for me in my\ntop five favorite running shoes what I\nlike about this shoe it it you know\nfirst and foremost and it's not\neverything but it looks really great you\nknow hats off to deor if I'm making a\ngood looking carbon racing shoe it is\nlovely and light and what you want from\na carbon bracing shoe that feeling of of\nrunning in this in the ride is very\nsimilar to me to shoes like the Met\nspeed Sky Paris it's not quite as\npolished as the Met speed Sky Paris but\nit's definitely Hallmarks of that shoe\nhere and I do think it's one that I can\nyou know will work for kind of longer\ndistances but it absolutely has the\nscope to be a short distance racer as\nwell just like some of the other shoes\nI've mentioned so 2024 has been a\nsuccessful year of racing for me uh I've\ngot my Marathon PB this year my half\nmarathon PB and my 10K PB and my park\nrun PB if not though my actual official\n5K PB so so after last year was a fairly\nquiet year after the birth of my second\nkid went back in hard this year with two\nbig Marathon blocks the first at London\nmarathon where I did PB uh over that\ndistance and then second for Valencia\nmarathon where I didn't even make the\nstart line because I twisted my ankle in\nthe taper but I did have a very\nsuccessful block up until that point and\nactually in my build to the Valencia\nmarathon is when I sent my 10K and half\nmarathon PBS and I have used a range of\nshoes throughout the year that have all\nperformed very well for me but the\nstandout has definitely been the A6 meta\nspeed Sky Paris which was not a shoe I\nexpected to come in and immediately\nbecome my favorite racer of all time but\nit did and it's a shoe I used at London\nto run my Marathon PB I also used it for\nmy half marathon PB running Loops of\nBattery Park a month or two ago and yeah\nI can't really argue anything about this\nshoe I think it's pretty much perfect\nit's incredibly lightweight it's the\nlightest carbon racer I think I've ever\nused but still has a full stack of foam\nand it it's really responsive you get a\nlot of punch off the toes in particular\nI think more so than the metas speed\nEdge Paris which I also like but just\nfind the sky Paris that little bit\nbetter having also raced in the edge\nParis and although it's not like a\nreally big in in and bounce shoe or one\nthat you know feels really squishy Under\nFoot like some of the really big ones\nlike the alphafly or the Hocus yellow X1\nit is still you know comfortable and\ncushion enough for the marathon and\nreally responsive and fast for shorter\nevents and when I'm tiring at the end of\nthe marathon I found at London that it\njust really helped me keep my feet\nturning over because of that lightweight\nbuild and it's really easy to get the\nenergy return from the plate and the\nfoam in the mids so that's been my\nstandout shoe this year but there have\nbeen some other really spectacular shoes\nI've tested including the Nike alphafly\n3 which I thought was going to be my\nshoe I used for all my big races this\nyear having tested it right at the start\nof the year but the ax came in and\ndisplaced it but it's my favorite Alp\nFlag Ever with the continuous Mido just\ngiving a really smooth and effective\nride for me as someone who heel strikes\nand comes through and I get a really\nnice transition with the new alphafly\neven compared to past models which I did\nalso really like you've got a really\nbouncy material there I used it for a 5K\nand a 10K early on in the year when I\nwasn't all that fit but then used it for\nmy 10K PB at the inven 10K as part of\nthe Loch Ness Festival it's the riverest\n10K it's a very friendly course the\nriverest 10K with a net down Hill but\neven so I was really impressed by the\noutlow on the day I think it is an all\ngreat all distance racing shoe obviously\na very effective Marathon shoe as the\npros have shown and one that I would\nlike to get out and do a marathon at\nsome point but the Mets spe just still\nedges it out for me because it's a\nlittle bit lighter and seems to suit me\na bit better as a high Cadence Runner I\nmaybe I don't get as much Bounce from\nthe Ally as some Runners but I still do\nreally like it and a shoe I would highly\nrecommend for sure as is the on cloud\nboom strike LS which was a bit more of a\nsurprise for me like it came in and on\nhas just really stepped up its game\nthroughout the entire of the shoe\nobviously the upper is very impressive\nand exciting there's one piece upper\nthat makes the shoe really lightweight\nbut it's the midsole that really\nperforms well for me I've not tried the\nstandard Cloud boom strike but I'm sure\nthat's probably got a similar feeling\nagain it's really responsive but\ncushioned enough to go long distances I\nran a half marathon in the on cloud boom\nstri L which would have been my first\nsub 70 half marathon in my PB but\nfortunately it ended up 160 m short\nbecause they sent us the wrong way at\nthe very last turn so I ended up with a\n68 minute nearly half marathon and then\nset my actual PB in the aex going sub 70\nfor the first time a little bit later\nbut it was really impressive in that in\nthat run I do think it has a similar\nVibe and feel to the aex metas speed Sky\nParis really lightweight responsive\nslightly firmer than shoes like the Ally\nand yellow but still comfortable and\nloads of punch and loads of response\nit's expensive though and I think it's\nsimilar but not quite as good as the\nmetas speed Sky Paris for me so it's one\nthat I have just slightly behind the aex\nbut another really good shoe for sure if\nyou love the whole look of the upper in\nparticular which has fitted well for me\nand hasn't stretched at all over about\n130 150k of running so do think that's\nan innov that's working for on there's\ntwo other new shoes this year I think\nare really worth shouting at and one is\nthe Hocus yellow x one now this is not\nreally a top tier racing shoe I'd say\nbecause I have raced in it did a half\nmarathon in it and it was good and I've\ndone shorter races as well the laces\nhave come undone in a race which is not\nideal but I think the newer models of\nthe C X1 have got different laces to the\nones we tested it's so bouncy it's so\nenergetic it's really fun to run I've\ndone so much training in that shoe lots\nof my hard sessions in marathon training\nwere done in SE X1 but the weight holds\nit back a little bit I think compared to\nthe shoes I've mentioned already like\nit's not one that I out as my favorite\nMarathon shoe or a shoe I'd really want\nto do my big a marathon in because of\nthat weight really excited for the\nsecond version which is Trimm the weight\na little bit so if can keep the same\nbouncy fun ride I think the C X1 2.0\nwhich is a bad name but should be a\nreally really good shoe and looking\nforward to trying that out next year and\nthen it's the Puma dev8 Nitro Elite 3\nwhich I think is really right up there\nas a car plate racing shoe at a great\nprice in the UK and I have raced 10K in\nit as well as actually a 5k park run\ntoday but the reason I haven't used it\nmore is primarily just the fit the one\nI've got just fit slightly long I think\nand as someone who's kind of in between\nsizes I've got a bit too much room in\nthe toes and I don't really enjoy using\na racing shoe that feels just a bit too\nbig on me so I do think that's a really\nimpressive shoe where you still got the\namazing things that P are already known\nfor including the grip the reason I used\nit today was because it was it's a wet\nday here in London I was on kind of\ngreasy Park paths and you know that\ngrips reliable I also raced a mix\nterrain 10K in it when I raced during\ntesting so that's a real big plus point\nbut now you've also got a really\nresponsive foone a high stack of it\nenough Comfort there to race you know\nover Marathon distance and everything\nlike that which I don't think you\nnecessarily had on the previous models\nand it's a really lightweight shoe as\nwell it's coming in around 200 g in my\nsize so yeah that's a really impressive\nshoe I see those five shoes are the ones\nI think that stood out the most out of\nnew shoes this year couple of other\nthings I have raced in this year include\nthe Hoka rocket X2 which I ran my second\nfastest 10k and the Paris 10K and\nprobably my fastest official 10K because\nyou know that's not a course of a\ndownhill rating it's a very twisty\ncourse in the center of Paris and yeah I\nwas really impressed by that it's\nanother shoe that again a bit like the\non actually that's a really good shoe I\nthink it's going to deliver the\nperformance you need to set all your\nfastest times if you have it love it use\nit go for it I think it's just as good\nas pretty much everything out there but\nfor me it's quite similar but not quite\nas good as the SX metas speed Sky Paris\nfor me so that's one i' lean to out of\nthose two and then as a little throwback\nI did use the Nike VAP 4% flying it this\nyear as well which was really fun I did\na 10K mostly Road Race there was some\nslightly dodgy bits on off-road trails\nwhich the VAP play 4% does not love\nbecause that outside was not at all\ndurable lots of exposed Fame on that\nshoe but I want to see how it stands up\nagainst modern Racers and it certainly\ndoes stand up like the 4% I really love\ndoing that 10K in it I ran pretty much\nas fast a time as I could have expected\nto on that course given any of the newer\nraces as well it's got slightly\ndifferent feeling to some of the modern\nshoes with the lower stack under the\nfour in particular because of the high\ndrop and I think even though I loved\nrunning marathons in it at the time I'd\nnow certainly prefer to be in the\nslightly more High cushioned carbon\nRacing shoes you have now for things\nlike marathons but yeah definitely still\nstands up and kind of for me drove home\nthe point that the leap from racing\nFlats to the vapor flight 4% was massive\nand the leap from the VAP 4% to the\nSuper Shoes we have today is relatively\nsmall I'd say I think there are\nimprovements across the board certainly\nbut yeah that was such a leap forward\nand such an amazing shoe it was really\nfun to put it on actually and race again\nin it this year",

  "text": "hey time for run testers in this video\nI'm finally going to be doing my review\nof the New Balance hero V8 Trail shoe uh\nand I'm also going to be covering the uh\nnew balero V8 GTX as well but I'm going\nto put that down now cuz I just got back\nfrom a trail run and it's really muddy\nright let's dive in and see what I\nthought to these\n[Music]\nshoes the New Balance hero V8 costs \u00a3140\nor\n$149.99 it weighs 283 G or 10 oz for men\nin a size 8 and the drop is 6 mm the new\nBalan hero V8 GTX cost 160 or\n$169.99 it weighs 303 G or 10.7 o for\nmen in the size 8 and the drop is 6\nmm the hero V8 is a trail shoe designed\nto be both comfortable and accessible\nlike new balance's 1080 road range the\nhero is a shoe built for ticking off\nmiles with a good balance of comfort\nstability and ing the foam used in the\nmidsole is a modified version of The\nFresh Foam X found across many of the\nBrand's Trail and Road shoes in this\niteration of the shoe it's slightly\nsofter than the previous version to\nimprove the ride the outs soole features\na healthy layer of vibr and rubber to\nprotect the midsole and improve grip on\nvaried conditions with 4 mm lugs to\ntackle lighter Trails the upper is a\nbreathable lightweight close-knit\nengineered mesh that aims to protect the\nfeet from off-road obstructions without\nbeing unnecessarily bulky the GTX\nversion of the shoe adds a new upper\ndesigned to to protect the feet from\nwind rain and water while maintaining a\ngood level of\n[Music]\nbreathability so the fit for me in these\ntwo shoes the Helo is a shoe that is\ndesigned for very general trail running\nit's not performance shoe it's not a\nshoe that has any particular features\nthat are designed for running faster\nrunning on technical terrain it's very\nmuch a comfortable um Trail shoe and the\nfit um mirrors that completely I'm a\nsize8 in the UK uh both of the shoes fit\nme perfectly um there's plenty of space\nin the forefoot there's plenty of room\nbefore the toe uh there's the upper is\nvery very comfortable in the um in the\nin the Standard Version and in the GTX\nversion although uh the upper in the GTX\nversion is a little bit uh less\nbreathable um but does fit me exactly\nthe same no issues with fit on either of\nthese shoes there's plenty of padding on\nthem as well all in all definitely stay\nto my size in in both versions of the\nhero V8 think it's fantastically\ncomfortable shoe sort of shoe that uh\nMir crosses over that world of um\nrunning shoes and day-to-day shoes so\nfor these you you these might be used by\nyou as purely a walking shoe if you're\ngoing out walking over the fields and uh\nacross public foot paths and stuff like\nthat so it's very comfortable all around\nI'd St to my sight and both\nshoes Okay so the Hera range is a range\nreally designed it's an entry level uh\nrange where it's really a shoe that's\ndesigned for all out comfort on the\ntrails it's not particularly well\ndesigned for anything technical or\nanything like that it's really designed\nfor ticking off the miles on pretty\nlight Trails um if you just want comfort\nand it's pretty good for road as well\nthere a very good road to Trail shoe if\nyou're just ticking off the miles and\nyou want something that can keep you\nrelatively um safe out on the trails and\ngive you a little bit of extra stability\nand an extra a good level of outso grip\nas well so um I've used the hero V8 on a\nfew different runs now most of the runs\nI've done have been fairly comfortable\nruns but I have been over some different\nTerrain in this shoe I definitely\nwouldn't go out and use this shoe to run\nfast in but having said that I think\nthis new version is an improvement on\nprevious versions of the hero um what\nI've said about previous versions is\nthey can be quite clunky uh and if\nyou're going out and you're running long\ndistance you can really feel that you've\ngot a lot of shoe on your feet but uh\nthis is an improvement so the hero V8\njust feels a little bit lighter on the\nfeet just feels a little bit like\nthere's a bit more softness in the midf\nit's a bit more comfortable and\ndefinitely a shoe that is veering more\ntowards um trail shoes that you would\nuse for slightly more intense training\nthan the earlier versions the earlier\nversions for me very much were almost a\nwalking shoe that you could use for a\nbit of trail running but that's as far\nas i' I'd use them for that I there were\nso many other trail shoes that I\npreferred to using the hero uh line but\nthis one I actually quite enjoy um it's\ndefinitely not a shoe that I would use\nfor anything anything uh taxing uh I\nhave been on the Downs in this shoe and\nit didn't feel particularly good it was\nokay it was comfortable but the outsole\nisn't particularly great for dealing\nwith Muddy terrain um the uh it doesn't\nit still feels relatively clunky on the\nfeet uh if you're trying to run fast or\nif you're trying to run uphill and\nthings like that at PACE I mean if\nyou're going really slow it's absolutely\nfine but it's just not a very versatile\nshoe if you're going out and you're\ntrying different speeds and things like\nthat but it is a really solid\ncomfortable shoe for me The Sweet Spot\nfor this shoe is those Trail runs where\nyou're going across public foot paths\nmaybe you're going through Forest paths\nthings like that where you've got a good\nlevel of um a fairly hard compact ground\nand you want something that's almost\nlike a rachu that is going to give you a\nbit more traction on the ground a bit\nmore protection um from things like this\ntoe protect at the front it's really\njust a a a road shoe that's been upped\nto be able to deal with the trails in a\nlot of ways and I think that's that's\nexactly what it's it's positioned as and\nI think that works very very well for\nmost people who are probably doing quite\neasy Trails or Trails where you're not\nreally concerned too much about falling\nover or things pointing into your feet\nvery good shoe for that very very\ncomfortable uh and you can also use it\nfor road as well I know people that have\nversions of the hero and they run part\nruns in it they they they run on Road in\nit um sometimes the GTX version of the\nshoe is almost identical to the standard\nversion of the shoe uh it's a bit\nheavier um because it's got an upper on\nit a GTX upper which is a bit thicker uh\nand it's designed for dealing with wet\nconditions I'm always a bit skeptical\nwith GTX versions of shoes um because\neven though they make the shoe\nwaterproof it if you're running around\nin shorts uh and it's raining you're\nstill going to get water into those into\nthose shoes and it's also harder to get\nout sometimes because uh they're less\nbreathable um than the normal version of\nthe shoe so I've been out and um on the\nbest way to use the GTX version is if\nyou're going out and running on maybe\nfields or if you're running on paths\nwhere there's a bit of mud and a bit of\na bit of wet on there but you're not\nreally going over it I did go out for a\ntrun and I went straight into a puddle\nso it completely negates the point the\nthe the value of having a waterproof\nshoe on if you're actually submerging\nthe shoe in water but if you're running\nalong fields or puddles or things like\nthat and the water's not going above the\nankle Line That's The Sweet Spot for\nthose sorts of GTX shoes probably also\ngood for Walkers as well who are walking\naround fields in The Dewy mornings and\nthings uh just to stop your socks\ngetting wet and your feet getting cold\num so the difference in those two shoes\nis minimal um in terms of the ride you\nyou can tell that the GTX version is a\nlittle bit heavier than um The Standard\nVersion it's pretty pretty pretty normal\nuh when you have that sort of extra\nweight on from from the upper but the\nride is very similar the out Soo is very\nsimilar uh and for me if you're the sort\nof person that's probably going out and\nwalking on wet paths and things like\nthat it's it might be a good option um\nfor me I would always go for the um\nstandard version of the shoe because the\nonly time I'm really worried about my\nfeet getting wet uh is in the rain um\nand this that's not going to stop it\nunless you've got Gators on so overall\nuh the I really like the hero I think\nit's a big Improvement on the earli\nversion of the the shoe which I've never\nbeen a massive fan of um and I think\nit's a really good option if you're\nlooking for Comfort if you're looking\nfor something that delivers very similar\nto a road shoe um and maybe something\nlike the ten v14 um it's it's a similar\nride to that sort of shoe uh and it's\nalso um just feels very good and stable\nout on those lighter lighter foot paths\num so yeah uh solid um run test in this\nshoe so my verdict on the hero V8 and\nthe hero V8 GTX I think it's a solid\nshoe that a lot of people are going to\nlike um I think it's a shoe designed for\ncomfort and ease of use over lighter\nTrails if you're looking for a shoe that\nyou might want to do some technical\nrunning in whether that is up a mountain\nor rocky areas or uh really boggy wet\nareas I wouldn't get these shoes they're\nnot designed for that the the out soole\nis not really that hard or deep logs and\nit's not really designed for you know\nrunning up a a boggy Hillside in the\nLake District because it's going to get\na bit slippy if you're on foot paths if\nyou're going across Fields um if you're\ngoing through um Forest paths things\nlike that where it's pretty comfortable\nto run on and you're not you've not got\nloads of um obstacles in the way great\nshoe for that definitely a shoe that I\nthink a lot of people probably wear\nbecause it is comfortable walking shoe\num if I was going out and taking the dog\nfor a walk this is a great shoe for it\num but I'm not reviewing walking shoes\nhere I'm reviewing running shoes so as a\nrunning shoe I think it's a solid uh\nlighter Trail shoe definitely not\ndesigned for any speed definitely not\ndesigned for anything technical very\ncomfortable um and if you're the sort of\nTrail Runner that just wants something\nthat goes from a road shoe to a trail\nshoe over those lighter Trails I think\nit's a really good option now and I\ndidn't say that about the previous\nversions so definitely uh definitely a\nbig improvement with this new tweak to\nthe midell phone and solid um a solid\nGeneral use Trail shoe uh unless which I\nwouldn't get if you were doing anything\nreally really technical alternatives for\nthis would be things like the sakon\nparagr range S paragen range is quite\nsimilar in the way that it's uh quite\nit's quite accessible for a lot of\npeople um but it is better when it comes\nto more technical terrain um it feels a\nlittle bit lighter on the feet uh it's\ngot a bit better grip on it it's not the\nlugs aren't massive in comparison to\nthis but it's just got a little bit more\nto it when it comes to um running faster\nor running on technical terrain if you\nwanted to get a nice entry level shoe\nmaybe get that or maybe the Hawker speed\ngo range I haven't tried the latest\nversion but I know the other guys really\nlike that that shoe um they're both good\noptions which aren't miles off of this\nshoe they're still very comfortable um\nrow to trail shoes if you needed to use\nthem for that but they just got a little\nbit more to them when you're running out\non more technical terrain that's it for\nme on this review of the New Balance\nhero V8 and V8 GTX thanks a lot for\nwatching don't forget to like subscribe\nclick little bell and if you go to catch\nbelow you

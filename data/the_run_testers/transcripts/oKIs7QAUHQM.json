  "text": "hey Tomy from the Run testers in this\nvideo we are going to be talking about\nrunning shoes coming out in\n2025 so we're going to be talking\nthrough shoes that we think might be\ncoming out or hope are going to be\ncoming out over the next 12 months and\ntalking about the ones that we're most\nexcited about the shoes that we're\ntalking about in this video we don't\nreally have any insight into the release\ndate of them or if indeed they are going\nto get released this is purely\nspeculative uh excitement around shoes\nthat we hope will appear over the next\n12 months this is also uh the podcast so\nif you're planning on listening to the\npodcast then don't watch this video\nright let's dive in and uh see what\nwe're looking forward to in\n[Music]\n2025 so we're coming to the end of 2024\ngreat year for shoes some fantastic\nreleases and and as keeps telling us um\nbut 2025 is going to be here very soon\nand there is a lot of shoes that we've\nheard about possibly getting released a\nfew websites have talked about um\nrelease schedules for shoes um and shoes\nthat maybe we don't know about yet but\nwe would probably guess that there would\nbe a new version of them coming out so\nuh guys what are we excited about in\n2025 in the running shoe World um let's\nlet's start off with I'll break this\ndown to categories so that we're not\njust flow throwing shoes left right and\nCenter let's start with brace shoes uh\nNick what race shoes are you excited\nabout in 2025 there a few I think uh\nI'll probably go with the ones that have\nbeen confirmed so I think a lot of shoes\nget confirmed at the running event in\nTexas which we've uh We've not been able\nto go to yet our emails are open for\ninvites for sure but um so a few that I\nthink the one that really stands out to\nme is I'm super excited about is the uh\nit's the worst named shoe of all time\nit's the hoker cell X\n2.0 which is you got to ask questions\nhave you about that nav protocol but\nhocus yellow X1 was one of my favorite\nshoes of last year I think we all anyone\nwho whove run it have loved it\nincredibly bouncy really fun a tad heavy\nand now they've brought the weight right\ndown the second version by all accounts\nthey've changed the cutout to move it to\nthe other side of the shoe to hopefully\nincrease stability I was talking to H\nabout this a little bit as well think\nthey've changed the plate shape a little\nbit so if it can retain the incredibly F\nbouncy fun feeling of the first one or\nmaking it lighter I think that's going\nto be a really really Top Choice for\nMarathon racing in particular but races\nin general and I think that's definitely\nthe race I'm most excited about um\nintrigued to see if we get a new\nvaporfly vaporfly 4 and what exactly\nthey do with it Nike because the three\nwasn't universally well received you\nguys didn't like it that much I think um\nI liked it but the alphafly seems in\nlike before there was lots of lots of\ndifferent choices I think between people\nbetween vly and Ally I think the Ally 3\nis pretty much the choice for most of\nNike Elites now so inter see if fer fly\n4 changes that a bit but I've got a\ncouple of others but I'll let you guys\npick them because those are the two that\ntop of my mind then Ken what have you\ngot for rues yeah I mean I guess there's\none that we've been waiting for for a\nwhile or it feels like it since the\nfirst gen came out and it was a bit of a\nshoe that divided opinion but the so\nendorphin Elite 2 looks really\ninteresting um not everyone liked it I\nused it for quite a lot of sort of big\nraces I did the comrades in it I did um\na long kind of ultra the tunnel in it\nbut I guess the big news is phone that I\nfirst heard about uh a couple days ago\nwhich the incred Run phone run which is\nwhich is I don't know the name yeah it\njust sounds like a yeah sounds sort of\ngimmicky but um apparently incredibly\nsoft and Incredibly bouncy and from what\nI've seen on the videos the most amazing\nthing about this is just how far the\nfoam squeezes down if you do that kind\nof finger squeeze thing that people do\nwith their shoes it kind of goes right\ndown and then returns um it's going to\nbe still got a full length kind of\nslotted carbon plate um\nthey've now changed one thing which I\nthink did divide opinion which was the\nuppers were quite fiddly and fussy on\nthe old\nendorphin um Elites they've made them a\nlittle bit more simplified and they've\ngot an integrated tongue now so you're\ngoing to get like a guess a bit more of\na sort of booty fit which I think should\nmake him feel a bit more comfortable\noverall but it sounds to me like they're\ngoing to be softer and much more bouncy\nhave have you have you seen them in\nperson uh I've just seen them on in\nvideos yeah I've held them I've squished\nthem and they and I mean it's unreal\nremember when when I remember when I\ntalked about the uh the ballos when we\nfirst heard about it and I I got a\nfeeling that it was going to be the\nperfect shoe for me I've got I think the\nEndorphin Elite 2 is going to be my my\nrace of choice I I really i' love hate\nrelationship with the Endorphin Elite\none I got like a few PBS in that shoe\nWay Beyond what I expected to get in the\nraces I think it's fast shoe but I don't\nfind it very comfortable I think I think\nthis may be my shoe of the year if it's\nuh if if it's I think it's might stray\ntoo soft like just Jing it looks so soft\nand I've SE I know some people who have\ntried an early version they're a little\nbit scared of it because it's so soft\nand I guess that makes it a little bit\nwobbly but if it returns in the right\ndirection then it's going to be a lot of\nfun I mean Tom's going to lose his mind\nif it's a soft well I need I need a new\nsoft bouncy Rao why you're not doing\nmarathons anymore mate don't worry about\nit well I can I can still use it for\nhalf marathons if I want you know I'm\ngoing to end up signing up to a marathon\nin August as soon as you feel our soft\nthis shoe you're going to sign up to\nlike an ultra doesn't matter yeah cool\nwell that yeah that is a that is one\nthat um I am very excited to test out\nfor me um one sh that I'm I want say I'm\nexcited about it I I would be if it it\ncomes out like I I wanted to but the\nsney dorphin pro five um because you\nknow that Pro three is my favorite\nrunning shoes of all time didn't really\nlike the four very much so I'm really\ninterest to see what what they do with\nwith the five um and if if they if they\nyou know shift it a little bit more\ntowards what people expected from the\nearlier version yeah I think the other\none we should call out is Brooks finally\nmoving to peber Foams next year with a a\npeber version of the current shoe um\nwhich I think comes out quite early in\nthe year and then they're the all new\nHyper Elite 5 will have you know a\nredesign with so I mean they are I think\nnow the last brand to move across to P\nFoams races or at least you know an\nequivalent very soft springy foam so\nmaybe because I think this when is\nusually F this year every brand pretty\nmuch has caught up and is in a similar\nlevel now in terms of quality except\nmaybe Under Armour and Brooks so maybe\nBrooks will be joining the pack uh with\na with a redesign\n[Music]\nshoe um all right let's have a look at\nuh trainers and super trainers uh so\nthat's you know sitting under the race\nthe race day shoes what are we excited\nabout so I've I've got one I love the\nmax the Brooks Hyperion Max 2 I found it\nlike a really nice uh sort of versatile\nshoe to run and again I did a lot of\ndifferent sort of runs and races in it\nI'm quite excited to look at the the\nhyper Max 3 and again you know they've\nbasically added a bit of a bigger stack\nheight it might change I'm a little bit\nworried because I quite like the fact\nthat it wasn't overkill on the last shoe\nand you now got DNA gold PE based mol\nfoam as a top layer you're going to have\nuh DNA flash which is in V2 and the old\nSho in the bottom layer um keeping uh\nPack's plate but they've kind of changed\nthe geometry as well um and it's mainly\nthey've got a massive you know they've\nactually added quite a lot of extra\nstack to it so it may well change that\nwhich I'm a little bit worried about but\nit might make it a bit more of a lively\nshoe for a daily train and put it into\nthat kind of super super trainer\nterritory where the other one was you\nknow maybe a little bit dull for some\npeople's liking compared to shoes like\nthe super blast or whatever so I think\nthat one could be interesting I think\nBrooks could have a really interesting\nyear this year yeah definitely yeah Big\nYear for Brooks cuz they're bringing the\nDNA tuned foam from the glycerin Max\ninto a few other shoes as well right so\nbe interesting to see new Foams across\nthe board I think I'm very excited about\nthe hok ma X3 which basically looks like\nthe same shoe but with a less fiddly\nheel design which I think will make it\nthat was my shoe of the Year pretty much\nthis year I didn't mind the heel but you\nknow a slightly more comfy heel for a\nfor what is a training shoe really will\nbe will be great looking forward to that\nin the super trainer realm for sure\nanything else well we talking just fast\ntrainers or super is that the plan here\nor uh I think we lump them together fast\ntrainers super trainers diags are we no\nno this is a relaxed chat this is a\nrelaxed\nchat um what's the soin trainer yeah\nthat looks it it's weird that doesn't it\nbecause it that looks like a almost a\nredesign Kara Pro kind of I don't know I\ndon't it feels like a shoe that didn't\nIan they already have the Endorphin\nspeed not replace the kvara pro right is\nit okay I think so there's a Kar Pro too\nI thought coming out oh too many cavar\nPR yeah yeah need\none but it's got like a half carbon it's\ngot like a a half carbon plate as well I\nthink in the four foot so it's got a\nslightly different that's what the conar\npro did as well wasn't it\nyeah I don't know where that sort of\nslots in but hoker redesigned some um\nmade big changes to stuff like the\nClifton as well looks like high fairly\nHigh drop which would be because hok is\nbasically across the board 5 millimeters\nmore or less except yellow I think but\nClifton's going up a little bit and St\nright yeah more St I think that's good\nthe way because there is a sky flow in\nthe mac and they're a bit more different\nnow I think because the sky flow felt\njust like a like a better Clifton very\nsimilar but with a nicer foam so and the\nBondi is getting a super critical foam\nso it' be interesting to see how that\nfeels because that was not a shoe we\nwere huge fans of in the past well let\nme throw another one at you Nick the\nMuno Neo Vista 2 excited about that one\nI am excited about but they've also\nreleased another one that just very\nrecently right that's the race the race\nshoe no no not the race shoe there's\nanother Neo Vista style shoe that's\na little bit less aggressive and it\nfeels like they're now packing that area\na bit too tightly with shoes but I mean\nneov Vista was more or less like a\nperfect reintroduction of Muno to that\narea I think so I don't know I I don't\nknow what they'll do with that I mean\nthe new Rue I'm annoyed by a little bit\nbecause it's like 60 millimeter stack\nheite just slightly away from where they\nmeasure it and that's that is out of\nhand isn't it that's one thing when you\nlook across all these shoes and even on\nfrom road to Trail as well it does feel\nlike we're\nnow in the world where 40 is small or\nwe're getting it feels like everything's\npushing now all the across all of the\nshoes the stack kits have gone higher\nand higher eventually the racing the\ntraining shoes will be better than the\nlegal Racing shoes and that's and where\nwill we be\nthen um I I don't know I it's a serious\npoint if you even from the test that\nwe've been doing recently where I've\ngone from like an over blast 5 and back\ninto something like a supernova rise 2\nwhich just got some you just really feel\nit and I do worry like there's a bit of\nbit of that where none of those shoes\nwill none of the more traditional shoes\nmight might exist it feels like they're\nall being kind of even the rise 2 is\nnearly 40 isn't it yeah yeah but it\nfeels it feels more that now feels more\ntraditional compared to a lot of the\nothers you know or some of them even\nwhen they're really big don't feel CR\nlike no me doesn't feel like a 42\nmillimet Sho it feels quite regularly\nfeels relatively normal compared to some\nof them but then the Pegasus premium\nfeels so high at 4 you know two more\nmillimeters so it's I I think getting\nused to being on the higher Stacks as\nwell though now I've noticed like I'm I\nback in the day that would have been you\nit would have felt like a big shoe to me\nwhen I flick back to something isn't\nquite does I do notice\nbut all right well let's oh other ones\nthat in this category that might appear\nyou'd assume that there would be another\nversion uh aex Magic speed five well we\ndidn't test the four did we no we get to\ntest I there's been lurky rumors online\num you know around around the forums I\nlove a good forum about aex going for a\npro Evo style\nshoe asn't like they as in a very very\nlightweight mostly focused on Elite\nstyle shoe which is a development I am\nvery against and I'll be really unhappy\nif brand start doing that more often\nwhere there's shoes that basically\npeople can't really access um and\nthey're too expensive or they're not\nreally out there so if it's on General\nsale and it's not a silly price fine you\nknow make a crazy light shoe that\ndoesn't last very long like people don't\nhave to buy that think I wouldn't buy\nthat but you know some people want to\nbut if it's a case of you can't run the\nshoes the elites run in which probably\nbe pretty much the first time in running\nhistory that's been the case that would\nbe that'll be a shame won't it amazing\nmarketing from Adidas though in this in\nthe last few releases of shoes based on\nthe existence of the the pro Evo I get\nbecause people people obviously love the\n[\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] pro for and it probably is the\nmore suitable shoot for most people but\nas a keen amateur I would never go and\nget that shoe because well that's not\ntheir best shoe so I'll go to a brand\nthat is selling their best shoe like the\nalpha fly or the you know normal speed\nbecause I don't want to I don't want to\nfeel second\nbest yeah uh i' got for you Tom got\nwhich is one that we haven't actually\nthis another brand that I think is going\nto be interesting to watch I know Nick\nyou tested some I haven't tested their\nrecent shoes but on got the cloud boom\nMax yeah that looks fun they're bringing\ntheir people phone a bit more stuff\nright yeah and that's that's but that's\nan interesting one because it's it's a\nshoe\nthat's it's not carbon plated it's got\nthey've gone back to having um what do\nthey call it their speedboard they've\ngot a slightly more flexible speedboard\nbut it's going to be a big stack of um p\nphone and they're basically aiming this\nat people who run marathons in four five\nhours but they want they say that it's\ngoing to have like a super shoe feel for\nfour the four and five hour marathon\nrunners so that's I never like when\npeople say that that's never come across\nwell when shoes I've tested I yeah I\ndon't need it yeah it's like I think\npeople people run to marathons in most\ntimes are using Super Shoes and I think\nthey're doing perfectly\nfine they're asking for a lot of money\nfor a stub sander shoe\nsometimes I think it's an interesting\none because they sort of say this is\ngoing to be like the Super Shoe dream\nfor those people and they've got it from\ngoing and watching lots of people run\nthose times at marathons and observe\nthem and see that they're maybe not\nmoving as as well as they might do in a\nshoe still they still differ massively\nin how they move right all those people\ndon't have the same running style this\nexactly what Solomon said with a spectre\nwhich was just basically a super trainer\nwith the price of a super shoe and but\nmaybe they'll pull it off I mean I'm\nreally excited about the on cloud boom\nZone as well I think that's going to be\nwe haven't tested that yet that's kind\nof been out but I think that'll be a\npretty fun shoe If This Cloud boom Max\nis the cloud Monster hyper what I wanted\nfrom that like a full P kind of Mido\nthat' be great uh all right well now you\ncompletely messed up the uh the system\nthen we might as well mention the Haw\nRocket 3 if that's if that's going to\nappear next year this is just a vague\nlike speculation from a website right\nTom cuz there's no sign of this year or\nanything no I mean a lot of these ones\nwe haven't like got confirmation and\nokay to Cave at that now and at the end\nof the at the end of the video and the\npodcast that these are we're not\nconfirming that these are going to be\nreleased we're we're talking about\nrumors some some of them you may have\nseen some of them like the Texas ring\nshow but yes a lot of these are\nspeculation and uh we're not confirming\nrelase States or anything yeah we we\nhaven't got any Scoops here to give you\nI'm afraid yeah yeah yeah um so HCK\nrocket three if that if that does appear\nI hav I never tested that the two so I'm\nassuming that's quite an exciting shoe\nwell it wasn't at the Texas show was it\nand they did have most of the hookah\nshoes into next year so I guess it maybe\nmaybe won't but and then Adidas Tumi s\n11 that might be yeah that would be ad\nthat's often go on a twoyear cycle I\nmean there should be a new Boston right\nthat would be great yeah yeah\num I don't know I don't I haven't seen\nanything on this what I'd love next year\nis a real super blast competitor I was\njust going to say super blast stuff yeah\nI don't think there'll be a super blast\nnecessarily itself cuz they often I\ndon't know they release it right at the\nend of the year if they do it don't they\nT to but lots of brands have come out\nwith mega stack like with great Foams\nand they've all ended up being more like\nkind of like the Hocus Skyward X than\nthe super blast you know heavy cruisy\nbig fun you know daily trainers no one\nsee I mean the super blast is lighter\nthan most of the plated super trainers\nwe like test it's it's pretty incredible\ncombo so interest to see if anyone can\nreally have a go at that mhm\n[Music]\nall right well let's move on from the\nfaster shoes and let's start talking a\nbit more about the uh the world of\ncushion and daily shoes there's one\nthat's probably going to be quite\nexciting for you that might be appearing\nnext year Nick you guess what that is uh\npelocity nitro 4 yeah well I don't know\nbecause that was a was that last time\nthey only released that right at the\nstart of this year didn't they the\nvelocity Nitro 3 yeah I mean I mean yeah\ncould we good I'm not sure i' I've not\nSE anything on it yet so I I don't know\nI don't know as long as I don't mess\nwith it too much well it's yeah it's\nbeen so far it's been a pretty\nconsistent line hasn't it um some\nchanges to to that version is being\nreleased but like K said that's still 36\nodd millimeters so that will now feel\nlike a low shoe yeah yeah yeah okay any\nother cush or daily Cushing shoes uh\nwe're excited about to see if they\nresurrect the Triumph after what we did\nnot enjoy that one this year oh yeah\nyeah yeah what about I saw I saw\nsomething I I don't have any detail to\nshare on it but I know you guys love you\nlike enjoyed the hurricane right yeah\nyeah yeah yeah that's going to be I\nthink there's an an update for that one\ncoming as well\nso yeah that's under 40 millimeters and\nthat feels like a massive shoe um yeah\nthat was a really big pleasant surprise\nthis year just a really enjoyable\nCruiser probably one of my favorite\nCruisers of the whole year Well I say\nthis about the the hurricane I I didn't\nactually know existed before we tested\nthe the this year's version um so the\nfact that it's such a long line of shoes\nis it was really surprising but you\nassume that from a shoe shoe that's got\n26 versions already there will be\nanother version uh this next\nyear yeah it'll be um I think I did see\nsomething about this but I can't\nremember what what changes they make but\nI guess it was quite a drastic change\nthis year so I don't it'll be assume\nmost yeah they won't change it too much\nthe overlast six will obviously go back\nto being quite firm so that'll be every\nyear they change that they flip-flop\nyeah it's funny one the over blast range\nisn't it it does actually change quite a\nbit whereas where doesn't have a lot of\nconsistency um good for us because we\nmakes it more fun to review something\nthat's changed a little bit but um yeah\nanything else in the cushioned world the\nda Sho World whether I mentioned already\nthe Bondi going to a full super critical\nfoam will be interesting it basically be\na Mac stack Sky flow or Mac six so to\nsee how that\nfeels Brooks G 22 i' I've seen yeah\nthat's out isn't it or some of the\npeople have got that people have got\nthat in America that's got the midsole\nfrom the glycerin Max okay I slightly\nlower Stacks that should be quite nice I\nthink I've had a little I've had a\nlittle run in that but all right I don't\nif I'm allowed to say that yeah well I\ndid a little I just like up and down\noutside in a car\npark oh little chatter bricks in you\nyeah yeah and it yeah so it's I guess\nI'm allowed to say if your car did you I\nI ran I ran the longest I've ever run in\na car par\nrun a 2 minute mile in the\nshoe but I think I think it will bring\nif you if the glycerin was a lacked a\nbit of life this one might come to life\na bit more I\nthink okay um no idea if it's getting\nreleased but the uh ride 18 if that\nappears that' be an exciting one for us\nyeah\nguess yeah I mean I like the rides but\nyeah again I'm pretty sure I've seen\nsomebody already put that out there oh\nreally I saw something on the guide for\nsure so they usually come to don't they\num we should probably probably know more\nabout that our\njob we like the surprise it all appears\nyeah it's true also we're in the UK we\nwe get stiffed a bit on some shoes\noccasionally we get stuff ahead of the\nUS which is quite nice but it's very\nmuch occasionally yes yeah yeah uh and\nthen there's probably going to be\nupdates to shoes like the Kayano range\nthere's there's always an update to that\nevery year isn't there well we've got\nthe Nimbus in so what have they done to\nNimbus slightly higher stack height\nmostly the same they'll do the same with\nthe car I guess\n[Music]\nokay um what shoes am I missing Trail\ntraila yeah let's do Trail Kieran what\nuh trail shoes what what would you be\nexcited only if you're ready Tom only if\nyou're ready I don't want I just had\nthought about Trail TR so so I'm I'm\nshocked I haven't got any I'm not got\nany prep for it so go for it there's\nonly there's one that I I'm again I've\nkind of seen it on videos from the\nrunning event and that's the um North\nFace Summit vective Pro three I wish\nthey put more names in the names to make\nbut yeah so you've got uh like a\nnitrogen infused PE of\nmidsole but there's a dual carbon plate\nsystem which is interesting so they've\ngot one carbon plate at the bottom which\nis supposed to give the kind of the the\nspeed and propulsion and they've got\nlike another sort of cage there's like a\ndrop in insert and then a cage that sits\nacross the top which then is supposed to\nprovide the stability so they're trying\nto do this kind of jaw system so you can\nhave speed and stability on the TR\num it's going be fascinating to see how\nthat how that if that actually works out\nand because it's a big it's it's it's\nagain it's like another big old sort of\nStack shoe for the trail probably along\nthe lines of the meta Fuji and those\nkind of things where we're getting\nhigher volume but how that runs will be\nyeah it would be interesting prob think\nthe second version was actually that the\nwing on the side rubbing the the wing on\nthe carbon play actually rubbed so\nhopefully that's cuz that I quite\nenjoyed the ride of it but yeah I mean\nyou don't want that in a shoe you're\nmeant to be running long distance is it\nand and then there's a ma there's hok of\nmafti 5 which I've not actually run in\nthe mafti for a long time I don't think\nbut they've done something which they've\nthey're basically going to flip the\nFoams around so normally you would have\nthe um Firma Foam on the bottom right\nand the softer foam on the top they're\ngot to flip it the other way so you've\ngot the softer Foams on the bottom and\nthe fermer foam on the top the idea is\nthat this can almost like absorb the\ntrail so it's kind of mold itself or\ndeform as you hit bits of the trail so\nyou don't feel the lumps and\nbumps that's got high drop as well is it\nor higher drop than the usual for H yeah\nI think yeah again they're yeah they're\nall adding so very interesting given\nthat so much of the industry has spent\nthe last 5 10 years moving towards the\nshoes that hoker originally brought you\nknow the kind of low Drop Rock could\nchoose and now hoker is moving towards\nthe High Drops that everyone else was\ndoing it's intriguing to see what what\nhappened the the momentum and patterns\nwe see in the running shoe world except\nNike with this resolutely 10 millimeter\ndrops with no rockers always the\nsame so I suppose I suppose there might\nbe new versions of the\ntecton uh out next year that that came\nout it's around a lot of the trail is\nreleased around UTMB don't they now yeah\nespecially the big races yeah so might\nsee a new one of those do do you want to\nkeep the gator on it I didn't mind the\ngator actually I have to say I I need it\nbecause I'm nearly always running in\nlike it's more kind of like grassy and\nstuff it's not really like rocks and\nstuff but didn't mind it just looking\nthrough possible shoes but I mean\nthere's there's nothing really on the\ntrail side I'm not really that excited\nabout anything maybe another of those\nwhat's that one I like the as6 meta\nTrail Max or whatever it's called gel\ntruko or gel truko that's it yeah\ngetting with the uh I still haven't\ntried the more Trail need to need to get\nhold of that um anything else on the\ntrail world that you're excited about Ro\nTrail world there's only one name in the\nroad Trail world right now and that's\nthe mor flight but I can't imagine a\nmore flight too what would you do with\nit what would you do with it exactly\nyeah so different colors just need new\ncolors of it that's true yeah just bring\nout more colors keep reducing that's\nalready incredibly reasonable\nprice nice all right well I think that\nprobably covers Us with most of the\nstuff that's coming up that we we hope\nis coming up or um we've heard rumors\nabout on the on on the internet um so uh\nyeah we'll hopefully get to test a lot\nthose shoes and um they will appear in\n2025\nanother fun year hopefully big year on\nthe channel lots of fun stuff to come\nwell uh in in advance uh or depends when\npeople listening to this happy New Year\noh yeah happy New Year happy New Year\ncatch you later guys catch on the 50\nflip on God\n[Music]",

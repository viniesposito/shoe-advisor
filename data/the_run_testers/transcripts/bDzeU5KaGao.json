  "text": "hey Tomy from the r testers in this\nvideo we are going to be doing our full\nreview of the aex GEL Nimbus 27 let's\ntake a\n[Music]\nlook the A6 gel nibus 27 cost 180 or\n$165 it weighs 306 G or 10.8 o for men\nin a size 8 and the drop is 8\n[Music]\nmm the ASX gel nibas 27 isn't add IC\nupdate to its predecessor but it does\ninclude a couple of big updates to\nimprove the overall comfort of the shoe\nthe most important of those is an\nincreasing the stack height of FF flas\nEco midell foam by 2 mm to add even more\ncushioning to the ride and the other is\na new engineered jacked mesh upper to\nimprove comfort and breathability in the\nrear of the shoe you'll still find the\nsame pure gel technology designed to\nimprove shock absorption and there's an\nauthorly x55 sock liner to add even more\ncushioning to The Ride Like the earlier\nversions there's still plent of padding\nacross the upper including a knit rib\ncollar as well as a gusseted tongue wi\nfit system to ensure a good fit on the\noutsole is a hybrid aex grip to provide\ngrip and protect the\nmid comes the fit of the ASX Jael ners\n27 I have my usual size here which is a\nuk9 or a US 10 and it fits me really\nwell I've got no concerns told about the\nfit I would stick to your normal running\nshoe size as I'm someone who's slightly\non the fence between a 9 and 8.5 UK it's\nquite roomy in the toebox for me but not\nin a way that i' consider too roomy for\na Big Easy Day Cruiser like this so yeah\nall around was very happy with the fit\ngood hold around the hill of midfoot\nthere was a lot of kind of cushioning at\nthe back here but it didn't irritate my\nachilles at all sometimes found actually\nwhen walking that the slightly high\ncollar here would feel a bit weird under\nmy ankle but actually on the run that\nwas never a problem so yeah all around\nnice comfortable fit as you expect I'd\nstick to your normal size with a nimbus\nsame size I've used for the past three\ngenerations of the shoe just give you a\nquick word on fit then and I think this\nis pretty much more of the same as the\naex Joe Nimbus 27 you've got really\nample room at end of the toe box nice\namount of clearance across the top of\nthe toes there's plenty of flex these\njackard uppers are a bit more structured\nthan you got with the nip from the 26\nbut this is still a really roomy happy\nshoe to run long distance in oodles with\nspace basically lots of Flex for the\ntoes comes back up I get good lock down\nacross the midfoot no problem there\nwe've got these tongues that they're\nsort of quite loose they're sort of\nknitted they just take the edge off but\nthey aren't maybe as padded as some you\ndo have to make sure you get them in the\nright place into the heel colar I think\nyou've got exactly the same heel package\nas you got in the 26 and they hold well\nthere's lots of plush padding which\ncreates Good Foot security little bit of\na heel counter here that's not too stiff\nbut very present holds you nicely I had\nno slipping no problems with lockdown\nand I would recommend going TR size in\nthese shoes so fit for me has been very\ngood overall in the gel nus 27 I've got\nmine in a UK size 8 that's my typical\nrunning shoe size that's generally the\nshoe size that works best for me in aex\nshoes that's the same shoe size that I\nhad the jamus 25 in I didn't test the\ngbus 26 now like my experience with the\njbus 25 given I've got quite skinny\nnarrow feet I would say the fit is\nnaturally very Ry and accommodating and\nyou know for me that's been absolutely\nfine given also that there is a wider\nfit option here but I think for most\npeople going for that standard fit is\ngoing to be generally fine I think you\nknow when I talk about that room I think\nthat's particularly in the middle\nsection of the shoe I think in the toe\nbox as well where I think personally I\nwould take maybe things being rained in\na little bit to give you something that\nsits a little bit closer but I think you\nknow it hasn't been an issue having that\nkind of roomy kind of spacious toe box\nfor me in my running time I think other\nthings to mention here I think in terms\nof getting a good lock down here I think\nit it does take a little bit of work\nhere I think you know given the material\nwhich is quite skinny and stretchy and\nthat kind of stretchy tongue you're\ngetting here I do find you have to pull\nthem in quite tightly those laces to get\na good kind of lock down there when you\nget further back into the shoe you've\ngot a fair amount of padding there I\nthink you know particularly in the\ninside of the heel collar the um kind of\nheel counter is you know it's a pretty\nflexible one didn't cause any kind of\nirritation for me at my achilles and\nthere definitely some elements there\ncreating that kind of supportive kind of\ncomfort um at your getting at the hill\nof the shoe so yeah overall very good\nfit for me as I said I personally would\ntake something maybe that's sat a little\nbit closer to my feet but I think in\nterms of my running time it has been\nabsolutely fine and I think unless you\nwant a really spacious roomy kind of\nwider fit option going for that standard\nfit option and going true to size should\nbe absolutely fine for most people so\nthe fit for me in the gel numberers 27 I\nhave a size 8 foot uh I also have very\naverage with feet I don't tend to have\nproblems with shoes very often um the\ngel number is 27 absolutely perfect\nthere's plenty of space in the 4 foot\nfor me um it's not the widest shoe in\nthe world but it's definitely wide\nenough on my feet and they are pretty\naverage there is a wider version of the\nshoe as well so uh you can get that but\nfor me with my average width feet and\naverage sized feet for uh a size H shoe\nuh is absolutely fine very very\ncomfortable I had no issues I really\nlike the upper design um there's a\nlittle bit of giv it so it's quite\ncomfortable around the sides of the foot\nand there's loads of padding in it as\nwell it's definitely a shoe designed for\nComfort I would definitely stay to my\nsides in the GEL Nimbus\n27 run test then and in testing I've\nlogged around 40 km in the GEL Nimbus 27\nlots of slow and easy which is largely\nthe intended purpose for this shoe but\nI've thrown in some faster miles as well\ntried building to a bit of Marathon Pace\non a progression run just to see how\nthey pick up now the big difference here\nis obviously that extra 2 Ms of softer\ntuned cushioning that aex has managed to\nadd to the stack without increasing the\noverall weight and that does change the\nride somewhat between the 26 and the 27\nbut essentially what you get is a shoe\nthat stays pretty true I think to the\nNimbus Heritage delivers a plush soft\ncushioned Comfort ride that's happiest\nwhen you're moving slower ticking out\nthose got an easy miles it's not like\nthe Nimbus 26 wasn't cushioned and plush\nan impact eating but the 27 now offers\nmore of that there's more protection\nmore softness more Long Haul comfort and\nI think there's also a smidge More\nBounce and energy coming back from the\nmidsole as well not enough to make me\nwant to run a lot of marathon pace miles\nin this shoe which is generally a bit\nheavy uh it's ultimately still a heavier\nshoe but you can do marathon pace miles\nif you really need to though it's a bit\nharder work for the legs I find now I\nalso did a side by-side Mile with the 26\non one foot and the 27 on the other and\nwait Wi on the run I think the shoes\nfeel the same there's perhaps a touch\nless stability in the numers 27 because\nyou've got the extra softness and you've\ngot a bit higher off the ground but it's\nstill a big wide stable shoe stable\nplatform to run off I really like the\nuppers I think the changes are a step on\nthere's a bit more structure to the\njackard than you've got with the knit\nit's a minor difference here overall in\nterms of how it wraps the foot and\noverall I wouldn't say one is more\ncomfortable than the other but I do like\nthe more premium feel and I think it\nlooks nicer than you've got with the old\n26 knit I still generally prefer less\nshoe on the F something lighter and more\ncompact for most of my runs but I still\nthink this generation of the nimus\ndelivers a happy cushion ride that if\nthat's your thing you'll still really\nenjoy so in terms of my running time in\nthe G num is 27 I would say overall it's\nbeen very comfortable I would say it's\nbeen a very reliable shoe to run in it's\na very stable shoe um to kind of spend\ntime in you know runs very smoothly as\nwell I do think there are some changes\nhere from the the previous gimbus which\nI tested the gimbus 25 and given that\nthe gimbus 26 was really around kind of\nchanges with the outsole the cor exp has\nbeen very similar to The Joe numers 25 I\nthink there as I said some changes here\nthat I think do make a nicer shoe to be\none that you are you know is designed to\nabsorb a lot of your running time this\nis a cushion shoe a cushion daily\nTrainer shoe that for me very much ve on\nthat kind of easy kind of recovery Pace\nbut I have found I've been able to run\nat more moderate running Paces in this\nshoe and it hasn't felt you know totally\nkind of awkward to do that but I do\nthink this is a shoe built for those\nkind of you know when your legs are tied\nand you are doing those kind of easier\nruns and maybe kind of longer runs as\nwell you're not running at your hardest\nor fastest now one of the big changes\nhere is you're getting a little bit more\nof that FF blast Eco um foam here which\nis you know used in the super Blast 2\nbut not on its own and then you know\nwe've seen with the Nova blast 5 you\nknow asex has moved away from the um Eco\nplus kind of phone and use that kind of\nnew FF blast Max phone which is\ndefinitely softer compared to this now\nhaving that extra you know you know\nstack of that foam doesn't make it a\ninherently kind of plusher shoe than the\nprevious shoes I think you know gives\nyou I would say a lot more protection\nand you know that would be the main\nquality I would say I think the biggest\nchange for me has been really about\nwhere that foam you know is setting and\nI feel like the geometry of the shoe the\nslight changes for me have made it a\nnice issue to run in I think as I said\nfor those Paces those easy recovery\nPaces I just found the num 25 the ride\nfelt a little bit dull for me I don't\nthink it rolled through as nicely and I\nfeel like that has changed for me with\neel Nimbus 27 I I think as I said I have\nbeen able to run kind of more moderate\nPaces in this and it's felt comfortable\nto do that it would be better if it was\na lighter shoe and I think that would\ngive it a touch more versatility but I\ndo think overall it's been a nicer shoe\nand I think for me some improvements\nfrom the gers 25 for me I think out so\nwise I think there's not a huge you know\nmajor difference for me I run in a\nmixture of dry and wet conditions and\nfor me I think you know this isn't the\nbest outsole grip that you're going to\nget on a cushion daily train of shoe but\nI think it offers enough for me I think\ngiven you know how most people are\nprobably going to use this shoe and as I\nsay you know you know ticking off a lot\nof your training Mars when you're not\nrunning at your fastest then I think\nit's going to be generally fine I would\nbe sticking to roads and Pavements maybe\nhandling a little bit of those going to\nLi to Trails so yeah my experience has\nbeen very good overall very much feels\nlike a Gel Nimbus I do think the real\nstory here that the geometry has changed\nand made it a nicer shoe to tick that\nrunning time off and I do think makes it\na nicer shoe for me than the joers 205\nis it the cushioned you know or the best\nkind of aex cushioned daily Trainer shoe\nyou should get I'll get into that in the\nverdict and more so the GEL Nimbus line\nor the last two versions of it which\nwere the updated versions of the shoe\nthe previous versions uh I never really\ngot on with but the last two versions um\nI've I've always enjoyed uh I've always\nfound them to be shoes that do what they\nsay on the tin they're comfortable daily\nshoe you can do easy runs in them\nrecovery runs longer runs um the changes\nto this version of the shoe essentially\nfrom uh the perspective of the\nexperience of the ride is is that\nmidsole a little bit extra midsole foam\nin there um and for me it doesn't\nmassively change the the ride I'm\ngetting a very similar experience to\nwhat I got from the previous two\nversions of the shoe I think it probably\ndoes feel a little bit softer because\nyou get a little bit more of that mid\nfoam in there but for me the um the way\nI run in the shoe I'm a midfoot striker\nuh so I'm hitting it right in the middle\num the way the geometry of the shoe\nworks uh and the previous two versions\nof the shoe I don't get much of a roll\nthrough in this shoe it's a very\ncomfortable shoe to wear but I I just\ndon't get any sort of transition or\ncomfortable transition um that makes it\nin any way versatile it still is a very\nSlappy shoe for me um not as Slappy as\nthe first uh well the the\n25 that was the Slappy version of the\nthe new versions of the shoe um it's not\nas Slappy as that but is quite Slappy\nfor me and I think the reason is that it\ndoes have this quite flat bottom section\nof the shoe I know Nick is a heel\nStriker so he's probably benefiting a\nlot more from this big wedge of um mopo\nat the back for me I'm hearing it dead\non this flat section uh and I'm not\nreally getting any sort of transition\nfrom it that's not a massively bad thing\nif you're just buying this shoe for\ncomfort and those easy day runs those\nlonger sessions where you just want\nComfort um the runs that I've done in it\nI've not found it to be particularly\nversatile it's fine it's comfortable\nit's nicely stable for um a Max stack\nshoe uh and as a result it's probably\nquite accessible for a lot of people who\nwant a load of cushioning but don't\nnecessarily want a really wobbly or or\nsoft shoe uh which can be the case with\na lot of Max stack shoes at the moment\nso over those runs what I've really\nfound about the shoe is that is very\nmuch the same as what I've experienced\nin those pre two two previous versions\nit's a solid shoe that is just very good\nfor comfort and and everything about the\nshoe really screams Comfort the upper\nthe the way the midell sits um I did try\nand pick up the pace in it on a couple\nof runs didn't really enjoy it one\nbecause I really started slapping it\nquite hard I was actually one point\nwhere my girlfriend was about two\nstreets away walking the dog and she\nsaids she could hear me um coming back\nhome so it is quite a loud shoe from\nthat perspective and it really does when\nyou pick up the pace uh I I really start\nhitting that midsection really hard um\nso for longer runs I think it's uh I've\nonly got up to 15K in this shoe but for\nthat it was really nice I don't think\nabout this shoe on my feet when it's on\nthere it just feels very comfortable I\ndon't have to worry about the stability\nof the shoe or anything like that so I\nthink really it's a shoe that is quite\nnicely balanced if you're looking for a\nlot of cushioning whereas that's not\nalways the case with these Max stack\nshoes the outside of the shoe uh it does\nhave quite a lot of exposed areas from\nthat from that midsole foam um the\nrubber itself is is fine I wouldn't say\nit's the grippiest outsole on any shoe\nI've tested but I haven't had any\nproblems on it uh on wet Pavements uh\nthe exposed section here I've not seen\nany issues on it so far but that does\nconcern me a little bit because this\nrubber doesn't go out very far from the\nmidell foam so that is just a concern\nwhich I think I'll just keep an eye on\nas I continue to use these shoes all in\nall though uh outsole is fine just\nnothing that impressive when compared to\nsome of the better outsoles on the\nmarket so I done about 60k in the ax ja\nNimbus 27 Now using for a mix of easy\nand long runs and one progression run\nmove from an easy to slightly faster\nPaces by the end and on my first run I'd\nsay that the main update that aex had\nreally done to the shoe was to bring it\nout in teal and send me a teal shoe\nwhich is a smart thing to do it\nimmediately made me like the shoe a lot\nmore than previous versions just\nstraight away cuz teal is the best color\nwe all know this but actually I didn't\nthink it' Chang much at all on the run\nlike it has got a little bit of a higher\nstack heite but in that first run I\nthought yeah it's a nimbus it's nice\ncomfortable it's protective cushy solid\nenough job but actually as I've done\nmore runs in the shoe and done different\ntypes of runs in the shoe I started to\nlike it a bit more I do think it\nactually is know a sneakily big upgrade\non the previous models of the shoe so\nyou got a little bit more stack heite\nthere which doesn't add too much really\nin terms of the overall comfort of the\nshoe it was already a very comfortable\nshoe but I think the extra end of the\nforef foot is important and I think\nactually the geometry has been changed a\nbit more on the shoe and that's what's\nmade me enjoy it a bit more especially\nas a heel Striker I think you've now got\na much smoother transition from Heel To\nToe like I get quite a Slappy ride with\nthe Jo nus 25 and 26 and actually it\nsometimes even create a bit of\ndiscomfort coming through on the shoe\nand I think it's definitely been\nsmoothed out here I really noticed it\nwhen I was running at slightly faster\nPaces in the shoe and I did that easy to\nsteady run like in the previous models\nyou know as I started to increase the\nspeed it would feel quite Slappy and it\nwouldn't feel great at all like it's not\nreally the best shoe for speedwork still\nbecause it's quite heavy and big it\ndefinitely felt less Slappy and more\ncomfortable to me like it's still\nslightly Slappy shoe but definitely less\nSlappy than previous models and I do\nthink the heel has been redesigned to\njust ride a bit more smoothly and I\nreally did notice that as a heel strike\nand it made it a lot more enjoyable on\nlong runs and then when I was moving a\nslightly faster Paces at all so like I\nsaid I did that easy to steady run\npretty standard daily training run but\nmoving down towards almost marathon pace\nby the end and I thought you know this\nis going to feel a bit unpleasant in the\nshoe cuz it is quite big but no not at\nall I think it's got a stiffer and\nfaster ride than I think I expected and\nyou'd probably expect from a shoe like\nthis I'm not going to say it's a superv\nstyle shoe that I'd love to go do a load\nof speedwork in it but I do think it now\nhas a bit more hostility to it and even\nas a heavy shoe uh I think it does work\nas you know a daily trainer for people\nwho want to really cush and ride but one\na shoe that can then do kind of tempo\neffort you know the odds kind of long\nsession long long runs that kind of\nthing I think it you can do them okay in\nthe ja nus 27 if you're not that fuss\nabout those kind you're not someone like\nme who's someone who have a rotation\nhave a dedicated speed work shoe for\nthose kind of runs if you just want you\nknow one shoe to do lots of different\nkinds of runs then the Nimbus 27 is\nactually better than than I expected for\nsuch a big shoe while obviously really\nexcelling on those nice relaxed easy\nruns as well because of the comfort you\nhave underf foot like I say the ride is\na little bit stiffer than I expected and\nsome people might not like that so much\nan easy shoe but I think it probably the\nkind of thing that breaks in a little\nbit like it's eased a bit over the first\nfew runs already and I didn't find it\nuncomfortable at all but yeah it's\nprobably a slightly different feeling\nthan you might expect from a shoe like\nthis when you step into it you're not\ngetting that soft squishy feeling you\nget on some of these Big Max cushion\nshoes like the 1080 line or the Nike\nInvincible or something like that like\nit has a bit of firmness to it and\nresiliency while still being really\ncomfortable and that I think does help\nwith the smoothness and the speediness\nof the transition from Heel To Toe which\nis something that I find comfortable\nlike it's not really the definition of\ncomfort but have that smooth and natural\ntransition from Heel To Toe that just\nmeans I can tick over without thinking\nabout the shoe too much is almost how I\nDefine Comfort on those easy and long\nruns and the Jo nimbers for such a big\nshoe does disappear on the foot nicely\nso after you know prettyy standard first\nrun that I thought was going to be much\nthe same as previous models I've\nactually ended up really enjoying the\ngimbus 27 more than I expected I think\nit's a really natural feeling shoe for\nsuch a big shoe and you do get a little\nbit more versatility than you might\nexpect and yeah it comes in teal so\nthat's\nfantastic so my ver on the ax GEL Nimbus\n27 is that this is a very solid update\nto the Gel Nimbus line and for me\npersonally it does feel like an upgrade\non the previous gel nimas shoes I think\nparticularly from a ride point of view\nyou and I think if you are looking for a\nshoe that is very comfortable very\nprotective I think very stable and you\nknow you know can really help you kind\nof tick off that running mileage then\nthis is a shoe absolutely can do it I\nthink if you're looking for your first\nrunning shoe this is a good option if\nyou're looking for a good long run shoe\nthis is going to fit the bill as well I\nthink when you look at the other kind of\ncushion daily trainer shoes and asx's\nkind of range of shoes I think there\nbecomes a bit of a problem I think you\nknow look at the Nova blast 5 which is\ncheaper and I think you would use for\nthe same types of runs as the gel number\n27 which is a more expensive shoe I\nthink that is a shoe that can work for\nlong runs as well I think gives you that\ncomfort as well and that protection in a\nslightly different way but I still think\nin a very effective way I do think there\nare super Blast 2 qualities in the GEL\nNimbus but that's really around the\nmidsole and you know when you look at\nwhat you get in the super Blast 2 and\nyou know it just has a quicker feel to\nit has a lighter you know overall weight\nas well is apparently a more versatile\nshoe compared to the jail ners 27 I\nthink if you look outside the aex range\nI think it becomes a problem as well\nagain for the Jael nimbers particularly\naround the the midso foam and just\nhaving other midsole Foams that are just\na bit more enjoyable just has a little\nbit more fun about it I think you look\nat what you're getting in kind of you\nknow Brooks's range particularly at the\nmoment I think you look at saky as well\nwhat you're getting from New Balance as\nwell so I think you know from that point\nof view at this kind of range this type\nof shoe maybe aex is playing a little\nbit of catch up is falling a little bit\nbehind but crucially it does have\nsomething in the Nova blast 5 and I\nthink that FF blast Max phone which I\nthink probably for me will probably end\nup in the ja Nimbus some way down the\nline if not you know very soon the Next\nGeneration the ja Nimbus but for me I've\nhad a very good experience with the G\nNimbus 27 I do think it's Improvement on\nthe G nimus 25 which I tested and the g\nnimus 26 which you know wasn't massively\nchanged from the Jus 25 and I think if\nyou like the JIS range the most recent\nrange and you like the idea of something\nthat just has a little bit more of a\nnoticeable kind of you know rocker and\nride in it then I think that's what\nyou're going to get in the jail number\n27 if you're looking for the best kind\nof value cushion daily Trainer shoe the\nmost memorable shoe this is probably not\nit but I do think a lot of people are\ngoing to like what you get from the GEL\nNimbus 27 to my verdict on the aex GEL\nNimbus 27 I think it's pretty much more\nof the same of what you're getting from\nthe previous two versions of the Jael\nNimbus line it's a very stable\ncomfortable um accessible shoe if you're\nlooking for easy runs longer runs um\nrecovery runs that sort of thing I don't\nthink it's particularly versatile still\nI don't think the updates that have been\nmade to the Midol foam have had a\ndramatic impact on its versatility I\nwould pretty much only ever use this for\nthose easier runs daily runs are I'm\ngoing out ticking off the miles and I'm\nnot really bothered about the speed for\nme that's probably going to be about 5\nminute kilm 5 minute 15 km feel spying\nat those Paces picking up the pace in\nthis getting down to like 4:30 doesn't\nfeel very comfortable doesn't feel like\nit wants to do that and definitely I\ndon't get a lot of um smooth transition\nfrom the the geometry of the shoe it\nfeels very much like I'm landing on it\nit's comfy and then I'm pushing off\nagain it doesn't feel like there's any\nsort of comfortable smooth transition uh\nfrom this from this geometry there are a\nlot of alternatives to the shoe and at\n\u00a310 this is quite an expensive shoe I\nknow a lot of shoes are getting quite\nexpensive now but I've always thought\nthe nimus line is a very expensive shoe\nfor what you get from it for me um I'd\nlook at something like the new band Mo\nV5 is considerably cheaper than shoe\nlittle bit softer now um but I just get\nbetter transition from that shoe I feel\nlike um it just smoothly Glides me\nforward as I'm maintaining a nice\nconsistent Pace at like 5 minute 20 or\nsomething like that um and I get a lot\nmore of that transition from that shoe\num so I definitely go some like newbound\nmore V5 for my style of running over the\nover the Nimbus uh I think that she was\nlike 108 v14 quite similar in a lot of\nways to this shoe um but I do think that\nthe um 1080 is a little bit more\nversatile in the more recent version it\njust has a little bit of a smoother RVE\nfor me and just feels a little bit\nlighter on the feet and then something\nlike the um Brook ler in Max I think is\nvery similar in this shoe to a lot of\nways um but the only difference is I\njust think it's a little bit more\nversatile not massively but I would\nprefer that shoe to this shoe if I was\ndoing very training sessions in it and I\nwanted something maybe from marathon\ntraining or something like this uh I\nprobably would Reserve would use this\nshoe primarily always for those easy\nruns or uh daily runs where I'm getting\nup to about 15K or something but I\ndefinitely would try and do anything\nfaster in this shoe so I definitely\nenjoyed my time in the axd on Imus 27 I\nthink it's one of the better Big Max\ncushion shoes out there probably put it\nin line with the sakon hurcan 24 is my\nfavorite of these Big Max cushion shoes\nwhich are not generally the kind of\nshoes I go for like even on my easy runs\nlong runs I tend to prefer to be in\nsomething that's a little bit smaller\nand lighter and just a bit more Dynamic\nand ticks over a bit better but the Jo\n27 is certainly would be a contender for\nmy iritation if I was going to have you\nknow a big Max cushion shoe in there it\nwould be between this and the suc\nHurrican 24 which also thing is an\nexcellent shoe that runs a lot lighter\nthan it is has a nice rocker has a\nlittle bit of resiliency to push against\nand that's build more as a stability\nshoe and has maybe you a few more\nstability features but the gel 27 is\nalso a very stable shoe for a neutral\nshoe and yeah wouldn't really you know\nworry about it on that front at all\ndespite the high stack so yeah a really\ngood shoe I think a nice update on the\nprevious model I still think the\nprevious model is more similar than\ndifferent to this shoe I prefer the ride\non this shoe for sure and I'd get it\nover the Jael ners 25 or 26 if there was\nonly a little price difference if you\nare finding the older shoe at a massive\ndiscount then I'd probably still get\nthat because that is still a good\ncomfortable easyday shoe but at the same\ntime I do think this is a better shoe\nand one I enjoyed a lot more than the\nprevious model so I do think it's a\nsuccessful update despite the fact it\nfelt like quite a minor update to me\ninitially also in the attics range you\nhave the NOA blast of course now the no\nblast 5 I really like as well I think\nthat's a good shoe that also had I think\na redesigned heel bevel this year that\nmade it a smoother riding shoe no blast\nis still really cushioned that's\nprobably the shoe I'd go for as more of\na generalist cushion daily trainer like\nit's a lot lighter than the ja num 27\nhas a bit more versatility they're both\nreally good shoes I think they almost do\nquite similar jobs so I'd just get the\nlighter shoe and the no blast and the\ncheaper shoe as well but if you're a\nslightly heavier Runner or really crave\nlike loads of cushioning under fo then\nthe ja nimus 27 I think does a really\ngood job and we'll provide that at that\nslightly higher price few other shoes\nyou know in this big Max cushion Market\nI think the 1080 v14 is a lighter shoe\nand a slightly smaller shoe and that\nfeels a bit more Dynamic and maybe has a\nslightly more exciting phone than the G\nNimbus 27 I think that's another one\nthat I think has a bit more versatility\nand almost feels more like a similar\nFeud to the Nova blast the de Nimbus\nthese days for me because it is a little\nbit lower stack and feels a bit more\nlike a cushion daily trainer this feels\nbit more build just as a Max stack shoe\neven though I do think it is a bit more\nverstile than you might expect I think I\nprefer it to some like Su Triumph 22\nwhich is just not a shoe I really got on\nwith that well there's a Brooks Glycerin\nMac which is a bit more expensive and\nyou know has quite a similar Vibe\nactually a big Max cushion shoe a bit of\nresiliency there you probably got a\nlivel foone with the glycerin Max but\nyou're paying a bit more for it and\ndon't necessarily think it's a much\nbetter shoe for faster runs or anything\nlike that and the Nimbus 27 is certainly\nas good if not a little bit better for\njust allout easy runs so yeah that' be a\nbit of a toss up there's a glycerin 22\ncoming as well which looks interesting\nso all around I think this is one of the\nbetter Max cushion shoes out there for\nsure it's probably one of my favorites\nlike I say with the sakon Huracan 24\njust got a ride that is big and\ncushioned but turns over nice and\nspeedily feels quite natural has more\nversatility than you expect and is nice\nand smooth from Heel To Toe with a\nlittle bit reduced slapp compared to\nprevious models so a successful update\nfor me the SX Jo Nimbus 27 verdict then\nNimbus fans are going to like this\nNimbus because this is textbook Nimbus\njust soft and more cushioned without\nadding any extra weight that's a trend I\nthink we're going to see a lot of the\nstack Heights rise across many shoes\nwith new light performance Foams coming\nacross the lineups for me the Nimbus is\na shoe it's a bit limited on versatility\nI'd only tend to use it for my slowest\nruns I think that's still the case\ndespite there being a little bit extra\nenergy out the midso it wasn't great at\nmarathon pace but the Nimbus 27 does an\nequally good job as the 26 for that easy\nslow Comfort running if you wanted more\nKush than the nimus 26 offered you'll\nabsolutely love this shoe if you prefer\nthings a little stiffer then I'd stick\nwith the nus 26 if you own the 26 I\nwouldn't rush out and buy the 27 until\nyou need to the changes aren't that\npronounced the other plus I think is the\nnumers 27 feel built a last this is a\nshoe that should have long mileage\nlifespan and even if that phone bottoms\nout a bit I think it's still going to be\nmore cushion than many shoes out there\nif you like your easy Run shoes to also\npack a bit more versatility though I\nthink the new Nova blast 5 might be\nworth a look probably not as sort of\noverall cushion but it's got a little\nbit more softness I personally like the\nBrooks ghost Max 2 which is a bit\nsnappier but it's not as cushion and sof\nas the nimus 27 I also think the New\nBalance 1080 v14 now offers sort of\nnimus style easy Comfort but maybe a bit\nmore energy as well that's it from us on\nthis review of the asex gel niers 27\nthanks a lot for watching don't forget\nto like subscribe and click that little\nbell and if you're going to catching\nbelow you can find into our podcast\nwhich comes out a couple of times each\nmonth thanks lot for watching catch you\nnext time\n[Music]",

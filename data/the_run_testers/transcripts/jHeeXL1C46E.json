  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name's\nNick and in this video I'm going to be\ncomparing the sakon Endorphin speed 4\nand the Nike zoomly\n[Music]\n6 so the zoomfly 6 and the Endorphin\nspeed 4 are both plated super trainers\nthat are designed to be fast training\nshoes or all-rounders or can even stand\nin for race day shoes they are both\nreally good shoes two shoes I've Loved\nrunning in this year the Endor speed 4\nmore or less continues the fine Heritage\nof the line which I think has been the\nprobably the best super trainer on the\nmarket since it launched the original\nversion of it the zoom fly was almost\nthe original kind of plated or training\npartner shoe but went off the boil quite\nsignificantly the last few versions but\nit's very much back on form now with the\nzoomfly 6 so yeah both cracking shoes\nthe Endorphin speed 4 cost \u00a3180 or $170\nwhereas the Nike zoomfly 6 a bit cheaper\nin the UK it's \u00a3155 same price in the US\nthough $170 the Endorphin speed is the\nslightly lighter shoe at 255 G or 9 oz\nin a uk9 whereas the zoomfly 6 is 266 G\nor 9.4 o in a uk9 the zoomfly has an 8\nmm drop with the stack he of 42 mm at\nthe heel 34 mm at the 4 foot the speed\nalso has an 8 mm drop but it's a lower\nstack shoe across the board it's 36 mm\nat the heel and 28 mm at the for foot so\nlooking at the design with an Nike\nyou've got a two- layer woven mesh upper\na pretty comfortable upper that doesn't\nreally you know sacrifice too much in\nthe way of comfort to try and keep the\nweight down you got a fair amount of\nstructure at the back and a bit of\npadding there as well you have a dual\ndensity mid so with a top layer of\nNike's zoomx foam the bouncy peber foam\nthat's been the best foam in its range\nsince it launched with the vaporfly\nunderneath that there's a layer of Sr O2\ncarrier foam which is there to add a bit\nmore durability and stability then you\nhave a carbon plate running through the\nmids soole but it's a little bit more\nflexible than the ones you'll see on\nNike's Racing shoes but still provides\nthat stiffness and pop you expect from a\nplate you got a waffle out sole with\ngood coverage on the forefoot and the\nheel cut out in the middle there to\nreduce some weight a pretty standard\nsetup on the bottom of the shoe there\nfor a super trainer then the Endorphin\nspeed 4 you've got an engineered mesh\nupper it's a little bit more kind of\nthin and breathable at the front than\nthe Nike similar kind of levels of\npadding at the back of the shoe there\nsmall internal heel counter as well you\ngot s power run PB foam in the midsole\nwhich is a p based foam as well and\nyou've got the speed roll rocker\ngeometry that's been very much a\nsignature feature of the Endorphin line\nacross the board in that midle you have\na nylon plate so again a little bit more\nflexible than a full carbon plate on a\nracing shoe with wings to add a bit more\nstability and you have a latice rubber\noutsole on the shoe very similar to the\nNike in terms of the coverage there at\nthe front and back with that cutout in\nthe\n[Music]\nmiddle it comes to fit of the two shoes\nI've got a uk9 in both which is a us10\nwith both of these brands that is the\nsize I generally use with sakon and Nike\nI did try a uk8.5 A us99.5 in the\nEndorphin speed 4 which also fitted me\npretty well I am kind of on the fence\nbetween those two sizes I would say in\ngeneral they both have a good fit and I\nwould stick to your normal running shoe\nsize I wouldn't go up or down in either\nof them the Nike maybe a little bit more\nkind of dialed in around the toes than\nNike's full cushion shoes but still has\nenough room in my normal size no\nconcerns with the fit at all really like\nI had a good lock down around the heel\nand midfoot they're both pretty\ncomfortable shoes especially the Nike\nwhich has you know an exceptionally\ncomfortable upper I would say for a\nsuper\n[Music]\ntrainer onto the run test then and as I\nsaid right at the start of the video\nthese are two really good shoes shoes\nthat I love running in both very\nversatile both have lots of speed both\npretty comfortable for easy runs they\nreally fit the mold of a modern super\ntrainer for sure but they do have quite\ndifferent feels and approaches I would\nsay the speed 4 is the shoe I tested\nfirst of the pair and it's still got\nthat light Nimble fast feeling that\nwe've had with the Endorphin speed since\nthe original version I think this latest\nversion is a little bit cushier at the\nheel than past models but I still find\nthis a shoe that's very fast I can go\nout and do very hard workouts in the\nshoe and it's got that slightly more\ndirect ride than most shoes these days\nbecause you have got a slightly lower\nstack heite especially under the 4 foot\nand compared to the zoomfly it does give\nyou a slightly firmer feel a slightly\nmore rocket feel and yeah a very fast\nand Nimble feel but maybe isn't quite\nnecessarily as bouncy and cushy as the\nNike as mentioned it's really cushioned\nat the heel and that does give it a nice\ncomfortable feel for easy runs like as a\nheel Striker I do feel like you're\ngetting a soft ride there if you are\nmoving at slower speeds and then you do\nget that nice snap through from The\nRocker when you do start to up the pace\nthe slight downside of that is that\nbecause it isn't so crazily cushioned\nunder the forefoot if you are snapping\nthrough like I do as a heel Striker can\nget a little bit of for foot discomfort\nI think from this shoe when pushing hard\nover longer distances like it's not\nsomething that's really bad I still\nthink it's got the chops to do those\nlong distance runs and races even but\nyeah it's a little bit less comfortable\nunder that 4ot compared to lots of shoes\nthese days that have a lot more foam\nunder that area including the zoom fly\nso with the Nike if I go and do those\nlonger hard runs you just don't get that\nall like I did a 90-minute steady run in\nthe shoe and you could really feel the\ndifference between what I'd get from the\nspeed four on that kind of run because\nit's really comfortable cruisy\ncontrolled speed 4 has that almost more\naggressive feel and more direct feel and\nyou know doing that kind of steady run\nthe speed after about 60 Minutes I get a\nlittle bit of four foot discomfort\ncruising through 90 minutes in the Nike\nI just didn't have that problem at all\nso that's really what you get here you\nget a slightly bouncy ride a cushier\nride a you know ride that almost feels\nlike you're more in kind of cruise\ncontrol even when you're running fast\nwhereas the speed you feel a bit more of\nthat pace when you are pushing hard in\nthe shoe but then when you move on to\nreally fast Paces I think that's where\nthe speed for does have a little bit of\nan edge so if the Nike has that bit more\nComfort on longer sessions and that kind\nof thing the speed has a bit more\nnimbleness and speed when it comes to\nyou know all out sessions so when I push\nto kind of my faster race Paces in the\nNike it just feels a little bit big on\nthe foot it's not heavy and you can do\nthose runs in it it is a fast shoe but\nthe speed feels more natural to run\nreally fast in I find like I can use the\nspeed 4 as a stand in for a full carbon\nshoe and I'm eyeing up a really nasty\nsession on my training plan I'm starting\nthinking oh might just use a full carbon\nshoe the speed 4 is one of the super\ntrains like I could do that shoe I feel\nlike I can perform just as well in it\npretty much as a carbon shoe like I\nremember doing a really nasty session I\ndid I think 24 times 1 minute on 30\nseconds uh float and then into a 6K at\n330 perk kind of around marathon pace\nand just felt amazing in the shoe ran\nthe you know that long section at the\nstart really well hitting Pace as I was\nyou know expect to hit in a carbon shoe\nand then cruise through that know\nmarathon pace bit at the end so I do\nthink when you're looking at you a\nreally nasty session a really tasty\nsession the speed forward have the edge\nover the zoom fly but if you're eyeing\nup something like a long progression run\nor you know really long hard tempo run\nthe zoom fly will be the one that comes\nto mind for me and that extends then to\nother kinds of runs so these aren't just\nfast training shoes like I said they are\nvery bur start they can do a bit of\neverything but when it comes to your\neasy Runs Nike has a more relaxed feel\nthe upper is really comfortable the\nunder field is very comfortable even at\nslow Paces whereas speed for is all\nthose things but maybe not quite so much\ndid a short run wearing boies at the\nsame time like at a mix of paces certain\nto say is the Nike is louder I think\nthat's something should mentioned with\nmost of the zoomfly content you know to\nget that slight Slappy sound that you\nget from some Nike shoes you do get it\nwith the zoomfly even though it doesn't\nhave that big airod that I thought was\ncausing it in the Ally you at slower\nPaces they both are really soft and\ncushy like I do think that wedge of the\nfoam at the back of the Endorphin speed\nyou does give it a comfortable ride at\neasy paces and as you start to move\nthrough the gears maybe I start Landing\na bit more midfoot and you get a\nslightly firmer feeling from the speed\nthat really fast rocker transition Zoom\nfly feels more similar at all Paces you\nknow soft bouncy but you know it's fast\nyou kind of you're moving fast you don't\nnecessarily feel like you can tell\nyou're moving as fast in this shoe you\nhaven't got so much feel for the ground\nbut it's really protective you are\nmoving quick in it speed has that more\nkind of aggressive rocker feel to it a\nbit more of that ground feeli if that's\nsomething you're\n[Music]\nafter these are two really good shoes\nboth shoes i' be very happy to have in\nmy rotation as a fast trainer or an\nallrounder Nike is a fair bit cheaper in\nthe UK which is something I would\ncertainly consider as a factor given the\nway the speed is priced to be the same\nin the US but you know Fair bit pricier\nin the UK but they do kind of have\nslightly different strengths as well the\nNike I think is a great daily trainer\nthat also has a lot of speed whereas the\nEndorphin speed 4 is a very good fast\ntrainer that can also do those daily\nruns so it's almost what you would\nprioritize when you were buying the shoe\nthat might help you make the decision\nwhen you're picking between them it's a\nbit similar to what I was talking about\nthe hak X2 and the Nike uh and when I\nwas comparing those two shoes these are\nboth cracking shoes but if you're\nparticularly looking for a shoe to do a\nlot of long miles lot of marathon\ntraining runs lots of long sessions do\nyou think the zoomly 6 has a bit of the\nedge on those runs Dophin speed just\ndoesn't have quite as much comfort Under\nFoot but if you are looking for a fast\ntrainer to potentially go and do races\nin especially shorter races and to hit\nthe track for short reps that kind of\nthing the speed for does have a bit more\nPace in it I would say for sure and then\nthere's also a different ride field to\nconsider as well if you do like the big\ncushy rides you want more foam Under\nFoot you want a slightly bouncy ride in\ngeneral that is what the zoomly provides\nif you do like that little bit more feel\nfor the ground that fast turnover from\nThe Rocker on the speed and the shoot it\njust feels faster in general then the\nEndorphin speed 4 provides that like I\nsaid they're both have a very broad\nrange of strengths and I really don't\nthink I'd discount either as an\nallrounder just might come down a bit\nmore to ride field Maybe the price and\nmaybe yeah like I say what you're\npredominantly looking for from a shoe\nwhen you're adding it to your rotation\ndefinitely a very hard call around for\nme I think given the training I do I\nwould probably lean towards getting the\nNike in fly myself usually marathon\ntraining lots of long runs that don't\nnecessarily go flat out Paces but I want\na shoe that can bounce through the\nmerrily and protect the legs well and I\nthink the Nike does that a little bit\nbetter so it's so I think it's a\ntraining style that probably plays for\nit strength though when it comes to\nthose really allout sessions I probably\nthen have to reach maybe for a carbon\nshoe whereas the speed 4 You does do\nthose ones really well\nthat's our comparison of the Nike Zoom\nfly 6 and the S endorphin speed 4 let us\nknow what you think in the comments\nbelow please do like and subscribe ring\nthe little bell and we'll see you next\ntime",

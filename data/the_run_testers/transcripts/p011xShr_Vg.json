  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name\nis Nick and this is our full review of\nthe Nike zoomfly\n[Music]\n6 so zoomfly 6 is the six version of the\nzoomfly a shoe that's had a slightly up\nand down history the early models were\npretty good shoes they were the original\ntraining partner shoes the ones that\nyou'd use in partnership with the\nvaporfly second one was a plated trainer\nfor the first time and since then the\nline has gone off the rails a little bit\nthe shoes have got progressively heavier\nand less speedy and less suited to\nreally any kind of running I'd associate\nwith a super trainer but the zoomfly 6\naims to put that back on track with the\nchanges made all looking very good on\npaper you know have a lighter shoe it's\ngot more zoom X foam in it that's the\nclassic zoomx foam not the recycled\nmaterial used on the zoomfly 5 and all\naround it looks much more like a plat\nsuper trainer in line with the best on\nthe market things like the hok ma X2 so\nendorphin speed 4 New Balance SC Trainer\nV3 like hopefully this is going to be a\ncompetitive shoe and spoilers it is a\ncompetitive shoe I really like this shoe\nuh we're going to go more into the\ndetail of that during the rest of the\nreview but yeah I think Nike's knocked\nout the park with this shoe I've really\nloved running in it it cost \u00a3155 or $170\nwhich is pretty good for a super trainer\nthese days a lot of them are now edging\nquite near or even above2 200 and it\nalso weighs about middle of the pack for\na super trainer as well it's 266 G or\n9.4 o in UK size 9 which is a US size 10\nit has an 8 mm drop and a stack height\nof 42 mm at the heel 34 at the 4ot comes\nto the design of the the shoe you've got\na two layer woven mesh upper you know it\nfeels like quite a lot of material but\nit is a very comfortable upper something\nI've definitely noted on the run for\nsure got a fair bit of support at the\nback with an internal heel counter bit\nof padding around the heel not too much\non the tongue though then you got a two-\nlayer midsole with a top layer being\nmade from zoomx Pham this is not\nrecycled zoomx like we have seen on some\nNike shoes this is the original stuff\nthe good stuff which is a peber based\nfoam that is lightweight bouncy all the\nthings you expect from a top foam and\nunderneath you have a layer of sr2\ncarrier foam which is a bit more\nmysterious in terms of makeup but it's\nbasically there to bring a bit more\ndurability and stability to the shoe\nwith that zoomx layer above it running\nbetween those layers of foam you have a\nfull length carbon plate which is not\nquite as stiff as the plates on Nike's\nRacing shoes but still gives you that\nkind of propulsive feeling and\nstabilizes this High Midol stack you\nhave a couple of side cutouts and one on\nthe bottom as well to reduce the weight\nof the shoe a little bit and then you've\ngot a rubber out soole covers the for\nfoot and two sections at the heel got a\ntypical outsole setup for a speed Focus\nshoe like this with Nike's waffle p on\n[Music]\nthere comes to the fit of the zoomfly 6\nit's been really good for me in my\nnormal size got a uk9 here which is a\nus10 with Nike across Nike's range this\nis the size I pretty much always used\nand it's always worked for me and it\ncertainly works for me in the zoomfly 6\nit's maybe a little bit more dialed in\naround the toes than with of more\neveryday training Focus Shoes like the\nPegasus or the Invincible or the Vero\nsomething like that you might get a\nlittle bit more space but it's not been\ntoo dared in for me I haven't had any\nproblems with my toes hitting the front\nof the shoe or any rubbing around there\nin fact in general it's been a really\ncomfortable upper for a super trainer\nthe comfort of this upper is notable\nbecause it's a speed Focus shoe and it\nis a fast shoe but you actually do get a\nkind of daily trainer level of comfort\nhere which you does make it that little\nbit more enjoyable to use at slower\nPaces as well so yeah all around the fit\nwas very good and I would stick to your\nnormal size with Nike or running shoes\nin\ngeneral so I've run 112 km in the zoomly\n6 now mostly doing pretty long run runs\nin the final stages of my marathon\ntraining ahead of the Valencia Marathon\nlike done a fair mix of sessions in it\nlike so mostly all my runs I'd say have\ninvolved some kind of fast running at\nthe end or as intervals and also some\neasy running pretty much so I've done a\nnice variety of Paces in the shoe and I\ndid an awful lot with it in the first\nfew days I had it so across a 4day\nstretch in the shoe I did my first run\nin it which we have a video up on the\nchannel about where I did a a track\nsession running 10 times one Mar reps\nprogressively quicker reps from 530 mile\ndown to 5 minute Ming then the next day\nI took it out for a steady 90minut run\nso that's steady for me with my coach is\nkind of you know an effort a controlled\neffort it's not quite Tempo Pace but\nit's you know it's a decent effort so he\nrunning pretty quick on that as well\ntook the Monday off this shoe and used a\ndifferent shoe for an easy run and on\nthe Tuesday I did a really hard\nprogression running it doing 45 minutes\nwith the last 15 minutes of that being\nat 325k pace so in that 4-day stretch I\ndid three runs in the shoe of over 70k\nin total and it really impressed me each\ntime one thing that definitely stood out\nis how comfortable the shoe is for a\nplated trainer a super trainer like this\nlike it's got the speed which will'll\ncome on to but the thing that stands out\nis its comfort so it's a really nice\nshoe to pull on it's a shoe that feels\nreally good on cool downs and warm-ups\nyou know and then feels comfortable on\nlong hard runs as well like the upper is\na big part of that but the underfoot\nfeel is really nicely done where you\nstill feel fast it doesn't feel\nponderous at all but do get a lot of\ncomfort and support and you know using\nit for those three hard runs in four\ndays like it really protected the legs\nwell it bounced back well from those and\nall around just really enjoyed it on\nthat front and then like I say it has\nthe speed like this has definitely not\nbeen the case with a zoom Fly Shoe over\nthe past last couple of generations like\nit's not a shoe that feels really Nimble\nand agile like some in this category\nlike the sakon Endorphin speed 4 but\nit's a shoe that just delivers a lot of\nBounce propulsion and really helps you\nto dial into paces and hold those Paces\nso I was doing those mile reps on the\ntrack and it felt great in the first\nkind of nine when I was doing you know\nmore relaxed Paces down towards my half\nmarathon pace like I say 530 per mile\n525 a mile 520 a mile doing an allout\nmile at the end of that when I ran\naround five minutes was a bit tougher in\nthe shoe because yeah that's when you\nwant a slightly nimbler feeling shoe but\nyou know still did it and it still moves\nreally well and then on that steady run\nthe next day like that was one of the\nbest runs of my whole training block\nwhere you I was running to effort to\nfeel like I was trying to keep my heart\nrate you know fairly low and just make\nsure I wasn't getting out of breath or\nanything like that and the pace coming\nout was you know surprisingly good for\nme and really enjoyable and just the Run\nfelt great and the whole run I kept\nwondering oh I'm going to start flagging\na bit is this shoe going to stop feeling\ngreat but no it felt amazing I do think\nit's got the chops to be you know a\nlower cost alternative Marathon shoe for\nlots of people you know for a run like\nthat where where I was ding not not far\noff my marathon pace but you know not at\nany kind of race Pace but still running\nyou know fairly quick and it just felt\nreally enjoyable comfortable again\nprotected the legs felt great the\nprogression run probably showed the\nlimits of its speed for me where like I\nsay the last 15 minutes I was running uh\nlike 325 a k pace so that is around my\nmarathon pace my go marathon pace with\nValencia you know few hard runs over the\ncourse of the days befor hand and the\nshoot just started to feel a bit big for\nme then like still did the Run completed\nthe run two plan and you know has that\nin if you want your training shoe to do\nall your training runs it can do them\nbut that's the kind of run where as\nsomeone with a high Cadence High\nturnover I gent prefer just a Nimble\nlighter feeling shoe like even though\nyou're getting loads of Bounce from the\nshoe just feel at more Flatout race\nPaces I like that lightweight feel to a\nshoe which you get from some of the\nsuper trainers like the Mac X2 or the\nEndorphin speed 4 which have that\nslightly more lightweight feel but you\nknow all around the shoe felt really\ngood throughout those three sessions\nI've used it since then for a couple of\nprogression runs done a 22k progression\nrun in there and then a shorter one as\nwell and yeah it's just always delivers\nthe good and it's showe I really look\nforward to pulling on which is\ndefinitely not the case with the\nprevious models which were kind of get\nthrough the testing you know hasn't\nreally worked again and then move on\nthis is a shoe I'll be coming back to\nafter the review because it is so\ncomfortable whilst having that pace and\nespecially for someone like marathon\ntraining you it really does feel like a\nshoe that you can use for lots and lots\nof different runs so big tick on the run\ntest for me like Nike has changed the\nshoe in the way I wanted to see it\nchanged I think lots of people wanted to\nsee it changed and the results are as\ngood as we expected I think like it\nreally is you know now a competitive\nsuper trainer and one that will work\nreally well in partnership with\nsomething like the alphafly with that\nreally nice cruisy setup that can handle\nlots of different speeds feel\ncomfortable and general just be a shoe\nthat you look forward to pulling on for\nlots of different kinds of\n[Music]\nruns so i' say that Nike has done a\nfantastic job here in resurrecting the\nzoomfly line and really making it a\ncompetitive supr trainer again it's just\na very good shoe it's comfortable it's\nfast it does all the things you want\nfrom a plated super trainer you're going\nto use for lots of different runs and\nit's enjoyable to use them for all those\nruns when you look at the super trainer\nMarket at large which is a very\ncompetitive area of the market I would\nsay um it sits probably more at the\ncomfortable end of things so things like\nthe New Balance FC trainer V3 or even\nthe AIC super blast shoes that can do it\nall but especially are very comfortable\nand great for long runs but it's a bit\ncheaper than those shoes and I think I\ndo like the Zoom F six a bit more even\nthan the superlast I know people love\nthe superlast and they won't be happy\nabout that but I really like the feel\nyou get from the shoe and the superlast\nsometimes just feels a little bit too\nboatlike for me as great as it is this\nis a slightly Nimble of feeling whilst\ndelivering loads of pace as well it's\nalso the Muno Vista in this area which\nis a really fun and bouncy lightweight\ndaily trainer I think you get a bit more\nPace out of the zoom fly be more\ncomfortable going to do a hard long run\nor track session in this shoe than the\nMuno but that's another great option and\nreally good value in the UK in\nparticular and then my favorite super\ntrainers at the moment are the Endorphin\nspeed 4 and the Mac X2 which are the\nlighter weight faster super trainers and\nthey do a really fantastic job of being\ngreat race day stand-ins or perfect for\nreally hard sessions the Nike isn't\nquite as quick as those shoes doesn't\nfeel as Nimble as those shoes but it is\na comfort upgrade like compared to the\nEndorphin speed 4 you've got a lot more\nfoam Under Foot and a more comfortable\nfeeling there especially under the four\nfoot the Endorphin speed 4 is relatively\nlow stack compared to lots of super\ntrainers especially under the 4f foot\nand I think you get a bit more Comfort\nthere for long hard runs even if the\nspeed 4 is a bit more Nimble and fast\nfor actual racing or shorter sessions\nand the Mac X2 is really comfortable is\nreally balancy like has a lot of the\nsame great underfoot properties as the\nzoomfly 6 whil it's being a bit faster\nin nimbler but has a slightly trickier\nupper so I've gotten okay with the Mac\nX2 upper but I do know it's caused\npeople some issues around the heel\nyou're not going to get that with the\nzoomfly 6 which I think has\nexceptionally comfortable upper as I've\nmentioned so the Mac X2 is still my\nfavorite shoe in this area because it\nhas so much speed and I do get on with\nthe upper and you really can do anything\nin that shoe including very easy runs\nbut think the zoomfly six is a bit more\ncomfortable bit more relaxed on those\neasy runs just maybe have quite the same\ntop end speed as the Mac X2 but\ncertainly you know really good shoe you\ncould use instead of that if you don't\nget on or find the MAC X2 a bit too racy\nor unstable or anything like that so\noverall really liked the zoomfly 6 I\nthink it's a really good super trainer\nthat can handle wide range of runs\nreally well especially someone's looking\nat marathon training I think it does\nthose long runs in particular very well\nindeed and yeah like I say it's very\ncomfortable pretty good value super\ntrainer that now can compete with the\nbest out there might just depend which\none you go for might just depend on what\nexactly you're looking for from a super\ntrainer in terms of whether you want\nthat top end speed race day stand in or\nmore of a comfortable shoe that's just\nexclusively going to be used for\ntraining but certainly a lovely surprise\nto get here at the end of the year that\nthe zoom fly is kind of back to its best\nthat's our review of the Nike zoomfly 6\nlet us know what you think in

  "text": "hello and welcome to the Run testers my\nname is Nick and in this video I'm going\nto be comparing the Hoka Mac X2 and the\nNike zoomfly\n[Music]\n6 so the Mac X2 and zoomfly 6 are both\nplated training shoes that are designed\nto be used either in partnership with a\ncarbon plate racing shoe or as racing\nSLT trining shoes themselves both these\nmodels are significant improvements on\nthe previous versions of the shoe in my\nopinion and both are very much among my\nfavorite shoes of the year but then both\nin my top five running shoes of 2024\nbecause I've really enjoyed spending a\nlot of time in both of these shoes but\nthere are certainly differences between\nthem that might make them suitable to\ndifferent Runners the zoomfly cost \u00a3155\nin the UK $17 in the US the Mac X2 is a\nlittle bit more expensive it's \u00a3170 in\nthe UK and then $190 in the US Mac X2 is\na slightly lighter shoe at 255 G or 9 oz\nin uk9 whereas a zoom fly is 266 G or 9.\n4 oz in a UK knot zoomly has an 8 mm\ndrop and a stack heite of 42 mm at the\nheel 34 mm at the for foot whereas Mac\nX2 has a 5 mm drop a stack height of 44\nmm at the heel and 39 at the 4T in the\nmen's shoe and then 42 mm at the heel 37\nat the 4T in the women's when it comes\nto the design of the two shoes they'\nboth got dual density midsoles with top\nlayers made from peber based foam so\nyou've got that peber based layer over\nan Eva layer on the Hoka ma X2 and in\nbetween them you have a paback plate\nthat has wings at the 4 foot to add a\nbit more stability there you got a very\nclear rocket geometry lots of cutouts\nit's a very aggressive you know design\nto the shoe that is certainly\nreminiscent of racing shoes like the\ncell X1 in hokus range got a very\nlightweight woven upper not very much\npadding at all around the heel or on the\ntongue again very racy feeling upper and\nthen you've got rubber on the out soole\ncovering key stuff around the forefoot\nand heel but there's lots of cutouts\nthere's lots of exposed foam it's all\ndesigned to really reduce weight on the\nNike you've got a slightly more relaxed\nfeeling shoe certainly around the upper\nyou've got this two layer woven mesh at\nthe front there quite a lot of padding\nat the back Fair bit of structure as\nwell like it's much more of a training\nshoe style upper compared to the racy\none you get on the hoker then you've got\ndual density midsole like I say we have\na top layer that's Nike's zoomx foam\nthis is not the Recycled version this is\nthe Fresh zoomx Foam over a full length\ncarbon plate and then the bottom layer\nis sr2 Carrier foam now with the comp\nplate in the Zoom Flight it's a little\nbit more flexible than the ones on their\nRacing shoes so you see you almost got\nsimilar amount of flex to the pack plate\non the hoker so even though it's carbon\nit's not necessarily quite as stiff as a\nfull racing shoe which is what you want\nthat's designed to be used for training\nas well and then you've got a rubber out\nsoole with kind of the waffle pattern\nthat you see on lots of Nike shoes\npretty good coverage on the 4 foot\ncouple of bits at the heel there like\nneither shoe has loads of outso coverage\nbut both have actually been pretty good\nfor grip for me and I've not seen any\nkind of wear and tear\n[Music]\nyet it comes the fit of the two shoes\nI've got a uk9 in both with Hoka that's\na us99.5 with Nike it's a us10 it's a\nsize I've used for both Hoka and Nike\nyou across their shoes for many years\nand both of these shoes do fit me well\nin my normal size the Mac X2 is a\nnarrower shoe but you can get it in a\ncouple of different widths the zoomfly 6\nhas a little bit more kind of tightness\naround the toe than some Nike shoes I'd\nsay it's not as roomy as the more\ncushion shoes like the Pegasus or\nsomething like that but I do think\nthere's enough room there sticking to\nyour normal size is probably the way to\ngo and that's the case with B shoes I do\nthink you should stick to your regular\nsize definitely a difference in fit\naround the heel you've got much more\npadding a bit more structure around the\nback of the Nike it's got a much more\ncomfortable Steppin feel when it comes\nto the fit whereas the hoker has that\nvery strip back design like I've heel\nlocked the shoe I haven't had any major\nproblems with the heel myself on the\nshoe but lots of people have it can\nirritate or rub the heel a bit I think\nwith the next version you know coming\nout next year H is going to put a more\npadded heel design on the Mac X3 but for\nnow it's a little bit of a worry point\nwith the shoe for sure like I said I\nhaven't had any major problems myself\nbut lots of people have and you do get a\nmore comfortable fit around the hill\nwith the Nike for\n[Music]\nsure onto the run test then and these\nare two shoes that I really enjoyed\nrunning in this year I've used both of\nthem for a really wide variety of\nmarathon training runs like some really\ntesting sessions you kind of workouts on\ndouble days long hard runs and also Fair\nbit of easy running as well I do think\nversatility is a big strength for both\nof these shoes they very much fit the\nbill in terms of that super trainer\ncategory as a shoes that can do a little\nbit of everything they have the pace for\nyour faster runs could even use them\npotentially for racing if you're not\nusing full carbon shoes but you can also\nease back and run nice and slowly with\nthem if you want to max2 was the first\nof the two shoes I tested and it was a\nreally enjoyable shoe to run in like I\nsay like I didn't really get on that\nwell with the original macx CU I found\nit just an okay shoe but just not that\nfast and didn't really feel like a super\ntrainer to me the max2 certainly is I\nthink it's the fastest super trainer out\nthere really can step in for a carbon\nshoe when it comes to really hard\nsessions or even races you've got very\naggressive rocker and ride that really\npunches you forward off the increased\nstack of peber foam you have in this\nversion compared to the previous model\nand yeah it just feels really fast and\nthen I do find you can ease back and run\nslowly in the shoe I do think it has\nthat kind of range like when I was first\nusing it I took it away on holiday and I\ndid enjoy just you know running pretty\neasy in this shoe does have a little bit\nmore push to it to try and get you\nforward to start running faster than the\nNike it's not necessarily the most\nrelaxed shoe out there especially with\nthat upper which isn't like I say the\nmost comfortable for just relaxed easy\nruns but I do think you can do pretty\nmuch anything in this shoe and then it\nreally does have that top end speed like\nI after some really horrible sessions in\nthe shoe on the track on the road where\nI would normally start to lean towards\nusing a full carbon racing shoe and the\nmacx 2 has really delivered on those\nruns and then zoomfly 6 for sure has a\nmore easygoing ride than the macx 2 like\nfrom the moment you pull it on it's a\nmuch more easy shoe to get on and lace\nup and then you can just Cruise very\nslowly in it but I have found that it's\nreally got that top end Pace as well\nmore so than expected like when I pulled\nit on it felt pretty good I thought it\nwas going to be a pretty nice General\ndaily training with a bit of speed but\nactually I have done some nasty runs in\nthe shoe gone down the track done 10\ntimes 1 mile reps done a like a steady\n90minut run where I went through the\nhalf marathon Mark and like 115 and it's\njust felt really good throughout has a\nmore of a bouncy ride than the hoker it\nhasn't got so much of a rocker like it's\nnot quite as traditional and Slappy as\nlots of Nike shoes with very high drops\nlike the Pegasus but it isn't really a\nvery rocket shoe but it feels quite\nsmooth and soft underf you've got loads\nof cushioning there and both of these\nshoes have big big stacks of cushioning\nunder the forfeit in particular so\nthey're kind of comfortable over any\ndistance and then the zoly does give you\nquite a lot of propulsion off the front\nof the shoe there kind of more so than\nyou sometimes feel like with the macx\ntoo you can really feel the speed but\nZoom fly the speed is there but it's not\nquite as aggressive feeling underf foot\nit comes to really fast Paces like I\nhave gone up to faster race Paces in\nboth these shoes like the Zoom fly6\ndoesn't feel quite as good as the Mac to\nme like it doesn't feel heavy per se but\nit just feels quite big on the fo end\nfeels more like kind of a bounding shoe\nthat might work well maybe for people\nwho have more of a loping stride than me\nbut as quite a high Cadence Shuffle\nRunner I think the Mac X2 feels a bit\nbetter it feels more Nimble and\naggressive it feels like it's turning my\nfeet over a little bit more easily and\nwhen it comes to those really fast Paces\nyou know like I say often when I might\nlean towards using a carbon shoe even in\ntraining for those really hard sessions\nthe Mac X2 does those better than the\nzoom fight I would say when it comes to\nmaybe looking at holding a pace over a\nlonger distance doing an easy steady\nlong run progression runs that kind of\nthing I think the zoom fly is more\nrelaxed ride is preferable and it's\ncertainly you know that more relaxed fit\nis a big plus when it comes to daily\ntraining as well to the short run in\nboth of these shoes at the same time the\nfirst thing that I noticed was how much\nharder it was to get the hoker on and\nlaced up compared to the Nike like I\nsaid it's got really dialed in fit you\ngot to adjust it get it just right to\nreally hold your foot in place without\nirritating the top of your foot with the\nlaces or worrying about the heel design\nthe Nike just slips on like a very\nrelaxed daily trainer and then when you\ncome to the Run itself you can\ndefinitely feel more of a tip forward\nfeeling from the hoker The Rocker is\nreally noticeable even at easy paces and\nand when you get up to speed you can\nreally feel that fast turn over and that\nPunchy Pace from the hoker gives you a\nlittle bit more you off the toes I'd say\nthan the Nike which feels similar at all\npaces and feels good at all paces and it\nstill works you know as a speed shoe\nlike I've been talking about but you\ndefinitely feel that speed a bit more in\nthe Hoke of a Shore and get that more\nkind of thrusting forward feeling uh\nfrom the design and the geometry of the\n[Music]\nshoe verdict is that the Hoka max2 and\nthe Nike zflow 6 are both excellent\nsuper trainers that you can use for a\nreally wide variety of training runs and\nalso you know to step in as Racing shoes\nfor sure I say the Mac X2 is the faster\nof the two as I've been talking about\nit's the one that I think I would go for\nif I was looking particularly I was\nlooking at a racing shoe or a shoe to\nuse predominantly for very fast sessions\nyour fastest sessions each week I think\nthe Mac X2 does those a little bit\nbetter but then the Nike is a more\ncomfortable shoe a more relaxed ride and\nand a better option I think for General\ndaily training or still having a fair\nbit of speed so if you are looking for\nsomething that's going to be you picking\nup a lot of miles in your week each week\nI think the zoomfly 6 probably has a bit\nof an edge there because it's just an\neasier shoe to get on with in terms of\nthe fit and the ride being comfortable\nand really good at easy Paces I like the\nmacx 2 at easy Paces but that might not\nbe the case for everyone I think it has\ngot you know more aggressive feeling\nride underf foot Nike might also be a\ntad more stable when it comes to that\nkind of thing it's also a little bit\ncheaper so that's obviously a bonus as\nwell overall I do prefer the hak X2\nmyself I think it's pretty much my\nfavorite shoe of the year so far but a\nlot of that comes down to the fact that\nI quite like the feeling and easy Paces\nwhich I'm not sure everyone will and I\nalso get on with the fit of the shoe so\nthe heel design will obviously be a big\nno no for some people and that will\nimmediately make the zoom plus 6 a\nbetter option but I've got on with it\nfine like I say the ride Works me at a\nwide range of Paces I really like the\nfact it's got that impressive top end\nspeed so it'll be my pick but the\nzoomfly 6 probably an easier shoe for\nthe majority of Runners to get on with\nstill very fast a little bit cheaper as\nwell so certainly a case of both of\nthese\n[Music]\nshoes that's our comparison of the Mac\nX2 and the zoomfly 6 let's know what you\nthink in the comments below please do\nlike and subscribe ring the little bell\nand we'll see you next time",

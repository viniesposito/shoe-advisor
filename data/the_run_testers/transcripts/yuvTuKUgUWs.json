  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand in this video we're talking running\nheadphones specifically the Run testers\naward-winning Jabra Elite a active 2\nthere has been some minor updates to the\nsecond edition of these inar buds that's\nmainly to improve the active noise\ncancellation and the awareness modes the\nfact they haven't changed too much is\ngood news in some ways because the first\ngeneration also won our award for best\nrunning headphones last year so if you\nwant to know why we've crowned these the\nbest running headphones two years in a\nrow you need to watch on\nnow before we get into the design the\nfirst thing you need to know is that\nJabra is getting out of the headphones\nbusiness so while these are fantastic\nthe software support and all that you\nknow the app support might not last\nforever so there is a caveat to this the\nchanges to the jabber Elite 8 active 2\nthough are minimal the hardware stays\nlargely the same and the it's the\nsoftware and the algorithms that have\nbeen updated to improve the sound\nquality the updates include enhanced\nhearr transparency mode for better\nawareness Outdoors is optimized to\nreduce wind noise strong adaptive hybrid\nactive noise cancellation with improved\nmid and low frequency noise cancellation\nthere there are a total of six mics\nstill in these to try and guarantee good\ncore quality on the move and Jabra says\nthat's also been improved thanks to new\nenhanced AI Core algorithms there's a\nnew smart case which is the big Hardware\nchange and this connects to any device\nvia the supply dual end USBC or a 3 and\nA2 mil Jack so you can now stream\nspatial sound direct to your earbuds\nwithout Bluetooth so you can use these\nnow with non Bluetooth friendly kind of\ntreadmills and airplane screens by\nlinking the case into those and then\nusing your headphones beyond that you're\ngetting the same wingf free light and\ncompact buds that sit snug in the ears\nwith a shap grip liquid silicone\ncompound coating that gets grippier when\nit gets wet the buds are nice and\nlightweight they weighing at just 5 G or\n0.2 o the charging case is Compact and\nrunning belt friendly weighing in at 472\nG or 1.68 o on paper the battery life on\nthe buds is 8 hours with active noise\ncancellation on there's a further 24\nhours of active noise cancellation\ncharge in the case or up to 56 case\nplugs buds total run time if you use\nthem with the active noise cancellation\noff a 5 minute fast charge Banks and\nhours run time when it comes to\ndurability Jabra says these are the\ntoughest headphones it's ever made the\nbuds are ip68 rated so they can be\nsubmerged up to meter and a half in\nwater they can be rinsed underwater they\ncan get splashed during water sports\nrunning soaked on a rainy day all that\nkind of stuff they're dust proof as well\nand they're military tested the case is\nalso ip54 rated so that's dust protected\nand splash proof which is good news if\nyou want to carry it with you on a run\ngood thing for Ultras if you're packing\nthem in your belt and all that kind of\nthing the sound is powered by six mil\nspeakers with Dolby spatial sound\ncustomizable music EQ and music EQ\npresets in the partner R other clever\ntricks include Spotify tap for launching\nyour most recent Spotify play track with\na single tap find my buds for locating\nmisplaced headphones and on connectivity\nthey pack Bluetooth 5.3 multipoint so\nyou can connect to two devices\nsimultaneously and switch from laptop to\nphone without having to reconnect you\ncan also pair with up to 10 devices and\nthere's that ell audio mode for wiring\ninto things like airplane monitors when\nyou can't connect via Bluetooth on price\nthe RRP was \u00a3229.99 in the UK but you\ncan find the jabrai a active gen now for\naround\n\u00a3160 for context you can pick up the\nfirst gen now for around \u00a399 as well on\n[Music]\ndeals so there's not a huge amount to\nreport on the design side of things with\nthe Gen 28 active they're identical to\ngen one and that goes for the kind of\nlook that kind of understated kind of\nstylish kind of matte look that I think\nmakes it quite nice to use for when\nyou're you know running but also when\nyou're using outside of running as well\ntoo it uses that kind of shake fit grip\nuh design to keep them in your ears so\nthere's no ear hooks no wing tips and\nyou know like gen one they've worked\nvery well for me I've used them for a\nmixture of runs a mixture of paces and\nthey have stayed put I think the other\nthing I really like that's kind of stuck\naround has been the controls I think you\nknow you know some airbuds really\nstruggle in terms of implemen those\ncontrols but Jabra do a really good job\nwith their kind of physical controls\nit's a case of pressing on the outside\nof the airbuds and you know I love the\nfact they've got volume controls there\nwhich you know work really well for me\nand I kind of like adjusting volume you\nknow the kind of skipping tracks all\nworks very well for me the key\ndifference really kind of lies in the\ncase it's minor differences it's maybe\nslightly heavier than the one with the\nGen one airbuds you got a similar\nsimilar kind of look in terms of\nportability but the cables have slightly\nkind of changed you're getting a USBC to\n3.5 mm cable which enables kind of\nspatial sound mode which not really for\nrunning but also you know uh can you\nknow make it better for kind of\ntraveling and using um kind of in\ninflight Entertainment Systems as well\ntoo so those are really kind of\nnon-running kind of benefits but\neverything else from a design point of\nview from a running perspective is all\nvery similar here so terms of sound\nquality effectively you are getting the\nsame setups with the Gen 2 to the Gen\none vers version it's the same\ncomponents it's the same in terms of the\nmodes that you're getting you're getting\na hearr mode active noise cancellation\nmode with that active noise cancellation\nmode Jabra is promising that thec is\ngoing be two times more effective than\nthe version used on the Gen one version\nbut it essentially uses the same version\nof that kind of hybrid active noise\ncancellation as gen one and it's not the\nbest kind ofc support offered on a pair\nof Jabra earbuds now in terms of that\nperform I would say it has been pretty\nsimilar for me and you know that's not\nnecessarily a bad thing you know the\nJabra Elite a active gen one sound very\ngood and it's all the same kind of\nthings I'm seeing here in terms of that\nSound Performance it's bright energetic\nit's\ncustomizable it's good kind of General\nbase warmth there as well as I said with\nGen one I think out of the box The Sound\nPerformance or quality isn't the best\nand I think once you kind of pair it\nwith that sound companion app uh um on\niPhone or Android you know go and see\nwhat you can play with in terms of\nsettings in terms of the EQ mode I think\nyou get something a lot more rewarding\nand that's ultim what I had to do with\nGen 2 in terms of having more effective\nactive noise cancellation I can't say\nthat's something I really did notice in\nmy time with him you know it isn't the\nbestc support I have experienced on a\nset of earbuds I still think the\nairpods kind of and Sony's kind of um\nkind of top end airbuds kind of offer\nthe best perform performance there that\nI've experienced it's the same with the\nhearr mode as well too it's very good\nit's not the best available on a set of\nearbud but I think ultimately I really\nenjoy the Sound Performance and the\nprofile that you get on the jabber a\nactive Gen 2 it's not that far off the\nGen one the promises of improvements\nI've not really seen in terms of battery\nlife again I would say it is very\nsimilar if not identical to my time with\nthe Gen one version of the elite a\nactive it's promising the same numbers\nand that's whether you're using Inc mode\nor without ANC now when I used them for\nkind of generally for over an hours\nworth of running withc I saw a drop of\naround 30% I think for similar amount of\nrunning time withc disabled it was half\nthat so if you kind of look at those\nnumbers that kind of you know adds up to\nwhat those kind of numbers are promised\nby Jabra and as you know as I said it's\nnot a promised Improvement on gen one\nit's it's matching what gen one offered\nand if you're happy with the level of\nperformance that we've got on gen one\nthat's what I've experienced using the\nGen 2 versions Elite 8 active so Jabra\nElite 8 active Gen 2 the last ra I think\nfor jabra's Consumer side headphones is\na bit of a shame because they've always\nmade very good headphones always\nheadphones that we've rated very highly\nas running headphones and that's\ncertainly the case with the elite eight8\nactive Gen 2 so a lot of the stuff I\nlike about these buds is the same as on\nother Jabra headphones the previous\nmodels of these headphones in particular\nstarting with the fit in general I don't\nreally get on that well with iner buds\nfor running they just squirm loose and\ndrop out for me and that kind of unless\nI have some kind of wing or a ear hook\non them which can come a little bit\nuncomfortable over time but jabra's\nheadphones have always stayed in place\nfor me and that's the case with the\nelite a active gen 2s as well they just\nsit pretty comfortably in my ear they\ndon't fall out on the run runs of any\nlength they feel comfortable you know\nand it's an exceptional aspect of those\nheadphones for me I lots of other people\nget on fine with all in a headphones but\nI do think the jabas are the ones that\nhave always fit the best for me the\ncontrols are still very good on these\nheadphones like they have been on\nprevious models you get a nice clear\nbutton that's easy to hit while you're\nrunning you can also turn them off which\nyou can't do most truly wild headphones\nwithout putting the back in the case and\nI do find that quite annoying if I want\nto just take the headphones with me on a\nrun then maybe take them out and you\nknow be able to turn them off put them\nin the pocket so that's a nice little\nplus point you get there the battery\nlife is also exceptional as it was with\nthe previous models for headphones that\nare this small you get amazing battery\nlife the outlasts most of their peers\nwhether you're using the ANC or not\ncases small enough to carry with you as\nwell and that really bumps the battery\noff to a very high figure and they've\nbeen hitting the marks that Jabra\nsuggests as well like I tend to probably\nhave thec or hearr mode on but they're\nstill lasting you know good long time on\nthe run and for General use as well and\nthen the stuff that has been upgraded a\nlittle bit compared to the previous\nmodel of the Elite 8 active is the sound\nquality and thec so sound quality for me\nwas very good on the previous model of\nheadphones and it remains very good here\nI haven't really noticed a huge upgrade\nthere but I'm sure people will who maybe\nhave a slightly more finely tuned ear\nthan I do but they sound very very good\nfor sure do think thec has received a\nnoticeable little bump if you're going\nto be traveling a lot going on trains\nand planes you that is a benefit but I\nwouldn't say those little upgrades are a\nreason I'd rush out and buy these over\nthe previous model like the original\nElite a active had very good sound\nquality Inc like I really enjoyed using\nthem all the time as well you know a\nlittle bump up is no bad thing but I\nwouldn't say it's it's a huge upgrade\nthat's can massively change your life\nbut like I said if you're a bit more of\nan audio file than me you might really\nappreciate that little bump you get\nthere the hearr mode remains excellent\nas well I think that's one that's worth\nflagging up in the run test here is lots\nof headphones have these transparency\nmodes I think this Jabra mode and the\none on the Apple airpods Pro are the\nones that I really find are good on the\nRun As in that you can hear stuff around\nyou quite clearly it doesn't just become\nlike a wind mode where just you know get\nnoise as you're running along you can\nactually filter that out and still hear\nwhat's going on whilst keeping your\nheadphones in your rears like it's not\nthe same level of awareness that you get\nfrom open buds or even open fit\nheadphones like the airpods 4 but know\nit is a really handy feature as a runner\nif you'd rather not just take both\nheadphones out so you can still hear\nyour surroundings whilst listening to\nmusic or podcasts so let's have a look\nat the run test and starting with the\ncase well this is nice and Compact and\nrunning belt friendly I think overall\nthere's a comprehensive Suite of\nadditional features to these two active\nnoise cancellation he through find my\nbuds I love the duw simultaneous\nconnections that make it really easy to\nswitch between phone and laptop they\nwork really well I've come in from runs\nsort of onto calls quite a lot so that's\na really easy thing to do and in my test\nwhen it came to battery life it's solid\n90 minutes running with ANC on burned\n30% 90 minutes running withc turned off\nburn 10% that's with the volume up\npretty high on both I listen really loud\nthey'll cope with Marathon easily and\nsingle day Ultras with the case regular\ntopups with a quick charge feature also\nreally alleviate the need to charge them\nfully and when you factor in the kind of\ncase most Runners are likely to get\nthrough a month running an hour a day or\nso on a single charge with these or at\nleast with very minimal charging which\nis it's a good on battery life now inar\nheadphones tend to be okay for me and I\nfind the jabas fit nice and reliable 99%\nof the time occasionally I have to\nfiddle a bit once I start moving just to\nensure that I've got them kind of more\nfirmly and securely in place but I think\nthe fit really benefits from how light\nand compact the buds are I don't get any\ntug like you can with some heavier\nbulkier buds that sort of move\nthemselves out of your rears over time\nand running it flat on flat at any Pace\nwas fine with me however I wouldn't 100%\nback them to stay put on got a big\nimpact sort of steep descent or\ndownhills trails and that kind of stuff\nnow I don't tend to fiddle with my\nheadphones that much once I'm running I\nusually stick a playlist on pop the buds\nin and then I'll just start running but\nthe controls when you need to use them\non the elite a active to are nice and\nsimple the presses are nicely responsive\nyou don't have to jab too much which\nhelps with that kind of fit security I\nalso like that you can customize many of\nthe controls in the app and I like that\nkind of single tap Spotify feature that\nautomatically plays your most recent\ntrack it's a nice welcome touch now I'm\nquite easily satisfied when it comes to\nsound I Like it Loud Rich Bassy with\nplenty of energy and I think the jabber\na active to tick those boxes like they\ndid with the first gen of these uh\nthere's good depth to the sound I think\nit's full and Rich with a decent amount\nof subtlety to it at least for my sort\nof slightly simplistic non-audio file is\nis it's got great top volume plenty of\nbass if you want it I don't get any\nDistortion at the top levels and I love\nthe fact you can flick between presets\nor create your own custom sound profiles\nfor different settings like in the gym\non a treadmill versus being outdoors\ncool quality on the Run was good for me\non the odd occasion that I took a call\nall the people I tested this with said I\ncame across loud and clear with no\ncutouts and importantly with limited\nwind interference now one of those extra\nsort of boosted sound profiles the\nactive noise cancellation and that I\ndon't personally use ANC or the\ntransparency modes that much on the Run\nmostly I'll fire it up in a shared\nworking space cafes that kind of thing\nand for me it's pretty effective for\nfiltering out the general hubub works\nwell on public transport too if you're a\nuser of awareness modes the wind\nfiltering is now pretty good on these\nimproved for the last generation samees\nhere as well and overall the buds do\neverything better in the sound\ndepartment for this upgraded generation\nbut I didn't find the difference was\nthat staggering on the sound that I'd\nreally pay the extra for those upgrades\nI'm kind of happy with the last gen\nperformance some people might find the\nsubtleties worthwhile but I pretty happy\nwith what the last gen\ndid verdict I do think it's a real shame\nthat Jabra are discontinuing this kind\nof headphone I think they will be\nsupported going forward so I think you\ncan buy without worrying about it too\nmuch but it's a shame because I do think\nthey do make the best workout and\nrunning headphones with this range like\nthese are the in buds that I found the\nbest for running and other times of\nworkouts consistently across the past\nfew years the top active model in\njabra's range is generally the best\nrunning headphones I think if you're\nlooking for that crossover of really\ngood sounding headphones that have\nusable controls great battery life\nreally good ANC and transparency modes\nlike really good sound qus you can use\nthem for General use but they also stay\nin place reliably on the run you feel\ngood on the Run are easy to use on the\nrun and that's exactly what the elite a\nactive Gen 2 are they you know they're\nfantastic all round headphones so you\ngot a lot of similar qualities actually\nto something like the Apple airpods 2o\nbut that fit is what really sets them\napart for me like as someone who like I\nsaid who struggles with in a headphones\na lot of the time the elite a actives\njust stay in place and that's not the\ncase with the airpods and lots of other\nsmaller in a buds like that so that\nmeans they're quite comfortable because\nI don't have to wear a wing with them\nhowever I don't think they're a huge\nupgrade on the previous model of these\nand in general that's always I think the\nthing that undercuts the top models in\njabra's range is they do have an\nextensive range of headphones there\nElite 4 Active there's even the Elite 3\nand even if they're not necessarily\nactive headphones they do tend to have a\nvery good fit I think Jabra headphones\nfor running and they have a lot of\nsimilar features across the board you're\ngetting an upgrade as you go up the\nrange certainly in terms of things like\nsound quality and ANC and this is the\nPinnacle of jabra's range in that sense\nbut I think it's pretty close between\nthese and the previous model which if\nyou're going to find them in a sale or\nthey're just cheaper at their standard\nprice I'd probably look at that myself\nlike if you're someone who travels an\nawful lot and are very very keen on\nsound quality then yeah make maybe make\nthe upgrade to the new ones because the\nextrac will help on traveling and you\nmight notice more of a bump and sound\nquality than I did but I think the\noriginal Elite 8 actives are amazing\nheadphones and you could definitely look\nat those then the Elite 4 Active if\nyou're just looking for a really solid\nset of headphones that can do everything\npretty well they're now going you know\nfor really low prices in sales and they\nare still excellent headphones like they\ndon't have the same ARR features there\nor as good sound orc as you're getting\nhere but everything's pretty much\npassable on there and you still get a\nreally good fit pretty good battery life\na nice small compact set of headphones\nthat are great for running as well as\ngeneral use and they're coming in a lot\ncheaper so yeah probably the main\ncompetition here is jabra's other buds\nwhich are such good value but these are\nthe best ones Jabra has made and I'm\nsure they'll be a regular feature in\nsales themselves as Jabra kind of winds\ndown this consumer side of its business\nand you're going to get a really good\nset of headphones for running and\ngeneral use if you do find them at a\ngood price verd it then well I'm a fan\nof jabra's running headphones they tend\nto offer good quality and value so it's\nsad to see them exit this space and I\nthink the active 82 build on what's gone\nbefore will be it for me in my use case\nin a small way if you're looking for\ngood fit solid sound big battery life\nthe a active 2 offers that all round\npackage that you got with the last gen\nthere's balanced sound that packs plenty\nof top volume punch with clear Rich deep\nand nuanced audio that's easy to tweak\nand tune and get personal sound profiles\nsort of tailored in in the app I found\nthe fit secure thanks to a nice compact\ndesign the controls are easy to to use\nnicely responsive the customization is\ngreat the active noise cancellation\nbattery life is pretty competitive with\n8 hours on the buds that's plenty enough\non the buds for a marathon rising to an\nultra now throwing good durability and a\nfeature app and I love what these kind\nof offer all around however that's also\ntrue I think of the previous generation\nso if you can find the active 8 for\ncheaper I think they're as good for\nrunning basically the jabber Le a active\n2 offers a fantastic all round package\nfor the price but I think you can get it\nslightly better on the cheaper ones so\nmight take on the jabber Elite active\nGen 2 is that these are like gen one\nfantastic truly wise airbuds for running\nand if you are looking for a set of\nairbuds that really Excel for\nnon-running uses but really kind of\ndeliver on the running front as well\nthen there's very few better airbuds\nthan the jab a active Gen 2 now in terms\nof being an upgrade from gen one there's\nnot a huge amount here really the you\nknow core things here like design and\nfit Sound Performance battery life\nperformance are identical and it really\nkind of does boil down to whether you\nwant that smart case and that support\nfor that kind of spatial sound if you're\nthe kind of person that likes to kind of\nyou know run a lot in the gym and likes\nto be distracted by films and TV shows\nif you don't then I wouldn't be\nupgrading to Gen 2 and I think you know\nsome of the promised sound you know\nperformance upgrades don't really kind\nof ring true for me on the Gen 2\ncompared to gen one so you look at the\nother options that are available outside\nof jabra's range and I'm really talking\ntalking about things that I think work\nkind of in those kind of as I said\nnon-running kind of scenarios but also\nrunning scenarios and I think you're\nlooking at things like the Apple airpods\nPro 2 you are looking at things like the\nBeats fit Pro you're looking at things\nlike the Bose Ultra open earbuds as well\nwhich with starting with the bows they\nare you know they're pretty expensive\nairbuds they use that kind of open a\napproach slightly kind of more unique\ndesign now those sound great I think the\nfit in general is fine but I when I've\nrace with them or to raise them I found\nthe fit more problematic and using\ncontrols more problematic as well when\nI've been running I think you look at\nthe Beats fit Pro I think sounds are is\ngreat on those I think what I found with\nthe beat fit Pro is that the fit has\nbeen uncomfortable over longer runs and\nit's been a lot more reliable with the\nJabra airbud in comparison the Apple\nairpods Pro 2 I think sound fantastic\nthe active noise canellation is more\nimpressive on the Apple airbuds compared\nto the jabas but I think in terms terms\nof you know having a more reliable fit\nfor more people the jabber is probably\ngoing to work a lot better I think if\nyou look at the price ranges they're all\npretty expensive airbuds but if you kind\nof look on the kind of Jabra side of\nthings things are dropping in price now\nJabra is going to kind of step out of\nthe consumer airphone uh business so\nwhile you know they're not going to kill\nsupport straight away you know further\ndown the line this is something they're\ncommitting to making more of but I think\nI think you're going to be fine getting\nthem now you know IB comfortable kind of\nstill picking them up you're still going\nto deliver and still be usable for a\nlong time and think you know if you are\nlooking as I said for a good set of\ntruly wise airbuds that kind of work\nwell when you're not running and really\ncome alive really deliver on the running\nfront then these are some of the best\nand if not the best that you can buy so\nthere you have it that's been our review\nof the Jabra Elite 8 active

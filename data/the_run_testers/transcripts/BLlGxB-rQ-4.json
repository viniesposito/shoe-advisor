  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name is\nNick in this video I'm going through my\nfive favorite new running shoes of 2024\nthis is a series we do on the channel\nwhere we each pick out our favorite\nshoes because we all have individual\npreferences and sometimes our favorite\nshoes aren't necessarily the ones that\nwould win our Awards or even be top\npicks in our best roundups they ones\nthat we just happen to really enjoy\nrunning so we get a chance to flag those\nup in these videos so there aren any\nrules here like I don't have to try and\nbuild a sensible rotation and that is\nimportant cuz I've not built a sensible\nrotation and you can spend any kind of\nmoney it's just that their Road shoes\nand they came out this year that's the\nonly kind of real rules we have here in\ngeneral my favorite kind of shoes that I\nreally have a lot of affection for are\nfar shoes whether that's carbon plate\nracing shoes or super trainers that you\nknow you can do a bit of everything in\nthose are predominantly the shoes that I\nhave in my top five like I say I'm not\nbuilding a sensible rotation they're\njust the kind of shoes I love the most\nand I think about the most compared to\nsome like s Huracan 24 a shoe I'd love a\nshoe I'd put in my rotation I'd\nrecommend buying but it's not one of my\nfavorite shoes of 2024 it's just you\nknow big comfortable shoe I cruise\naround easy runs in I want something\nthat has a bit of Verve to it and all of\nmy shoes certainly have a bit of Verve\nthis year in general I've done two big\nmarathon training blocks I didn't\nactually get to run the second Marathon\nbecause I twisted my ankle but that's\npredominately what I've done with my\ntime so all of these shoes have a place\nin that kind of training like in\nparticular doing lots of long hard\nworkouts that kind of thing and\nobviously racing as well so bearing all\nthat in mind and in particular bearing\nin mind that I might well be picking out\nshoes I probably wouldn't recommend you\nrush out and buy my first pick is the\nhoker cello X1 this is the shoe I've run\nthe most miles in in 2024 because I love\nrunning in it I find it just the perfect\nshoe for my marathon training doing lots\nof really hard sessions you know\nprotecting the legs bouncing back doing\nanother hard session a few days later\nand I have RAC in it as well I think\nI've done about 320k in the shoe and it\nstill feels really bouncy I think it's a\nvery durable shoe as well which is a\nbonus I think it is a little too heavy\nto be a top tier racing shoe and it has\ngot a very high price tag which is why\nI'm not necessarily going to say rush\nout and buy this shoe hoker already have\nthe second version in the works coming\nearly next year I think which is going\nto be a fair bit lighter so lots of\nstuff point to the fact that this isn't\nnecessarily a shoe that meets its price\ntag but at the same time you I got it\ninto test and I've just kept running in\nit and I did so much running head of the\nLondon marathon where I set my PB and\nI've done loads of running it recently\nhead of Valencia marathon where I didn't\nrun at all and I think it's a fantastic\nshoe and one that I love so that's why I\npicked it out here you've got this big\nstack of hogus pea foam which delivers a\nreally bouncy and comfortable ride and\nunlike the rocket X2 which I think is an\nexcellent carbon plate racing shoe I\nfound that the cell feels great\nthroughout a long run or a long hard run\nit gets lots and lots of Bounce all the\nway through whereas the rocket X2\nsometimes just doesn't feel quite as you\nknow explosive at the end of those runs\nso I do think it's an amazing carbon\nshoe for longer\nraces and also lots of training I think\nhe certainly is good enough to race in\nit's just I prefer other models but it\ndefinitely merits a place in my top five\nlike I say it's a shoe I've done the\nmost running in this year because I love\nthe way it feels so much so definitely\nhad to include it it's the Hocus yellow\nX1 my second pick is my actual favorite\nracing shoe and the one I have\nrecommended in multiple videos you've\nall seen it a lot on the channel if you\ndo watch it is the aex metas speed Sky\nParis this is my favorite racing shoe of\nall time I've run my Marathon PB in this\nyear of 227 I run my half marathon PB\nthe first time I've gone sub 70 even run\na park Ron PB in the shoe as well even\nif it wasn't my my actual 5K PB and it's\njust perfect for me it's very indicative\nof the way I think Super Shoes are going\nto go which is that they're going to be\nreally lightweight while still having a\nfull stack of foam Under Foot still\ngiving you all that bounce and repulsion\nbut this now comes in at around 190 G in\nmy UK size 9 obviously the addas proo\none kind of spearheaded this charge of\nlightness but it's not a u tested and I\nthink it's still pretty hard to get hold\nof in general the Met speed Sky Paris\nlike I say it was comfortable all the\nway through that Marathon I did in\nLondon it's got plenty of pop off the\nfor foot more so than the edge Paris\nwhich is the other shoe that you could\ncompare it to in the aex range I prefer\nthe sky Paris myself and as a high\nCadence Runner you quite Shuffle stride\njust find the lightness and the pop and\nthe way it feels very easy to get kind\nof life out of the plate in the shoe\njust makes it really good for racing I\nfeel really good at the back end of\nraces in it and at the start of them\nit's also pretty comfortable and\nprotective maybe not quite so much as\nthe C X1 if you can do loads of training\nbut this feels much more like a shoe\nthat you'd be saving for race day\ndurability is a bit of concern with the\nstrips of rubber not going all the way\nback at the hill the the pair I've used\nmost I've done about 250k in does have\nsome you know kind of cosmetic wear and\ntear there but the performance is\ncertainly still there yeah 100% was\nalways going to make my list this shoe\nis my favorite racing shoe met speed Sky\nParis okay for my third pick we're going\nback to Hoka we're going for the Hoka\nMac X2 this is my favorite super trainer\nI wasn't really a big fan at all of the\noriginal Hoka Mac X I just found it an\nokay training shoe one that wasn't that\nLively or that much more verstile than a\nstandard training shoe but the Mac X2 is\na proper super trainer hoker beefed up\nthe stack made the shoe lighter gave it\na very racy upper more on which later\nmore people F in the mid sole it now has\na really bouncy ride it feels very f you\nput it on although you can throttle back\nand run easy in this shoe I do find it a\nvery versatile shoe myself and I've done\nlots of really hard training like you\nknow when I wasn't using cell X1 I was\nprobably using the Mac X2 or another\nsuper trainer for those hard sessions\nduring marathon training this obviously\nis a fair bit cheaper than cell X1 was\ndelivering you know some of that fun and\nbouncy ride and do think it is fast\nenough to also stand in for a carbon\nplate racing shoe if you don't want to\nspend big money on something like the\nclo I do think it's a really good and\nfar shoe whilst also having the extra\nversatility for easy runs as well I've\ndone some very easy stuff in the shoe\ntook it out on holiday as well and\nreally like using it for a bit of\neverything drawback is certainly the\nupper for some people so reason I love\nthis shoe so much and it probably is my\nfavorite overall new shoe of the year is\nthat I don't have any trouble with the\nupper it fits me well but the heel is a\nbit sparse and thin and it has you know\ngot a reputation for rubbing people and\ncutting their Achilles so that can\nhappen but if it doesn't you're getting\nan amazing all round shoe that can do\nreally every kind of run but a really\nfast super Tru I think it's the fastest\nsuper trainer which is important for me\nif I'm going to use that kind of shoe\nfor lots of really hard sessions instead\nof a carbon shoe but it does have that\nfirst ility as well I think the hoko Mac\nX3 is going to be a similar shoe with a\nredesigned heel so that'll probably be\nmore or less perfect we're going to see\nthat shoe next year but the Mac X2\ncertainly one of my favorites of this\nyear next up we have a late and\nunexpected I think it's fair to say\naddition to my top five I didn't expect\nto like the shoe this much it's the Nike\nzoomfly six I said I didn't expect to\nbecause the last two models of the shoe\njust have really not Flo my boat they\njust been big heavy shoes that don't\nfeel fast don't feel that enjoyable for\neasy runs even and were fairly expensive\nwhereas the zoom 6 is a proper super\ntrainer like it's a shoe where Nike made\na lot of the changes people are asking\nfor with the line you've got more zoomx\nfoam in there it is now the Fresh zoomx\nFoam rather than the Recycled stuff used\nin previous models shoes a lot lighter\nthan the previous model it's got a\nhigher stack it's you know slightly more\nrocket to me it feels a little bit more\nsmooth in transition and in general\nyou're now getting a super trainer that\nis a worthy addition to the range that\nyou know you can use alongside Top Class\nraces like the Nike alphafly or the\nvaporfly so sh I used a lot at the back\nend of marathon training I put about 112\n115k on it over a couple of weeks I did\nlike 70k in it in 4 days across three\nones really hard runs and I just think\nit's been amazing like I've done you\nknow mile reps down the track done a\nsteady long run where I went through a\nhalf marathon about 115 and it just\nfeels really good around and I think\nwhat makes it stand out for me compared\nto like the Mac X2 which I do think is a\nfaster shoe the zoomfly is a really\ncomfortable super trainer so you've got\na lot of speed here you can do hard runs\nand you go and do hard sessions it's not\nquite as fast as the macx for really\nhard sessions or if you're looking at\nshorter races or something but it is a\nlot more comfortable not just for the\nheel design in general the upper is\nreally accommodating and it makes the\nshoe very nice to on for easy runs you\nreally notice if you do a session in\nsomething like the zoomfly compared to\nsomething like the macx whereas you know\nthe session feels great as you'd expect\nfrom a super trainer but the warm-ups\nand cool downs and the zoomfly are\nreally comfortable it feels very easy to\nrun slowly and you know relaxed in the\nshoe which isn't always the case with\nsome of the faster super trainers so so\ncertainly one I look forward to using a\nlot more next year as well the zoom F 6\nmakes my list this year as one of the\ntop new super trainers and a massive\nreturn to form for a shoe line that been\npretty underwhelming for the last couple\nof years so it's fair to say up until\nthis point the four shoes I've got in my\ntop five were all locks they were all\nvery easy picks for me ones that\ndefinitely stood out even more than some\nof the other shoes I've left out here\nbut the fifth one was very hard to me\nthere were lots of shoes I could have\ngone for here like you know it's not\nsuing indin speed 4 and pum velocity\nNitro 3 are just extensions of shoe\nlines that I really loved and still\ncontinue to really love and HX 6 would\nhave had a really good case if I'd not\nalready picked two other Hoka shoes can\nhave three in and there's the atic super\nBlast 2 which I've not picked and I know\npeople will be annoyed by that but I\ndon't tend to get on with it as well as\nother people I just find it a little bit\ntoo boatlike at times like I think it's\nan amazing shoe but it's not made my top\nfive what has made my top five is a new\nbalance Rebel V thought because it's all\nabout like affection I think this top\nfive so I was just thinking about shoes\nand thinking about my gut reaction to\nthem and I have so much affection for\nthe New Balance Rebel line in general\nI've really loved all of the versions\ntoday but the four really hit the spot\nfor me because the previous versions\nknow they were really good at what they\ndid they were quite narrow Nimble shoes\nthey weren't that you know protective\nand that was great but it meant I could\nuse them up to a certain point whereas\nthe rebel V4 is a shoe that I could use\nfor everything it's just got that little\nbit more foam a slightly wide design and\nit just means it's more comfortable for\nlong run so enjoy doing long run in the\nshoe but it's still really lightweight\nfor what is you still a pretty chunky\nshoe it's really lightweight shoe I've\ngone down the track in it it's a shoe\nthat basically just lets you go out and\nrun you can do whatever you want in the\nshoe it's not giving you a load of\nassistance like the other shoes I've\npicked with plates and massive stacks of\nvery bouncy Foams it just feels good\nUnder Foot and it just gets out the way\nso you can go do a really easy run in it\nyou can go and do a hard long run you\ncan go and do reps to the track you can\neven race in it like I would choose the\nother shoes for racing obviously but it\nis just a shoe that I think the\nSimplicity really appeals to me I like\nthe way it looks I like all the\ncolorways of it especially the white and\nteal one which I think gives it some\nvalue as kind of a holiday shoe as well\nand it's really good value which you\nknow it's not something I've that fast\nabout when I'm picking this top five but\nit just all helps to create the image of\nthe shoe in my mind where I really like\nit and that's why it's made my top five\nahead of some of those other shoes other\nones I probably want to shout out to be\nfair are things like the aex NOA boss 5\nwhich you might have made it in if we'\nhad it a bit earlier for testing I'm\njust finishing off testing now but I\nthink it probably wouldn't have cracked\nthe top five but a very good shoe the on\ncloud boom Striker less is amazing one\nof my favorite races but you know I've\ndone more enjoyable and more runs in the\naex and the hoker this year and there\nauna n Vista great shoe Puma devi8 Nitro\nElite 3 amazing you racing shoe but yeah\nthose are my top five I say four\nabsolute locks the rebel gets in just\npurely in the bases of a shoe I just\nreally like and I do think it's one I\nwould recommend to lots of people as\nwell because it is good value and can do\nso many types of run very well at a much\nlower price than lots of the big super\ntrainers out that you are looking at\nlike the super blast or the New Balance\nballos so yeah Rebel rounds out my top\nfive C yellow metp Paris Mac X2 Zoom 6\nRebel V4 what a year for shoes very have\ngot to test all of them and love so many\nof them and hopefully it be just as good\n2025",

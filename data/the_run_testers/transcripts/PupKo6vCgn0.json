  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name\nis Nick in this video I'm going to be\ncomparing the Nike zoomfly 6 which is\nnot this shoe it's this shoe and the New\nBalance SC Trainer V3 which is this\n[Music]\nshoe so the Nike zoomfly 6 and the New\nBalance SC Trainer V3 are both plated\ntraining shoes or super trainers they're\ndesigned to be partner shoes to the top\nRacing shoes in the new balance and Nike\nranges or shoes can indeed stand in for\nRacing shoes whilst also being very\nversatile daily trainers as well zoomfly\nis the cheaper shoe especially in the UK\nit's 155 or $170 whereas the SC Trainer\nV3 is $180 in the US and a pretty wild\n\u00a3230 in the UK the zoomfly 6 is the\nlighter shoe is 266 G or 9.4 o whereas\nthe New Balance SC Trainer V3 is 278 G\nor 9.8 o the Nike has an 8 mm drop and a\nstack height of 42 mm at the heel 34 at\nthe 4T and New Balance has a 6 mm drop\nand a stack height of 40 mm at the heel\nand 34 mm at the forefoot comes to the\ndesign of the shoes with a Nike you've\ngot a two-layer woven mesh uper quite a\nbit of padding around the heel of the\ncollar of the shoe there and a fairly\nsignificant internal heel counter as\nwell to add some support you have a dual\ndensity midsole the top layer is Nike's\nbouncy zumax foam which is you the best\nfoam in its range the stuff using its\nRacing shoes and then you have an sr2\ncarrier Pham beneath that to add a\nslightly more durable and stable\nmaterial beneath the zoomx and then\nbetween those two B you've got a full\nlength carbon plate and then you have a\nwaffled tread out soole good coverage on\nthe foref foot little bit at the heel\nthere as well and a big cutout in the\nmiddle that reduces the weight and shows\noff the carbon plate and then with the\nNew Balance you've got a phantom fit\nengineered mesh upper and then you've\ngot a fuel cell midso which is all made\nfrom the same material it's not a dual\ndensity Mell or anything like that it is\nthe 20% peber 80% Eva blend of fuel cell\nI believe you balance tweaks the makeup\nof fuel cell quite a lot so it's Racing\nshoes it's full peber and that kind of\nthing but it's still a pretty light\nweight and bouncy foam you've got a\ncarbon plate that's forked under the for\nfoot to reduce a little bit of weight\nthere like the Nike you've got a big\ncutout on the bottom of the shoe that\nshows off the carbon plate and brings\nthe weight down and then similar rubber\ncoverage to the Nike shoe as well with\ngood for foot coverage couple of strips\nat the back there so all the key impact\nareas are covered and both shoes have\nbeen pretty good for me in terms of grip\nand I've seen no signs of wear and tear\non that out soole after over 100k of use\nin\n[Music]\nboth come to the fit of the two shoes\nI've got a uk9 in both shoes which is my\nnormal size with a Nike that's a US1 and\nthat's the size I've used across Nike\nshoes for many years got no concerns at\nall with the fit of the Nike zoomly 6\nreally comfortable shoe it's maybe a\nlittle bit closer around the toe than\nsome of Nike's more cushioned training\nshoes but I've got enough room there for\nlong runs and yeah all around a really\ncomfortable fit with a new balance it's\na US 9.5 so it is a little bit smaller\nin than the Nike in terms of us sizing\nand I think you do have a little bit\nless room around the toes as a result\nbut the fit is still really good for me\ngot less padding around the back of the\nshoe but it's still comfortable there\nholds the foot well I've not had any he\nheel rub which has been a problem on\nsome New Balance shoes that have\nlaunched this year and overall the fit's\nbeen pretty comfortable even if the Nike\nI think has a slightly more\naccommodating and you know padded upper\nfor daily\n[Music]\ntraining onto run test then and these\nare both shoes that I've enjoyed using a\nlot during my marathon training in\nparticular for the Valencia Marathon\nwhich I didn't end up running but I did\na lot of training for and these two\nshoes were really enjoyable for it after\nover 100k in each of them because they\nare ideal for kind of longer sessions\neasy to steady long runs progression\nruns that kind of thing they really tick\noff all those runs really well and I\nthink they do pretty much an equally\ngood job of it they're both fantastic\nshoes that have a really nice relaxed\nside to them so they feel comfortable at\neasier paces and on long runs but they\ndo have a lot of pace there if you do\nstart to push the pace in them which you\nneed to in those long sessions so they\nNew Balance with the shoe I tested first\nand it was a pleasant surprise actually\nI wasn't a huge fan of the first two\nversions of the shoe the first one was\njust bit too big it was bouncy but it\nwas just a bit too big I think to really\nenjoy for anything fast at all and then\nthe second version was a bit lifeless\nand I do really like the foam in this\nthird version of the shoe I think it has\na nice responsive Edge whil it's being\ncomfortable obviously it's not a full\npeber midsole and stuff like that and\nyou can get hung up on the details a bit\ntoo much I think because just based on\nhow it feels it feels really nice on the\nrun you do get a nice bit of energy\nreturn when you are going to run faster\nbut it is also a very comfortable shoe\nfor more relaxed runs I did do you know\nseveral sessions in the shoe including\nlike sessions on Double Days and I think\nit excels up until about my marathon\npace so I think the fastest session I\ndid was probably something like 10 * 1K\nat around marathon pace and it you know\nfeels really good for that I did a four\ntime 4K session in it as well and a 15 M\nprogression run and all those runs felt\nreally good once you push past to kind\nof faster race Paces you know Flatout\nefforts doesn't feel as Lively and\nNimble and as exciting as some of the\nshoes on the market and that's actually\nthe case to be fair with the Nike as\nwell but I do think it's probably got a\nlittle bit more punch and push when you\nare at those fast Paces just like the\nNew Balance I found the Nike and a\nreally big step up on past versions of\nthe shoe like the last two couple of\nzoomfly shoes I think have been really\nheavy and just not at all what I'd\nconsider a super trainer they were kind\nof you fairly okay easy and Long Run\nshoes but you know you're paying a lot\nof money for a shoe that didn't really\ndo much when it came to trying to run\nfast and the new version is a fast shoe\nI've done similar sessions actually to\nthe New Balance but I've probably pushed\nthe Nike a bit harder and done some\nfaster sessions did a 10 times one mile\nin it I've done a hard 45 minute\nprogression run you know pretty solid\nsteady 15 Mile as well and just have\nreally enjoyed it at all times you have\nthat really comfortable upper and\nrelaxed feel underf foot at easy Paces\nyou really notice actually when warming\nup and coing down in this shoe but then\nit has the punch and the propulsion\nyou're looking for when it comes to\nthose far sessions in between those\nwarm-ups and cool downs and fast\nsessions in general again I think it\nexcels right up to those Marathon paced\nefforts and sessions when you start to\nlook at faster sessions there are super\ntrainers I'd rather be in things like\nthe hok max to the Endorphin speed 4 but\nyou can do them in a Nike and you can to\nbe fair also do them in New Balance they\nthey're bigger shoes they feel Cruiser\nthey don't really feel like super\naggressive shoes for those fast sessions\nbut you know you can run fast in them\nthey are good enough for those sessions\nand then they have that really nice\ncomfortable feel that cruisy feel when\nyou're not going flat out and want a\nshoe to kind of run at controlled paces\nand longer session or just run easy in\nfact also I'd say that both have felt\npretty stable to me you know for high\nstack shoes with soft Foams in them and\nthat kind of thing I haven't really had\nany concerns about stability when\nrunning on of you know standard\nPavements with things like cambers and\nbroken up bits and stuff like that so\nthat's a plus point I think for both\nshoes because they've achieved that\nstability without going for a really\nheavy design with a really wide base or\nanything like that so yeah all round\njust really good shoes you can use for a\nmix of everything did do a short run\nwhere both shes at the same time the\nNike did feel a little bit softer than\nNew Balance for me especially at the\nheel I also think you get a slightly\nmore punch feel from it when you come\noff the toes you think the plate in the\nshoe maybe just delivers a little bit\nmore punch off the toes and you get from\nthe balance but it is pretty close to\ncall all around also has that really\nnice padded upper which it's not\nsomething I really look out for in super\ntrainers and that kind of thing as long\nas it's comfortable enough then that's\nfine but this is a shoe a super trainer\nthat excels on Comfort the balance is\ncomfortable but actually the Nike does\nfeel very good to slip on each and every\nday for daily training when I was\nrunning aoes at the same time I did also\nnoticed that the extra foam you get in\nthe New Balance under the for foot there\nso like I said I think you get a little\nbit more kind of lift and push from the\nNike when you roll through onto that 4\nfoot but does feel like a more cushion\nshoe under the 4 foot than you balance\nno problems with discomfort on the Nike\non longer runs I think there is enough\ncushioning there but your balance\nprobably just has that little bit more\nyou know Comfort under the for foot with\nthe extra foam you have there the\nslightly lower drop think the Nike rolls\nyou through a little bit more\naggressively onto the forefoot which is\ngood as long as it doesn't end up being\nuncomfortable it doesn't for me with the\nNike but you probably get a slightly\nmore cruisy roll through with the new\nbalance and maybe that will be more\ncomfortable for some\n[Music]\npeople it comes to the verdict I think\nthe Nike Z 6 and the New Balance SC\nTrainer V3 do a similar job and they do\nit very well they are very versatile\ndaily trainers that really Excel on the\ncomfortable side of things and still\nhave a lot of speed you not maybe as\nmuch speed as things like the hok X2 and\nthe Sak endorphin speed 4 but you have\nmore comfortable shoes here in terms of\nthe upper and the underfoot feel and the\nkind of more relaxed Vibe they have when\nit comes to easy runs daily training\nruns progression runs that kind of thing\nthey they really do work really well for\nit and they still do have pace so I do\nthink they have a similar feel and do a\nsimilar job but I do think the Nike does\nit a bit better I think you get a little\nbit more range from the Nike in terms of\nthe allout speed if I was just picking\none of these shoes to stand in as a\nracing shoe instead of a full you know\nkind of carbon Super Shoe I would pick\nthe Nike I think it has that a little\nbit extra pace for fast workouts as well\nand actually I think it also has a\nslightly more comfortable design in\nterms of the upper for daily training as\nwell so New Balance ticks a lot of boxes\ndoes them all really well but I think\nthe Nike ticks all the same boxes and\nactually I think it does all of those\nboxes just that little bit better so I\nprefer all around for sure the price is\nalso a big factor especially in the UK\nin the UK this isn't really a contest\ncuz New Balance has got a silly price\nbut you know even if it came down in\nprice to the same price as the Nike I'd\nbe picking the Nike in the US the price\nis closer but yeah I still do prefer the\nfeel of the Nike Zoom fly 6 underfoot\nnot writing off new balance is a bad\nshoe at all I really liked running in it\nbut I think the Nike just does the same\nkind of stuff a little bit better and\nit's the one I'd pick out of this pair\nfor\n[Music]\nsure that's our comparison of the Nike\nZoom fly 6 and the New Balance SC\nTrainer V3 let us know what you think in\nthe comments below how have you found\nthe super trainers that have come out\nthis year have you tested a few of them\nis there any that you've really\npreferred out of the main ones I've\nmentioned here the Nike the New Balance\nthe Hoka max2 the Sak Dophin speed 4\neven the super blast for extending it to\nnon PL to choose but yeah do like and\nsubscribe ring the little bell and we\nwill see you next time on the channel",

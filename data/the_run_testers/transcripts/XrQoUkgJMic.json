  "text": "hey Tomy from the Run testers and this\nis my first run review of the Muno wave\nRebellion Pro 3 Let's Take a\n[Music]\nLook Muno wave Rebellion Pro 3 cost 210\nor $250 it weighs 222 G or 7.8 o for men\nin a size 8 and the drop is 4\nMIM the Muno wave Rebellion Pro 3 is a\nperform shoe designed for runners aiming\nfor faster times over longdistance\nevents the latest version has been\nmodified to be even better for endurance\nevents due to a wider Landing platform\nand the addition of the brand soft and\nbouncy nitrogen infused Muno enery XP\nmid cell phone Muno states that the shoe\nis aimed at Runners looking for a sub\n2.5h hour marathon time thanks to the\ncombination of the new Midol foam along\nwith a smooth speed assist geometry for\nOptimum gate and efficiency and a carbon\ninfused mauno wave plate to provide a\nhigh level of energy return the shoe\nalso features a breathable mesh upper\nand a G3 outsole designed to be\nlightweight but provide a good amount of\ngrip on road surfaces although the stack\nheight of the shoe is measured from the\nheel to the 4 foot there is a much\nthicker stack of the midell foam in the\nmiddle of the\n[Applause]\nshoe so the fit for me in the uh waver\nBion Pro 3 I'm size eight in the UK this\nis a race shoe it's performance shoe\nit's designed for Speed it's designed to\nbe as light as it possibly can and as a\nresult that generally means that you\nhave quite a lean fit on the top that is\nthe case with this shoe it's quite a\nlean shoe there's not a lot of space for\nme in my size eight um in the four foot\nof the shoe um there's Fair bit of space\naround the toe box no issues there but\non the midsection of the shoe um it is\nquite thin uh for me I didn't have any\nissues with it I find it very\ncomfortable on that first run but I\nthink if you do have wider feet or um\nyou might be a little bit over um the uh\nyour size for your feet so I'm a size\npretty average size eight um shoe If\nyou're sort of going over the size eight\na bit you're going to notice that the\nother thing about this shoe is that it's\nvery much like um a high heel shoe it's\nit when you're running in it it's\npushing you forward a bit and I do find\nthat my foot goes further down the shoe\nthan it would in a lot of other shoes\nand as a result you probably are getting\ngetting closer to the the toe section at\nthe end of end of the shoe for me I I in\nthat first run I didn't have a problem\num but there's not a lot of playroom in\nthere so I might suggest going up half a\nsize in this shoe um just to um just to\nget a little bit of extra space in there\num but I'll find out more during the um\nduring the full review but on that first\nrun it was fine but I think um it may\nyou may did a little bit more space in\nthat for foot of the\nshoe okay so the first run I did in the\nshoe was a fart Leck interval session I\nwent out and I did about 11k and I just\ntried lots of different Paces out for\nabout 1 km and that varied quite a bit\nbetween really slow Paces for me which\nabout 530 minute kilm and taking it up\nto about 4 415 which is about my\nmarathon pace I didn't go any faster\nthan that because it's between Christmas\nin New Year and I struggled to find the\nuh motivation to run really fast uh on\nthat first run but um the what I found\non that on that run is that this is a\nreally interesting shoe uh it has this\nnew Muno NZ XP midell phone which is\nbouncier than the previous version of\nthe shoe I was a really big fan of the\nearly version of the shoe the wer\nBellion Pro two I thought it was a\nincredibly fun shoe um but it it wasn't\na shoe that I ever picked up I never\nused it for a marathon because I was a\nlittle bit wary of the lack of stability\nin that shoe and the fact that um it was\nquite aggressive in how it made you run\nso when I run a marathon I really want\nuh a natural feel I like Ury turn like\nbound so like a nice bit of softness but\nI want the ride to feel relatively um\nnatural and comfortable because in those\nlater stages in a very aggressive shoe\nit can be quite hard and in the soc\nDophin Elite which is a very aggressive\nshoe I only went up to half marathon in\nthat shoe and by the end of the half\nmarathon I did find it very very\nuncomfortable there is no way I could\nhave run a marathon in the socon\nEndorphin um Elite now the new version\nof the wave Rebellion Pro the wave reion\nPro 3 um it's very similar to the\nprevious version but it does have this\nnew midle foam in it the Muno nerz XP\nwhich is a little bit softer a little\nbit more energy return in it and it\nfeels a little bit denser as well so\nthat's where that energy return is\ncoming from it's really compressing and\ngiving you a lot of the energy back and\nyou really notice that as soon as you\nstep out the front door in the shoe it\nfeels bouncy straight away um what I\nthink one of the things I think that's\nchanged with this shoe is that the well\none of the main things that's definitely\nchanged is that it has a much wider bait\non it so you'll see that\nthe older version of the shoe is a very\ndifferent outsole to it you have this\nbig cutout section L across the full\nlength of the waiver belly and pro two\nyou don't have that on the Pro 3 you've\njust got a section at the back and um\nthe front section of the shoe is also\nwider so it gives you this wider base to\nland on um the other thing as well I\nthink is that the this heel section you\nhave this cutout section of the heel um\nthat seems to have moved back a little\nbit in this shoe so previously when I\nran in the version two uh I'm a midfoot\nstriker and I was hitting the this sort\nof pointy section or the the section\nwhere the shoe basically the full of the\nshoe where you where you land on it you\nmove forward I was hitting it dead on\nand it was really bouncy but I wasn't\nreally getting loads from it it was a\nfun shoe to run in um and it was it\ndefinitely a shoe that made you run in a\ncertain way um but that shoe unless I\nwas running really fast it wasn't really\ntipping me forward it was sort of making\nme bounce if I was running fast I I was\ntipping over a bit more and and and and\nit was um working really well for that\nthis shoe is designed more for longer\ndistance Runners apparently uh and I\nthink part of that is to do with the\nfact that they've moved the this sort of\nf chrum area further back so as a result\nwhen you when you land on it it sort of\ntips you forward a lot more it's more\nnoticeable in this shoe than it was in\nthe previous version of the shoe so it\nreally is quite aggressive and how it\nmoves you forward um when you're running\nat slower Pace you get a nice bit of\nthat bounce and it rolls you forward\nnicely so when running it my marathon\npace at about 4:15 I can really feel it\ntipping me forward it's quite hard to\nrun slowly in this shoe because it's\ntipping you forward all the time when I\nstarted the run I I was left the house\nand I was just planning on jogging to\nthe place where I normally go and do my\ninterval sessions and um I was strug I I\nwas just getting down to about 4 minute\n40 without even trying um and normally\nI'd probably do it about 5 minute 20 up\nto where I start doing my inal sessions\num and I think that's because of this\ngeometry of the shoe it's really sort of\nrocks you forward um and land you on\nthat that front section and bounces you\nforward it really does make a big\ndifference so it's definitely a shoe\nthat gives you a little bit more in that\nrocker format than the previous version\nof the shoe did which is welcome change\nthe shoe because the fness of the uh\nprevious version of the shoe didn't work\nquite well for me when I was running\nlonger distances at PACE whereas I think\nthis shoe that's the focus of it um it\nis noticeably uh a little bit aggressive\nso for some people that's probably not\ngoing to be uh what you're looking for\nbut if the Mao talk about being a shoe\ndesign for people who want sub 2.5h hour\nmarathons so is a shoe design for Elites\nit's not necessarily a shoe you're going\nto pick up and go and run a you know 30\nminute part running it because it's a\nit's quite a shoe that's not really\ndesigned for that it's very much\ndesigned for for for hitting those\nfaster paces and maintaining that pace\nas you go along but for me at that four\n4 minute 15 Mark which is my marathon\npace it felt really really good um other\nthing I say about this shoot as well is\nthe front section of it which is that\nwider base it is noticeable so when you\nland on that it does feel a little bit\nmore stable on the front of the shoe um\nbut the back section of the shoe\ndefinitely isn't very stable overall the\nshoe isn't even though they've tried to\nmake it a bit more stable it's not a\nvery stable shoe and it's definitely a\nshoe that you have to keep an eye on the\nground with uh if you're not running on\ncompletely flat roads so where I run uh\nthe terrain changes a bit I do a little\nbit around parks and things like that\nand I really have to pay attention to it\nbecause um even though if you landed on\nthe front section of the shoe you might\nbe all right but not many people do that\num and I land sort of on this rear\nsection and it is a bit wobbly it's not\nit's by no means a a stable shoe at the\nback so it's definitely a shoe that\ndespite them trying to make it more\nstable it is not a very stable shoe um\nbut what I would say of that first run\nuh is that it it's fun it definitely\nchanges the ride from the previous\nversion of the shoe and really pops you\nforward a lot more than you would expect\num and I definitely think it's probably\ngoing to be better for longer distance\nsessions because of that more aggressive\num tendency to to pop you forward at\nthose those those Marathon Paces uh and\nI might even use this for um uh from for\nManchester coming up U maybe uh maybe to\nbuy in a couple of weeks but I'm not\nentirely sure if I'm going to do the\nMarathon distance at that yet so yeah\nfirst run in this very very much enjoyed\nit I think it's an improvement on the\nprevious version I like some of the\nchanges that have been made in the shoe\nuh and I definitely think it's more\nconducive to longer distance training um\nwhich is what it's meant to be better at\nbut uh I'll I've still got a lot of\ntesting to do in it and see um if it's a\nshoe that I would actually pick for\nMarathon so my early verdict on the Muno\nwave Rebellion Pro 3 some interesting\nchanges to the shoe I I think it's um\nit's changed the experience of the shoe\nI think it's definitely something that\num is more conducive to running those\nlonger distances pushing you into a\nposition where you're moving forward at\nthose Paces without really picking up\nthe p and going really fast previously\nthe uh first few versions of the shoe I\nreally liked for 5K 10K um but I\nwouldn't have used them for a full\nMarathon just because I didn't get um\njust didn't get the sort of roll through\nthat I want from it I did use the twos\nfor a half marathon found it very fun\nbut I did find it to be a little bit of\nan awkward shoe to wear for that longer\ndistance it didn't really help me in the\nlatter stages because I was it was\nbouncing me but it wasn't really rolling\nme forward I think this is this shoe is\ntrying to trying to fix that and roll\nyou forward um in in throughout the\nwhole course of a marathon or or half\nmarathon so that um it it it's giving\nyou that optimized um efficiency as\nyou're running but it is quite\naggressive so I will do some longer\ndistances in the shoe and see how it\nfeels because I I don't necessarily like\nan aggressive shoe when I'm running\nlonger distances I like a natural feing\nshoe but the changes that have been made\nto the shoe I think are improvements I\nthink that wide base is a good is a\nsmart move\num and I also think that the foam is a\nlittle bit there's a bit more energy to\nit as well um but when it comes to\nstability I still think it's a way off a\nlot of shoes out there so if you're\nlooking for a stable race shoe you\nwouldn't get this because it's it's it's\na way off being stable at the moment\nespecially if you're Landing in the uh\nback section of this shoe that's it from\nme on this first look at the Muno wave\nbellan Pro 3 thanks a lot for watching\ndon't forget to like subscribe click\nthat little bell and if you're going

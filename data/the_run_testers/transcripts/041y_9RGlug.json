  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nand in this video we are putting the aex\nNova blast 5 up against the sakon ride\n17 to help you decide which shoe might\nsuit your running best we're going to\ntease out the differences compare the\nperformance and reveal our personal\nfavorites so let's get into it the aex\nnumber blast 5 versus S ride 17\nhead-to-head key details first then the\naex NOA blast five stack height has 41\n1/2 m in the 4ot 33 1/2 m in the hill\nfor an 8 mil drop the Stony ride 17\ncomes in at 35 m in the hill 27 m in the\nfour also for an 8 mil drop when it\ncomes to weight aex man to shave a\nlittle bit off the overlast five and our\nUK men's 8 and a half It Now tips the\nscales a pretty impressive 8.9 o or 251\nG the S ride 17 weighs in 10.3 o or 293\nG in the same size on price the RP for\nboth shoes is1 135 in the UK and $140 in\nthe US you can find the ride 17 in sales\nunder 100 and under\n$100 now let's give you a quick shoe\ncomparison starting with the midsoles\nthe Nova blast 5 sticks largely to the\nnovablast blueprint with a Max stacked\nmidsole what you've got now is flight\nphone blast Max which is tuned bit\nbounce a bit softi it's got a large\nrocker the ride 17 has a big but not Max\nstack with the LI power on plus phone\nthere's also saky speedroll roering\ngoing on here as well up top the ride 17\nhas engineered meshup as medium padded\nheel collar and a medium padded gusted\ntongue there's also quite a stiff heel\ncounter here and you've got heel pools\nto help you get them on the novablast 5\nhas a more premium jackard mesh up the\ntop that takes styling CES from the\nsuper blast the Nova blast 5 heel colors\nare more padded the gusted tons are\nthinner though with a nicely wrapping\ndesign you've also got heel pools here\nand you've got a little lace Loop which\nhelps flip them over in the ride 17 has\na good covering of outsole rubber for\ngrip and durability in all the right\nplaces an over blast five out soole\nsticks to a relatively standard covering\nof the aex ah low rubber you're not\ngetting that kind of top level grippiest\nah plus that you'll find on the aex\nsuper blast too though but you've got\npretty good coverings here to protect\nthose\nmidols when it comes to fit I ran in a\nUK 8 A2 which is my regular shoe size in\nboth of these and the fit on both of\nthem I find is good it goes sort of true\nto size for me I get good security and\nhold in all the key areas heel midfoot\nno slip no complaints no rubbing the NOA\nblast 5 is considerably roomier in the\ntoe box than the ride 1 but the ride 1\nstill offers ample wiggle room up there\ntoo I like the Airy fit of both shoes\nnow some people have found that the no\nblast 5 is a bit too spacious but I've\ngot wide feet quite high in steps so\nthey sort of fit nicely for me and I\nlike spacing shoes particularly as I've\nused these for longer miles so both I\nwould recommend going true to size so\nthe fit for me in these two shoes uh the\nride 17 is definitely the a bit more on\nthe uh thinner side when it comes to\nshoe width it's fine for me I've got\nfairly average WID feet um but I I think\nthat the ride 17 is probably a little\nbit more restrictive if you've got wider\nfeet not massively I think it's a fairly\naveragely width shoe um but if you\ncompare it to the no blast 5 I think\nthis is a little bit more forgiving in\nthe width of the shoe also a little bit\nlonger as well um but definitely if\nyou're if you're if you're veering more\ntowards the wider side of feet then noas\n5 has probably got a little bit more\ngive it than uh ride 17 um but I will\nstick to my size of both of these shoes\nI'm a size eight in the UK these are\nboth size eight and I found to be very\nvery comfortable didn't have any issues\nin either of them so I still say to my\nsize um but just take that consideration\non the the slightly thinner width of the\nride 17 so it comes the fit of the ride\n17 and the overlast 5 got my normal size\nin both shoes which is a uk9 with both\nof these Brands that's a US 10 and I've\nhad no concerns at all really with the\nfit I've got enough room in the toe box\nthey no blast in particular is quite a\nroom is shoe around the toes and I've\ngot a narrow foot so I've probably got a\nbit too much room in terms of the width\nbut it hasn't been a problem in terms of\nlock down or anything like that good\nhold around the heel and midfoot and\nboth shoes they are padded and\ncomfortable without irritating my\nAchilles or anything like that so yeah\nI'd stick to your normal size with both\nof these shoes I've had no problems with\nthe\nfit now in testing I've run loads of\nmiles in the soc ride 17 it's one of my\ngo-to shoes for my casual run so I use\nit a lot when I'm not testing other\nshoes and when I'm really just looking\nfor reliable comfort for those easy\nmiles I've covered well north of 50 mil\nin the no last five including a full\n4-Hour solo Marathon test it's video on\nthe channel coming soon I've used both\nshoes across the same range of paces and\nterrain covering slow and easy long runs\nright up to faster intervals and\nprogression runs and as usual I've run\nmainly on the tarmac on the asphalt on\nthe road but with some light Offroad too\nto test the stability uh River pars that\nkind of thing into the park sometimes\nnow quick take on both shoes I love the\nride 17 there's excellent disappearing\nComfort a really good ride that balances\ncushioned Landings with a rolling\nresponse and a bit of springy energy for\nme it's one of those shoes that feels\nnatural Straight Out of the Box the\nmoment you put it on it's not a totally\neffortless shoe but it's very easy for\ncovering long miles just clipping along\nwhether you're moving slow and easy or\nyou're pushing things slightly more Up\nTempo it's not super soft it's not super\nenergetic but it's nicely consistent\ngood stability good reliable ride and I\nthink it's pretty good value overall the\nASX NOA blast 5 is a very competent\ndaily trainer too but it has some what\nsort of maybe left me a bit torn it\noffers a nice smooth ride that responds\nwell on toe off and it feels springy but\ncontrolled when you're feeling good\nrunning with good form and pushing the\npace that's when the over blast five I\nthink feels most energetic when you're\nfeeling like you're energetic but it's\nalso cushioned enough to accommodate the\nslower Paces as well super comfort for\neasy casual miles though sometimes on\nheavier legs I find the it can be a bit\nsinky and a bit soggy I've had slow runs\nor at least runs where I felt tired with\nthe softness certainly in a kind of\nslower Pace form makes it feel like the\nshoe is working a little bit against me\nsomewhat that was the case during a\npretty heavy legged Marathon test that I\ndid but even then it still delivered\ncomfort and protection in a reliable\nride that took care of my tired feet and\nlegs deep into that Marathon test and\nthen I've had runs in the nov blast 5\nwhere I'm full of energy running in good\nform really working off the foref foot\nwith the nov blast 5 I think has felt\nmore energetic and you notice that kind\nof bounce that comes through in the foam\nthat's the way the foam sort of tuned\nI've also done a side by side Mile with\nboth of these shoes one on each foot and\nhere is what I found so I've just done a\nsidebyside mile in the novablast 5 on my\nleft foot I've got the S ride 17 on the\nright foot I would use these shoes for\npretty much the same kinds of run they\nactually feel very very similar in terms\nof the softness and the Cushing you're\ngoing to get there's more cushioning in\nthe no blast 5 for sure really sinks a\nbit lower than the ride 17 comes back a\nbit quicker but they're both going to\ntake the edge off those kind of long\neasy slow miles you've also got a little\nbit of a lower stack on the ride 17 so\nthat might be a deciding factor I find\nit a little bit more stable than nov\nblast 5 the no blast 5 isn't an unstable\nshoe for me but the ride 17 is just a\nbit more of a reliable platform to run\noff got a big wide 4ot as well yeah I\nlike both of these shoes actually I\ncould do easy easy miles in them I think\nyou could do uptempo in some of them as\nwell so R 17's been out for a while now\nno blast 5 is a new shoe um R 17 is\nstill a fantastic shoe really really\nsolid daily trainer um almost uh a\nworthy um successor in some ways to the\nTriumph 20 and 21 because now the 22 is\nnot not really the same shoe as those\nthe ride 17 is very similar R to what\nyou're expecting from those sort of\ndaily cushion shoes where you want\ncomfort you want cushioning but you also\nwant to do a bit more you want a bit of\nVersatility uh for a pretty good price\nas well um big fan of the ride 17 um I\nthink it's a solid all round running\nshoe feels quite stable um feels very\ncomfortable to wear but also it just\nfeels like it's got a bit more to it a\nbit of responsiveness to it um and\ndefinitely issue that uh I would take\nwith me if I was going away on holiday\nand I wanted something to do lots of\ndifferent runs in um also has a great\noutsole as well um really solid grip on\nthe outsole and quite sturdy as well no\nsigns of wear te on my ride 17 after\nabout 100K running in it over the past\nyear no blast 5 uh is a shoe that if I\nwas comparing the ride 17 to the no\nblast 4 they're quite similar shoes you\nget a similar experience i' use them for\nsimilar things they've got same sort of\nlevel of responsiveness I'd probably say\nno blast 4 is a little bit little bit\nmore bouncy um than the R 17 but not\nmassively overall they're very\ncomparable shoes those those two and I\nthink they're both very good all around\nof daily shoes that you can use for a\nlot of training um the sit at the same\nsort of price noas F has changed his\nmissile phone to FF blast Max which is\nsofter um which I normally I would\nreally really like um but I think what\nit's done in the nol 5 is it's taking a\nlittle bit of the um responsiveness away\nwith that softness at easy runs it feels\nvery very comfortable absolutely fine no\nissues at all when you're picking up the\npace a bit when you're I've been\nmarathon training for Valencia recently\nA lot of my runs have been really a\nconsistent pace for an hour an hour and\na half uh and when I'm doing those runs\nand I'm trying to maintain close to my\nmarathon time so uh I'm 4 minute 30 4\nminute 40 uh per kilometer what I'm\nlooking for is a shoe that helps me out\na bit and gives me a little bit uh nice\nnice turnover maybe a little bit of\nbounds a little bit of response enough\nso I can just maintain that pace for a\nconsist\nperiod ride 17 would be fine at that it\njust really smoothly just you know you\ncan you can move along nicely and it it\nreally helps you it's nice and nice\nturnover nice bit of responsiveness uh\nno blast 5 if you're if I'm trying to\nrun for a longer period at a pace that\nisn't really really comfortable for me\nwhich is about 430 I'm I'm pushing\nmyself to do that pace doesn't seem to\nbe helping me the midell phone feels a\nlittle bit sluggish um and it doesn't\nquite give me a lot of energy back when\nI'm I'm running at that pace easier\nPaces it's fine I'm not expecting\nit to do anything particularly amazing\nat easy Pace you do get a little bit of\nbounce back from that midell foam um but\nI think when you're running faster you\nprobably putting a little bit more\npressure into that Mido foam um and\nyou're just not getting as much back as\nI'd normally like from a shoe that I'm\ndoing faster training in so no blast 5\nwhereas the no blast 4 was a really good\nallrounder shoe very similar to The Ride\n17 I'd say that no blast 5 is now firmly\nan easy day shoe a comfortable shoe that\nyou take off the miles in but you're not\ngoing to go out and run fast efforts in\nit or use it for inter sessions or\nanything like that um that's not a bad\nthing unless you want versatility uh and\nand a lot of people do want versatility\nthese days that was one of the good\nthings about some of the Nova blast\nversions is that you could use them as\nyour one shoe that you'd buy and you do\nlots of different training sessions in I\ndon't think the no blast 5 is going to\nbe able to do that now I think it's just\na little bit too easy day orientated and\nI think that um it will struggle uh it\nyou'll struggle if you get it and you\nwant to do lots of intervals in because\nit does feel a little bit uh energy\nsapping to me at certain Paces uh the is\nabsolutely fine on it um it's got good\ncovering it's got this trampoline\ninspired outsole which I've never quite\nunderstood what it means but um\nabsolutely fine no issues at all with\nthis um I haven't really been running\nmuch in the wet in it um so I'm not sure\nhow it how it deals with wet ground but\nfor me on most of the surfaces I've run\nit it's been absolutely fine so the ride\n17 and the no blast 5 I think are both\nvery solid daily trainers at a decent\nprice kind of sitting in the middle of\ntheir range of shoes for each of their\nrespective Brands I think they have a\npretty in offensive ride all round\nthey're reasonably versatile but mostly\nquite cushioned and protective I think\nthey'll both work for a nice wide range\nof Runners and I enjoyed running both of\nthem even if neither are very\nspectacular shoes in any way they're not\nreally the most Lively or exciting shoes\nout there but they do a really good job\nand I think both provide pretty good\nvalue as well there is a pretty big\ndifference in the ride field between the\nshoes though and that mostly comes down\nto the foam in the midsole they've got\nslightly different geometries as well I\nthink You' got a slightly more smooth\nRocket Ride on the ax nose blast 5 but\nreally it's difference in the Foams here\num with the rides 17 I think you've got\na firmer denser material with this power\nrun plus foam you know it's pretty\ncomfortable but it's not redesigned to\nbe squishy and soft or anything like\nthat it certainly provides enough\nComfort but it's got a good level of\nresiliency so as you roll through you\nget a little bit of responsiveness off\nthe forefoot and you know it is quite a\nverstile foam around I think it is just\nquite dense and heavy though is the way\nI feel about it so although I like the\nshoe and I like this foam I think it's\njust not perfect for me I'm quite a high\nCadence Runner I'm not the heaviest\nrunner in the world and I think\nsometimes I don't really sink it enough\ninto this phone to get a lot of rebound\nout of it because it is quite dense like\nI said whereas no blast 5 I found the\nfoam on the new shoe to be really nice\nlike certainly got a softer ride than\nthe ride 17 you're sinking a bit more\nbut I haven't any problems with it\nfeeling mushy or anything like that it's\nbounced back nicely for me and I have\nfound it quite a nice spritely ride a\nshoe I've enjoyed using quite a lot I\nknow the other guys have found it not\nthat verstile and a bit too mushy and\nsoft but I think it's got a good level\nof softness actually it's comfortable at\nthe back there and then I do roll\nthrough it quite well and get a bit of\nspring off the toes again neither of\nthese are the most Lively Foams like I\nsay they're not really super Foams or\nanything like that they're comfortable\nnot giving a huge amount of punch or\nanything like that but they do feel good\nunder foot without necessarily being you\nknow amazing as I mentioned I did find\nthe nose blast a bit smoother myself as\na heel Striker I find I just move\nthrough my foot strike a little bit\nbetter and it disappears in the foot a\nlittle bit more than the ride 17 for me\nwhich has a bit more of a thudding ride\nto it I think again because of that that\nslightly denser foam you have there and\nI do think also the fact that nose blast\nis a fair bit lighter certainly helps\nout on that front I find I can just tick\nthrough my runs a bit more you know\neasily in a more relaxed fashion in the\nno blast 5 and that lightness does mean\nit's a bit better when it comes to\npicking up the Pace neither of the\nshoeses I'd say are incredibly verstile\nI think they're fine I think it's daily\ntrainers you can do a bit of faster\nrunning in them I'd prefer to be in a\nmore speed Focus shoe myself for any\nkind of workout or races but if you just\nwant to cushion daily trainers to do a\nbit of everything I think both of these\nshoes do a decent job I think the Nova\nblast is a little bit more versatile\nbecause is that a little bit lighter and\nlike I say I think the foam isn't too\nmushy or anything like that they're both\npretty stable as well like neither is a\nstability shoe but I haven't any real\nconcerns of either despite the fact the\nno blast in particular is a high stack\nshoe I think it's wide enough and still\npretty stable with side Falls of foam\nthere so on neither shoe is explicitly a\nstability shoe I don't think either shoe\nhas a problem with stability either so\nyeah all around pretty solid shoes I did\ndo a run wearing both shoes at the same\ntime and it kind of bore out those\ndifferences you just got that denser\nfeeling that slightly firmer feeling\nwith the ride 17 for me a slightly\nsofter and spriter ride from the nove\nblast 5 but I know the other guys\ndisagree a bit on that and find it maybe\na bit too soft in which case they might\nwell prefer the more resilient foam in\nthe ride\n17 okay my verdict on these two shoes\num it's pretty easy one for me uh when I\nlook at Daily shoes in this category I'm\nlooking for a shoe that can do lots of\ndifferent things um if I'm comparing\nthese two when it comes to being daily\nallr rounders ride 17 is by far the\nsuperior shoe you just get a lot more um\nof everything really it's a bit more\nstable it's a a bit more responsive it's\ngot a nicer turnover for me um and it\njust feels like you can do a lot of\ndifferent things in it the only thing it\ndoesn't do amazingly well for me is easy\nruns and the no blast does do that and\nthat is really what the no blast 5 is\nnow it's a it's a comfortable easy day\ndaily training shoe uh which it's\ncompeting with um more of those sort of\ncushion shoes now I think things like\nthe BR B Max the new band more V5 shoes\nlike that where you're just buying a\nshoe for comfort and and cushioning and\nyou're not really doing a lot of other\ntraining in it I think that's what this\nshoe is now um I don't think it's\nespcially designed for lots of\nVersatility that's not a bad thing it's\njust tricky with AN overb line because\nthey Chang the way that the shoe rides\nquite a lot so if you're a lot of people\nwill buy running shoes um the same line\nall the time because they trust that\nline and they know that it's designed\nfor them but I think with a Nova blast\nyou don't get that every time because\nyou you get slightly different shoe each\ntime and you're never quite sure if the\nnew version is going to be right um but\nif you're looking at these two shoes and\nyou you want a really good allrounder\nshoe solid does does everything you want\nI'd go for the right 17 if you're just\nlooking for comfort in Easy Day sessions\nI probably still wouldn't get the nebli\nbecause I even though it focuses on that\neasy Day stuff I think there are better\nEasy Day shoes out there I think if\nyou're looking for Pure Comfort uh and\ncushioning I'd go for the New Balance\nMor V 5 um so like the Brooks Glycerin\nMax bit more expensive so it's a bit out\nof the same price league as this but um\nfor me I think there are better Easy Day\nshoes out there and the magic of the\nnovas line has always been that\nversatility which I don't think it quite\ndoes anymore still think it's a nice\nshoot to run in I just think it lacks a\nbit on versatility so I'm going to go\nfor the ride 17 all the way when it\ncomes to daily running shoes it comes to\nmy verdict on these two shoes I think\nthey're both good options I think\nthere's a lot of similarities between\nthem in terms of price performance\nversatility but I prefer the ride filler\nthan nose blast 5 myself like it's\nsofter without being too soft it's a bit\nlighter and a bit spriter and livelier\non the run and I find I just kind of\nenjoy running in it a bit more I also\nthink it has a little bit more about it\nin terms of fast running because it is a\nlighter shoe and I find I can pick up\nthe pace a bit more smoothly in it than\nin the ride 17 but there's not a lot to\npick between them really on performance\nit's probably just going to come down to\nthe ride F you prefer that slightly\nsofter ride you have on the nose blast 5\nor the more resilient firm ride on the\nride 17 so yeah two really solid shoes\nI'd say despite my preference for the\nnose blast 5 if I saw the ride 17 the\nsale for like 450 quid less I'd be very\nhappy to pick that up instead and as it\nis the older shoe and a very popular\nline it's certainly the shoe that's\nlikelier to pop up in SES sooner so yeah\nI would look out for that CU you're\nprobably going to get a good deal on the\nride 17 soon verdict then and I think\nthese two shoes cover very similar types\nof run they're better at the easy end\nbut they're capable up towards marathon\npace as well I think they're both very\ncompetent daily trainers as well I've\nenjoyed my runs in both of the shoes and\nthe testing that I've done for me the\nmajor difference comes down to the Nova\nblast 5 having a sof and more cushioned\nEdge thanks to the slightly bigger stack\nI think some will prefer that\nparticularly at the easier end of things\nwhere you want a bit more cushioning\nyou're also saving a bit of weight on\nthe no blast 5 despite that bigger stack\nso it's probably a shoe that's maybe a\nshade more speed friendly however I find\nthe ride 17 more consistent and a bit\nsmoother the lower stat ride suits my\nstyle more I get a bit more ease in the\ntransition from the ride 17 rocker so if\nI was choosing one shoe I think I'd\nprobably choose the ride 17 and not\nleast because you can now pick it up on\nreally good deals it'll do the same job\nI think as the novablast 5 overall in\nterms of the runs just a bit cheaper the\nNova blast 5 though is still a good shoe\nso there you have it that's been our\nhead-to-head between the S ride 17 and\nthe aex NOA blast 5 we hope you found it\ninformative and helpful if you liked it\nenough to want more make sure you hit\nthe Subscribe button ring the bell as\nwell to hear when more videos land on\nthe channel if you're after daily\ntrainer I'm going to pop a video up on\nthe channel now you should go and check\nit out that's our pick of the best\ndailies otherwise thanks

  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nnow the ax Nova blast is one of those\nshoes that changes tack each generation\nit kind of shuffles from being softer\nand more cushion to stiffer and more\nresponsive the aex Nova blast 4 was\nfirmer and snappier which improved its\nfaster Pace potential over the novablast\n3 the latest Incarnation the ax no blast\n5 here now goes back to soft with the\nnew midsole foam that's tuned for added\nbounce the springier flight foam blast\nMax midsole aims to help the no blast 5\nhit that do it daily trainer sweet spot\nbut how does it compare to the overlast\n4 has it finally nailed the versatility\nand is it a better option than the old\ngeneration shoe well here's the verdict\nin our asex no blast 5 versus aex no\nblast 4 head-to-head\nreview so quick details then stack\nheight and the stack height here stays\nthe same 41 a half Ms in the hill 33 m\nin the 4T with the same 8 mil drop in\nboth shoes from the four to the five\nwhen it comes to weight as managed to\nshave a little off the A6 no blast 5 in\nour UK men's 8 and a half test shoe the\nno blast 5 Now tips a scales of 8.9 o or\n251 G compared to 9.4 o or 267 G in an\noverlast 4 broadly the same weight as\nthe aex super Blast 2 and among the\nlighter big stack daily trainers the\nasex no blast 5 price stays the same too\n\u00a3 135 in the UK $140 in the US sitting\nfirmly in the mid-range bracket for a\ndaily trainer\nso let's give you a shoe comparison then\nand at first glance fresh out the box it\ndoesn't look like much has changed\nbetween these two shoes design sticks\nlargely to that Nova blast blueprint\nwith this geometric midsole and a Max\nstack midsole at that with a large\nrocker plush Cruiser Comfort details up\ntop but there are a few important\nchanges including a new midsole foam\nwith a wider footprint new uppers and an\nupdated outsole pattern as well the ax\nNova blast 5 is currently the only shoe\nin the range that now has a full midsole\nof flight phone blast Max a phone we\nfirst saw in the ax Glide ride Max ASX\nsays this Max stack foam offers around\n88.5% More Bounce than you got with the\nmid the no blast 4 up top you've got the\nwoven upper of the overlast 4 has been\nreplaced by a more premium jackard mesh\nthat takes styling cues from the super\nBlast 2 the new mesh improves\nbreathability has a degree of natural\nstretch that holds the foot well without\nrestricting over blast 5's heel collors\nare slightly more paded\nthe gusted tongues are virtually\nidentical with quite a thin nicely\nwrapping design though asex has added a\ntongue pull kind of lace Loop to the top\nof the tongue here the out soole sticks\nto a relatively standard covering of aex\nahar low rubber aside from a change\npattern this is the same across the over\nblast 4 and the five however you're\nstill not getting that top level grip ah\nplus that you'll find on the ax super\nBlast\n2 quick word onfit then and the one\nthing thing that has changed here is the\nway that these shoes feel particularly\nacross the back of the toes here these\nuppers there's much more kind of flex\nthere's lots more room the feeling in\nthe toe box is one of kind of more space\nand if you really wanted that in a long\nrun shoe then you're going to get that\nin the Nova blast 5 I really quite like\nthat particularly if I was thinking\nabout going for Ultras the extra space\nin this shoe which does you know some\npeople might think it feels a bit baggy\nI really like that I like to have a lot\nof wiggle room you'll notice that when\nyou go back into the Nova blast four bit\nmore structure to the uppers and they\njust hold a little bit closer across the\ntop of the toes here I found these also\nvery comfortable to be honest and I find\nthem roomy enough but you're going to\nget more in the no blast 5 than you got\nhere maybe a bit better hold coming back\nup across the top of the midf foot heel\ncollars and everything else for me holds\nexactly the same in both shoes I would\nrecommend going true to size when it\ncomes to the fit of the two nov blast\nshoes I got them both in my normal uk9\nwhich is a us10 with ax I've had a good\nfit with both no concerns at all they're\nboth fairly voluminous in the forefoot\nespecially the no blast 5 is quite a\nroomy shoe and I have quite a narrow\nfoot but the length is right and I've\nnot had any problems with lock down or\nanything like that not noticed a big\ndifference in the uppers I will say and\naex has tweaked the one on the new shoe\nto try and make it more breathable like\nthey always say when they change an\nupper I've be running in fairly cold\nconditions I haven't really noticed too\nmuch of a difference between them on\nthat front both have a comfortable hold\naround the heel and midfoot so yeah fits\nfine for me in my normal size so fit for\nme has been very good in both of these\nshoes I would say these are true to size\nfitting shoes I've got them both in a UK\nsize eight that is my typical running\nshoe size that's the same shoe size that\nI've had the previous Nova blast shoes\nand I you know I think you know things\nlike the kind of rooms in the toe box\nare very similar you know just enough\nroom not too roomy not too short and\nmaking them ideal for longer runs level\nof padding and the hill colors and the\ntongues are very good so youve got that\ngood Comfort around your heel and on top\nof your foot as well getting a good lock\ndown has been generally good as well\nacross the board I think the only real\ndifference for me is just how the two\nuppers feel with they're slightly\ndifferent materials or make up of\nmaterials I think the no blast 5 one\njust sits a little bit more snug a\nlittle bit more relaxed I think\nparticularly the middle of the shoe and\nI think with the no blast 4 if you\nprefer something that sits a little bit\ncloser that middle section of the shoe\njust wraps a little bit closer then I\nthink you know that's what the no blast\n4 will give you but yeah it's it's small\nthings and I think as I said for me\ngoing true sizing both of these shoes I\nthink will be fine for most people if\nyou don't really have to play around\nwith sizing on the Nova last series so\nthe fit for me in these two versions of\nthe Nova blast I'm a size eight in the\nUK these are both size eights very\nsimilar fit in both of them I'd probably\nsay that the Nova blast 5 is a feels a\nlittle bit more forgiving a little bit\nwider to me than the Nova blast 4 but\nthere's not a lot in it the length is\npretty similar to me and I definitely\nstay to my size in both of these shoes\npadding wise there's probably a little\nbit more um comfort in the padding that\nyou get in the no blast 5 um but very\nvery similar shoes um when it comes to\nfits so I'll say to my size in both of\nthese shoes\nin testing I've covered well north of 30\nmiles in NOA blast 5 and more than 50\nmiles in the Nova blast 4 I've used them\nacross the same range of paces and\nterrain as usual I've run everything\nfrom slow and easy long runs to faster\nintervals and progression runs that's on\na mix of Road and light off-road River\nPS the usual stuff that I put the shoes\nthrough now I've had a bit of an up and\ndown relationship with the ASX no overa\nblast over the generations there's no\ndoubting the plush comfort of these\nshoes but I found the very earliest\nGenerations a bit too soft and mushy\nslightly uncontrolled at times While\nothers raved about the bouncy energy I\nfound that had to work hard to energize\nwhat I thought was quite a sinky midsole\nthat changed with the no blast 4 which\nbrought some welcome firmness a bit of\nstiffness and snap to the ride there was\na little bit of midsole outsole kind of\nstiffness that added IM medy that made\nthe no blast 4 I thought better for\nfaster runs and boosted the overall\nversatility with the no blast 5 things\nhave gone bit soft again but it's try to\noffset that with some extra bounce in\nthe mids salt but I'm kind of back to\nbeing a bit torn at times I've Loved\nthis shoe others I've wanted it to give\nme a bit more when I'm tired now we\noften talk about how Pace impacts the\nride of shoes but for me the ASX no\nblast 5 performance and my enjoyment of\nthe shoe relies much more on form than\non speed I find the no blast 5 got\namplifies how you're running on the day\nregardless of pace so when you're moving\nheavy legged at time times they can feel\nsluggish you know if you're struggling\nthere's plenty of cushion and comfort\nand protection and they're still capable\neasy mile shoes but you have to work\nharder however when you're moving light\nand full of energy probably a bit\nfurther up onto the midf foot 4 foot the\nax NOA blast 5 I find responds well and\ngives all of that energy straight back\nnow like the Nova blast 4 I still\nwouldn't use these shoes I don't think\nfor my allout top Pace runs or they\nwouldn't be my first choice there are\nbetter shoes for that like the speedier\nsuper Blast 2 or the more Compact and\nnimble socking endorphin speed 4 but you\ncan shift up the gears in the Nova blast\n5 and they respond well right up to\nTempo efforts the overlast 4 also offers\nthat range I think it's just more\nconsistent across the paces even when\nyou're not feeling on top form there's a\nbit less sync to work your way out of in\nthe transition I find now I like the\nNova blast 5 is a bit more of a compact\nshoe some of the length has been cut by\ndropping the heel extension Plus I'm\nalways happy to save weight on a shoe\nparticularly on the larger shoes the no\nblast 5 now runs lighter on the foot\nthan you'd think and feels bit more\nNimble by comparison to the Nova blast 4\nyou're still getting a big stack shoe\nbut you're getting it without the kind\nof feelings of that kind of extreme heft\nthat you might have got with the four\nheel Strikers May well notice the\nreduced heel extension help smooth the\nride as well so it comes to the run test\nthe ax no blast 4 was my favorite\nversion of the no blast yet I've never\nbeen someone who's been completely in\nlove with the range I found the first\none a little bit too wobbly second one a\nlittle bit too dull the third one was\ngreat out of the box but the foam seemed\nto lose a lot of its life over time but\nthe no blast 4 I did click with I found\nit a really good daily trainer with a\nvery smooth and rocked ride that could\nhandle a range of runs but it was just\ngenerally best for those easy and\ncomfortable long runs no blast 5 I think\nis a small Improvement on the shoe I do\nprefer it a little bit to the no blast 4\nbut it's not a major jump in any way I\nwould say and overall they are shoes\nthat do the same kind of job which is to\nbe a versatile mid-range daily trainer\nthat will appeal to lots of Runners\nthere's nothing too exceptional about\nthem I'd say in terms of the ride field\nbut they are very solid shoes they do do\na good job and I think they're easy ones\nto recommend to runners in general so it\ncomes to differences between them I'd\nsay the no blast 4 does feel a little\nbit firmer to me I think the foam has\nsoftened a little bit with this new FF\nblast Max stuff you have in the Nova\nblast 5 but probably the bigger\ndifference in the ride field that I\nnoticed with when I was running in both\nshoes at the same time or using them\nseparately was that the redesigned heel\nbevel on the nol 5 does give it a\nslightly smoother feel for me as a heel\nStriker I find that the landing Zone\njust feels a little bit more natural and\nthe shoe feels a little bit smaller as a\nresult that these are big shoes with\nlots of foam on the foot they still got\nyou know pretty big rear ends on both of\nthese shoes but I find that I just tick\nover probably slightly more smoothly in\nthe Nova blast 5 don't think you're\ngetting a lot more life out of the shoe\nor anything like that in terms of bounce\noff the for foot or anything like that I\nthink it's a bit softer don't think\neither shoe really gives you a load of\nresponsiveness but what you do get is a\nsmooth ride from that rocker and that\ndoes mean that it's quite easy to pick\nup the pace in them a little bit I would\nsay especially as they are quite\nlightweight shoes given the high amount\nof cushioning here for me both of them\nwould be used as daily Trainers for just\nrelaxed runs easy runs long runs you can\ndo you know some uptempo stuff in them\nthey're just shoes I prefer for that but\nif you are more of a new Runner or\nsomeone who wants a nice cushion daily\ntrainer to do everything in and both of\nthem would fit the bill on that I think\nyou're just getting a slightly softer\nride with a no blast 5 and a slightly\nsmoother one because of that redesign\nheel and then the other thing I noticed\nwhen I was running it at the same time\nis you got a slightly Slappy ride from\nthe no blast 5 and that could be down to\nthe new outso material which is meant to\nbe a little bit softer haven't really\nnoticed a great deal of difference in\ngrip I think both of these shoes have\nbeen pretty good for grip on me I know\nno Blast has been pretty poor on that in\nthe past no Blast 3 was a little bit\nslippery for me out of the box although\nit did improve over time on the grip\nfront both of these have been fine for\nme running on wet Pavements even very\nslightly icy Pavements around here in\nthe UK so don't think the grip's been a\nmassive difference but I do think it's a\nless Slappy shoe than new one probably\nbecause they've changed their outside\nmaterial a little bit so in terms of my\nrunning time in these two shoes I've\ndone well over 50a in both now and I\nwould say that beyond that kind of\nheadline difference which lies with the\nmidsole Foams there are some differences\nI think will dictate and influence the\nkind of experience you're going to get\nrunning in these shoes the first one for\nme is comfort and why don't you know\nthese both these shoes are very\ncomfortable shoes but I do think the\nover blast 5 is doing a little bit more\non or in that department to offer that\noverall more comfortable feeling that's\nfrom the upper midsole and the outsole\nDepartments the upper just feel a little\nbit more relaxed particularly the midf\nfoot of the um shoe you're getting a\nmidsole foam a midsole makeup that is a\nsofter feeling one compared to the Nova\nblast 4 and you got an outsole which\nlooks similar to the one on the Nova\nblast 4 but it definitely kind of\ncontributes to that kind of more\ncomfortable feeling you know that softer\nmid is spread across what I would say is\na slightly larger surface area\nparticularly the for foot of the shoe\nwhich again you know it means that\nComfort is delivered from all\ndepartments and I think that's what I've\nreally seen between the two shoes then\nyou get into that midsole makeup where\nthere are some differences here with the\nNova blast 5 got the FF blast Max as I\nsaid spread what I think is across a\nkind of wider base I think what you get\nis something that you you know sink into\na little bit you know compared to the\nNova blast 4 it's very protective it\nfeels very forgiving I think you know\nyou roll through very nicely in the shoe\njust a very you know smooth shoe to run\nand kind of roll through in I think\nwithin Nova blast 4 you got the FF blast\nEco plus which is firmer in comparison\nto the FF blast Max I think when you get\nthat firmer feeling shoe you're getting\nsomething that is naturally more stable\nwith that kind of firmer foam whereas I\nthink there's a little bit more going on\nto deliver that stability on the kind of\nno blast 5 I think for me that the no\nblast 4 is geared towards running a\nlittle bit more Tempo in it that's kind\nof what I found I've had my nicer runs\nin it I think when I've tried to ease\noff in it and you can run a little bit\neasier in it I think that's where the\ngeometry and the designs of these shoes\ncome into play I think you've got this\nkind of chunky heel which works against\nyou know being more comfortable at those\neasy recovery Paces where that's been\nlost on the NOA blast five where I think\nthat's made it a nice isoe to just you\nknow cover a lot more time in run it\nkind of easy to moderate Paces if you\nwant to you know you know pair things\nback it feels easier and less awkward to\ndo it in that shoe so for me I think\nthey work for similar Paces I do think\nthat when I've tried to run a little bit\nquicker it's felt nicer to do in the\nNova blast or when I tried to ease off\nit's felt better to do that in the Nova\nblast 5 I think from an outside point of\nview you know no blast outside is not\nbeing the best you know that you can get\non a daily Trainer shoe I think with an\nNOA blast four and the five I think\nyou're going get something that's going\nto handle well and drive Pavements and\nRoads when it gets slightly wetter are\nthey going to give you the best level of\ntraction possibly not but I do think\nthere's a bit more rubber you know here\non the Nova blast 5 which I think is\ngoing to hold up better from a\ndurability point of view and maybe\nhandle you know longer runs in you know\nin this shoe compared to this shoe but I\nthink yeah I don't think there's a huge\namount in it from an outsole kind of\npoint of view from a grip but I think\nmore so maybe on the durability point of\nview so I've had a good experience in\nboth of these shoes I would say though\nfor me the Nova blast 4 probably gears\nor more to that more Up Tempo moderate\nPace whereas the Nova Bloss five for me\nfeels more comfortable with easy\nrecovery Paces more kind of easy to\nmoderate Paces I would say as opposed to\nreally slow paces and that's where it\nfelt more at home for me um so yeah two\ngood Nova blast shoes for me very\ndifferent Nova blast shoes from four to\nfive okay so the Nova blast line is one\nthat has seen a lot of development since\nit started a few years back and I was a\nmassive fan of the original Nova blast\nand since then I've had um differing\nviews on uh the shoes as they've been\nreleased novablast 4 um I I really like\nthe shoe because um I wasn't a big fan\nof the no Blast 2 didn't really wasn't\nwasn't overly impressed by the Nova\nBlast 3 didn't tend to use it a lot it\nwas fine but I just just better shoes\nout there for me for that sort of daily\ntrainer all rounder thing um novast 4\nactually came in with um the uh FF blast\nplus midell foam and um it just felt\nvery different than nov Blast 3 it's\njust bit more responsive a little bit\nfirmer a little bit better for running\nfaster in and all in all a very\nimpressive versatile shoe that really\ngoes up there um again some some great\nshoes like the Haw ma range things like\nthat um bit more cushion than those\nshoes but still a similar sort of daily\nshoe and you could use it for faster\nsessions you could use it for longer\nsessions you could use for easy runs um\nand it was a really good shoe for all of\nthose different things it doesn't excel\nat easy runs but um it also doesn't\nexcel at faster sessions it just sort of\nsits in the middle there as a very solid\nall round shoe that if you wanted one\nshoe and to do all your training in you\ncould comfortably do it in this shoe um\nand it would do a really good job um and\nthat's that's the good thing about no\nblast 4 it's just a great great value\nshoe that does a lot of different types\nof runs competently um but all in all if\nyou go on holiday it's a great shoe to\ntake on holiday if you if you're going\nto have to do some faster efforts and\nsome slower efforts because it ticks off\nof those boxes and it's not that\nexpensive when you can compare compare\nit with some of the other shoes out at\nthe moment the Nova blast 5 comes in\nwith this FF blast Max midell foone\nwhich is noticeably softer than what's\nin the Nova blast 4 um I love soft shoes\nI love cushioning I love bounce um so\nwhen I first took this out I really\nreally liked the no blast 5 the first\nrun video I actually said I think it\nmight be the best NOA blast that's been\nreleased um since then I've used it for\na few more runs I've used it for fire\nruns now so I'm up to about 55 60k in\nthe shoe um and what I found is that it\nif you're going out for a nice easy run\nmaybe a comfortable Pace when you're\npushing yourself a little bit it feels\nvery comfortable it feels very nice you\nget a little bit of bounce back from\nthat Mido foam and all in all um I I\nfelt like a shoe that I would prefer to\nthe Nova blast 4 which is a little bit\nmore um a little bit firmer in the mid\nsole which is not something that I\nnormally go for in a shoe um but what I\nfound out the no blast 5 is that over\nthose runs I had a bit of a mixed\nexperience with it sometimes I go in on\na run with it uh and it feel really the\nball really nice sometimes quite a when\nI was picking up the pace in it it felt\nlike that Mido was just a little bit too\nsoft and was a little bit sluggish it\nfelt like I wasn't getting as much\nenergy return back as I wanted to get\nfrom something like the level last four\nwhich is very good at giving you a nice\nlevel of responsiveness and energy\nreturn um from that slightly fir Midol\num whereas the novast 5 just feels like\nit it dulls it a bit so sometimes you'll\nbe running on a faster session and it\njust feels like it's not really helping\nyou it's feeling comfortable um but it's\nnot helping you get any end your return\nback or any responsiveness um so it's a\nshoe that really for me uh is much\nbetter at those easy runs um and if\nyou're if you want something comfortable\nand um with plenty of padding in it it's\na great shoe for that it just feel very\ncomfortable it just when you're when\nyou're actually want to maintain a good\nPace or or pick up the pace for Interval\nor something it doesn't feel like a shoe\nthat works really well for that that\nbounce doesn't seem to appear when\nyou're when you're trying to run fast\nyou don't seem to get a lot of that back\nfrom it but for easier sessions um it\nfeels absolutely fine um and definitely\na shoe that if you wanted a daily shoe\nand most of your runs were on the easy\nside or on the comfortable side of\nrunning this would be a fine shoe for it\nif you wanted to pick up the pace of bit\nthen ner blast 4 is probably a better\noption for that but all in all I think\nit really comes down to that Mell foam\num and the fact that it's just a little\nbit softer in the no blast 5 and as a\nresult it does change the experience of\nthe run and essentially makes it a\ndifferent type of shoe uh as as opposed\nto sort of versatile daily trainer to a\nmore easy run daily trainer which um\nyou're probably not going to do many\nfaster sessions\nin verdict then and these are both good\ndaily trainings that will largely cover\nI think similar runs everything from\nslow and easy up to Tempo runs for sure\nmaybe even some pickups and intervals if\nyou don't mind doing those sort of\nfaster efforts in a larg sh shoe that\nfeels like more on the foot however they\ndeliver that capability I think in a\ndifferent way and ultimately how they\ndeliver I think dictates which shoe\nmight suit your running best if you like\nshoes that are softer and bouncier then\nI think the NOA blast 5 is your best bet\nif you like a ride that's a bit stiffer\nand a bit snappier and a bit more\nresponsive a bit more immediate then I\nthink the Nova blast 4 is probably the\nway to go now same for slow miles if you\nlike your slow miles really soft the no\nblast 5 softer Edge probably makes it\nthe better cushioned option the no blast\n4 is still an impact eating got a\ncushion shoe in the gamut of all the\nshoes but there's a bit more firmness\nthat some might not want on those\neasiest of easy runs or those longer\nlonger slow miles now I think both\nGenerations have Merit I get a similar\nperformance similar runs covered they\njust deliver it a different way for the\nway I run and my preference for a Snappy\na ferma ride I think the over blast 4\nwould probably be my first choice\nhowever overall you've got two good\nversatile dailies here that can eat most\nof your runs that you'd encounter when\nyou're kind of pushing through training\nfor a marathon some Runners might even\nbe able to lace up either of these shoes\nfor a marathon and racing them when\nyou're looking for just reliable Comfort\noverall and at the price I would say\nthese two shoes actually represent\npretty good value too so I don't think\nyou can go wrong with either just choose\nwhich ride you like best when it comes\nto the verdict I do prefer the aex nose\nblast 5 I think it's my favorite version\nof the shoe yet but I do think it's a\nfairly incremental Improvement on the\nnose blast 4 like I like the fact the\nrides a little bit smoother I like the\nlittle touch of extra softness you get\nwith the shoe which for me hasn't made\nit mushy at all or anything like that it\njust gives you a slightly softer feel\nstill the predominant feeling I get with\nthe ride on both shoes is that rocker\nwhich is smooth and effective a little\nbit smoother on the newer shoe and that\njust means you can tick over quite\nnicely in it at a range of Paces but for\nboth shoes I'd be sticking mostly to\neasy Paces so you know all things being\nequal the price being exactly the same I\nwould probably pick the no blast 5 but\ngiven that no blast 4 is the older shoe\nI think it performs really well still I\nwould probably look for a deal on it\nahead and if it was even you know kind\nof5 10 pound cheaper I'd be happy to go\nfor the no blast 4 over the nose blast 5\nbecause I do think they excel in very\nsimilar ways honestly if there was\nactually just a color of the nose blast\n4 that I much prefer to the the no blast\n5 I'd get the no blast 4 because I do\nthink it's quite similar in terms of\nperformance and although I do think the\nno blast 5 is a better shoe I don't\nthink there's that much in it you can\nuse them both as comfortable daily\ntrainers they do a good job and I think\nthey perform at a fairly similar level\nso yeah no blast will be the one to get\non value or even color like I say but no\nblast 5 is the shoe I prefer I do think\nit's the best no blast yet but but the\nimprovements we've got here on the no\nblast 4 aren't enough to really make it\na huge leap forward so for me if I had\nto pick between the Nova blast 4 or the\nNova blast 5 I would be going for the\nNova blast 4 which I can understand I'm\nprobably in the minority here but what I\ncan see from having running these two\nshoes now is that you know I like a Del\ntrain that has a little bit more of a\nversatile Edge to it I feel like the\nNova blast 4 for me does have that\ncompared to the Nova blast 5 which is a\nvery good Nova blast and you know if you\nwant a Nova blast shoe that's very\ncomfortable and is going to be a good\nkind of comfortable long run shoe then\nabsolutely does that but I think you\nknow if I wanted something for with a\nslightly more uptempo Edge I think the\nno blast for give you that or has\ndefinitely given that to me in my time\nso for me personally I would be going\nfor the Nova blast 4 this is a good Nova\nblast as well but I think that more\nversatile feeling I've got from the Nova\nblast 4 just edges it for me so my\nverdict on the Nova blast 5 and the Nova\nblast 4 is that they are quite different\nshoes now and we've seen this quite a\nlot with the Nova blast line they tend\nto make quite a lot of changes to each\nof the versions of the shoe which does\nchange the experience quite a bit uh and\ndoesn't always happen with shoe line\nsometimes they they've stick very much\nto what they they know works but with\nthe nov sign they do tend to experiment\na little bit with these shoes um so what\nI would say is that the major difference\nis that midell foam and I think it\nreally comes down to the sort of running\nthat you want to do no blast 4 is a very\ngood versatile shoe for the price both\nthese shoes are good shoes for the price\num no blast 4 just has a little bit more\nresponsiveness a little bit it's not the\nfirmest midsole but it's definitely\nfurmer than the no blast 5 bit more\nresponsive definitely a shoe that if\nyou're looking for one trainer to do\nlots of different type of types of\nrunning maybe you're training for a half\nmarathon a marathon and you want a shoe\nto take off all of those sessions apart\nfrom maybe race day you could race in it\nbut you probably wouldn't want it you\nprobably W use a ray shoe for that um\nbut it's a good shoe for all of that\nsort of stuff not the fastest shoe\naround there there's definitely shoes I\nwould train in if I was going to do\nintervals over the no blast 4 but I\ndon't mind using the no blast 4 for\nthose same of easy days I wouldn't pick\nthis shoe up for an easy day run because\nI've got loads of other easy day shoes\nbut I don't mind wearing it for an easy\nday it's absolutely fine very\ncomfortable plenty of cushioning in it\nno blast 5 softer not very good for\nfaster sessions more for those easier\nruns uh where you're looking for for\nComfort a bit more um Mido softness um\nand if it do you do get a bit of end\nreturn on the easier runs but on the\nfaster sessions when you maybe hitting\nit the ground harder you don't really\nget as much back so I think it really\ncomes down to the sort of shoe you want\num because these are quite different\nshoes now but if I was to pick one of\nthese toso shoes I'd say the no blast 4\nis a better shoe just because it's more\nversatile I I prefer softer shoes but I\ndo like this ride better I just find it\nto be just more enjoyable to running um\nespecially if you're running at a nice\nconsistent Pace um which for me would be\nprobably 4 minute 50 km um so I\ndefinitely say no blast 4 is the\nsuperior out of these two shoes but if\nyou really want to get an over blast and\nyou really want a soft shoe that is nice\nfor easy runs you don't care about\nversatility you might want to go for the\noverlast 5 just because that's where it\nsort of sits um but it's less versatile\nand um probably I probably wouldn't\nclass it as a an all around a daily shoe\nI'd more class it as an easy day shoe\nnow",

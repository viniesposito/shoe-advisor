  "text": "hi people welcome to the Run testers now\nwe waited very patiently for the adios\nPro 4 to arrive and now that it's\nfinally here one of the big questions is\nwhether it's better than the adios Pro 3\nand if you like the Pro 3 will you still\nlike the Pro 4 now the shoes might look\nsimilar but there are some important\nchanges that switch up the ride so in\nthis video we're going to whip you\nthrough what's changed how that affects\nthe ride and whether the New Gen of\nAdidas's fast Marathon racer is an\nimprovement on the old so let's get into\nit in our Adidas adios 4 versus Adidas\nadios Pro 3 head to\nhead first up some quick details then\nand the adios Pro 4 remains among the\nlowest stack carbon races it packs 39 Ms\nin the hill and 33 Ms in the 4 foot for\na six mil drop so according to the\nofficial figures that we had that's half\na millimeter shaved off the 4f foot\nstack compared to the Pro 3 for a\nslightly lower drop though the designers\nat Addy have told me that the change in\nthe quota stack depends a lot on how you\nround up those kind of or round down\nthose half millimeters so in reality the\ndifference here might be negligible and\nactually I think it comes in at the same\nstack height the adios Pro 4 comes in at\n202 G or 7.1 o in my men's UK 8 and 1\nhalf test shoe that's 14 G or 0.6 o\nlighter than the adios Pro 3 it's now\nmuch closer to the Nike vaporfly NEX 3\nand the aex metas speed Sky Paris on\nweight but still a shade heavier than\nthose rival carbon plate shoes which\ncome in under 200 g now price stays the\nsame at 22 20 in the UK or $250 in the\nUS let's get into the shoe comparison\nthen the adios Pro 4 has been given a\ncomplete overhaul the black and white\ndesign and new rocker geometry riff off\nthose rare expensive Elite friendly Adi\nZero Pro EVO One the midsole features a\nnew formula Light Strike Pro that's\ntuned to provide a little extra softness\ncompared to the Pro free the 4 foot\nrocker has been moved back to boost\nefficiency it's now positioned at 60%\nCent the length of the shoe that makes\nit a little bit faster to engage the\ncarbon element is the same here the\nadios Pro 4 also carries the full length\ncarbon energy rods 2.0 just the same as\nwe had in the Pro 3 up top is perhaps\nwhere the most impactful change happens\nwith brand new light loock uppers on\nhere to fix some of the issues that some\nof the runners had with Comfort these\noneway stretch woven mesh uppers aim to\naddress one of the biggest gripes with\nthe adios Pro 3 that some Runners found\nthe fit wasn't quite as disappearing and\ncomfortable as other cars races Runners\nme included also experienced some\ndiscomfort particularly around the toen\nknuckle from the eyelets those have\nchanged two on the Pro 4 the thin\nwrapping tongues in the Pro 4 are also\nnow stitched in to prevent them moving\naround having a little bit more lace\npinch busting padding as well and\nthere's a simplified lacing structure\nthat hopes to make it easier to get a\ngood fit and reduce some of those\npressure points boosting Comfort there\nalso some new locking bands inside the\nshoe that wrap the foot for a snug and\nsecure fit providing some additional\nsupport now the RAC and minimal heel\npackage stays largely the same with just\nthe two small side pads for holding\nComfort there's only a little bit more\nextra padding right behind the heel\npresumably to address some of the heel\nrubbing issues that some Runners also\nsuffered in the Pro 3 if you flip them\nover there are changes to the outsole\nthe Pro 4 now has a textured data mapped\nlight traction outsole and the pad of\nthe Continental grip on the key Landing\nPoint has been tweaked and moved you can\nsee there's a bigger sort of central\nChannel as well cut to the midsole of\nthe Pro 4 to save weight the heel\ngeometry has also been altered dropping\nthe cut away there as\nwell now when it comes to fit in testing\nI ran in my regular Adidas running shoe\nsize in both the Pro 3 and the Pro 4\nwhich is a UK and a half and on the\nwhole I found the fit much improved on\nthe four versus the three it's much\neasier to get the pro four on and\npositioned and locked down than the\nfiddle adios Pro 3 I think the improved\nstitched in tongues really help and the\nmodified lace eyelets kind of remove any\nof that lace pinching or rubbing around\nthe toe Knuckles however you've still\ngot a narrow toe box that tapers quite\nabruptly if that was a problem with the\npro fre it still lik to be a problem\nhere I did a marathon test of the Pro 4\nand once I'd gone beyond two and a half\nhours either the length or the\nnarrowness of the toebox or a\ncombination of both caused quite a lot\nof discomfort in my toenails I don't\nremember ever having that as badly while\nracing in the Pro 3 but some others have\nreported it and that's definitely a\nfactor here so while I prefer the fit of\nthe Pro 4 to the pro three I wish the\nPro 4 was quarter of a size bigger I\nthink half a size might be too much but\nI definitely factor in that when sizing\nfor both of these\nshoes onto the run test then and in\ntesting I covered more than 50 miles in\nthe Adas adzo adios Pro 4 and put it\nthrough some tough tests that includes\nan allout 5K lots of progression stuff\nand a solo Marathon test there's a video\non the channel for that already I ran a\ngreat deal more miles in the adios Pro 3\nwhich included a few marathons actual\nraces but all of that was quite a while\nback so for this head-to-head I also\npopped these back on for a refresher and\ndid a sidebyside mile with some\nintervals in the mix but more on that in\na mo now I was a fan of the ride of the\nadios Pro 3 it wasn't perhaps as\nenergetic as shoes like the alphafly 2\nor not as Punchy as the aex metas speed\nSky Paris but it was still fun Lively a\ngood Marathon raayo that offered enough\noomph for runners to chase PBS over\ndistances up to the marathon it perhaps\nwas a bit more capable around my mid\npace so I could do faster training in it\ntoo what I wasn't keen on was the fit\nand the biggest problem was the eyelets\non the toen knuckle the adios Pro 4 has\nfixed that fussy fit bug bear for me but\nit's also changed the ride quite a lot\nnow the Pro 4 is lighter and that's\nalways a good thing big tick in the box\nbut for me the Pro 3 feels more\nimmediate I get less compression in the\ndenser midsole on touchdown and engages\nfaster with a bit more stiffness coming\nfrom that combination of the energy rods\nand the foam I find I feel more\nconnected to the ground and I quite like\nthat kind of ride but it sounds obvious\nto say and it's true of all shoes but I\nalso think how you run makes a big\ndifference here in how you experience\nthese shoes some Runners seem to find\nthe pro three milder less aggressive and\nthe pro four bouncier and more\naggressive with snappier transitions I\npersonally don't find the pro for more\naggressive necessarily it's definitely\nsofter and bouncier and now a punchier\ncarbon shoe that's close to the rivals\nbut a little bit of the Pro 3 stiffness\nhas gone there's a bit more of the vapor\nfly 3 softness just with more bounce but\nthat said I didn't necessarily get a\nsense that the updates would change the\nkind of runs that I'd used the Pro 4 4\nversus the Pro 3 as I said I think they\njust get you there in a slightly\ndifferent way but more on that in this\nside by side test I've just done my side\nby side mile I've got the adios Pro 4 on\nthe left foot I've got the adios Pro 3\non the right foot I did a one mile kind\nof easy warmup around here and then I\ndid three sets of all out 400 meter\nintervals it just to see and I think the\nbig difference here when you're going a\nbit slower the softness of the adios Pro\nreally comes through the adios Pro 3 is\nmuch more firm it's much more immediate\nthat that midsole foam doesn't sink down\nas much it holds firmer and like a ball\nunder the foot fires you off much\nquicker but you do I want say you sort\nof feel more of the ground but it's just\ncompact quicker and goes quicker so in\nthat sense it kind of feels more firm\nbit more connected to the ground slower\nPaces the adios Pro 3 is a much kind of\nsofter shoe creates a bit more wobble I\nthink the difference comes when you\nstart to push up and punch at The All\nOut pace and then they feel more similar\nin terms of the ride that really\nactivates the foam in the adios Pro 4\nand it really comes to life a lot more a\nlot of that softness goes it's still not\nquite as immediate as the Pro 3 and\nactually I think that's how it's going\nto differentiate one of the likenesses I\nwould say about this is I feel like it's\na little bit like the shift from a\nvaporfly 2 to a vaporfly 3 there isn't\nthat extreme of the softness but the\nfour is softer and I think you're going\nto have to like a softer profile shoe to\nget on with the four if you bought the\nthree because it had that kind of\nimmediacy and that kind of stiffening of\nthe foam that happens quickly that kind\nof Punchy roll through bit of that has\ngone I think from the Pro 4 I don't\nthink it makes the pro four a slower\nshoe just tweaks the ride slightly\ndifferently Comfort wise the Pro 4 is\nthe most comfortable shoe out of the two\nthe uppers hold better they hug without\nrestricting you can still feel the\neyelets on the Pro 3 and it's just a bit\nmore fussy some people asked when I did\nthe review about the heel package of\nthese two they are very similar there's\na few changes into the Pro 4 but I\nhonestly don't notice any difference in\nthe slipping in their heels I haven't\nhad any problems from ail's rub or\nanything from both issues in the test\nthat I've just done they both feel\nsecure right now I I don't think there's\nanything to distinguish between the two\nof them the way they hold for me anyway\nthat's the way my feet feel and I think\nwhen it comes to and you've got them\nside by side like this the the major\ndifference here is just going to come\ndown to that ride feel and how you\nprefer your shoes if you want something\nthat's a bit softer and you thought the\nadios Pro 3 was a little bit too\naggressive I think you're going to like\nthe Pro 4 if you don't if you wanted\nthat kind of aggression I think the Pro\n4 may come up a little bit soft for you\num but anyway more more on that back in\nthe\noffice verdict then and the adios Pro 3\nand the Pro 4 are both very capable\ncarbon shoes I think a lot of Runners\nwill enjoy for faster miles up to the\nMarathon distance they both offer Speed\nbut get you there in slightly different\nways the change between the ride is\nnoticeable the Pro 4 is softer and\nbouncier the Pro 3 is stiffer and more\nimmediate the Upp is on the Pro 4 better\nI think but if you didn't have any\nissues with a Pro 3 and you really like\nthe ride you might be better off\nsticking with a pro three and hunting\ndeals on those shoes if you found the\nPro 3 too harsh and wanted more bounce\nand energy and softness from the ride\nthen I definitely look at the pro four\nfirst for me personally I think on\nbalance the pro four is the better shoe\nbut a lot of that to me is down to the\nERS I just wanted a quarter of a size\nmore room in the toe box to avoid the\ntoenail WS that I got that's a big deal\nfor me on the Pro 4 and I know some\ntoenail bashing is part of the marathon\nexperience but this was some of the\nworst that I've had and it somewhat\nlimits how far I'd really want to run in\nthe adios Pro 4 going true to size\nregardless right now as it is if I'm\npicking one shoe to go and race a\nmarathon it's still the Pro 4 so there\nyou have it that's our head-to-head\nbetween the new adios Pro 4 and the\nadios Pro 3 I hope you found it useful\ndrop us a like like if you did if you're\nnot subscribed to the channel we'd love\nyou to do us the honor and hit that\nbutton if you want deeper dives into the\nadios Pro 3 and the Pro 4 I've got the\nreviews up on the channel Now get stuck\ninto those otherwise thank you very much\nfor stopping by and until next time\nhappy running people",

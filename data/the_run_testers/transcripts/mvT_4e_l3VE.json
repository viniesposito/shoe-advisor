  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my\nname's Nick I'm here with Mike and\nKieran and today is the second our\nseries of best running watch videos\nwe're doing different categories in each\none we've done the best beginner watches\nalready we're now moving on to the best\nvalue running watches now the key for\nValue here is getting a lot of features\nfor the price in our opinion so it's a\ngreat balance of features and price it's\nnot just very very cheap watches it's\nalso watches are bit more expensive but\nare coming in significantly cheaper than\nother watches that have similar features\nand we're going to do a couple of\nwatches that are is cheap generally\nthey've got a very good kind of list\nprice or retail price and then a few\nthat are now so consistently in sales I\nthink it's very much worth flagging them\nup because you know though kind of\nwatches in the real world you're looking\nand seeing for a really good price and\nconsidering buying especially in a big\nsales period like Black Friday right now\nwhen whiches are everywhere are being\nreduced so the first one we're going to\nflag up is the one I think we all agreed\nwe probably thought was the best value\nwatch overall if we are looking at it\nbecause it's a slightly older watch it's\nthe Garmin 4 on a 255 there's a music\nversion a non-music version a small\nversion crucially and a bigger version\nso it's very good for small wrists even\nthe bigger version is pretty good for\nsmall wrists it's been around for few\nyears it's basically the last of the two\nX5 series uh after very popular 235 245\nthen the 255 and now it's gone AMOLED\nwith the 265 which means the older watch\nis a lot cheaper it's not AMOLED but you\nstill get dual band tracking it's a\nmultisport watch it's very accurate and\nit's usually now in sales for you're\nprobably looking at 1002 200 less than\nthe\n4265 hard really not to rate this as a\nvery good value watch just fair to say\nKieran\nyeah again it's like this this one I\nthink if you went back in time when we\nwere doing kind of reviews on the 265\nall these other watches didn't exist\nthis would have been one of our top\npicks back in the day and yeah I mean\nthis is a fascinating question people\nalways go to be you know should when\nshould we upgrade do these watch if if\nsomeone landed that watch and you hadn't\nseen the new ones and we were running we\nwere all running with the 255 we' be\nperfectly happy with the capability of\nit right and if so if you can get it at\na knockdown deal it will cover\neverything you really need it to do on a\nrun if you never seen an AMOLED screen\nyou could pretend that you haven't and\nyou're not drawn to that kind of bright\nshiny it's a fully you know it's a fully\nfeatured very capable watch decent\nbattery life I think you know all the\nall the um relative accuracy that you\nneed and yeah I think I'm kind of saying\nthat if everything else got wiped out\nand someone handed you a 255 you'd run\nwith it very happily so if you can get\nit cheap and that's you know you're on a\nbudget then you're not compromising in\ntoo many areas really no I think couple\nof features you're missing out on things\nlike training readiness there's a lot of\nstuff that a lot of people might\nconsider bells and whistles you're\nmissing out on I mean you don't get a\nvery Hardy design of fa to say mic or\nvery long battery life but otherwise\nyou're pretty much set right I mean for\nfor me like particularly what we've see\nwith the 265 and it's kind of slightly\nmoved out of that mid-range price status\nin terms of where it sits where this\nvery much does sit at mid-range and now\nif you look around the sales I mean I've\nseen it for around 20000 \u00a3220 that is a\nvery good deal for a watch that's\neffectively the same as a 265 minor that\nam display I would say it's getting you\na bit more in terms of battery life kind\nof dayto day um so you're going to get a\nlittle bit more out it from that point\nof view I found that I think something\nthat really stood out for me was the\nheart rate performance I know you know\nwe don't all kind of you know will Bank\non kind of obstacle heart rate you know\nif you're really kind of trusting out\nfor training and you're from a kind of a\nheart rate based uh point of view But\nultimately if you were and you did kind\nof didn't want to kind pair up with\nexternal heart mon i' I found that it's\nbeen very good overall so I think you\nknow there are some definite um kind of\nqualities there in the t55 and I say\nultimately you my experience has been\nvery similar to the t65 from a core run\ntracking experience I think Smartwatch\nexperience as well too if you can live\nwithout that AMOLED display you know\nthat drum drop in price isn't getting\ngiving you a kind of drop in terms of\nfeatures no fantastic watch and yeah\ndefinitely one that's going to be in the\nsales a lot then we move to a watch that\nis very rarely reduced this is the coros\npace free in generally coros don't do\nbig reductions on their watches their\nstatement is basically that we price\nwatches you know lower than other brands\nand so we don't need to reduce them and\nit is kind of true because most of the\ntime the brands that compete with chorus\nis because their watches do get reduced\nsomething like the 255 but the pace3 at\nits full price is an incredible package\nI would say it's a full multisport watch\nyou've getting the same training\nanalysis you get on chorus's top watches\nyou're getting pretty good battery life\nit's a dinky little plastic thing which\nI think has quite an appealing design it\nmight not appeal to everyone because it\nis a small plastic watch but it is\nreally lightweight and that's something\nthat a lot of watches are going away\nfrom they seem be getting heavier in\ngeneral it's a very lightweight really\nhigh performance watch one of my my\nfavorites in general and also really\ngood value so yeah Kieran you love the\npast three as well right no this is so\nthis is a watch that's already\nrepresents good value I agree yeah it it\ndoes you know it covers a lot of the\nbases bang for buck in all the reviews\nthat I've done when I've written this up\nbangb when you compare it to to watches\nthat are much pricier this sort of comes\nin and competes really nicely good\ndesign good reliability in terms of the\naccuracy uh really good battery life\nwhich I love and yeah I think just\nrepresents really nice value I think\nyeah I think the biggest takeaway for me\nI think it's really important in terms\nof the cor coros kind of ecosystem is\nit's really trying to and striving to\nkind of have a the same software\nexperience across its watches and that\nincludes the pace three as well too so\nyou know while it might not you know\nmatch the vertic and the Apex in all\naspects from a hardware point of view\nthe software you know CH is really\nstriving to kind of make sure that it's\nconsistent so you know going cheaper\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you're\ngoing to going to miss out on all these\nbig features that car was talking about\nit it tries its hardest to make sure\nthat it's rolling back to its most\naffordable watches so don't you know I\nthink that's a real kind of important\nthing for me that your watch is going to\nimprove and you're not going to sit\nthere and watch other people with an\napex and vertex think oh you know I'd\nlove to have that software feature\nbecause you know carus is really trying\nto make it consistent across its range\nyeah I agree\nanyway next watch I'm going to throw you\nis one it's the sunto races now sunto\nhas not been known I think it's fair to\nsay for been making great value watches\nand then suddenly the sunto race came\nout which was very good value for its\nprice and then Theo race s came out\nwhich is a smaller version of the watch\nbut has all the same kind of features\nyouve got dual band GPS you've got a\nreally kind accurate tracking in quite\nan attractive and hard wearing display\nand it's really cheap so it's a\nmid-range watch but it's undercutting\nthe other big hitters in this area like\nPace Pro the Vantage M3 Garmin 4 and a\n265 it's kind of undercutting all of\nthose watches whilst offering nearly all\nthe same features and a slightly harder\ndesign and you know you're not just\ngetting an all plastic watcher you're\ngetting quite you know a bit of metal on\nthere nice screen and it's got a pretty\ngood tracking experience around as well\nso I don't if youve test this Kieran but\nMike you have right and it's just\nsurprised all of us how good this watch\nis yeah I mean I guess this is a classic\nexample of don't judge a watch by its\nprice because I think people would\nprobably look at it and think oh it's\ngoing to be just another kind of\nmid-range watch but you know it's\neffectively taking what we really liked\nI think probably is one of the watches\nor has really surprised Us in terms of\nperformance in terms of what is on offer\nhere and gives you that for less money\nand I think you know I think what really\nimpressed me from a cinto point of view\nhas been their kind of dual band's kind\nof application to its watches what what\nhow that kind of experiences in terms of\nbattery life I think the mapping support\nas well too you know that core you know\nexperience is very very good and I think\nthere's some areas where I think\nultimately it can improve it's not you\nknow alone on that I think particularly\nfrom a kind of presentation it's kind of\ntraining and Analysis um side of things\nbut what it will do is make sure that\nit's going to play with other kind of\nyou know third party platforms and\ngiving you the scope to kind of share\nthat information in the places that you\nmaybe potentially do use from a training\npoint of view but I think yeah\nultimately it is sat at a midrange price\nbut it has got the features that you\nknow ultimately is going to let it\ncompete with kind of much you know more\nexpensive watches that we all kind of\nyou know like but ultimately sunto is\ngoing to give it to you for Less i' I've\nactually been testing the titanium\nversion which is a bit more expensive\nbit more bit more premium materials but\nit's still good value actually and yeah\nand actually you know in terms of the\nway it operates it does everything else\nexactly the same as the uh as the non\ntitanium version and I think I I\ncompletely agree with you this has been\na bit of a surprise it's been a while\nsince I strapped on a sunto watch and\nactually felt really positive about it\nand this one has been yeah a bit of an\neye opener I think it's it's kind of hit\na sweet spot they've done something very\nclever here in terms of offering that\nkind of full breadth of features uh lots\nof the kind of hardware and um\nfunctionality you're going to want but\nthey've come in at that price point it\nfeels like they've done a little bit of\na coral\nin this and made it and made it just so\nmuch more attractive there to the point\nwhere there are things I don't\nnecessarily like about the sunto kind of\nplatform I'm not I've never been in love\nwith their UI I find it very hard to\nnavigate sometimes I know that you get\nused to watches but I have to find I\nhave to get used to this one a little\nmore than others but there's some of\nthose things that have always been a bit\nof a bug bear with me that I'd be\nwilling to foro a bit more because of\nthe performance and the breadth of\nfeatures and just the way it looks I\nthink it's a really nice looking watch\nand everything you're getting out of\nthis package is is there's a there's a\nlot more to like than dislike and that's\nit's been a while since I've sort of\nfelt that about sunto 100% we actually I\ndon't think we' even said this at any\npoint it's an AMOLED watch it's got a\nlovely AMOLED screen uh and this is one\nthat we're talking about as great value\nat its full price but sunto unlike\nchorus does reduce watches so you might\neven get a better deal on this watch\nfrom time to time but I 100% agree with\nall the kind of little Annoying quirks\nabout the UI in sunos interface which\nalways annoyed me in all the reviews are\nstill present on this watch but you just\nkind of forgive them because it is\nreally good value and it does other\nstuff really well whereas in the past\nyou know really annoyed me even more\nbecause you were paying so much for a\nwatch that wasn't competing so yeah\nreally massive hat tip Toto for the race\nand the races coming in really good\nvalue and taking it to Garmin like you\nsay like they've done a choros but\nactually even undercut the choros pace\nPro a little bit in the UK in particular\nso very good value watch then a couple\nother picks we have in this category are\ngoing to be G watches that are going on\nsale and this is I think the big problem\nactually most brands have with releasing\nwatches that are good value is that yeah\nbut you're you're actually competing\nwith last year's garming on sale which\nstill has more features and is now you\nknow saying kind of price couple of the\nbig ones here so one is the Garmin 4 and\na 955 so this is the last 95 watch uh so\nthe 9 that wasn't an AMOLED watch the\n965 brought in an AMOLED screen but it\nis still very much up to date with all\nof GT software features you've got dual\nband GPS you've got offline maps it's\nit's basically a top Garmin in a\nlightweight plastic design with a memory\nand pixel display now you do not going\nto get that in the future I think from\nnow on you're only going to get top\nwatches with AMOLED displays and they're\ngoing to start introducing more and more\nmetal so last chance for this kind of\nwatch still an amazing watch very\naccurate full featured dropping in sales\nnow so I think this watch going to start\nhovering in the low 300s do we think\nthat kind of price yeah I think so I\nthink at the moment it's probably under\n400 but given what's happening elsewhere\nin garmin's range it it seems inevitable\nthat it will it will drop and it's it's\nessentially a bit like the 265 255 kind\nof situation ultimately where you you're\neffectively paying for that amade\ndisplay and you're paying a premium for\nit but if you can live without that\neverything you're going to get on the\nthe 955 you know from a functionality\npoint of view I think largely from a\ndesign point of view to feel feel very\nsimilar you know it's not a huge large\nwatch like the kind of more expensive\nPhoenix ranges but it's going to give\nyou that kind of level of support in\nterms of mapping in terms of navigation\nin terms of that multiband um support as\nwell too and yeah I think it you know\nconsidering it's I think it's very\nlikely it's going to drop even less than\nit already is uh now it's going to be an\noption for a lot of people I think want\nthat kind of a little bit more in terms\nof that overall kind of comprehensive um\nkind of feature set um but ultimately\nmaybe wanted for a bigger watch then you\nknow the 265 and 255 will will give you\ndefinitely and it is a it's a highend\nwatch it's you know it's not that cheap\nbut it's definitely good value there's\nalso the for and a 945 which is the\nprevious version now all of these older\nwatches you're going to struggle a bit\nin terms of you're not going to get that\nmany software updates going forward I\nthink the 9945 is now out of the Garmin\ncycle but I have seen it today for like\nyou know well under 300 so that's that's\nthat's an interesting watch in that case\nthat's still a very good watch but 955\nis probably the more it gives you more\nvalue in terms of future proofing a\nlittle bit more I would say the last\nwatch though gin Phoenix 8 is just\ncoming out the Garmin phoenix8 has just\ncome out I mean to say which has\nreplaced the Epic Pro and Phoenix 7 Pro\nLines also the Epix 2 and Phoenix 7 have\nkind of now been suaded by two watches\nwhich means there are great deals to be\nhad on what were you know the top\nwatches in garmin's range one or two or\nthree years ago Max and these are still\noutstanding watches so Phoenix 7 is\ncertainly one that's going to be in\nsales a lot but the one that's standing\nout for me a lot every time I look at\nthis on Amazon it seems an amazing deal\nwhich is the Garmin epics 2 is always\nthe white titanium version now the key\nis the titanium version of the Epic 2 is\nthe one that has dualband GPS as well as\na sapphire screen whereas the base steel\nmodel is doesn't have dual dual band GPS\nis a bit heavier so the Epic Ste I think\nis one of the best value watches on the\nmarket these days because it is dropping\nto under \u00a3400 in some places it's\nusually $450 I noticed in America and\nthat is still basically a top-of the\nrange garment in many ways like you miss\nout the new Phenix 88 now has things\nlike a mic and speaker it's got a better\nOptical heart rate monitor you've got a\nnew user interface how much that bothers\nyou I don't know but you have got pretty\nmuch all the same software features you\ndo not get a flashlight which is a bit\ngutting so I think you know this is the\nwatch I used for a year and loved you\nknow and there is upgrades of the Epic\nPro and the Phoenix 8 but I I can't help\nbut think this is unbelievable value\ngiven that you are basically getting a\ntop software and feature an AMOLED\nscreen Garmin watch for so much less\nthan the new models is that what do you\nguys think of this Kieran come on tell\nme I'm right no I I yeah I mean you are\nalthough it wouldn't it would never have\nbeen my first choice of watch out of the\nwhole range but when you put it like\nthat and you couch it and you're putting\nit up against yeah I mean there are new\nbells and whistles on on the Phoenix 8\nand it's there's some sort of fun Tools\nin there the voice notes the sort of\nvoice activation of certain things and\nthat new UI but I don't think they're\nyou know they're not deal breakers\nthey're not particularly they're good to\nhave they're nice to have but I think\nyeah if you can save hundreds of pounds\non having a or you know 100 pound on\nhaving a watch that's got the very\nsimilar functionality I wouldn't be\nleaping to spend the extra on the Garin\n8 so this is going to look very good\nvalue by comparison I think for me it's\nlike you know it was probably the first\nexample of an Amal gar where I felt or\nyou know with along with the n65 it's\nlike you're going to get the battery\nlife you kind of still crave and you're\nwilling to make compromises with but I\nthink ultim what that price is going to\ndo is put up against things in gin's own\nrange which Hammer displays like a 265 I\nthink and it like well do I go for 265\nor I go for this granted they're\ndifferent in terms of design but in\nterms of what you're getting for your\nmoney for probably a little bit less\nmoney than that watch you're getting a\nlot more a lot more um you know and I\nthink it feels like a no-brainer if you\nwant that kind of more rugged design um\nyou know kind of more of those kind of\nlatest kind of um kind of Hardware um\ninnovations that Garmin has done with\nthe epics and I think you know this is\nfor me this is the one that's that kind\nof stands out because it's dro poing\nalongside a lot of other G watches that\nyou think it seems like this is the one\nthat you should be going for yeah it is\nif you wanted we've talked a lot about\nkind of lightweight watches in this area\noften they are the ones that are a bit\nbetter value but this is you know the\nfull deal especially the titanium model\nrugged all that kind of stuff just just\na great watch and a watch that is a real\nkiller for lots of new watches even from\nGarmin themselves I think these days\nwhen you launch a premium topend AMOLED\nwatch and you go well the epics 2 IS300\ncheaper straight away again not looking\nat that you know you have been updated\nup to this point with the Epic 2 you're\nnot going to get the new user interface\non the Phoenix X8 there's going to be\nsome stuff phased out I'm sure but for a\nwatch that came out I think in early\n2022 it still very much stands up as one\nof the best on the market I think and\ncertainly good value which is the whole\ntheme of this video so now we're going\nto attempt to really Flawless goodbye\nfrom all of\nus uh but thanks very much for watching\nwe' also got the best beginner watches\nup already we have got some other come\nwe're going to do best high-end watches\nuh we'll talk about watches that cost a\nlot more than the epics 2 we're going to\ndo best smart watches for full smart\nexperience and we're going to do best\nmid-range watches cuz it's suddenly got\nvery hot in the mid-range category of\nlate with two new watches coming out but\nfor now it's goodbye from me goodbye\nfrom me goodbye from me yeah beautiful",

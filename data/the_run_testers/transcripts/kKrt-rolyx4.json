  "text": "hey Tommy from the Run testers with\nanother running shoe versus in this one\nwe're going to be looking at two New\nBalance shoes the New Balance 10 v14 and\nthe New Balance Rebel V4 let's see what\nwe all\n[Music]\nthought the New Balance 1080 v14 costs\n\u00a360 or\n$164.99 it weighs 287 G or 10.1 Oz for\nmen in a size 8 and the drop is 6 mm the\nNew Balance Rebel V4 cost \u00a340 or\n[Music]\n$139.99 it weighs 207 G or 7.3 Oz for\nmen in a size 8 and the drop is 6\n[Music]\nmm the New Balance 1080 v14 is a daily\nshoe built for comfort and accessibility\nin the previous version of the shoe New\nBalance modified the fresh Fox midsole\nto be noticeably softer but with that\ncame a dip in the stability and the\nversatility of the shoe the Tennesse v14\naddresses that with a slightly firmer\nversion of the foam and the overall\nmidsole geometry in addition there's an\nupdated engineered mesh upper to improve\nthe fit and provide better breathability\nthat also includes a good level of\npadding as well as a soft gusseted\ntongue on the outsole is a modest layer\nof rubber across the key areas of the\nshoe although this doesn't cover the\nfull length of the Midol foam the New\nBalance Rebel V4 is a daily shoe that's\ndesigned for faster training while still\nproviding plenty of cushioning the fuel\nso foam is a peber Eva blend that offers\na soft ride as well as a good level of\npropulsion with a geometry that's taller\nand wider than its predecessor the upper\nis a breathable mesh that uses the\nBrand's Phantom knit technology to\nensure a supportive fit with a good\nlevel of padding around the ankle collar\non the outsole is a generous layer of\nrubber across the foref foot as well as\nstrategically placed sections to the\nrear of the\nshoe so in terms of these two shoes I\ndefinitely think it's a story here of\nhow sizing can vary across new balan's\nshoes now the 108 14 very much is a true\nto size fitting shoe for me I've got it\nin a UK size 8 that is my standard size\nnow the rebel V4 landed for me in an 8\nand a half and actually despite being\nhaving or having concerns that maybe it\nmight be a little bit long for me\nactually having an eight and a half has\nworked out very well and I think\nfeasibly for a lot of people going half\na size up in this shoe should make it a\nbetter fit overall it's a bit of a\nsimilar story to the SC Elite V4 which I\nhad in a size eight and worked well for\nme used it for the London Marathon a lot\nof my training runs I think you know it\nwouldn't have hurt gang half a size up\nin for me and if you were a little bit\nin in between sizes or half sizes in the\nSE Elite V4 I think you know it would be\na similar story here with the rebel V4\nso for me the 1080 v14 the more padded\nshoe and the more true size fitting shoe\nthe uh Rebel V4 a lot more like the\nscite V4 in terms of that upper in terms\nof that kind of more racing profile and\nI would go half a size up based on my\nrunning time so it for me in these two\nshoes I'm size eight in the UK these are\nboth size eights t 14 very comfortable\nshoe plenty of space in the for plenty\nof space before the big toe um I found\nit to be very comfortable shoe I've got\naverage width feet and I've had no\nissues with this shoe at all definitely\nwouldn't have it in a different\ndifferent size um the new Bal Rebel V4\nthe fit on this is a little bit\ndifferent it's a faster shoe it's a\nlittle bit leaner the upper is not as uh\nstructured as the T v14 so you end up\nwith this sort of um soft uh looser fit\nto to the upper um I've not had any\nproblems with it uh found it very\ncomfortable and as a result it's it's a\nbit stretchy as well so you can sort of\num press your toes against it and it\nwill move out but I i' found a similar\nfit in both these shoes but I would say\nit's a little bit more restrictive in\nthe rebel V4 uh so just take that into\nconsideration but I would say to my size\nin both of these\nshoes Okay some of you might look at\nthis versus and say that these two shoes\naren't necessarily that comparable but\nthey are both daily shoes they do fit\ninto a similar category and for some\npeople it might be difficult to choose\nbetween these two shoes based on the\ninformation that you get from the brands\nand that sort of thing the 10 v14 is a\nshoe that's predominantly designed for\nticking off the miles it's a daily shoe\nthat isn't the most versatile daily shoe\nout there it's not bad um it's a shoe\nthat really uh is a a cushion daily shoe\nthat's designed for doing all your\nmilesin so whether you're going out and\ndoing a 5k uh recovery run whether\nyou're going out to do a 20K uh\ncomfortable run easy run um consistent\nPace run it's fine for those things it's\nit's a shoe there that's just designed\nto eat up the miles it's not really\ndesigned to do much more um and it does\nthat very very well it's a very\ncomfortable shoe um it has a nice\nbalanced Mido it's an update from the\nMido that is in the ten v13 and the ten\n10 V3 was very very soft and some people\ndidn't like that me it was less stable\nuh and wasn't great for some people\nwhereas the ten v14 very stable great\nplatform on it good balanc M it's a\nlittle bit firmer than the tv13 as a\nresult much more accessible to a lot\nmore people who maybe need a little bit\nmore stability um and a little bit more\nresponsiveness it's it's definitely a\nshoe that you can use for faster\nsessions than the\ntv13 um but I wouldn't use this for\nintervals or anything like that at my\nspeed I would use it purely for ticking\noff the miles hourong runs 10ks 15ks\nthat sort of thing where I'm just going\nout and I just want a comfortable shoe\nthat does the job um it's sort of a\nholiday shoe uh if you took it away you\ncould do bit faster sessions in it but\nnot I definitely wouldn't pick this\nspecifically to do those those sorts of\nruns with the New Balance Rebel V4 is a\nshoe that is designed for faster daily\ntraining it's a very comfortable shoe I\nactually quite like this shoe for easy\nruns it's a a much softer midsole than\nyou get in the 108 v14 it um is lighter\nthan 108 v14 it just as a result it's\nit's a lot quicker it's a lot poppier uh\nthat midle um it for me me it really\ncaps out at about 15K I do find it a\nlittle bit too squishy for me um and I\nwouldn't want to do longer sessions in\nthis unless I was running really fast um\nin this shoe but yeah it's a little bit\nsquishier in the midsole uh it's\ndefinitely a shoe that's designed for\nreally picking up the pace it excels\nwhen you're going you're doing interval\nsessions Tempo sessions fart leg\nsessions anything like that where you\nwant to pick up the pace and you want a\nlighter shoe on the feet um but you\nstill want a bit of comfort in it as\nwell um I think this I think the uh\nRevel V4 is more versatile than the 108\nv14 if you're going up to a certain\ndistance um I definitely think there's\nyou'll get a lot more miles out the 1080\nv14 it's definitely a more solid stable\nshoe that you can tick off a lot of\nmiles Rebel V4 i i i exclusively use\nthis shoe for shorter efforts where I\nmay need to go faster and when I mean\nfaster I mean training Pace I use this\nshoe for picking up the pace to 4 minute\nkmers that sort of thing where I'm\nactually training for a ra saw training\nfor uh training to improve my speed this\nis a good shoe to go for especially if\nI'm not looking to use a plate for any\nreason or if you're if you're looking at\nbuying a a training shoe and you don't\nwant to have a plate in it this is a\nreally really good option um definitely\na great shoe for running faster in um as\nI said I actually like running in doing\nslower miles in this recovery miles easy\nruns up to a certain distance I actually\nthink the Reel V4 is very good for those\nso um both daily shoes but for different\nreasons the outsole on these even though\nthey come from same brand uh the outsole\non the rebel V4 it does have really good\nrub coverage on the front of the shoe\nnot a lot on the back um and this fuel\ncell mle is a little bit exposed in\nthose areas I've done about 70k in this\nshoe so far it's not really got any\nmajor signs of wear or tear because this\nrubber is pretty good and it sticks out\nquite far um bit of wear on the actual\nrubber itself I always run um R rub down\nthat section there but still looking\npretty good 10 v14 has uh outside is\nabsolutely fine uh but there's a lot of\nexposed uh midsole foam on it in about\n70k running I've not really seen any\nwear or te on the midsole cuz it's got a\npretty good layer of rubber on it but I\ndefinitely think the outso on the rebel\nV4 is better so in terms of my running\ntime with these two shoes I say it's\nbeen very good overall these are very\nmuch daily trainer style shoes but these\nare daily trainers with definitely very\ndifferent profiles I would say you know\ndifferent runs I would ultimately use\nthem for there maybe is a little bit of\noverlap But ultimately I think they are\nvery different in terms of those kind of\num daily trainer profiles now one of the\nbig reasons for that is the difference\nin the weights the new B Rebel V4 is\nsignificantly the lighter of the two\nshoes the weight is more in keeping you\nknow getting towards racer style shoes\nso from that point of view if you want\nsomething that feels a little bit more\nspritey to run in it's going to be the\nrebel V4 now 1080 v14 isn't a heavy shoe\nper se particularly for a kind of Max\ncushion shoe But ultimately if you want\nthe lighter shoe then the rebel V4 is\ngoing to give you that and then when you\nget into the midsoles and what you're\ngoing to get from them and what they're\nultimately going to deliver for me the\nrebel V4 getting out running in this\nshoe you got that fuel cell and midell\non there which is a mix of Eva and peber\nso you're getting something from those\nkind of more racing Focus Shoes\nsomething a bit more lively bouncy um a\nlittle bit more aggressive The Rocker is\na little bit more aggressive there I've\nalways found I've got out in this shoe\nit's really wanted to kind of push me\nforward you know from hillt toe a lot\nquicker compared to the 1080 v14 which\nas the Fresh Foam X which has very\ndifferent properties you know and very\ndifferent kind of roles ultimately it's\nabout protection and comfort it's\nprobably you know has a has a plusher\nfeel to it as well too you know it's not\ntoo firm on the uh rubel V4 either but\nit's definitely got you know a bigger\nstack there as well of that foam um and\nit's really about kind of as I said\nproviding that protection and comfort\nultimately what I think ultimately does\nis going to be something that's going to\nbe comfortable over those easy runs over\nthose recovery runs be a good uh kind of\nrun to run longer in as well too\nprobably more so than the 1080 v13 you\nknow there is a rock in here it's a a\nmore gentle rocker than the one in the\nrebel V4 but it's just enough to kind of\nhelp you tick over in this shoe and as I\nsaid you know if you are looking for\nsomething or a daily trainer where you\nknow you really want something that's\njust going to help you kind of cover\nthat mileage and that is a shoe you know\nthe um 10 v14 will do that the rebel V4\njust feels a more kind of outwardly kind\nof faster shoe a more uptempo shoe I\nthink a shoe maybe doesn't feel as\ncomfortable as the 1080 v14 running a\nlittle bit longer maybe you want a\nlittle bit more in that mid soole to\nkind of protect But\nultimately it could run or work for kind\nof moderate to kind of uh kind of long\ndistances ultimately but I think for me\nit's kind of those shorter distances\nthose kind of shorter faster sessions as\nwell too that's where it's really\nexceled for me from a kind of outso\npoint of view I think you're probably\nyou know you're going to get a little\nbit more out of the 1080 v14 they're\nkind of covering the same types of areas\nultimately in terms of out Souls the\ngrip has been absolutely fine for me in\nkind of wetter condition as well too but\nI think if I was going Offroad on\nlighter Trails I'd feel more comfortable\ndoing it in the 1080 v14 so as I said I\nthink these are daily trainer shoes that\nyou know go about their business in very\ndifferent ways I think if you stick to\nthe types of runs that they work for\nthen they can be very effective in that\nkind of respect but I think ultimately\nif you are looking for a more\ncomfortable shoe particularly over\nlonger distances I think the 1080 v14 is\ngoing to give you that and give you a\nnice feeling to kind of roll you through\nthose runs as well too the rebel V4 a\nmore faster feeling shoe feels like a\nmore of a companion to the SE V4 taking\nthe pressure running in that shoe and\ndoing some of your sessions in this shoe\nand giving you it from a kind of lighter\nprofile as\nwell okay my verdict on these two shoes\nsaid it in the uh run test section that\nthey're not necessarily designed for the\nsame thing but you can use them for\npretty similar things uh I think it\nreally comes down to the sort of running\nthat you're doing if you are if your\ndaily miles generally are quite fast\nyou're doing a lot of interval sessions\nin a week you're doing faster sessions\nyou want something to go shorter faster\nto really pick up the pace re V4 is\ndefinitely the shoe to go for if you're\ndoing a lot of longer sessions if you're\ndoing loads and loads of miles at a\nreally comfortable easy pace which for\nme would be about 5 minute km go for the\n108 v14 it's just a very solid shoe very\nstable great for ticking off loads and\nloads of mils I'm marathon training at\nthe moment I've used this quite a lot\nfor um just just churning out my\nbasically um nice consistent Pace very\ngood for that and I think it's a lot\nmore accessible to more people but if\nyou're looking for versatility you're\nnot going to get a lot of that from the\n1080 v14 you're probably going to be\nlooking at the rebel V4 if you're the\nsort of Runner that actually wants to\nhave a shoe that you can pick up the\npace properly in and do real training\nsessions uh at faster Pace um but when\nit comes to things like durability and\nstuff I have a feeling that the 108 is\njust going to be far better because the\nmidsole on the um Rebel V4 is a little\nbit squishy for me and I can I can feel\nit being less dense than the 1080 v14 so\nmight take with you should go for the\nnew B 1080 v14 or the new B reil World\nV4 as I said these are shoes that are\nvery different for me and I would use\nthem very differently I think it really\ndepends on what you want from a daily\ntrainer style shoe if you want something\nthat has a more of an uptempo edge and\ndefinitely is one for kind of shorter\nsharper sessions and also for slightly\nlonger runs as well too and you want the\nlighter shoe more livey shoe I'd be\ngoing for the reble V4 if you're a\nlittle bit concerned about having a shoe\nthat maybe is that little bit more\naggressive and more kind of propulsive\nin terms of that ride and you want\nsomething that can still work for kind\nof more comfortable running can be a bit\nmore equipped or better equipped at\nthose longer runs in terms of protection\nthen I would be going for the new B 1080\nv14 but if I had to picked between the\ntwo shoes I think I've just had more fun\nin the rebel V4 while it probably lacks\na little bit more for those longer runs\nI think for the those daily runs and the\nruns that I'd be going you know from of\n5K 10K 15 20K this is a shoe that I\nthink works very well at those uh kind\nof distances and I think for faster\nPaces as well too as I said the 1080 v40\nis not a bad shoe but if I had to pick\ni' would be going the rebel V4 which is\nactually cheaper as well and I think\nyou're going to get a lot more value out\nthis shoe particularly if you want a\nmore uptempo daily trainer in your\nrotation that's it from us on this\nversus thanks a lot for watching don't\nforget to like subscribe click that\nlittle bell and if you're going to catch\nme below you can find a l to our podcast\nwhich comes out a couple of times

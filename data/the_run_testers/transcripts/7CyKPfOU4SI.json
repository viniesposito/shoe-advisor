  "text": "hey this is mik from the r testers this\nis the aex no blast 5 and this is the\naex super Blast 2 two shoes as you'll\nknow from our multitester reviews we are\nbig fans of now these are also two shoes\nthat sit at very different price points\nsuper blast do is the more expensive the\nno blast 5 is a lot cheaper and it's a\nlot easier to get a hold of than this\nshoe now what we're going to do in this\nvideo is take you through the key\ndifferences and give you a sense of\nwhether there is any kind of overlap in\nterms of experience in terms of the\ntypes of runs that these shoes can work\nfor and whether no blast 5 could give\nyou a super blast like experience for a\nlittle bit less money so first we'll get\ninto those key differences then give you\nour multi test to take on whether you\nshould go for the Nova blast 5 or the\nsuper Blast\n2 so let's get into those nitty-gritty\ndetails and differences between the Nova\nblast 5 and Super Blast 2 let's start\nwith price and the noov blast 5 is\nconsiderably cheaper than the super\nBlast 2 while both are offered in stand\nwidth size options only weightwise the\nNova blast 5 weighed in heavier for us\nthan the super Blast 2 in a UK men's\nsize eight you're getting shoes both of\n8 mm drops with the super Blast 2\noffering a bigger stack of cushioning at\nboth the heel and the 4f foot compared\nto the latest Nova blast at the upper\nit's engineered woven mesh versus\njackard mesh with similar tongue and\nlacing combinations used and the Nova\nblast 5 heel collar offering a touch\nmore padding there's big differences at\nthe midsole where the no no blast uses\nthe new FF blast Max for a softer feel\ncompared to the Eco plus included in the\nNova blast 4 and also the super Blast 2\nwhere it's combined with the FF blast\nturbo plus found in asx's metas Speed\nCarbon races asex adopts a similar\ntrampoline inspired outs soole design on\nboth shoes to spread those Foams across\na relatively broad base to bring that\nbounce throughout the shoe you're also\ngetting similar outo designs with the no\nblast offering a bit more coverage at\nthe for foot and lateral areas of the\nshoe\ncomes to the fit of the super Blast 2\nand the no blast 5 I've got the same\nsize in both shoes which is a uk9 us10\nwith aex it's the same size I use across\nthe aex range and both of them have a\nreally good fit for me I'd say you have\ngot really roomy forfoot on the no blast\n5 but even as someone with a narrow foot\nlike I am you know have too much room\nthere as someone with a narrow foot but\nit's not being a problem in any way with\nlockdown or anything like that got right\namount of length at the front there in\nterms of room for my toes good hold\naround the heel and midfoot I find them\nboth very comfortable shoes just to slip\non day after day so yeah no concerns\nwith the fit I'd stick to your normal\nsize okay so the fit for me in the Nova\nblast 5 and the super Blast 2 quite a\nsimilar fit actually um both very\ncomfortable I'm a size eight in the UK\ni' very much like wearing both these\nshoes they're both AIC shoes so a\nsimilar fit what I would say is that the\num nov blast 5 is a little bit more\nforgiving it feels a little bit wider\nand the upper just feels a little bit um\nmore flexible in in terms of how it puts\npressure on your feet so uh if you maybe\nhave a slightly wider foot you're\nprobably going to be better off with the\nNova blast 5 over the super Blast 2 but\nthere's not a lot in it and I find both\nof these shoes very very comfortable so\nI would stick to my size in both of them\nso in terms of fit it's been very good\nfor me in both of the shoes I've got\nthem both in a UK size a that my typical\nrun shoe size and that's generally the\nshoe size that works best for me in ax\nshoes now what I would say is the key\ndifferences for me is that with the Nova\nblast 5 it definitely has a more of a\nrelaxed fit and I would say you know\nit's a bit more roomy in the toe box of\nthe shoe I think it opens up a little\nbit more of going further back in the\nshoe as well and if you prefer something\nthat's a bit more accommodating\nparticularly if you've got slightly\nwider feet then I think that would be a\nbetter fit for most people I've got\nquite skinny narrow feet and while it is\na lot rier I found it's not been overly\nroomier or generous with that space I\nthink with the super blast too\ndefinitely does narrow a little bit more\nit's not super narrow in any way but I\ndo think like the space up front in the\ntoe box is still very good that hold at\nthe midfoot is very good as well too\nanother area I think is a key difference\nfor me is that there's just a bit more\npadding around the hill col\nin the Nova blast 5 where you know it's\ndefinitely issue for me that's geared\ntowards kind of giving you a little bit\nmore of that Comfort side where you're\ngetting that padding a pretty good\namount of padding on the hill col and\nthe super Blast 2 but it definitely\nisn't as much as it is on the no blast 5\nso the things for me would be that the\nNova blast 5 is a lot more roomy\nparticularly the front of the shoe and\nand the middle section of the shoe the\nsuper blast to has less kind of padding\nat the hill collar but generally for me\nI think going through the size for both\nof these shoes should be fine for most\npeople let's give you a quick word on\nfit then in amongst the pistachio shells\non this bench and in the ax superlast 2\nand the over blast five i r in my\nregular running shoe size which is a UK\nand a half I think these are both really\nkind of roomy accommodating shoes\nthere's loads of space in the toe box up\nfront big thumbs width there nice\nclearance across the top of the toes\nsuper lastar to for me they hold really\nwell in the midfoot the heels are nicely\npadded I have no slipping at all\nEverything feels locked down and\ncomfortable and nice and I would\nrecommend going through to issues\nparticularly if you want to go Long Haul\nbecause they're plenty roomy in the Nova\nblast 5 these are even area I mean\nthere's so much Flex in the toe box here\nthese are sort of spacious some people\nhave complained about the fact that they\nfeel too spacious particularly if you've\ngot narrow feet maybe they will feel a\nbit wide but I ran in my regular running\nshoe size and I found everything good I\nI really look for lots of toebox room so\nlook you can see you've got lots of\nclearance on the end there's plenty of\nFlex for the toes that TOS the top lock\ndown across the midfoot was nice and\nsecure I had good hold in the heels as\nwell tongues take the Ed jof no problems\nwith this and I I recommend going true\nto Siz in the shoe unless you really\nwant a snug fit where or you've got a\nnarrow foot where you might want to\nthink about going half a size\ndown so the aex super Blast 2 and the\naex no blast 5 are both shoes that I've\nreally liked testing this year I think\nthey both fit their roles very well\nwithin the ax lineup with the no blast 5\nbeing more of the mid-range shoe the\ndaily trainer that's designed to be\npretty good value appeal to a wide range\nof Runners have a fairly inoffensive\nride that's actually no very pleasant\nride in fact and one that I think will\nwork for lots of different Runners you\nobvious got a load of cushioning there\nunder foot but it's still a fairly\nlightweight shoe got a slight rocker\nthere that does help you roll through\nyour stri foot strike smoothly and\nactually that's been improved a little\nbit on the no blast 5 compared to the no\nblast 4 for me thanks to the redesigned\nheel bevel which is a little bit less\nhuge than the one on the no blast 4\nwhich does make it a slightly smoother\nride but you've got a good foam in the\nMido there which is comfortable but it's\nnot necessarily as responsive as\nexciting as the stuff you are going to\nget on the super Blast 2 for me the no\nblast 5 definitely works best for kind\nof easy runs relaxed da training long\nruns that kind of thing you can pick up\nthe pace in the shoe but you're not\ngetting a huge amount of responsiveness\nout of this foam it's more just the fact\nthat it's a pretty lightweight shoe and\none with a nice rocker that means you\ncan turn your feet over quite well the\nfoam is soft but not too mushy for me so\nI find I can run faster in the shoe\nwithout it feeling like I'm you know\nwaiting through a big wedge of soft foam\nso it's reasonably versatile but\ncertainly not as versatile as something\nlike the super blast which is a kind of\na special shoe so it's obviously a lot\nmore expensive than an overlast 5 it's\nbuild as a super training without a\nplate you've got the huge stack of asx's\nbest foam there the FF turbo plus and\nthat foam just is a lot livelier a lot\nmore responsive and it it really makes\nit a lot easier to pick up the pace in\nthe super blast compared to the no blast\nit's also a lighter shoe than the no\nblast and really you can kind of do\neverything that you would do in the no\nblast you can do it in the super blast\nand then it's got a lot more range in\nterms of that top end speed like it's\nnot necessarily a shoe that I absolutely\nadore running fast in myself because\nstyle of Runner I am I've got a high\nCadence fairly short stride like quite a\nshuffly runner and you know it's a big\nshoe so it's not a heavy shoe but it is\na big shoe and sometimes turning it over\nit can a little bit too boatlike and big\nfor me I actually would be quite Keen\nfor them to shave off a bit of that heel\nbevel on the super Blast 3 as they have\ndone with the no blast 5 I think that\nwould probably improve it a little bit\nfor me but I certainly can pick up the\npace in it I do enjoy running it a lot\nrecently I took it away for a trip was\nthe only shoe I had for everything and\nyou know it's a comfortable shoe to walk\naround in it then can do all the runs I\ndid on that trip at a range of paces and\nit just works all of for all of them you\nknow really very well and you do get a\nmuch livelier feel from the foam in this\nmidsole compared to the one in the nose\nblast 5 so when I was running both of\nthem at the same time that's the thing\nthat really comes across like the super\nblast feels lighter and it feels a lot\npoppier and more responsive under the\nfor foot in particular you get a lot\nmore lift off the toes in general just\nfeels like a you know more exciting ride\ngot a denser foam on the nose blast it\nfeels like a much more solid shoe you\nknow a heavier shoe which it is and one\nthat's a bit more suited just for\ncruising along it is still a pretty\nlightweight shoe like I say and it turns\nover well but compared to the superl you\ncan get a lot more kind of pace and\nliveliness out the shoe and it's also\nstiffer which I think does make it more\ncomfortable that pace that stiffness\nmight detract from the ride a little bit\nat easier PES for some people like I\ndon't really mind it myself you know\nit's not a shoe that's designed for Pure\nComfort but it does feel fine for me on\neasy runs but then the extra flexibility\nyou get from the NOA blast might appeal\nto some people when they're looking at\njust cruising around their daily\ntraining like there's a fairly big wedge\nof foam you get on the super blast and\nit does help with pushing you along but\nit is quite stiff like I say okay so\nyou'll notice that I'm still not holding\nup the super Blast 2 because Mike still\nhas it so I need to go and get that off\nhim at some point desperate to get that\nshoe back so I can do some training um\nfor uh Dubai Marathon uh that's coming\nup in a few weeks uh so these two shoes\nare shoes that um if you if I reviewed\nthe no blast 4 and the super Blast 2 and\ncompared them they're quite similar in a\nin in in how they run they both have a\nsame level of firmness in the midsole\nthey both have similar level of respons\nand it feels like uh the Nova blast 4\ntook a lot of learnings from the super\nblast um to provide a better all round\nversatile experience for runners um and\nI very much like both of those shoes\nespecially for training uh a longer\ndistance where I want to retain a\nconsistent effort but I still want a bit\nof comfort and a lot of padding as well\nuh the Nova blast 5 uh it's quite\ndifferent than superlast 2 now U because\nthis new midell phone this FF blast Max\nis um a bit softer than what was in the\nNova blast 4 and as a result it changes\nthe ride of the shoe uh quite a bit for\nme in comparison to the to the Nova\nblast 4 the result of that is that um\nit's definitely a lot softer than the\nsuper Blast 2 um but also you don't get\nthat same um turnover that you get in\nthe super Blast 2 Su Blast 2 is a shoe\nthat isn't very soft um and it has a\nquite a rigid midsole so it rolls your\nfoot forward and really helps you\nmaintain a nice fluid Pace I use the\nsuperlast 2 quite a lot for longer\ntraining sessions um where I'm trying to\nmaintain maybe my marathon pace and it\njust really helps you just smoothly just\ncover that pace it's not really\nnoticeable like a carbon plate shoe or\nsomething where you can feel the the\ncarbon plate doing something uh to to\nimpact the way that that you're running\nit's just a really smooth motion very\ncomfortable nice level of padding for\nrunning at PACE and doesn't in any way\num sap your energy or slow you down or\nanything like that but still retains a\ngood level of comfort as well uh the no\nblast 5 is a Sho that um because of this\nsofter midell foam it doesn't work so\nwell as the no blast 4 or the super\nBlast 2 when you are uh running faster\nbecause for me it feels like I'm hitting\nthat a little bit too hard um and I'm\nnot getting a lot back there's a little\nof energy return you get back from this\nphone when you're running at a slower\nPace or more of a consistent Pace but\nwhen you're picking picking up the speed\num I feel like I'm really putting too\nmuch pressure into that mid cell Pham\nand it's not giving it me back it's it's\nit's sapping the energy a little bit um\nwhen I'm running faster uh I think\nthat's really the the the key to what\nthe Nova blast 5 is now I think it's\nmore a daily shoe that fits more into\nthat easier realm longer runs maybe\nwhere you just want comfort and you're\nnot trying to pick up the pace or\nmaintain the tempo Pace or anything like\nthat um and and the superlast 2 is all\nall out designed for uh those consistent\nlong run Paces uh it's a fantastic\nmarathon training shoe probably be a\ngreat Marathon shoe I haven't used it\nfor a marathon uh race but the way that\nthe shoe rides is just very fluid very\ncomfortable um but really allows you to\nmaintain a pace which for me for\nmarathan training would be about 4\nminute 30 km uh if I'm going out to do\nlike a 25k 30k long run and and that\nshoe just Smooths your feet and just\nmakes you just be able to do that run\nreally really comfortably without really\nadding anything to it it's a very\nnatural ride as well it's not really\nforcing your foot into a specific\nposition no blast 5 I wouldn't use it\nfor those sorts of runs I think it I'd\nreally feel it after a while it just\ndeadening the the impact and not really\ngiving me a lot back but it is a very\nenjoyable shoe to wear for those easier\nruns or a longer run where you're just\ntrying to just maintain a nice\ncomfortable effort you get a little bit\nof bounce back back it's definitely very\ncomfortable shoot to a but for me it\ndefinitely sits into that realm of\neasier day shoes now um as opposed to a\nversatile option Su Blast 2 is very very\nversatile shoe great for easy runs I\nknow Kieran thinks it's a fantastic easy\nrun shoe I don't use it for easy runs uh\nI prefer a lot more softness when I'm\nrunning easy runs so if I'm just doing\neasy runs I'd probably pick the no blast\n5 but for a shoe that is really really\nwell designed for faster training\nsessions at longer at longer distance uh\nyou can also do a lot more with it so in\nterms of my running time in these two\nshoes I've done over 50k in the Nova\nblast 5 now I have done near to 100\nmiles in the super Blast 2 and what I\nwould say is these are two shoes that\nare very good at being ones that you\njust throw on and they are very easy to\nforget about what's going on in and\naround your foot to be ones that you\nknow really can kind of tick that\nmileage off you know really get that\nrunning time in your feet without really\nthinking too much about it there\ndefinitely are some differences between\nthese two shoes I think does kind of\ninfluence how I would use them how I\nthink a lot of people may end up using\nthem and want to use them I think the\nfirst uh Factor area for me is the\nweights now these aren't heavy shoes\neither than my heavy shoes but when you\nconsider at least for me that the super\nL 2 is you know is a bigger stack shoe\ncomes in a ways in lighter for me than\nno last five you know it just you know\nfeels like it runs a little bit nicer\nwith that weight just handles that\nweight a little bit better now it isn't\nsloppy and isn't heavy or cumbersome and\nthe no blast 5 and it's not a lower\nstack shoe by a huge amount but I just\nfound that you know having that kind of\nlight away on a on a Max taoe is is a\nvery nice kind of experience overall and\nit really kind of kind of feeds into\nwhat you're getting in the midsole what\nyou're getting below you know uh in the\nout soole as well and what that kind of\ndoes for the ride in these shoes I think\nfor me the no blast youve got the FF\nblast Max for me it's spread across a\nkind of larger surface area and what\nthat does first and foremost is just\ncreate something that is a lot or kind\nof naturally very stable I think it's\nalso a lot sof the feeling than the kind\nof dual density mids cell makeup in the\nsuper Blast 2 I think that what does for\nme the no blast 5 it just you know\nComfort is the first thing it ticks off\nit rolls through very nicely very\nsmoothly and for me when I've running it\nI found it felt more comfortable to do\nthat kind of easier and moderate Paces\nwhen I've tried to run a little bit\nquicker in it it's not you know been\ntotally uncomfortable to do that but\nI've just felt that when I've tried to\ndo that in the super Blast 2 it's felt\nmore at home it's felt more depth and\nthat's really down to that midsole that\ndual density midell being you know\nthere's some softness there but there's\ndefinitely some firmness as well too\nthere's some bounce as well I think\nthere a more prominent bounce for me in\nthe super blast 2it I think the rocker\nis more prominent as well you know the\nrocker is pretty good in this in the no\nblast 5 but I think coupled with all the\nthings that you're getting in these\nsuper Blast 2 it just rolls through a\nlittle bit more aggressively for me and\nI've raced in it I've done track\nsessions in it I've done faster sessions\nI've done shorter and long kind of runs\nin it as well and I felt it's covered\nyou or felt comfortable to do it at all\nof those Paces I think the other thing I\nmentioned other videos I think\ntransitioning from those different Paces\nyou know the super Blu does a very good\njob of that and that's why is kind of a\nstandout do it all shoot I think the\nNova blast five for me when I have tried\nto mix the Pacers in a single run I\nhaven't found it as comfortable I\nhaven't found it as Lively and bouncy\nbarring the first run that I did in it\nbut it's a definitely good experience in\nboth these shoes just for very different\nruns so I think these are good daily\ntrainer shoes you know relatively kind\nof big stack shoes as well for me there\nclearly one that is a little bit more\nversatile and a little bit more friendly\ntowards running a little bit more Tempo\nand faster um but definitely good shoes\nfor me other areas I think the out Souls\nI think you know for me I think the no\nblast 5 is giving you a little bit more\nrubber on that outsole and I think\ndurability wise I'm seeing less wear\nobviously less running time but for me\nthe super plus 2 has been H holding up\npretty well obviously still getting some\nexposed areas there's definitely a bit\nmore more rubber on the Nova blast 5 for\nme in those kind of similar areas as\nwell so for me from a you know\ndurability point of view I think you're\ngoing to get a bit more from no blast 5\ngripping has been fine for me I've run\nin kind of wetter and drri conditions\nfor both these aren't the best kind of\nyou know Road running outsoles available\nbut they seem to be up to task or have\nbeen up to task in my run so yeah two\nvery good shoes two very good Asic shoes\ntwo very good daily trainer shoes but\nit's definitely one that I pick of the\nother that's not to say the other one is\nbad but I just think the other or\nthere's one shoe here that works a\nlittle bit better for me and I'll get to\nthat in my verdict so in testing I've\nrun north of 30 mil in the new Nova\nblast 5 I've run much more in the super\nBlast 2 including a full Marathon test\nin this shoe that's on the channel now\nif you want to go and find it all of\nthat has been across a range of paces\nand terrain I also did a side bys side\nMile with one shoe on each foot to\nreally tease out the differences between\nthese two shoes and here's how that went\nso I've just done my side by side Mile\nwith the super Blast 2 on my right foot\nI've got the Nova blast\nfive on my left foot minute you put the\nshoes on you feel the higher stack in\nthe super blast you can feel that\nthere's that extra stiffness and\nfirmness in the midsole compared to the\nsofter novablast 5 which feel sort of\nsinky when you first put them on by\ncomparison superlast to sort of you know\nthey're cushion but they sort of hold\nyou up and you're expecting that kind of\nstiffness and that roll through and that\ntransition to come uh as a result of a\nslightly kind of stiffer ride there's a\nmore immediacy as a result of that\nthey're both big Cush C shoes though I\ndon't think the superlast 2 you know\nsacrificing that much cushion for me\nanyway they it does feel like a bigger\nshoe on the foot there's a lot more kind\nof heft to it doesn't feel quite as\nNimble you know it's a thing to say that\nNOA blast feels a bit more compact by\ncomparison because the Nova blast is not\na compact shoe by any stretch of the\nimagination but it does feel I mean\nthey're about the same weight but I\nwould say the no blast 5 actually feels\na bit lighter I think it's just because\nyou've got more of the superlast underf\nfoot stability wise I quite like the\nfirmness of the super Blast 2 I think\nthat provides a bit more of a stable\nplatform for me a bit more reliability\nyou do feel a little bit of mush and\nwobble I think into the Nova blast five\nif anything I expected over blast 5 in\nmy head for the runs that i' done with\nit initially to be a bit more like the\nsuper Blast 2 but actually I think the\nover blast 4 which had that kind of\nslightly additional stiffness firmness\nunderf foot now feels much more like the\nsuper blast than the Nova blast 5 does\nthe Nova blast 5 brings softness so how\ndoes that translate then well if you've\nrun in the super blast to if you've\nwatched reviews and you've thought\nactually maybe they might be a little\nbit too stiff for you to go Long Haul\ninto the long miles and you wanted more\nsoftness and the Nova blast 5 is going\nto add that it gets to the energy in a\ndifferent way though it's slightly more\nreliant on a sink and a bounce for the\nenergy to come back where you get a lot\nof energy and bounce from the super\nBlast 2 but you also get a little bit of\nthat kind of immediacy from the\nstiffness that comes so it's a bit\nquicker to respond it's a bit punchier\nas a result there's a bit more kind of\ntop speed potential I think of the\nsuperlast 2 it's overall just a bit more\nof an energetic shoe where the Nova\nblast 5 now I think bit more cushioning\nprobably bit more accommodating for\ngoing slower and longer whereas the\nsuper Blast 2 is probably better you\nknow cruising those kind of tempo Paces\nmaybe a little bit higher up if you\ndon't mind running in a big shoe that is\nhow I would divide those shoes but we'll\ndo the verdict back in the\noffice it comes to my verdict like these\nare both good shoes and shoes that fit\ntheir roles well within the aex lineup\nif you are looking for one shoe\nabsolutely everything and you want\nyou're prepare to pay for a special\nfeeling under fit you are going to get\nit with a super blast 2 like it's a\npretty amazing shoe it's not one that's\nentirely to my taste like I've picked\nout shoes that I prefer to it that are\nalso you know really fun all rounders\nand all that but it's certainly an\namazing shoe one that I do like running\nin and one that obviously is very\npopular with people at large like if you\nare just looking for one shoe to do\neverything the super blast is the one to\ndo it in if you're looking for a fast\ntraining shoe then the super blast is\nthe one to pick over the no blast the no\nblast is certainly better value you can\nuse it for the same kind of runs as the\nsuper blast you're just not going to get\nthe same energetic ride feel and is a\nbit more kind of cushy and relaxed when\nit comes to easy runs like you're\nlooking at putting these shoes in a\nrotation superlast either could be you\nknow a rotation killer a shoe you're\nused for everything or one that fits\ninto rotation in the middle of it there\nlike picking up the bulk of your mileage\nwith a maybe a very easy comfortable\ncushion shoe for some easy runs and then\na fast plated shoe for you know really\ntop end Speedy stuff whereas the no\nblast 5 I position more towards the\ncushion end of things in a rotation I'd\nwant to have you know a faster training\nshoe alongside this and maybe a racer as\nwell though you can use it for a bit of\neverything like it doesn't really have\nthe pace that I'd be looking for in an\nallrounder if you are a newer runner\nthough I think the no blast 5 is a\nreally good allrounder actually I think\nit's one that will protect the legs well\nbut is fairly lightweight you can use it\nfor some Speedy stuff like if I was a\nnew Runner I wanted one you to do\neverything I would get the no blast\nfirst before know spending loads of\nmoney on something like the super blast\nI think the no blast does play a role in\nbeing you know a cheaper version of the\nsuper blast in a way and it is a fair\nbit cheaper but the super blast you know\nyou are paying more for it but you are\ngoing to get a big upgrade in\nperformance if you do spend that money\nokay so my verdict on the super Blast 2\nand the Nova blast 5 is\nobviously the super Blast 2 is a much\nmore expensive shoe um so if it came\ndown to cost and the fact that it's\nalmost impossible to buy the super Blast\n2 and I know many of you will comment on\nthis video uh saying that you can't get\nhold of it sorry about that there's\nnothing we can do to get them to stock\nmore super blast 2os um but because of\nthat no blast 5 is probably going to be\nthe only option for most people anyway\nif even if you could get it it's a very\nexpensive shoe2 200 is a lot of money to\nspend on a training shoe um which is\nabove a lot of people's budget so the no\nblast 5 comes in under that it's a shoe\ndesign for more General Runners it's a\nshoe design for people that don't want\nto spend \u00a3200 on a running shoe um but\nit's not as good a shoe um obviously uh\nit's a lot significantly cheaper than\nthe super Blast 2 um if I was looking at\npurely the shoes themselves and ignoring\nthe price and the availability of them I\nwould say that super Blast 2 is a far\nsuperior shoe um for most runs if you're\ngoing to go out and buy a shoe then you\nwanted something that you could do a lot\nof stuff in easier runs daily sessions\nfaster sessions um long runs super Blast\n2 just ticks off all of those really\nreally well noas 5 doesn't really take\noff all of those well at all it really\nticks off the easier runs and the\ncomfortable training sessions the daily\nruns where you just want a nice bit of\nsoftness uh and comfort and you want to\ntake off the miles uh in as much um with\nas much padding and and comfort as you\ncan get um but it's really not a huge\ndesign for versatility or uh it's defin\nnot sure I'd use if I was training for a\nmarathon I was doing lots of longer\nsessions or faster sessions so I think\nit really comes down to that if you're\nlooking between these two shoes and\nyou're not worried about price or\navailability but obviously if you're\njust a general Runner that's looking for\na comfortable daily shoe you're not\ngoing to go for the superlast 2 because\nit's just so expensive uh and hard to\nget so out of for me I'm going to go\nsuperlast 2 all the way but I understand\nthat the no plus 5 is a more cost\neffective option but it's limited to\neasier sessions you can't really do a\nlot in this shoe after my first run in\nthe no blast 5 where I ran well and the\nNOA blast 5 gave back good energy I was\nwondering if they might be a more\naffordable alternative to the super\nBlast 2 a sort of super blast light if\nyou will but after logging many more\nmiles in both shoes I don't think that's\nquite the case here both shoes are\nenticingly versatile but the superlast 2\nis by far the more energetic shoe with a\nsmoother ride and I think a more\nconsistent punch across all the ranges\nof pace the no boss 5 has energy and\nit's also a capable Cruiser but but for\nme the softer Edge just isn't quite as\nencouraging as the ride you get from the\nsuper Blast 2 it just doesn't quite give\nyou that extra oomph I actually think\nthe Nova blast 4 runs more like the\nsuper Blast 2 it's a bit firmer a bit\nsnappier now The Sweet Spot for the Nova\nblast 5 and the super Blast 2 is really\ncruising from around my marathon pace up\nto Tempo there's enough cushion on both\nshoes to eat easy miles in relative\nComfort too I could Long Haul in both of\nthese shoes but I find both shoes can\nget a bit sluggish at my very slowest\npace at least when I'm running in my\nheaviest form when it comes to the\nfastest training both shoes can be a bit\ntoo much shoe on the foot I find for me\nto want to tackle things like all out of\nintervals again you can do these\nsessions in either shoe but I wouldn't\nsay either of them really excels at it\nover and above some other shoes now the\nsuperl 2 is a better shoe all round the\ngrip Superior the ride is snappier but\nif you're on a budget could you cover\nthe same runs in the over blast five the\nanswer I think is probably yes would\nthey be as good I don't think quite if\nyou're taking money out of the question\nI'd certainly choose the superlast two\nout of these two shoes I think on\nbalance is the more accomplished all\nrounder and the slightly snappier ride\nwhich appeals more to the way I run so\nmy take with you should go the A6 blast\n5 or the as6 super Blast 2 now the first\nthing I'll say is that these are two\nvery good daily trainer shoes if you're\ntelling me which one is the best it's a\nno-brainer it's a super blast too this\nis the shoe if you want a shoe that can\ndo uncover all of your runs and do it in\na really good way then that's what the\nsuper Blast 2 is going to give you in\nterms of the Nova blast 5 being a super\nblast light I think it works for some of\nthe runs that the super Blast 2 works\nwell at but not all of them I think this\nis a shoe you get if you you know can't\nget hold of the super Blast 2 you want a\nshoe that's accommodating that is\ncomfortable works for shorter and longer\nruns and I think for me easy to moderate\nPaces that's really where you know it\nfits best for me so if that's what would\nwork for you that's what you would look\nfor in a daily trainer Sho and go for\nthe over blast 5 if you want the best\nshoe between these two shoes the one\nthat can work for faster Paces longer\nruns shorter runs could be used for\ntrack sessions as well it's a super\nblast 2 you1 I appreciate it's hard to\nget a hold of but if you can you're\ngoing to be rewarded with a very good\ndaily Trainer shoe that weighs in at the\nkind of standard daily trainer weight\nand overall it's just a very good shoe\none of my favorite shoes to running or\nto have running this year so for me if I\ncould get a hold of it and you know I'm\nfortunate that I do have one\nI would be going for the super Blast 2\nif you wanted a shoe that you know and\nthat daily trainer profile that\ndefinitely Vees towards being more\ncomfortable but can definitely work for\nshorter and longer runs easy to modate\nPaces I'd be going for the Nova blast 5\nokay so there you have it that our take\non how the Nova blast 5 compares to the\nsuper Blast 2 if you got any questions\nabout either of these shoes or other\nshoes you want to see them compared to\ndo let us know in

  "text": "hey this is Mark from the ressers I'm\nhere with Nick and kieren and in this\nvideo we're going to be talking about\ngreat smart watches for runners now this\nyear for our top running watch picks\nwe've decided to do things slightly\ndifferently so we've broken things out\ninto individual categories to make\nthings a little bit more digestible so\nif you are a beginner Runner and you're\nlooking for a great affordable running\nwatch we've got a video for that if you\nare looking for a great value running\nwatch whether that's a cheap end or the\nkind of more premium end we've got a\nvideo for that as well too got a video\ndedicated to mid-range watches high-end\nwatches and this Smartwatch video as\nwell okay so let's get straight into it\nand we're going to go straight into our\nfavorite Smartwatch I think we've been\nunanimous in terms of our pick here and\nthat is the Apple watch Ultra 2 now the\nApple watch Ultra 2 launched last year\nthis year we got a bit more of a lowkey\nupdate we got a new color version now\nthe Apple watch Ultra 2 is the biggest\napple watch that you can get in terms of\nApple watch's Apple's collection this is\nthe watch that's got dual band GPS this\nis the watch that's got comparison to\nthe Apple watch Ultra a much brighter\ndisplay it's got Apple's latest chip in\nhere as well too and that's really about\nkind of enhancing the performance the\nprocessing enabling kind of better\nintegration with Siri uh and just\ngenerally giving you a better experience\nyou're getting the same battery life as\nthe Apple watch Ultra 2 now I think as I\nsaid we've been unanimous in terms of\nthis being our pick of the top\nSmartwatch for runners now Nick maybe\nI'll start with you first why have you\npicked this why was this our pick as our\ntop Smartwatch for run is uh so I've run\nwith an Apple Watch for many years even\nwhen it was the series version the Apple\nwatch Ultra brought some things that\npeople I think have been asking for a\nlong time in terms of having an extra\nbutton to take Laps on that kind of\nthing but actually I think the biggest\nwork I mean the hardware on this watch\nis great the Dual bound GPS is very\naccurate you got a pretty good heart\nrate M monitor it's comparable to most\nwatches which is up and down at times\ngot the action button and then the\nsoftware that Apple just keeps working\non and I think that's what really makes\nit stand out in the Smartwatch world\nlike I just don't think I've come across\nother Smartwatch companies making as\ngood adjustments to their native\nworkouts app in terms of approving the\nstats available the data screens going\non and then the Apple watch Ultra like\nall Apple watches opens you up to the\nApp Store and this is where a game where\nApple has such a big lead on other\nSmartWatches because the App Store is\njust Laden with amazing running apps\nthat are designed specifically for the\nApple watch so you basically end up with\na very capable tracker as a native\ntracker but everything that you kind of\nmight be missing out on compared to\nsports watches aside from battery life\nwhich is still not great obviously as\nit's a smartwatch you can find in the\nApp Store for apps like work outdoor and\nUr and many other apps I've talked about\nmany times and things so I think that's\nwhat you get with the Apple watch you\nget a very good tracker with very good\napp store and just the hardware on the\nultra too does make it a big step up on\nthe series 10 because you've got that\ndual band GPS and the lp button which is\nyou know some people never use LP\nbuttons I guess if you're not you know\nand if you're just using apps that have\nguided workouts in like Runner you might\nnot worry about it too much but for\nsomeone like myself going down the track\na lot it's very nice to have a lap\nbutton it's just something that I think\nis a bit of an essential all around so\nyeah I just I think as smart watches go\nit TI Pi all the boxes in terms of a Run\nTracker as well and it is a very serious\nsports watch that also happens to be a\nvery very good Smartwatch yeah and just\nto add that obviously with the Apple\nwatch you are getting something that\nruns on watch OS and with watch OS we\nare seeing Apple I've seen Apple kind of\ndelve a little bit more into the kind of\ntraining analysis side things so we're\nseeing training load added as a metric\nwe're seeing effort added as a metric as\nwell so apple is kind of moving in that\ndirection now Karen how have you found\nyour experience with the Apple watch\nUltra 2 and in terms of your testing\nover the year yeah I mean next covered\noff a lot of those sort of highlights I\nthink bigger battery life more rugged\nbuild uh the action button I find when\nyou don't have it on the Apple Watch\nseries 10 you kind of miss it it's one\nof those things that when it first came\nout I was like what's the big deal but\nif you do use it you do miss it when you\ngo back battery lives are key for me I I\ntested this actually back I did three\ndays around Lake Garder with the Apple\nwatch ultra um up against I think a\n4Runner\n965 so it was running like 7 hours a day\nand I wanted to really test whether or\nnot the Ultra battery life would work\nfor going sort a longer distance and it\ndoes you know it will cover that so now\nyou you finally kind of got an Apple\nWatch where if you're thinking about\ngoing to you know going to 50ks and\nBeyond you've got something that can\nkind of cope you know an average 1 hour\nmax accuracy run Burns around sort of\nbetween sort of five and 9% for me\ndepending on what I'm using during and\nthen you just got all of the other tools\nthat if you're going to go on an\nadventure one thing I real life it's got\nyou covered for and if you're doing\nsomething like a solo late Garder run\nyou could pop in you could use all the\ncontactless payments you've got your\ncalls you've got all the stuff that you\nreally need to be free and and and and\nrun without sort of having to carry\nloads of other stuff as well which I I\nreally like um the other thing I do I do\nreally like the way that they've done\nthe training load and the RP basically I\nthink having the ability to tweak the\nhow you felt that run went with your um\nperceived exertion and put context to\nthat data is something that a lot of\nother watches they might give you the\nsmiley faces but I think Apple's done it\nreally well and they used it to change\nthe readings in a in quite a good\nstructured way I really like that yeah\nand I think my experience and I think\nthe reason that I've picked it as well\nis that my experience has just been\nsolid I mean I wish there was another\nSmartwatch out there that I felt that\ncould really rival what I seen with the\nApple watch Ultra and the ultra 2 but I\nhaven't seen anything yet in terms of my\ntesting and when I've kind of picked\nthis watch back up and I've been out\nrunning with it again it just feels in\nterms of that experience the blend of\nSmartwatch and those kind of running\nwatch features whether it's kind of the\nNative tracking or whether that's you\nknow getting tracking support for one of\nyou know the extensive App Store that\nyou have and in that App Store there is\nhigh quality apps that really do enhance\nthe run tracking experience on the Apple\nwatch Ultra 2 I think it just makes it a\ncomplete package and you know the\nbattery life isn't you know what I\nultimately would want it to be but I\nthink in terms of pushing things forward\nand it is the best battery life that\nyou're going to get on an Apple watch\nright now then I think you know it's a\ncompromise that I think I'm willing to\nmake knowing the experience I'm going to\nget from that kind of Smartwatch and run\ntracking side of things now this year we\ndid get a new Apple watch now obviously\nthe Apple watch Ultra 2 just got a new\ncolor we did get a new Apple watch Ser\nwas a bit more of a radical design we've\ngot a much bigger case you know probably\ninfluenced by the fact that the you know\nyou're probably seeing more Ultra\nwatches out in the world we now got a\nbigger version of the series 10 that\ndoesn't have the kind of dual band GPS\nthat the ultra has but it has got a very\ngood kind of Performing GPS mode in\nthere it's got all the kind of qualities\nthat you see from a software point of\nview that you get on the Apple watch\nUltra 2 now we've all tested the Apple\nWatch series 10 and you know what have\nyour experiences been with it and Karen\nI'll go back to you first in terms of\nyour experience the series 10 yeah I\nmean the one thing that I think stands\nout for me is that even though you\nhaven't got that um dual frequency or\nyou know duel band GPS the performance\nwas actually really good I did it of and\nup against the Apple watch Ultra 2 and I\ncouldn't really find too much to choose\nbetween the heart rate performance is\nreally good as well in this you know\nthat that idea it's kind of it's thinner\nand lighter and more comfortable to wear\nand you're not having to sacrifice\nscreen real estate for it is a plus and\nI think it's like a nice Counterpoint\nnow to the Apple watch Ultra if you do\nwant to have something that's going to\nbe a bit lighter and a bit simpler it's\nalso significantly cheaper which I think\nis another standout you're going to\nsacrifice battery life for that I think\na 1 hour run for me was 7 to 8% it does\nburn much quicker the the rapid charge\nthough is another thing that if you're\nthinking about that all sort of day use\nyou're probably going to have to charge\nbut if you put it on for 5 10 minutes\nhere and there that does actually offset\nquite a lot of the battery life problems\nthat you might have from the Apple watch\nUltra with a bit of targeted charging so\nyou can alleviate some of that which is\na big plus we would like to see more\nobviously but I think this this now with\nthe the kind of performance in the App\nStore backed onto it if you're looking\nfor something that's a bit more\nlightweight bit easier to wear not quite\ngot that kind of rugged build then this\nactually is a really good performer cool\nNick now you've used all of the series\nwatches now do you do you feel like the\nseries 10 is a watch you could turn to\nand say you know this is a watch I would\nhappily rely on to track my runs yeah I\nmean I would I do think it has it's like\nproblems compared to the Apple watch\nUltra 2 I love the I like prefer the\ndesign to the Apple watch Ultra 2\nbecause it is smaller and thinner and I\nlike the look of it a bit more as well\nobious it's not as rugged but that's not\nsomething I'm too worried about like you\ndo lose some stuff that the lap button\nis a big loss you can get around it with\napps that use both buttons at the same\ntime and tapping the screen but I would\nwish I do wish they'd add that I wish\nthey'd add Precision start to the native\nwork app as well that just you know you\ncould actually say when you want to\nstart a workout you know when GPS is\nlocked on stuff like that but I do I do\nnotice a little bit of a drop off in in\nGPS accuracy like not you know General\nrun so much but if I'm going to go and\ndo a series of intervals especially\nrunning around like a loop and a park or\nsomething like that I do notice the\nseries 10 would just shave off a few\nCorners more and just affect the pacing\nand sometimes a little bit like that but\nit's not a big loss like if it was just\nthe only watch I was wearing I'd\nprobably be fairly happy wearing it for\neverything but it's a watch I think you\nhave to make you have to fake a few more\ncompromises on compared to the Apple\nwatch Ultra 2 so you really want this\namazing Smartwatch experience which you\ndo get with it it's got all the great\nsmarts and everything like that it's got\nall the great apps but you got to work\nout a way to take a lap and you've got\nto do things like that which you don't\nhave to do so much with the ultra 2 and\nthe battery life like for most of the\ntime it's absolutely fine like most days\nI've got no concern at all about finding\na quick period here and there to charge\nbut if you go and do tra if you go\ntraveling or just go away for a weekend\nit's a bit of a more of a complicated\nissue compared to the Apple Ultra 2 so I\ndo think it's an amazing watch I think\nit's a very good Run Tracker I do think\nthe ultra does offer a level up for\nrunners but at twice the prices you know\nthat's a little tricky maybe to make a\ncall or whether it's worth that extra\nstep up yeah I agree I think it's a very\ngood experience overall the test that\nI've done has been BR and a little bit\nlike Kier and I've been testing or using\nit alongside the Apple watch Ultra too\nthere definitely are some differences\nbut they weren't for me the kind of\nreally kind of huge differences I would\nthink for a lot of people the Run\nexperience would be very good I think\nthe main thing I would take away is I\nfeel that if you wanted a bigger Apple\nwatch you you kind of looked at the\nApple watch ra Ultra 2 and felt like it\nwas a big watch to live with I feel like\nthe the size difference on the Apple\nWatch series 10 the largest version I\nthink will probably work a lot more for\na lot more people so I think that's\nthat's something to factor in as well\nbut the app watch Ultra 2 is the Watch\nUltimate that we have picked as our top\npick now before we are accused of going\nall in apple we are going to talk about\nAndroids um and I think mainly I think\nit's me who's been kind of testing a lot\nof the Android stuff there's been a lot\nthere's always a lot of Android\nSmartWatches that launch you know we've\nhad stuff from you know Samsung had new\nwatches xiaomi we've had stuff from\nOnePlus we've had stuff from Google we\nhaven't tested the Google pixel watch so\nwe haven't had that in test so we can't\nreally going of talk about that watch\nbut there has been some good watch and\nwe've you know me personally I've got\nthrough a lot of them I think you know\nin terms of having there being standout\nones that offer a good balance of\nSmartwatch and running watch featur I\nstill think we are looking for that\nreally kind of ultimate kind of option\nthat really kind of seeks parity with\nthe Apple watch Ultra 2 we are going to\ntalk about one watch that has was\nprobably probably the most notable kind\nof Android launch this year and that was\nthe Samsung Galaxy watch Ultra which\neffectively was Samsung's answer or you\nknow it was meant to be Samsung's answer\nto the Apple watch Ultra now it had that\nkind of rugged design the kind of big\ncase it's got dual frequency GPS had\nkind of root import and navigation\ndidn't have the kind of full native\noffline mapping support that you now do\nget um you know whether it's through\napps or kind of uh natively on the Apple\nwatch and you know the battery life as\nwell a little bit like the Apple watch\nUltra wasn't you know that kind of\nMammoth battery numbers that maybe were\nexpecting see in Samsung Galaxy watch\nUltra now kieren you tested this uh as\nwell what was your experience of using\nSamsung Galaxy watch Ultra what did you\nmake of it do you think Samsung is on to\nsomething in terms of having an\nequivalent to the Apple watch Ultra yeah\nI mean I have to kind of confess this is\nthe first time I've really used a an\nAndroid watch in a long time and I'm\nobviously in the Apple universe so it's\na bit of a jarring experience when you\nfirst go across to it I think there's a\nyou know BR agreement that this is the\nbest uh were s watch for running there's\nsome really nice things that are robust\nbuild you've got that you know that\ntitanium chassis You've Got A nice\nbright screen you've got a wide\nselection of apps you've got the Apple\nesque Action button all those things are\nthere and those are nice things I think\nyou're going to have to like a big Hulk\nand great watch though to wear this I I\nfound it uh too big a little bit\ncumbersome bit too chunky I thought the\nstrap was thick and not very malleable\nand there's just little touches which I\ndidn't quite get along with and my\nbiggest problem with it really I found\nin my experience was you had this kind\nof weird sort of um hit and miss battery\nlife where sometimes it performed well\nso whilst I was running for up against\nthe Apple watch Ultra 2 it actually\nperformed better for over an hour run\nbut then it would just wipe out in half\na day on me and some days it would some\ndays it wouldn't and that was a bit of a\nworry don't know I watched it wasn't\nworking but it just wasn't quite there\neven with the Apple watch Ultra 2 though\nI do think there's you know there's good\nexperience here I it wasn't enough you\nknow if I I was looked at this from a\npoint of view would I switch over if I\nwas in the Apple Universe would it\nconvince me to go and get an Android\nphone and go for the for this watch the\nanswers no I can see that it's probably\nthe most capable running watch though on\nthe kind of within the Android kind of\nworld yeah I think this is probably the\nkind of best performing Samsung\nSmartwatch I've used for running but\nsaying that it hasn't been perfect I\nthink the test I did I think I did a\nrace test with the Apple watch Ultra and\nfrom a GPS point of view it just didn't\nkind of you know kind of sit up with the\nApple watch Ultra too and I think from\nyou know from that point of view that\ncore run tracking experience and you\nknow obviously looking at the kind of\nmapping and navigation support which\nisn't really there which I you know\nexpect to see on that this watch wasn't\nthere and you know my experience of the\nbattery life performance was very\nsimilar as well it was very indifferent\nvery inconsistent Samsung do a good job\nof kind of rectifying these issues but I\nthink you know in terms of being uh an\nalternative to the Apple watch Ultra 2\nit's not quite there yet I'd be\ninterested to see how some with how\nSamsung kind of develops it and whether\nit's going to continue because they kind\nof chop and change in terms of the types\nof watches and ranges they do but I\nthink it yeah it didn't quite I think\nwork for us I think we could we can\ncomfortably say I think for myself and\nKieran so if you are looking for an\nAndroid equivalent in terms of the\nwatches that we've tested one we're\ngoing to say that is a good one to look\nat is the amazed fit T-Rex 3 now the\nT-Rex range is effectively amaz fits\nkind of outdoor range and it's really\ntrying to undercut what you would get\nfrom outdoor watches like the Garman\nPhoenix which obviously is very\nexpensive you know things like the polar\ngrit 2x Pro and this is kind of sitting\nbelow \u00a3300 now for below 300b you\ngetting dual frequency GPS you are\ngetting offline maps you are getting\nsomething that works with Android and\niOS now from a smartwatch point of view\nit definitely is a work in progress but\nit is learning very quickly and while it\ndoesn't have this app ecosystem around\nit and all these kind of big\nhigh-profile third party apps it's\ntrying to find solutions to make you\nknow the experience of using those kind\nof bigger kind of software and apps more\nusable so you know you're getting apps\nfor things like Spotify you're getting\nthings for son us which will you know\nhelp improve that experience the\nnotification support is very good as\nwell too you're getting a music player\nin there but you're not getting that\nkind of offline music playback that you\nwould get from some other watches but\ncruly the for me the tracking experience\nhas been very good the Dual frequency\nsupport is very good it's not spotless\nit isn't the best used but in terms of\nthe Android Smartwatch I've used it's\ndefinitely felt the most reliable and\nyou're getting very good strong battery\nlife performance here this is a thing\nthat amaz has really tried to do with\nthe T-Rex range it's really tried to\npush towards those kind of numbers we've\nseen from other outdoor watches that you\ndo have to spend a lot more money and\nyou can get strong GPS battery life from\nthe T-Rex 3 you can get good day-to-day\nbattery life the good is definitely you\nknow outweighing the bad in terms of\nwhat you're getting here and I think\nyeah crucially the experience for me of\nall the Android SmartWatches that I've\ntested the T-Rex 3 is being the one\nthat's really stood out of me now there\nare other watches out there that are\nkind of Android and iOS friendly we\nshould also talk about things from Garin\nrange things like the venue range which\nand Tim that's not going to give you all\nthose things like kind of dual frequency\nmultiband mode all of the kind of Rich\ntraining analysis that you would get\nfrom some of the watches we've talked in\nthese other videos but in terms of a\nsmart watch and running watch experience\nyou're getting a good balance there so\nyou know you can look at what is like\nthe venue as another alternative okay so\nthey have it that is our video on the\ntop smart watches for runners now if you\ngot any questions about this video or\nany other watches that we've spoken\nabout do let us know in the comments as\na reminder as we said at the beginning\nof this video we do have dedicated\nvideos to other key running watch\ncategories so if you're looking for a\nbeginner running watch if you're looking\nfor a mid-range a very good value or a\nhigh-end running watch we have videos on\nthe channel dedicated to those as well\nas always like And subscribe hit that\nlittle bell to find out about our latest\nvideos and yeah we'll see you the next\nrun test this video\n[Music]",

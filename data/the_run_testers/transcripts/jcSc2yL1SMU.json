  "text": "hello welcome to run testers my name is\nNick in this video I'm going to be\ncomparing the Nike alphafly 3 and the on\ncloud boom strike\n[Music]\nLS so the alphafly 3 and the cloud boom\nstrike LS version I think are two of the\nbest common plate racing shoes available\nat the moment they're certainly two of\nthe most expensive Caron PL Racing shoes\nat the moment the alpha flight is \u00a3285\nor\n$285 the cloud boom strike LS is \u00a3330 or\n$330 the on is the lighter shoe it's\n1992 G or 6.8 o whereas the Ally 3 is220\nG or 7.7 o got an 8 mm drop with the\nalphafly and then a 4mm drop with the on\nso when it comes to the design of the\ncloud boom strike LS that light spray\nupper is certainly the most kind of\neye-catching part of it you've got this\none piece sock upper that's attached by\na machine to the midsole unit on the\nshoe this light spray upper is the\nreason it's such a lightwe shoe compared\neven to the normal Cloud boom strike and\nI found it a really good fit as well\nwhich we'll come on to later in the\nvideo you've got a Helen HF midsole\nwhich is a PE based foam it's On's you\nknow best foam they're super foam and in\nbetween two layers of that is a carbon\nspeedboard or carbon plate then you've\ngot a rubber out sole with good coverage\non the forefoot and the heel there\nthere's no big midsole cutout on the arm\nwhich is a bit surprising because it is\nsuch a lightweight shoe that big cutout\nis kind of becoming a PA of the course\nwith carbon shoes to try and reduce the\nweight certainly got a big one on the\nAlly 3 there which shows off the carbon\nplate in the middle of the shoe that\ncarbon plate is sandwiched by two layers\nof Zoom XOne as you'd expect with any\nNike racing shoe it's That Bouncy peber\nbased foam and you've got an airom pod\nin the forefoot of the shoe as well to\nadd a slightly more responsive feel in\nthat part of the midsole top of that\nmids soole we've got an atom knit 3.0\nupper with a little bit of padding\naround the heel it's a pretty\nlightweight upper around itself but\ncertainly nothing like the one on the on\nyou've got more padding at the back of\nthe Nike in particular you got a far\nshot rubber out sole good for foot\ncoverage bit of rubber at the heel as\nwell it's been pretty durable for me and\nthe grip has been okay like I say you've\ngot that big manell cut out there to\nbring the weight down a little bit\n[Music]\nso when it comes to the fit of the two\nshoes I've got a uk9 in both of them\nwhich is a US 10 in the Nike a US 9.5 in\nthe on that's the size I generally use\nwith both of these Brands I've used\nacross all of Nike's Racing shoes and\nthe Ally 3 fits me really well got no\nconcerns of it at all you've got a nice\nsnug hold from that atom knit upper that\nyou creates a comfortable feel but also\none that keeps the foot locked down on\nFast runs and there's a nice heel design\non the AL fly 3 as well sometimes Nike\nputs a little thin strip of padding\naround the back of the shoe like on the\nvapor fly 3 and that does tend to\nirritate my kiles sometimes so haven't\nhad any of those problems with the alpha\nfly 3E just a good secure hold obviously\nthe fit of the on cloud strike L is\npretty interesting I've had no concerns\nwith it at all actually it's worked\nreally well for me my foot is held in\nplace well I've got enough room without\nhaving any kind of feeling of looseness\nor worry about it hasn't stretched at\nall after 150k this upper either and\ngeneral it just creates a really nice\nBarely There feel on the foot that you\nknow it's great for racing because you\nhave got enough security enough lock\ndown there I have anyway and I've got\nquite a narrow foot and I haven't found\nthat I've got too much room in this\nupper at all so it is a riskier fit with\nthe on because you know if it doesn't\nwork for you you can't adjust it with\nthe laces or anything like that as you\ncan with the Nike but it does fit really\nwell for me and I've had no problems\nwith it so far so do like the fit of the\ncloud Striker less the upper has really\nworked for me but it's probably one\nthat'll divide opinion a bit more than\nthe more standard atom knit upper on the\n[Music]\nNike onto the run test then and as I\nsaid at the start these are two of my\nfavorite carbon plate racing shoes\navailable at the moment I've done over\n150k of running in both of these shoes\nand raced in both of them two or three\ntimes and I think they're the best\ncarbon plate racing shoes their brands\nhave ever made now I don't think I'll\nget much disagreement about that when it\ncomes to the on Tu because you on hasn't\nhad a great record in making carbon\nshoes and I think the cloud boom strike\nor less is a big step forward than what\nthey've had before along with the\nstandard Cloud boom strike which is just\na little bit heavier obiously with Nike\nI think you get a lot more disagreement\na lot of people really like the outfly 1\nand probably still prefer it to this\nshoe and the vfly 2 and the original\nvfly next perent also very popular shoes\nbut I like the outfly 3 more than all of\nthose shoes I really like the new\ncontinuous midsole design you get on the\nshoe which just creates a smoother and\nfaster transition to me as a heel\nStriker find that I get that nice level\nof propulsion from the big stack of\nzumax foam in the shoe but I get pushed\nonto the pods more directly and more\neffectively with the alply 3 and get you\na really nice responsive toe off as a\nresult Ally has always been positioned\nmore as a marathon shoe and you've got\nthe extra cushioning here compared to\nthe VAP fly even though they have quite\nsimilar stack ites does feel like a more\ncushion shoe a more springy shoe and a\nlot more like zoomx foam under fot with\ngiving you that kind of squishy ride\nfeel that you expect from a Nike racing\nshoe but now I think it just turns over\nthat a little bit more quickly and has a\nalmost vaporfly Edge to it while still\nretaining those kind of alpha fly\nproperties so last year I raced a couple\nof 10ks 5K in it I did like a few long\nruns during marathon training in it as\nwell I did my 10K PB actually last year\nin the Ally 3 and although that was on a\nfriendly course with a big downhill\nsegment in the middle I think it does\nshow that it is now very much an all\ndistance racing shoe I think in the past\nwas positioned more as a marathon shoe\nobviously definitely has the chops of\nthe marathon given the world records\nthat have being set in this shoe and I\nthink it's excels in particular over\nthose longer distances because of the\nextra kind of comfort you have here but\nit's lighter than past Alpha flies\nyou've got that snappier transition and\nI think it's just you know a great\nracing Sho for any distance I think\nthat's all true of the on cloud Striker\nless as well they probably have a few\nmore reservations about it as a marathon\nracer I do think it'll be an excellent\nMarathon shoe but maybe some would want\na slightly higher level of protection\nbut it was a big surprise to me this\nshoe like obviously the upper attracts a\nlot of attention which has worked very\nwell for me as I mentioned in the fit\nsection but really it's the upgrad and\nmidsole you get here compared to past on\nshoes that make this you know a special\nand impressive racing shoe it's not as\nsoft as the out don't get as much\nsinking and squish for sure but you've\ngot a really Lightning Fast turnover and\nreally respons it feel off the toes and\nI do think there is enough cushioning\nand comfort there as well you know you\ngot big stack of foam here it isn't as\nsoft as the Nike but it is still you\nknow nice and comfortable Under Foot I\nhave raced a half marathon in the\noncloud beam Striker L which would\nprobably be my best half marathon ever\nif they didn't get the course slightly\nwrong near the end so it ended up being\nyou know not a correct distance but I\nreally liked how it felt in that race\njust it just it was very easy to keep\nturning my feet over in the second half\nand maintaining a fast pace you got a\nreally fluid ride with a nice bit of\npunch off the toes and although you're\nnot getting that big sinking and\ndramatic bounce that you get from the\nalply you are getting a lot of response\nfrom that phone for sure however I do\nthink you get more comfort from the\nalide which I've done you know 20 M run\nin the on by the end of the half\nmarathon thought this is great it's done\nvery well for me here would I take it to\nfull Marathon I think I probably would\nbut I wouldn't necessarily be as\nconfident in doing so as I would with\nthe Ally 3 obviously the on cloud and\nstrike lessers has some very impressive\nresults in the marathon with unsponsored\nathletes but I think maybe for the the\ngeneral Runner crowd not the elites the\nextra cush you get from the AL line\nmight come into play a little bit as you\nhit that longer distance so I did do a\nshort run in both shoes at the same time\njust to kind of gauge those differences\ndirectly and you definitely get a lot\nmore Squish and bounce from the alphafly\nyou know it's got that very noticeable\nride all around you know partly because\nit's a much louder shoe you got that\nclassic alphafly Slappy sound with the\nNike Ally 3 which you don't get with the\non but you do you know if you are\nthinking about Super Shoes and you think\nthat you expect that really big dramatic\nsink in and punch from the plate and the\nfoam coming out again do get that with\nthe alply more so than the on which you\nreally feel the fast turnover in though\nlike it really feels like a very\neffective and fast shoe you're just kind\nof skipping along the ground you know\ngetting that pace back from the midell\nfoam and the plate in there but you\ndon't get such a noce feeling as you do\nwith the alpha fly which has that\nsquishier feeling especially landing at\nthe hill then pushing forward onto that\nfirmer forefoot which then really you\nknow punches you along so yeah this a\ndifferent ride feel for sure but a very\nfast one in both and the on just feel\nthat little bit more Nimble and\nlightweight you know because it is that\nlittle bit more Nimble and\n[Music]\nlightweight it comes to the verdict I do\nthink this is pretty tight and that's\nvery much something I wouldn't have said\nin the past about when I was comparing\nan on carbon shoe and a Nike racing shoe\nand it's not because Nike's Racing shoes\nhave got worse it's because I have\nreally Come Out Swinging with the cloud\nbeam strike and really you know released\na top tier carbon racer in my opinion\nthe on is that a little bit lighter and\nit does remind me of the metas speed Sky\nParis from aex which is my favorite\noverall rating shoe at the moment but I\nthink it's a touch firmer than that shoe\nand I'm not sure it's quite as explosive\nand there are certainly some big\nadvantages to the Nike you know when\nyou're looking at comparing these two\nshoes one is the price which is\nobviously very surprising it's very rare\nthat you can say the alply is a cheaper\nshoe in any comparison but it is a fair\nbit cheaper the fit is just going to\nwork for more people probably I think\njust off the peg because you've got this\nadjustable upper with laces which just\nmakes it a bit of a safer Choice\ncompared to the on I really like the\nupper on the oncloud and Striker less\nbut it is a slightly riskier fit and I\nthink the extra cushioning you get from\nthe alphafly I think if you're looking\nat marathons in particular this is the\nshoe I'd get I think it's the more\nrisk-free Marathon option I think it's\ngoing to perform incredibly well in a\nrace of that distance Theon I think will\ndo as well for lots of people but you\ngot that slightly more cushion feel with\nthe alply more protective feel whilst\nnot really losing any Pace at all\nbecause of the way the foam rebounds and\nreally gives you all that energy back\nand then given the fact that I do think\nthe ALF is a fantastic short distance\nracer as well I think overall I would\ngive it the win in this versus\nespecially I pick out of these two but\nlike I said they're both fantastic shoes\nand if you prefer a slightly more direct\nand lightweight feel in your racing shoe\nthen the cloud beam Striker Al L\ndefinitely provides that whereas with\nthe Nike Al 3 you get more of that\nclassic Super Shoe feel of the big\nbouncy midsole and loads of kind of\nprotection was also having bags of pace\nand what is actually still you know a\nvery lightweight package\n[Music]\nitself as a comparison of the AL 3 and\nthe on cloud boom Striker less let us\nknow what you think in the comments\nbelow please do like and subscribe ring\nthe little bell and we'll see you next\ntime",

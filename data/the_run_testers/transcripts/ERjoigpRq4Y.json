  "text": "hey people welcome to the run test it's\nKieran here now this year I've tested\nclose to 50 pairs of running shoes maybe\neven more I mean I did a rough count\nanyway we've tested a lot of shoes done\na lot of miles and in the next 10\nminutes or so I'm going to whip you\nthrough some of my top shoes of 2024\nit's always a tough job to whittle down\nall those shoes into a list of just five\nand this year the quality I think has\nbeen higher even higher than most many\nof the brands have put out strong\nlineups every brand has at least one\nstandout shoe even the shoes I\npersonally don't get on with the best\nhave been of a very high standard but\nthen there are running shoes that really\nstand out that really fit the way that I\nrun and the types of runs that I tend to\ntake on in training and in racing this\nyear that's been everything from running\na sub three at the Manchester Marathon\nto my fastest 5Ks I've raced Trail\nmarathons and Ultras I've run a 100 mile\nultra on mixed terrain I ran the\ncomrades Marathon a 55 M Road Ultra so\nthere's lots of variety there in the\nruns that I've been doing and in this\nvideo mainly though with going to be\nfocusing on the road shoes now in\ngeneral I tend to prefer firmer more\nimmediate responsive rides rather than\nthe biggest most pillowy soft sinky\nshoes I lean to towards shoes that feel\nmore compact that don't feel like too\nmuch shoe on the foot so the more\nprecise strip back shoes those kind of\nthings rather than the big hulking great\nshoes that's changed a little this year\nas we've seen good bigger stack shoes\nthat manage to kind of balance offering\nbig cushion but also feeling light and\navoid being too cumbersome I enjoy shoes\nthat protect my feet and legs on longer\nmiles but don't try to make the ground\ndisappear altogether I still like to\nfeel connected to the ground with shoes\nthat kind of let you know what's going\non Under Foot but kind of encourage a\nfast foot turnover as well I don't mind\nshoes that still require you to do some\nof the work and I prefer shoes that I\ncontrol where I'm kind of controlling\nthe Run rather than those shoes that\nsort of control you and try and fire you\ntoo much the other thing I'm always on\nthe hunt for is maximum versatility If a\nshoe can coope with a wide range of runs\nthen it really scores highly for me\nbecause it represents good value so with\nthat in mind I've tried to come up with\na fistful of shoes that I've really\nloved this year these are the shoes that\nhave really struck a cord with the way\nthat I run and the way that I race there\nis one caveat here I've not run in many\nshoes from pummer and none from Muno so\nif they're not mentioned here that's why\nthere obviously other shoes that I\nhaven't tested as well so this is a pick\nof the shoes that I've had on my feet\nanyway let's get into it\nfirst on the list then is the aex metas\nspeed Sky Paris now this is one of\n2024's standout shoes it has all the\ningredients you look for in a good\ncarbon ratio at a pretty competitive\nprice you've got light racy Airy uppers\na big stack of really bouncy energetic\nmidsole foam and a stiffness from the\ncarbon plate that adds plenty of extra\npop to your runs I use the metas speed\nSky Paris to set marathon and 5K PBS\nthis year and I think it delivers\neverything that you really want in a\nspeedy shoe for going Allin trying to\nchase those PBS I really like the\nstiffness in the midsole unit along with\nthe just right cushioning I think it\ndampens the road impact without leaving\nyou feeling completely disconnected from\nthe road in some ways it kind of reminds\nme a little bit of the vaporfly next\nperent too it has that kind of direct\nride for me there's a really good\nPrecision to The Landings as well it's\nquite a narrow profile on this it's\nwonderfully agile and if you're\nconfident you're in good racing shape\nI'd certainly say that this is one of if\nnot the best shoe that you can lace up\nright now to go and Chase those fastest\ntimes aex has made its best carbon plate\nshoe yet if it's got one drawback though\nI think if you're not sure you're going\nto hold your form deep into a race\nparticularly over the marathon it might\nnot be the most protective if you get\nheavy and ragged this shoe might hang\nyou out to dry a little more than some\nother carbon races so if you're hedging\nyour bets where you know you're starting\na race well below par I think there are\nbetter shoes to choose for garanteed\nComfort they'll look after you a little\nbit more if you do drop off but I've\nLoved all my runs in the aex metas speed\nSC by Paris and yeah it's been a\nstandout shoe\ntopnotch now regular viewers here won't\nbe at all surprised to see my next shoe\nI've run thousands of miles in the sakon\nEndorphin speed I ran across Europe in\nthe last generation Speed 3 I've done\nhundreds of miles in the Endorphin speed\n4 as well and it's every bit has\naccomplished in my opinion the speed 4\nfeels immediately natural on the foot it\ndelivers a lively Snappy cushion ride\nit's light it's full of energy there's\nno harshness here I think anyway no\nfussy business with the way it feels on\nthe foot and for me this is a genuine\nallrounder you can lace up for almost\nany run it really successfully sort of\nstraddles the world of comfort and speed\nthough fans of bigger softer cushioning\nmight want more protection for their\nvery easiest runs but for me the\nEndorphin speed 4 offers just enough\nprotection just enough Road impact for\nthe easy cruising miles you know I can\ndo that casual two mile around the\nblocking them but it really comes to\nlife when you start kicking up through\nthe gears there's enough response to eat\ntempos top Pace intervals that's where\nthe combination of the responsive Midol\nfoam The Rocker and the nylon plate\nreally kick in for a fast energetic and\nfun feel underf foot if you only want to\nbuy one shoe I think the Endorphin speed\n4 is a great utility shoe it's got your\nback for almost any run and if someone\ntold me I was only allowed to have one\nshoe to do all of my training and Racing\nfor a marathon I think the speed 4 would\nbe somewhere very high on my short list\nanother shoe that's really stood out for\nme this year is the Hoka Mac X2 I've\nraised half marathons in it I've used it\nfor a lot of faster training runs some\neasy while I don't think it's quite as\ncapable as an allrounder as the\nEndorphin speed for it's another pretty\nversatile option that's at its best when\nyou're running from or moving from your\nmiddle to those kind of upper Paces the\nhigher Stack The Tweak plate have\nbreathed some fire into the midsole ride\nand there's now clear daylight between\nthe energy of this and the Hoka Max 6\nthis Speedy daily trainer is really\nreally high quality the midsole changes\nadd up to an improved energy and ride\nversus the first gen hok macx as well\nit's a real gear change so if you felt\nthat wasn't quite Punchy enough this one\ndefinitely delivers I wasn't 100%\nconvinced by the upper Comfort or 100%\nin love with the fit and the heel color\npackage and I think that limits the\namount of time that I really want to\nspend in the macx 2 though I know a\nbeginner Runner who logged a 2hour half\nmarathon in them for their first half\nmarathon in fact and absolutely loved it\nso it might just be me on that and the\nfit definitely doesn't undermine the\nperformance of what is a brilliant shoe\nfor those shorter faster runs I think\nfor me racing a half marathon in this\nwould be it sweet spot for attacking\nruns like up to 90 minutes on feet it's\nexcellent you get a bucket load of fun\nand energy and a speed focused daily\ntrainer that's peier and puntier I think\nthan the sck indor and speed 4 but not\nquite as disappearing on the foot and\nfor that reason I just think they're not\nquite as versatile as the speed 4 but\nstill an excellent allrounder with a\nreally sort of faster\nEdge so it took me longer than the rest\nof the team to get my feet into a pair\nof these the super Blast 2 but once I\ndid I logged loads of Miles very quickly\nand that is a compliment to this shoe I\nran a full 4our solo Marathon around\nLondon in a test I've done intervals\nTempo runs and easy plots and it\nperformed well across all of that this\nshoe has been a surprise one for me\nbecause it is a bigger shoe than I'd\nnormally go for it's kind of a whacking\ngreat beast but it's surprisingly light\nfor a whopping great shoe you get big\ncushion comfort that's soft but not too\nsoggy got a nice roomy toe box you've\ngot balanced heel collar padding here to\nboost the Comfort there's good leg\nsparing energy from the bouncy but\ncontrolled mids for me it's perhaps not\nquite there for my top Pace runs there's\nstill just a bit too much shoe that for\nme to do those kind of really fastest\nruns and I'd reach for a speed 4 or a\nHoka max2 before I chose this one for\nthat kind of top end Pace it can also\nfeel a little soggy at my very slowest\nPace but I'm talking about the ends of\nthe spectrum here in both cases of that\nbut for me where the shoe really excels\nis kind of in the cruising pace and just\na little bit either side of that and\nthat covers the majority of my runs I\nthink that also makes this a potential\nMarathon shoe for many Runners if the\naex metas speed Sky Paris is the kind of\nshoe that you lace up when you know that\nyou can run well and hold form and\nreally go all out then the super Blast 2\ncould be a shoe that you could lace up\nif you're looking for something that's\nmore like a safety net sure that you can\nrun long in safe in the knowledge that\nit will feed back the energy that you\nput in but also it will look after you\nif everything does go wrong if you just\nwant to run a marathon in Comfort this\nshoe is going to do a job or even it\nwill go Ultra I think it is pricey but\nit's another shoe that could cover an\nentire training and racing block for a\nmarathon if you can get hold of\nit my final pick then might be a\nsurprise entry and it's not a shoe that\nscored a lot of headlines but I\nabsolutely love the Hyperion Max 2 from\nBrooks for the way I run I think it's a\ncracking first so shoe up to a point I\nran 40 miles of the Berlin w 100 mile\nultra in this shoe at an easy Pace but\nequally it's light Nimble and works for\nfaster Tempo runs too it's not the\nfastest springiest bounciest daily\ntrainer you're going to find the ride I\nthink is more subtle than that but there\nis response when you push the pace it\nkind of requires you to do some of the\nwork first though you have to run this\nshoe it doesn't run you and that's\nsomething that I really quite like it's\nalso one of those shoes that quickly\nvanishes into the background when you\nput it on and lets you go about your\nbusiness you've got like a tone down\naggression here and the extra cushion\nmakes this sort of adaptable enough to\naccommodate faster and slower miles but\nthe fit and foot feel is really\nexcellent I think that's where it really\nexcels it's light it's roomy it's\ndisappearing without feeling loose it\nsomehow sort of strikes a really happy\nbalance between feelings that racy and\nfeeling roomy now I don't think it's got\nthe top speed of shoes like the sock and\ndwarf and speed forward the Mac X2 it\ncertainly doesn't have the cushioning of\nthe super Blast 2 but I'm going to give\nthis Hyperion Max 2 very high praise\nbecause I think it's a really competent\neasy to run in reliable shoe that does a\nlot and the cheaper price tag I think\nonly adds to the\n[Music]\nappeal so that's my top five of 2024 but\nthere are so many shoes I could have put\non that list some other standouts for me\ninclude the adios Pro 4 from Adidas for\nracing marathons the socer r 17 for\naffordable versatile easy Comfort gear\nto the slowen the Brooks Glycerin Max\nfor that Max cushioned kind of\nExcellence the oncloud Monster hyper I\nthink is also good for Reliable\nlightweight cushioning and comfort and\nparticularly over the ultra distance\nthough it is pricey the new balanced SC\nTrainer V3 very priced in the UK is a\ngood shoe the HX 6 as well are both\nthese are both good allr rounders that I\nwould have in the mix as well so there\nyou have it that's been my top shoe\npicks of 2024 hit me up in the comments\nand tell me what you think what shoes\nhave I missed what shoes have I included\nwhere you think I've got it completely\nwrong are there any that you've not\nliked that I've put on the list what\nhave been your top picks let's hear them\nin the comments if you're interested in\ngood all around versatile shoes I'm\ngoing to pop a video up on the channel\nnow you should definitely go and check\nout otherwise thanks for stopping by and\nuntil next time happy running people",

  "text": "hey Tommy from the R festers I am in\nValencia this weekend so back to do\nValencia Marathon I've done it before\nbut last time I did it I was\nsignificantly slower than I have been\nover my last few marathons so uh I'm\ngoing to give it another go um I'm not\nsure I'm going to be taking my phone\nwith me so that's why I'm recording this\nnow in the dark uh I'm going to be aing\nfor a sub three but I'm not confident\nabout it um and I'm going to be wearing\nthe A6 uh met speed Sky Paris which I've\nonly used up to 10K distance so little\nbit the gamble today really looking\nforward to it weather's meant to be\namazing and yeah I'll be back in a bit\n[Music]\n[Music]\nhe\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay it's 4 days after the Valencia\nmarathon and I am back in the UK now I\nhad planned to record a video after the\nrace but uh I was out there with a few\nfriends and we got a little bit excited\nand decided to go to the bars instead\nand I've been on holiday for a few days\nas well so I haven't actually got round\nto um doing a video and editing it um\nbut Valen marathon is fantastic marathon\nit's one of the few marathons that I've\nactually done twice um me and Nick\nactually did it a few years back before\nwe started the Run testers um and we're\nreally big fans of that race it's very\nquickly becoming one of the most popular\num big marathons um especially in Europe\nand for good reason it's really well\norganized the course is fantastic the\nstart and end point is really really\nimpressive the uh route is really nice\nas well you've got loads to look at it's\nreally wide roads for the most part part\nfrom maybe the first 2 or 3K which can\nget a little bit congested um but once\nyou get out there it really widens out\nthere's loads of water every 5K on the\ncourse there's quite a lot of gels on\nthe course as well they have normal gels\nand caffeine gels I can't remember what\nthe brand is it's um it's not a brand\nthat I've used before I did have a\ncouple of those gels on course and they\nwere absolutely fine organization\neverything fantastic it's one of the\nbest marathons I've ever done and I was\nreally looking forward to going back and\ndoing it again probably the most\nimpressive part of Valencia marathon is\nthe Finish Line uh that goes through the\nscience area Science and Arts um area in\nValencia which is this really modern\nbuiltup artistic looking um series of\nbuildings but the finish line goes\nacross this uh little uh water uh\nfeature which is like a little man-made\nlake uh in the middle of the uh the\ncenter and it looks really impressive\nit's all blue it's all it looks\nfantastic um whenever you see images of\nValencia Marathon you're likely to see\nthat finish point and I put it down as\none of if not the favorite um Finish\nLine that I've ever done in the marathon\nand I've done about 30 something\nmarathons now can't quite remember the\nexact number uh other things to say\nabout the race um obviously this year\nValencia has had a lot of problems over\nthe past few months we weren't entirely\nsure if it was going to go ahead um but\nit did thankfully and it was really well\ndone um and really nice to to get out\nthere and do the race again uh the Expo\nuh that has changed this year so when um\nwe originally did the race back in I\nthink 2019 the um\nwas uh in the same position as the uh\nstart and finish area but it's moved now\nto quite far out of the city so it's\nabout 8 km out of the center which is\nquite difficult to get to uh especially\nat the moment because a lot of the\ntransport is down especially the tubes\num so the um it's quite a quite a tough\nuh trip out to the Expo it's an all\nright Expo it's not not one of the best\nExpos I've ever been to but um it has\nit's it's got everything you'd expect\nfrom a major marath Marathon Expo um and\nit's well worth a visit there's lots of\nbits and pieces going on very similar to\nwhat you get from things like London\nmarathon it's not as big as London\nMarathon Expo but there is quite a lot\nyou can do get t-shirts printed and\nthings like that um other things to say\nabout the marathon is that it's uh\nValencia is a fantastic City to do a\nmarathon in because when um it's nice to\nwalk down at the start it's still\nrelatively warm I walk down in t-shirt\num and uh afterwards you're in the\nmiddle of Valencia and there's loads of\nbars and everything it's really nice\nVibe uh in Valencia um if you're doing\nthe marathon so it's well worth doing\nthe other thing I'd say about Valencia\nis it's becoming increasingly more\npopular um which means that over time\nit's getting more and more likely that\nit's going to get harder to get in so if\nyou're planning on doing a big um big\nMarathon worth getting into Valencia\nearly because it's not a ballot at the\nmoment you can actually um it does it in\nwaves so you get cheaper tickets the\nearlier you get it but over time as it\ngets more and more um popular it's very\nlikely that it's probably going to\nbecome a ballot like many of the other\nbig big marathons I also wouldn't be\nsurprised if at some point it became a\nmajor now there are more Majors\nappearing um because it's really is one\nof the best races out there that you can\ndo now the course itself as I've\nmentioned it's pretty flat it's a really\nreally fast course um and the only thing\nthat really affects Runners out on that\ncourse is the heat if it gets a little\nbit hot later on once you get into the\n22s 23s 24s you can start to feel that\nespecially if you're out for a longer\nperiod of time there is a cut off in the\nrace which I think is about 5 and 1 half\nhours so nobody's out there for like 8\nhours or 9 hours in the Sun but still if\nyou're one of those Runners that's\nrunning around that pace you're going to\nhave a lot more sun U than some of the\nfaster Runners so take that in mind uh\nif you're planning on doing it but if\nyou're okay with the heat um it's a\ngreat place to to go and race and uh\nit's a great time of year to do it start\nof December um people winding down for\nChristmas people looking forward to a\ncouple of weeks off over Christmas it's\na nice little thing to start off the um\nthe period of uh the Christmas period\nwith uh and also it means that um you're\ntraining over the Autumn as well which\nisn't too bad it depends what where you\nlive where you live but uh this year in\num in England it's been bit of a mixed\nbag so there's been a lot of rain so\nit's not been a great training period uh\nover the Autumn this year but we can get\nlucky and it's it can be quite a nice um\ntime to train and you're not have to\ndeal with too much cold weather my race\nuh wasn't that successful so I ran uh\n314 something uh I did want to get a sub\nthree I have trained for this race but\nI've not trained as hard as I did for um\nChicago and Berlin Chicago and Berlin I\ngot 2 hours 55 in Chicago and 2 hours 53\nin Berlin felt great on those races my\npacing was really good for both of those\nnot not as good in Berlin my Chicago was\nperfect uh for this Valencia I did want\nto get sub three but I wasn't really\nsure I'd be able to get sub three um I\nhaven't done as much uh andoy endurance\ntraining long long runs at marathon pace\nas I had done previously and that really\nshowed in the race first half of the\nrace I hit one hour 29 and at that point\nI realized I would struggle to maintain\nthat pace for the rest the rest of the\nuh the marathon there's nowhere to get\ngot a one 12 n after that so mentally I\nwasn't really ready for it also my car\nstarted playing up at around\n23k um and yeah I just struggled after\nthat so I ended up with 314 which I'm\nhappy with I wasn't going for a PB or\nanything like that I just wanted to\nhopefully get under sub three but I was\na bit of a way off from that um so yeah\nmore more training needs to be done I\ndon't think I'm going to massively go\nall out for Manchester marathon in April\nI don't particularly like training over\nthe winter so I think I might take that\nas a bit of a an enjoyable marathon and\nmaybe focus more on a marathon in 2026\nand maybe use 2025 for half marathon um\ndistance and faster efforts over 10K but\nall in all Valencia fantastic Marathon\nfantastic course really well organized\nif you're looking at doing a marathon\nand you want something that's really big\nand exciting like the marathon Majors\nValencia is a great option for that um\nit can be quite expensive uh to F over\nthere if you're going over the immediate\ndates um of the marathon so if you're\ngoing out on like the Friday and coming\nback on the Monday can get very\nexpensive so I spent I went for a bit\nlonger and I actually went over to\nalante afterwards so that I could get um\ndifferent flights back and it's not too\nbad if you if you plan it out like that\nhotel are quite expensive over the\nweekend as well you can get lucky with a\nfew but you really need to book far\nahead to um get some good deals on those\nall in all though fantastic event Nick\nunfortunately couldn't do it he's a bit\ninjured but I did see him on the course\nand he shout at me um but he has done it\nbefore so um right let's dive in and see\nwhat uh kit I\n[Music]\nused okay so the shoe that I decided to\nuse was the aex metas speed Sky Paris\nnow this shoe I have used a few times uh\nI've raced in it but only up to 10K\ndistance uh so I wasn't really sure if\nthis would work for me over the Marathon\ndistance normally I would go for\nsomething like the alphafly 1 socer\nindorfin Pro 3 which is what I have um\nmy two fastest times in in the marathon\nuh but for now I didn't want to use my\nolder shoes one because I don't want to\nkeep using my alphafly ones cuz I want\nto save them for a time when I'm really\nfeel feeling fit and I'm I'm going for a\nfull-on PB um but also I wanted to try\nout one of the new shoes that I've got\nso the to up was between the Met speed\nSky Paris and the CEO X1 um I think I\nmade the wrong choice to be honest um I\nreally like the Met speed Sky Paris and\nthe reason that I went for it is because\neverybody voted for it in the awards\nthat we had a couple of weeks ago um and\nI wanted to see I I voted for it as a\ngreat as a great shoe for running fast\nin but my knowledge of it is for shorter\ndistances I've done intervals and longer\nsessions at faster Pace but I've only\nraced up to 10K in this shoe so um I\nwanted see what it was like and it if it\nworked for me as well as it has the\nother guys both Nick and kieren have got\nPBS uh in this shoe um and it is a great\nshoe it's really fast really picks up\nthe pace nicely nice smooth Motion in it\num for me it just feels like it's\nlacking a little bit of midsole that I\nlike I I I I like a little bit more\nsoftness in the midsole midsole I like\nit a bit of a wider base on it I like to\nreally feel the Squish and the bounce in\nthere I think the metas speed Sky Paris\nhas that um it's just a bit less it's\nmore of a a fast shoe for really uh\nflicking you forward with that carbon\nplate um and the mid Sole for me it's it\nit's not as soft as I'd like from um a\nmarathan shoe what the pace that I run\nwhich is about 4 minute 10 kilometers\nover Marathon distance uh what I'm\nlooking for is to settle into that pace\nreally comfortably uh and just have nice\nfresh legs and just be able to maintain\ntheir pace for a long period that's why\nthe sorin Pro 3 worked well for me it's\nvery subtle shoe that doesn't really\nbound you forward really push you push\nyou on really quickly um but it just\nfeels very comfortable and just to\nmaintain a nice Pace A6 met speed Sky\nParis loved it for 10K cuz I'm going all\nout on those at 3 minute50 um Pace but\nfor the marathon I think it just didn't\nhave the um softness that I needed um\ntowards the uh towards the second half\nespecially and that's partly to do with\nmy fitness at the moment but also I did\nfeel in in the latter half I did feel\nlike I didn't quite get as much softness\nand enjoyment from that mid as I would\nhave got from something like the Ally\none or the uh S dfin Pro 3 but really\nlike this shoe and I'm going to use it\nmore over the next year for shorter\ndistance races because I think that's\nhow it works well for me um but won't be\nusing it for a marathon and I I I think\nI should have used the COO X1 because\nthat's just feels a little bit more like\nthe alpha flly to me a little bit more\nto that mid and a little bit more of a a\nsmoother transition as opposed to a\nfaster transition which is what I'm\ngetting from the uh the aex speed Sky\nParis but great shoe just not quite one\nthat I enjoyed using as much as I\nthought it would based on all of the\nother run testers and their experiences\nin those shoes another thing worth\nmentioning is that I also wore uh monkey\nsocks to Racin fantastic socks those I'm\na bit late uh with the Monkey Talks I\nknow some of the other guys have tested\nthem earlier in the year did mention\nthem in the Christmas guide video\nfantastic socks really really\ncomfortable throughout that race really\nbreathable um had no issues at all they\nfelt great inside the Met speed Sky\nParis um and yeah definitely suggesting\nto anybody who's looking for some really\ngood quality running socks and that\ncomes loads of nice colorways and stuff\nas well so well worth looking at those\nuh if you want some fancy socks so\nthat's it from me on Valencia Marathon\n2024 not as successful as maybe I'd want\nit to be but had a great time love that\nmarathon and well worth doing if you if\nyou're looking for a really big big\nscale nice Marathon that pretty much has\neverything that you'd want from Marathon\nif you want to listen to our podcast you\ncan go to the link in the caption below\nand we will see you soon with another\nvideo thanks lot for watching catch you\nnext time\n[Music]",

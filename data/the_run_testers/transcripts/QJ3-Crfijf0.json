  "text": "hey people welcome to the Run testers\nwelcome to a wet and windy and stormy UK\nthere's been severe weather warnings not\nfor London but all around it's pretty\nmiserable I'm about to head out and do\nmy first run though in the ASX Jael n 27\nwhich arrived just now got to keep\ntesting wead to bring you the videos\ncan't stop for the weather so let's get\nout there in the mix and see how we get\non so let's give you a really quick look\nat what's new and some of the key\ndetails with the aex Joe nimas 27\nstarting with the stack and that's where\nthe biggest change happens the asex Joe\nNimbus 27 stack height now comes in at\nan increased 43.5 m in the hill 35.5 m\nin the 4 foot for an 8 mil drop which is\nthe same but that's 2 mm more midsole\nfoam across the foot using the same\nflight foam blast Eco plus foam but with\na tweak recipe that allows for more\ncushion without adding weight speaking\nof weight the nimbers 27 weighs in at\n10.8 o or 307 G in my UK men's 8 A2\nthat's marginally light than the Nimbus\n26 despite that extra stack which asex\nsays will add even more softness and\nplushness to the cushioning for those\nlonger easier runs which is what this\nshoe is primarily designed for now the\nners 27 moves to a jackard mesh Upper\nfrom the knit uppers that we saw in the\n26 a little more structure here to these\nnew uppers which feels a bit more\npremium as well and like they won't hold\nas much water as the knit did on the 26\nnow the heel package and the tongues\nstay the same and they've got the\ndetails like the heel pool here and a\nheel pool and that's sorry the pull on\nthe tongue they're all still here us\nprice also stays the same at $165 we\ndon't have the UK price at the time\nrecording this but we'll add that to the\ncaption as soon as we have it we'll\nbring it into the review when we do but\nthis is the new ASX Jo nus\n27 so I've just done my first run in the\nasex Joel Nimbus 27 now the major\ndifference here obviously is that extra\n2 Ms of Mile foam this tuned slightly\nsofter and more cushion that's across\nthe B some of that mids salt across the\nwhole foot you do notice it they are\nsofter I've also done like a side by\nside mile I've got them both on at the\nmoment with the Nimbus 26 and you do\nfeel the extra softness into the 27 it\ndoes make a difference I mean it's not\nlike the limbus 26 wasn't cushioned and\nplush and brought that kind of Road\neating impact protection anyway but the\n27 are going to offer more of that\ncrucially you know as says they've\nmanaged to add this extra stack Without\nReally adding too much extra weight and\nthe feel on the foot is the same in\nterms of the weight these are both big\nkind of sort hulking heavy shoes big\nplush padded heel collars you know\nmaximum kind of comfort for long miles\nthat is still here in the 27 but you\nwill notice just a bit more cushioning a\nbit more Road eating there's a little\nbit more sort of cushion protection\noverall I do find in that first run I'm\nthink there's a little bit more return\nas well bit more spring back maybe a\nlittle bit more bounce into the 27\nwhereas you're going to get a little bit\nkind of more stiffness in the 26 I think\nif you like the 26 I don't I think\nyou're not going to like the 27 there\nmay be a little bit less stability it's\nnot a huge amount but with that higher\nstack you do feel higher off the ground\nthan you would with the 26 that might be\na a point of difference here that will\nmake a difference for some people I\ndon't particularly find that there was\ntoo much to choose and I've just done a\nhappy mile but with one sh on each foot\nand it didn't really notice difference\ntoo much I took the 27 through their\nPaces from on tried to do a six mile\nprogression run uh where I sort of up\npaced if one of the miles I did was just\nfaster than my Marathon Pac sort of 630\nyou know it's kind of place there\nthere's a bit of Bounce a bit of energy\nthey can do that but you wouldn't want\nto do too many miles like that the mile\nafter that I was struggling and when I\ngot up running that fast I certainly\nfelt a little bit more of a hot spot\nunder foot from you know on under the\nkind of main sort ball of my foot so\nthat was something for the high pce\nobviously they're not really designed\nfor that but I like to test them just to\nsee overall I think you're getting more\nof the same here with the 27 nice new\nuppers I think they do add a little bit\nif you there a little bit less Flex\nmaybe in the knit they're not tight or\nMore Hugging this still plenty of room\nplenty spacious toe box here these are\nbuilt to give you space to run long in\nComfort there's a bit more structure I\nthink to the jackard than you get in the\nknit minor differences here but overall\nI wouldn't say one is more comfortable\nthan the other I do like the more\npremium feel of the jaak card I think it\nlooks nicer I think it's a bit more\nprotective in the wet won't hold as much\nwater perhaps as the knit which is\nanother point of difference but overall\ncom comfort and hold all of those kind\nof things I think you're going to get a\nvery similar ride here the main change\nas I said is down to that mid Sole and\nif you were looking for a little bit\nmore softness then the 27's going to\ndeliver it if you already own a pair of\n26 I wouldn't massively quickly run out\nand go and get a 27 I think this is\ngoing to be one of those shoes that\nyou're going to want to upgrade\nbasically when it's\ntime if you want to go from 26 to\n27 yeah I I don't know if you really\nlike the way the 26 is now and you\ndidn't want more softness then I'd stick\nwith 26 if you were looking for a little\nbit more softness even more cushion and\nmore stack then the 27 is going to be\nthe way to\ngo so first impressions on the Nimbus 27\nfrom the first 10K that I've just done\nthere in about an hour it's more of the\nsame for me I think you're getting a\nshoe that's very very similar there\nthere are changes here aesthetically the\nshoes look very similar you've got a\nlittle bit more stack obviously got\nthose changed uppers the heel package\nand everything Remains the Same you got\nthat same Comfort got the same tongues\nso the main difference here is in that\nlittle bit of cushioning on the ride I I\npersonally don't think it changes how I\nwould use these shoes I would use the 27\nand the 26 for the same kind of runs\nwhich is basically my easiest slowest\nruns where I want to have the most\ncushion protection the most kind of Road\nimpact eating where I'm going nice and\nslow and I just want guaranteed super\nplushness super Comfort I think that is\ngoing to be exactly the same here for\nthe 27 so yeah if you're only 26 I\nwouldn't rush out and upgrade if you're\nlooking for a really sort of super\ncushioned plush long easy or just easy r\nrun shoe and I think the Jo ners 27 is\nvery competent very capable feels good\non the foot it's sort of a happy slow\nand easy mile shoe it's also probably a\npositive that they've stuck at the same\nprice at least in the US we will reserve\nthe verdict for and the comparisons to\nthe other shoes until we've done the\nfull review the other run testers will\nhave it and then we'll give you a little\nbit more about how this Stacks up\nagainst other kind of super plush\nchrisan shoes but my first run in it I\nthink business as usual for the Nimbus\nand if you like the Nimbus range then\nyou're going to like this as well\nlet give you a quick word on fit then\nand I think this is pretty much more of\nthe same as the asex Joe nimus 27 you've\ngot really ample room at the end of the\ntoe box nice amount of clearance across\nthe top of the toes there's plenty of\nflex these jackard uppers are a bit more\nstructured than you got with the knit\nfrom the 26 but this is still a really\nroomy happy shoe to run long distance in\nOodles of space basically lots of Flex\nfor the toes comes back up I get good\nlock down across the midfoot no problem\nthere we've got these tongues that\nthey're sort of quite loose they're sort\nof knitted they just take the edge off\nbut they aren't maybe as padded as some\nyou do have to make sure you get them in\nthe right place into the heel collar I\nthink you've got exactly the same heel\npackage as you got in the 26 and they\nhold well there's lots of plush padding\nwhich creates Good Foot security little\nbit of a heel counter here that's not\ntoo stiff but very present holds you\nnicely I had no slipping no problems\nwith lock down and I would recommend\ngoing true to size in these shoes that\nhas been my first run in the aex Joe\nnimbus 7 we'll do loads of more testing\nthe other guys will try and get these\nshoes on their feet to bring you the\nfull multi- tester verdict in the full\nreview that will be coming soon if you\nwant to know something about the shoe\nhit us up in the comments below tell us\nwhat you'd like us to work out find out\nwe'll go and see if we can answer those\nquestions uh otherwise go check out\nloads of other shoe content on the\nchannel we've got some really good top\npicks that we've done a series where\nNick Mike Tom and I have all picked our\nfavorite shoes of 20124 so far won't\ninclude the numbers because they weren't\nout but it's a great videos go and check\nthose out I'll pop two of them up on the\nchannel now you can have a look\notherwise as ever thank you for stopping\nby and yeah happy running people and\nwe'll see you again soon",

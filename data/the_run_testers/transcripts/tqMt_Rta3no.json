  "text": "hello and welcome to run testers my name\nis Nick we have something a little bit\ndifferent today in that yesterday I went\nto run on the Wahoo kicker run treadmill\nthe very exciting new treadmill from\nWahoo that's available in the US but not\nin the UK can dive into my impressions\nof the machine and give you some more of\nan introduction in a minute but first I\nwant to run through some of the key\nstats on the machine starting with the\nprice which is $5,000 plus $300 for\ndelivery available in the US now in the\nUK late next year it's a big machine so\nit requires a lot of clearance in terms\nof face both to the sides and behind you\nand also above you they recommend that\nyou have a clearance for height that's\n24 in greater than the height of the\ntallest user because the treadmill does\nsit quite a long way off the floor it's\ngot a very big running belt it's 69 in\ntime 22 in really spacious certainly\nnoticed that on the run yesterday very\nhigh top speed of 4 minutes per mile\nwhich is 229 per kilometer got a maximum\nincline of 15% and then a maximum\ndecline ofus 3% so you can do some\ndownhill running on it as well machine\nhas paddles that can use to control\nspeed and incline and they have almost\nincremental changes you can do on them\nso if you can do a half tap on each for\nyou know a small bump in speed or\nincline or a really big push that then\ngives you a bigger jump and you can\nactually if you hold it in position for\nsomething like on speed you can increase\nthe speed very minutely almost to the\nsecond in your terms of your pace which\nis shown on the console in terms of\nminutes per kilometer or mile instead of\nthe kind of standard speed measurement\nyou get on most treadmills also on the\nconsole you get your incline but you do\nnot get time and distance the treadmill\nactually isn't really recording that\ninformation it's very much designed to\nbe used in partnership with apps which\nyou connect to via Bluetooth so you\nwon't see like total time and distance\non the treadmill itself only in\nConnected apps which you can use on a\ntablet or phone or even on laptop and\nthe massive tray that's on the front of\nthe machine that has a strap for holding\na laptop in place and that kind of thing\nthe big exciting features on the machine\nI'm going to talk more about in a minute\nare things like the runfree mode where\nyou can adjust your speed without having\nto use the paddles just by positioning\nyourself on the Belt a little\ndifferently and in general a natural\nrunning feel thanks to the belt material\nused and also the way it can tilt lat so\nyou don't end up landing on an entirely\neven surface the entire time which again\nmimics the feeling of outdoor running a\nbit more there's a bit more detail on\nthose features to come before my run and\nthen we'll talk through my experience on\nthe\n[Music]\nmachine good morning from London uh as\nyou can tell I'm at the Wahoo Offices\nhere to try out a very special product\ngoing to try out the Wahoo kicker run\ntreadmill which is something I'm really\nexcited about obviously it's this new\ntreadmill from W it's now available in\nthe US coming to the UK and other\ncountries next year which has some\nreally unique and novel features like\nthe runfree mode in particular which\nallows you to basically just run on the\npace and it will increase and decrease\nin line with you as you increase and\ndecrease your pace you know quite\nnaturally so delivering hopefully a\nreally natural running experience where\nyou can just speed up by running faster\nthough you can obviously use things like\npaddles on the machine to uh to do that\nif you want to instead but that's the\nmain thing I'm looking to test here\ntoday going my 60 Minute easy run on the\nplan today so I'm going to do that on\nthe treadmill play around with the paces\nyou know speed up slow down it's got a\nvery high top speed of 4 minute a mile\nso probably won be spending too much\ntime at that top Pace but other features\non here you've got a running belt that's\ndesigned to simulate like a hard hard\nattack kind of Trail so give you quite a\nnice experience under the foot and it\nhas a lateral tilting mechanism where it\nmoves kind of half a degree on a slant\neither way so you're not Landing in the\nsame spot every time like cuz outside\nyou never really run on a completely\nlevel surface so that creates again a\nmore natural running experience that in\nparticular I'm quite interested because\none reason I don't use treadmill loads\nand loads is that if you have a little\nniggle you land in the same spot all the\ntime on a flat surface so sometimes I\nworry that'll exacerbate that niggle and\nhaving that slightly uneven surface here\nas it moves I'll be intering to see if\nthat's really perceptible at all but\nyeah so that's a load of really natural\nrunning features I'm really excited to\ngive it a go I just did the setup on the\nmachine to try out the kind of runfree\nmode and other little features like that\nand now I'm to going and actually do a\nproper run on it and see how it\n[Music]\nfeels so all done after an hour on the\nWahoo kicker run and that was amazing\nlike it really you know I very high\nhopes and expectations for this machine\nand it kind of surpassed them when I was\nusing that run free mode it really does\nfeel very easy to move up and down in\nspeed and but also crucially it's quite\neasy to lock in on a pace because I was\na bit worried that if you're in that\nmode you know be jerking around a bit\nYou' getting slower faster but actually\nno if you're just running normally on\nthe spot like you would run at a pace it\njust kind of stays at that pace and then\nyou can speed up kind of just lean\nforward a little bit start Landing a\nlittle bit further forward on the\ntreadmill starts to speed up and then\nyeah you can uh ease back a bit quite\nnaturally as well like it's not entirely\nthe same as speeding up or slowing down\nwhen you're running but it's a very\nnatur natural movement to um to do it on\nthe machine for sure and you go very\nfast I took it right out to top speed\nfor a second or two cuz it 4 minute mile\nPaces it's moving some um but then you\ncan easily speed up to kind of more\nnatural interval Paces for yourself I\nlocked in on marathon pace for a bit and\nactually what you can do is you know go\nin the Run free J around a bit like you\nwould in the warmup ease up to your pace\nexit the Run free mode and obviously the\ntreadmill then stays at that speed it\ndoesn't you no move around at all and\nthen you can move it with the paddles\nvery quickly it accelerates and\ndecelerates very quickly indeed that's\num you know great for intervals great\nfor you know everything really it's got\na thing where if you're using the\npaddles to speed up and down like if\nyou're at slower speeds when you press\nthe paddle it jumps further because you\nknow if you're you're trying to get up\nto speed you might want it to jump up a\nbit quicker rather than moving in you\nkind of linear increments each time and\nyou can actually really fine tune the\npace down to the second pace is shown in\nlike minutes per K or minutes per mile\nrather than kind of classic treadmill\nspeeds so that's handy as well if you\nare looking in on the pace one thing\nthat isn't shown on the machine is your\noverall time and distance I would have\nliked that I was jumping around between\napps so OB it's very much designed to be\nused with lots of apps and then you get\nyour workout recorded on there you see\nthe total distance total time but\nbecause I was just you know messing\naround trying different things I'd\nactually know how far I've run I've got\nmy distance on my watches which obiously\ndifferent you know very different\nbecause treadmill and watches don't\nalways calibrate very well um but so\nthat's one thing I wouldn't mind seeing\non the thing as well as well could you\njust see your pace and incline on the\nmachine did link it up to zift both in\ncontrollable and non-controllable mode\nso the controllable mode is interesting\nyou know will you know when Swift and\nyou're cycling you get that kind of\nlittle image of the hills to come you\nget that and then you can see see it you\nknow went up an incline then down\nincline there see downhill on this tread\nrun as well and yeah it was just a\nreally great experience like I really\nenjoyed running it did an hour on the\nmachine it's quite even getting rid of\nall the kind of things on there all the\nrunfree mode and all that it's just a\nreally nice piece of Hardware with a big\nopen front so it's quite relaxing and\nnatural to run on it full stop the belt\nis nice nice and comfortable and all\naround I loved it like I you know I used\na tread Fair bit I test treadmill\nsometimes but I'm a huge fan always of\nrunning on a treadmill and that was just\na really good experience upgrade on\nnormal Trad experiences and I think it\nwould really come to its own even more\ncertainly if you're doing something like\nintervals when you want to just suddenly\nburst into Pace hold a fast pace and\nhave to think about your pace cuz that's\nthe thing about the run three mode like\nwhen I was doing it for like my marathon\npace like you have to get there and then\nhold that pace actually thinking about\nit like thinking about leaning into it\nputting that pace through the machine\nrather than you know normally tread you\nset it to the PACE then you kind of\nclock out mentally and just run that\npace and it's doesn't feel as engaging\nas when you're using that run free mode\nto try and maintain a Target Pace I\nthink that's quite an interesting little\naddition there that might help runners\nor maybe you prefer just you know\nsetting it to the non-run through mode\nat that point and just dialing in on\nthat pace and let the machine do that\nfor you but either way yeah really\ntremendous stuff like I'm sure lots of\nRunners going be excited about this\nobviously comes at a very high price tag\nit's also a very big machine so you're\ngoing to need the space for that it's\ngot some Nifty features it's got like\nalmost auto level so if you're putting\nit into an uneven floor uh which is very\nmuch the case for me if I'm putting it\nin the garage or even sometimes inside\nif you've got a mat under it or\nsomething the floor might be a bit\nuneven it naturally levels it for you\nthe machine is a level base and it's\nvery solid and stable at high Paces I\ntook it up to the fastest Paces on the\nmachine just briefly and you know it\ndoesn't start jerking around or start\nrumbling or anything like that it\ndoesn't feel ominous you know it's not\nincredibly quiet but it's not that loud\nfor a treadmill either when you consider\nlike how fast you can go on it this big\ntrain in front of you as well for all\nyour things you can't you know it's\ndesigned to work with a laptop there you\nknow you've got the strap there to hold\nthat and all that so yeah really enjoyed\nthat run on it it's um certainly I think\ngoing to shake up the treadmill Market a\nlittle bit there's nothing else really\nlike that high price but not\noutlandishly so I would say for a very\nyou know High ECT treadmill like if you\njust want to get very high speed and a\nnormal treadmill experience you can\ncertainly get that for you know less\nthan $2,000 \u00a32,000 but there's a lot\nhere you can get an upgrade with by\nlooking at the woo pick\n[Music]\nR so really snap verdict on the machine\nI hope to go and test it again and\nhopefully be able to test a unit more\nextensively next year in the UK but it's\na really great machine I think like it's\nreally interesting and if you're someone\nwho's really excited by the features on\npaper like I were in terms of that\nrunfree mode then they will deliver in\nperson in my experience like I really\nenjoyed that first run of them I really\nwant to go and do some intervals in the\nmachine because I think it'll be even\nmore you know useful for that kind of\nthing the way you can speed up very\nquickly whether using the paddles all\nthe Run free mode and yeah just delers a\nfantastic experience all around now the\nactual Hardware even without the kind of\nNovel features you get here is very\nimpressive and kind of in line with its\nprice T so that that price is really\nreally high but you know comparable\nmachines I've tested things like the\ntechnogy run which was is like $122,000\nso Wahoo could actually have come out\nand said this is a $10,000 or pound\nmachine and you know set it at that\nbecause they're almost setting their own\nprice here because they' doing these\nfeatures so well that haven't really\nbeen done by anyone else and you're\ngetting excellent Hardware as well only\nthing that's kind of missing compared to\nlots of topspec machines is a built-in\nscreen but you have got that tray which\nactually means you can use you know\nstuff that you already have and then you\ndon't have to use a set screen but yeah\nsome people prefer the built-in screen\non something like a Pelon or even the\nTechno gy run only other slight negative\nfor me is the fact that yeah I do want\ntime and distance on the console like I\nI don't think that clutters it up I\nthink that's a useful thing to have\nthere and I did get a little bit of\nstatic when I was using the paddles but\nthat might just been down to the shoes I\nwas using so yeah overall I had an\namazing experience I think this is a\nreally great machine and yeah hope to\nuse it again and certainly big kudos to\nWahoo for kind of pulling this off CU\nclearly has been you know a lot of\nambitious ideas going into this machine\nand i' would say that it's delivered on\nthose especially with that runfree mode\nthat just really works as well as you'd\nhope it to",

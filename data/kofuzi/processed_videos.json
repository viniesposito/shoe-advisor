      "text": "we are now in the home stretch for my\npreparation for the half marathon in\nHouston and I'll be hitting Peak mileage\nweeks just in time for Christmas so\nlet's pack up the presents and the\ncarbon plated Racers this is a runner\nupdate at week 10\n[Music]\nyo what's going on kafui coming to you\non location from my backyard for the\nthird installment in my training series\nwith Runa who is the sponsor for this\ntraining series now I've been using the\napp to prepare for the half marathon at\nHouston which is definitely different\nthan the Houston half marathon and right\nnow I'm standing in my backyard without\na jacket or even gloves on which means\nthat it's unseasonably warm here in this\npart of the country for this part of the\nyear but I'm going to take that as a\nlucky sign because it has been peak week\nand I've had some really tough workouts\nand the balmy unseasonably warm weather\nhas been really good for me to get those\ntough workouts completed let's see how\nthe workouts have been going starting\nwith week nine Mondays and Wednesdays\nare session days with the way I've set\nup my run a plan and this workout was\ncalled Tempo repeat now I don't know if\nI can call it a weakness but a kind of\nworkout that I particularly dislike is\nlong repetitions at Round threshold pace\nand that's exactly what this was two 2\nand 1/2 Mile reps at\n6:35 I was nervous and my original plan\nwas to try and just hang on to the tail\nend of the paces maybe stay within 10\nseconds per mile of what I was supposed\nto do but I ultimately decided to trust\nmyself and ignore the watch as much as I\ncould I ran to effort not the\nand I was able to come in under the\nprescribed Paces 625 for the first 2 and\n1/2 Mile rep and 631 on average for the\nsecond one and that was a big confidence\nbooster because while it was hard it\nkind of felt like I had to hold back a\nbit it wasn't an allout effort which is\npromising I was looking forward to a\nrecovery run on Tuesday but with 9 and a\nhalf miles on the calendar it kind of\nfelt like a lot I decided to take out\nthe diodora nucleo 2 for a first run for\nthis one diodora told me that this shoe\nwasn't a stability shoe which is\nimportant to me because I have a hard\ntime running in stability shoes but this\nshoe definitely felt a little bit like a\nrecovery shoe for the first several\nmiles but eventually both my body and\nthe shoe loosened up a bit and I was\nable to enjoy the rest of the balmy\nweather on this run\nWednesday was another tough session the\nworkout was called Fast\n842 and as the Reps got shorter the\npaces got faster the real tough thing\nabout this one though was that after 5\n800 met repeats I had to do 10\n400s mentally and physically there was\njust something about that 10 number that\nwas daunting I was trying out the Topo\nCyclone 3 which is a paback mids shoe\nthat is designed for these exact types\nof workouts but I will admit that in my\nmost tired moments I was really missing\nthe carbon fiber plate that this shoe\ndoesn't have I fell short on a bunch of\nthese reps but I definitely got the\nstimulus intended from this workout I\nwas exhausted by the end\nby Thursday I was definitely ready for\nthat recovery run and the easy five on\nthe calendar wasn't exactly easy but it\nwas nice and\nrelaxed and on Friday it was supposed to\nbe a long run day but it had snowed a\nfew inches overnight so I switched my\nFriday long run for the medium run I was\nsupposed to have the next day and I\nheaded for my local trails in veterans\nAcres\n[Music]\nPark or mule racing a trail and Ultra\nrace company that is also based in\nCrystal Lake puts on a couple of events\nin this very Park and it's also where\nthe local high school hosts its home\ncross country races it's also one of the\nplaces in town where I take the kids\nsledding so I've spent a lot of time in\nthis park and it's at its best when it's\nsnowing\n[Music]\nwhile I don't usually have to walk the\nuphills here on this snowy day and on my\ntired legs I did find myself walking\nfrom time to time but otherwise the\nwoods were just absolutely gorgeous and\nI had a fantastic time running the these\n11\n[Music]\nmiles Saturday was the long run day\nthough that I had moved from the day\nprior and it was supposed to be 17.5 mil\neasy I stopped by the lake to see people\nice fishing out there which is\nsurprising because the lake has has been\ngoing back and forth between Frozen and\nmelted over the temperature swings of\nthe past month I also noticed some of my\nfootprints which is always weird for me\nto see when I'm walking or running at a\nvery easy Pace my feet always stick out\nof B funny and you can see how my heels\ndrag a bit this I presume is why some\nshoes have lateral heel bevels\nI was enjoying this run but I did have\nto cut it a bit short I felt fine and I\nhad plenty of fluids and nutrition on me\nI just ran out of time it's easy to\nforget 17.5 Mi easy takes a long while\nto\nrun for my Sunday six I ran at busy\nWoods which runs through a town called\nElk Grove Village there are Elks at busy\nWoods they're kept behind a fenced in\narea and presumably they native to the\nregion busy Woods has a lot of bathrooms\nbut they pretty much are always locked\nand closed there's always a sign saying\nthat they're closed for the season but\nthese are permanently bolted in to the\nbrick wall so I'm not really sure which\nseason they're closed and which season\nthey're open cuz I don't think I've ever\nnever seen them open the loop here is\n7.3 Mi and I only technically needed 6\nmiles for the day but I ran the full\nloop and then some so that I could hit\n70 Mi for the\nweek now I'm not the type of Runner\nthat's going to get really bothered if I\nend a run at like 99 miles I'm not going\nto run a little bit extra just to take\nover to the next full whole mile but if\nthat happens to me in terms of weekly\nmileage like if I'm at like 69.8 miles\non the week I'm definitely going to run\na little bit more to get to that next\nround number so I ended week n with\n70.1 Miles rather than an otherwise\nludicrous\n69.8 Monday was another session day and\nthis workout was called onoff K five\ntimes 1K at 715 per mile and 1K at 615\nper mile so this was basically a 10K at\nwhat would average pretty close to my\n10K\nPB this run was not going to be easy I\ndid bring another shoe to test for this\none the Brooks Hyperion Elite 4 PB which\nbrings piba to their top tier racing\nshoe I was glad to have it for this run\nthe shoe is still a bit firmer than I\npersonally would like but the proof\nseems to be in the pudding I held myself\nback on most of the Reps but let it rip\nfor the last couple where I was able to\nin at PACE or even a little bit faster\n[Music]\n[Music]\non Tuesday we were at my in-laws and I\nhad a 9 and 1/2 Mile easy run I decided\nto go on a route that I hadn't run in a\nwhile and I definitely forgot how long\nthat Loop was for some reason I thought\nit'd be 9 miles and I'd have to run\naround a little bit to get to my mileage\nfor the day but by the Six Mile Mark I\nstill wasn't all that close to home\nwhich made me nervous because I'd only\nbrought one gel and no fluids with me\n[Music]\nthe loop ended up being 11 miles so on\npaper not all that much longer than I\nhad intended but it just felt like I ran\na lot that day plus my daughter wanted\nto go for a run so I accompanied her for\nan additional very easy mile and a half\nWednesday was Christmas morning and we\ndo most of our family Christmas stuff on\nChristmas Eve so I had the morning to\nsqueeze in a workout before the rest of\nthe extended family arrived for more\nChristmas festivities in the afternoon\nRuna with the holiday spirit was feeling\ngenerous so it assigned me 20 times 400\nmet repeats at 540 per mile Pace that's\na pace somewhere between 5K and mile\nrace pace so this was a tough one and\nwhenever I have to do a workout and I'm\nat my in-laws I'll most likely do it on\nthis one mile Loop in D Ville it loops\naround a couple of soccer fields it's\nmostly flat and I don't have to worry\nabout road traffic which typically has\ngiant trucks hauling things or actual\nfarm\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nequipment temps continue to rise on\nThursday and we ended up with some very\ndense fog I picked a route I wouldn't\nhave to to drive to for my 5m easy run\nit's a loop I've done so many times I\ncould almost do it with my eyes closed\nand with the fog that's kind of how it\n[Music]\nfelt I heard a couple of dogs barking\nthe farm I heard them from is one where\nI know the two dogs have an electric\nfence but there was a new third dog he\nwas not subject to an electric fence and\nafter a couple of tense first few\nmoments for me it eventually started\nrunning with me I tried to get it to\nstay or go home but those weren't\ncommands it seemed to know I'm starting\nto wonder if that's actually a thing\nthat dogs ever know so the dog ended up\nrunning with me for 2 miles until I made\nit all the way back home this isn't the\nfirst time something like this has\nhappened to me where a dog runs with me\nfor several miles and usually if it does\nfollow me all the way home I just go\ninside and let the dog figure it out the\ndogs around here all seemed to know how\nto do that but I didn't get the feeling\nthat this dog was from around here I\nsuspected it was visiting family and\nbecause it was so foggy I was worried a\ncar might hit a dog wandering back to\nwhere it came from so I put it in my car\nand drove it back to the farm and then\nwhen I got back home my daughter wanted\nto go for a run too so I had another 2\nmiles to run with my\n[Music]\ndaughter Friday was a big day the name\nof the workout was race prep 15.5 M\ntotal with 2 * 3.7 mil at race Pace\nRunner prescribed 640 per mile and while\nI feel like I can race half marathons\nfaster than that I wasn't going to try\nand be a hero on this day remember how I\nsaid I hate long fast reps well this was\nlike the mother of them all the first\none was so hard the one mile Loop that\nI've done so many workouts on never felt\nso long\n[Music]\nafter the first rep was over there was a\nim merciful 2 and 1/2 mil worth of easy\nrecovery I took a couple of gels and\nthen settled in for the next rep I used\nmy relish Mantra that I've been using\nthis entire training block I tried to\nzone out I tried to focus extra hard on\nmy technique I threw pretty much\neverything that I had at this last rep\nit was tough physically and mentally but\nI was able to come in right at PACE with\nthe first 3.7 mile rep averaging at 637\nper mile and the second 3.7 M rep\naveraging right at\n640 for Saturday we were back home in\nCrystal Lake the weather was wonderfully\nwarm and I initially felt like I should\ntry and run even more because it was so\nnice but 6 miles ended up feeling like\nplenty I was pretty tired\nSunday was another easy run but it was a\nmedium long one at 11 mil the temps were\nquite mild but everything was a bit wet\nit wasn't exactly raining but it wasn't\nnot raining\neither by mile 8 I was soaked and\nstarting to really want the run to be\nover and I probably could have cut the\nRun short with all the extra miles I run\nearlier in the week but I decided I\nwould ride it out for the full 11 and I\nended the week at 72.8 Mi\n[Music]\n[Music]\ntotal so with Peak Week completed it's\ntime to get to some predictions right\nnow I'm currently feeling pretty healthy\nsometimes at the end of a training block\nI can get a little thing with the pads\nof my feet that's not happening right\nnow and other things that can happen to\nme laid into a training block is that my\nankles might start to get really stiff\nthat's another thing that's not\nhappening so I'm feeling pretty healthy\nand I'm feeling pretty fit so what do I\nthink that'll mean let's look at a\ncouple of key sessions one thing that I\nwant to look at is that tempo run from\nweek nine where I had two times 2 and\n1/2 Mile repetitions that one I came in\nat 625 and 631 631 was my race pace for\nlast year's PR that I had at the half\nmarathon at Houston so so that's a good\nsign that I'm able to hit that pace for\nthose longer repetitions and then on\nweek 10 another key session was that\nlong run that had two times 3.7 M\nrepetitions that came in at 637 and 640\nso those are really good workouts for me\nI feel strong and confident about those\nbut those are slower than my race Pace\nwas from last year so maybe that is not\nas positive of an indicator\nnow on the other hand I did have\nbasically what was yaso 800s about\nhalfway through the training block when\nI was down in Austin and I averaged a\npace of about 3 minutes for 800 met\nrepetitions over the 10 reps which\nindicates that I'm pretty fit so that's\na positive indicator that leans me\ntowards thinking I might be in PB\nFitness but then again I've also\nsomewhat recently had two different fem\ntime trials one was a Turkey Trot on a\nvery pre hilly course and then the next\none was uh on the second day of a\ntwo-day back-to-back sessions kind of\nweek and so those times were very good\nI'm proud of them but they weren't\nexactly PB level fast which is something\nthat I would kind of expect to see for\nfive mile time trials late into a\ntraining plan so there's kind of mixed\nsignals all over the board but I think\nthere's one more week of intense\ntraining before Runa starts to put me\ninto a two- we taper and assuming the\ntaper goes well I think that when my\nbody is able to absorb all this work\nthat I've been doing and build upon all\nthe things that we've put together for\nthis training plan I'm\nfeeling pretty optimistic I'm not super\noptimistic about it but I think right\nnow the race plan is going to be to line\nup for 630 per mile pace for the half\nmarathon at Houston if I can hold on to\nthat pace for the entire race that'll be\na little bit of a PB but I think it\ncould very easily go a minute faster or\na minute slower than that if I fall\nanywhere within that range I'll be\npretty happy because that's going to be\na very fast time for me right up there\nwith my fastest half marathon times so\nI'm feeling good about where I am so far\nbut we'll have to see what happens come\na race day in the interim between now\nand then there's going to be a few weeks\nthe content plan is going to be that uh\nfirst I'll put out the Houston Race\nvideo uh which will show kind of like\nwhat's happening in the moment but it\nwon't go over things like how I felt\nabout the kit that I used fueling and\nany other things thoughts that are going\nthrough my head uh that all stuff comes\nin the following video in the race recap\nwhich will be the final installment of\nthis series and then of course in the\nmeantime there will also be regular\nrunning shoe review video so hit the\nSubscribe button if you're interested in\nany of that and if you are interested in\ntrying the run an app for yourself use\ncode kofuzi for two free weeks I get no\nbenefit or penalty whether you use it or\nor not but it's there if you want it",

YouTube channel\nmakes in a year now these videos always\nget away from me and get way longer than\nI intend so let's jump right into it\nlet's take a look at my YouTube Studio\nthis is the channel dashboard this is an\ninterface that I look at pretty much on\na daily basis if not multiple times per\nday to kind of keep track of how things\nare going on the channel and to get to\nthe numbers that we want to look at\nlet's go to the analytics section and\nchange my view to 2024 now I am filming\nthis on December 29th to get this video\nready for release at the end of the year\nat the end of 2024 so there's a couple\nof days worth of AD rev that aren't\ngoing to be accounted for in here and a\nlot of this stuff for December is an\nestimate but so far for 2024 YouTube\nstudio is telling me that this channel\nhas had an estimated revenue of $ 59,000\n8651 and that's over the course of 11.4\nmillion views\n$824,000 watch time in hours and an\nincrease of\n35.9 th000 subscribers now there are\nPeaks and valleys based on this in terms\nof how much money I'm making in a single\nday I think the biggest day that I had\nmoneymaking wise was on April 23rd where\nI made\n$476 in one day in terms of Revenue\ncoming in in that 24-hour period and\nthat was a day where I had just posted\nmy video from the London Marathon which\nis a race that I've been training for uh\nit wasn't a great race for me that day\nuh so there was a little bit of drama in\nthat video and the week prior was the\nBoston Marathon and that video I think\nwas already up as well so I kind of had\ntwo big videos that were both out at the\nsame time which contributed to that and\na lot of these other spikes are\ngenerally around either big SHO releases\nor other big racing events that I\nintended throughout the year uh if we\nscroll down through here we could see\nwhich were the top videos in the period\nthe number one viewed video that I had\nin 2024 was for the novast 4 after 100\nmiles which that is a long-term update\nvideo I already made a novablast 4 video\nprior to that um and at the beginning of\nthe year the long-term update came out\nand that came out with a 196,000 views\nover the course of the Year second place\nalso another as6 shoe the A6 Nimbus 26\nand in third place another update video\nthe new balance Rebel version 4 with\n162,000 views and so the number one and\nthree spots are really surprising to me\nbecause I always feel like that there\nisn't as lot of momentum around the 100\nmile update review video for those of\nyou that are unfamiliar with the channel\nwhen I review a shoe I'll run in it a\nfew times get to about 20 to 30 miles in\na shoe before I do a video uh sometimes\nmore sometimes less uh and that's kind\nof like the main hit that I get from\nreviewing a new shoe that's when people\nare excited about it it's when the shoe\nis newer I'll keep running in the shoe\nto see if things change and how things\ndevelop over time and get to about 100\nmiles and that's usually when I kind of\nend my testing period with the shoe uh\nand I'll post an update video I try to\ndo those a little bit more succinctly\nbecause it's a follow-up I've already\ndone a primary review on it uh and there\nisn't as much interest or at least feels\nlike it but to see that two of my top\nperforming videos or update videos is a\nreal surprise and then another surprise\nthat I see here is that my number sixth\nmost viewed video is a watch video and\nnow this is a big comparison video Coral\nSpace 3 versus a Garmin an Apple Watch a\npolar Pace Pro so this was another like\na big wide multiat review that took kind\nof a lot of time but I generally haven't\nbeen focusing it on a lot of watch or\ndevice reviews because it feels like\nthose are a lot of work and don't get a\nlot of views back from it but this one\ndid bring in 144,000 views and that's a\npretty Successful video for me so maybe\nI need to rethink that strategy I do\nhave a bunch of watches that I've been\ntesting lately and I haven't reviewed\nyet so I think that means that I should\nprobably do another kind of multiat big\ncomparison review video I just got to\nsit down and actually film it after\ngoing through all of my testing so let's\ndig deeper into some of these other sub\nuh menus in this analytics section to\ngive a little bit more context in terms\nof what this running Channel gives so\nnow in terms of published content I have\nbeen doing both shorts and YouTube\nvideos my shorts strategy is really just\ntake the reals that I'm making on\nInstagram and then post the same one on\nuh YouTube shorts I've never been a huge\nfan of making YouTube shorts and I don't\nreally love making short form videos I'm\nmore of a long form guy um but I felt\nlike I have to have some sort of present\nin YouTube shorts so I'm trying I'm\nseeing a little bit of traction and\ngrowth from it uh but it still feels\nlike it's more trouble than it's worth\nuh this year I uploaded 143 shorts and I\ndid 101 videos and those are long form\nvideos whether it's a shoe review an\nupdate shoe review video or uh I also do\nRun Travel Vlogs where I'm going to a\nrace or going to running event uh and so\nthat's where those 101 videos are coming\nfrom um in terms of how viewers are\nfinding me this is a product review\nchannel so like search and optimization\nis pretty important but it's not the\nmost important way that viewers are\nfinding me at this point in my YouTube\ncareer uh the browse features on YouTube\nare the main way I think that's\nscrolling through kind of like your\nhomepage is how people are finding me or\nother browsing mechanisms whether it's\nlike you shown a kind of like a panel of\nvideos at the end of watching a\ndifferent video and you can select which\none you want to watch next I think that\nalso counts as browse uh 32.6% of My\nViews are coming in from browse and\n31.6 are coming in from YouTube search\nand those are the two main ways that\npeople find me let's compare that to\n2023 where um much more of it came from\nbrowse and even less of it came from\nYouTube search which is interesting\nbecause this year I've spent even less\ntime worrying about tags to put into\ndescriptions or uh making sure that\nthere's hashtags or accounts that are\ntagged or anything like that but I have\nbeen trying to spend less time worrying\nabout like making sure that everything\nis optimized and just kind of naming\nthings the way that I would name them if\nI were to do a search for these things\nlet's go to audience which uh always\nsurprises me every year um gain 35.9\nth000 subscribers this year which is\nactually a a big decrease from last year\nit's a 27% decrease compared to the\namount of subscribers I gained last year\nI think big part of that is that uh I\nthink reviewed fewer shoes this year I\ndid a lot of work travel traveling to\nevents uh traveling to cover races uh\nand those always just take up a lot of\nmy time and make it harder for me to\nreview more shoes so I think that if I\nhad reviewed more shoes uh I probably\nwould have gained more subscribers at\nthis point and it's been this way for a\ncouple of years now I'm not too\nconcerned about getting new subscribers\nI kind of like the number of people that\nare here the community feels manageable\nto me the community feels uh intimate\nand welcoming and supportive but it has\nbeen down quite a bit and I do think\nit's because there has been less uh shoe\nreview videos and I do feel like I need\nto review a lot more shoes uh in 2025 so\nthat's something that I want to be\nfocusing on not just because of the fact\nthat it affects subscriber growth that's\nactually one of the last reasons why I'd\nbe increasing the number of shoe reviews\nuh it's just that this is a running shoe\nreview Channel and you kind of have to\nremember uh what people are coming here\nfor and then the last thing from this\nsubmenu that I want to go over is the\nage and gender and I always find this\nvery surprising uh I don't really feel\nlike I'm making a very male oriented\nChannel yet uh this number has been\ngoing up every single year this year I'm\nat 91.4% male viewership uh with 8.6%\nfemale viewership uh at least based on\nthe ways that are identifiable from the\nway that you are or aren't logged in on\nYouTube uh it's very different than what\nI experience on Instagram and also even\nmore so different than what I experience\nin in-person events in terms of people\nthat are coming to meetups group runs\nthat I do uh there it does not feel like\nit's 91% male to 9% female at all so\nthat number is always a big surprise for\nme I've had various theories as to why\nthis is over the years but ultimately\nthe figure is what the figure is it's\n91% male on the channel as far as\nYouTube and Google are concerned uh with\nthe the vast majority of those people\nbeing in either the 25 to 34 year old\ncategory or the 35 to 44y Old category\nall right uh last submenu that we'll go\nover is the revenue section and I think\nthere's a couple of interesting things\ngoing on in here we saw what were my top\nperforming videos earlier in terms of\nviews now let's talk about what the top\nperforming videos were in terms of\nRevenue or ad rev that comes in um and\nthe number one was the Sak endorphin\nspeed 4 which was one of my favorite\nshoes of the year uh it didn't end up\nbeing my shoe of the year but I thought\nit had shoe of the Year potential that\nended up being my highest revenue\ngenerating video of the year that video\nalone generating\n$1,248 which is quite a bit of a\nsurprise it's a great shoe uh but the\nviews weren't really there they didn't\njump out at me as being like an\nexceptionally High performing video so\nthe fact that the revenue is high on\nthat is a little bit of a surprise and\nthen the other surprise for me is that\nthe there's three videos in the top five\nad rev generating videos that are not\nshoe review videos so uh I mentioned\nthat I do Run Travel uh or run Vlog type\nof videos I call them Runners weekend\nthat's the name of that series the\nsecond highest revenue generating video\nthat I have was from my visit to the\nBoston Marathon I didn't run it uh in\n20124 uh but I went to go and put on\nsome Live inperson Events uh and I went\nto go watch watch the race itself and\njust kind of show what it's like to go\nas a super fan uh to attend a big world\nmajor Marathon that ended up bringing in\n$1,000 in Revenue in the net net I think\nthat in terms of the adrev versus what\nthe expenses were on that trip uh the\nexpenses were way more than $1,000 but\nthat is something where I am doing\nin-person events where I do charge\nappearance fees and so there's different\nmath that makes that work out I'm pretty\nsure I'd have to talk to my agent about\nthat but I'm pretty sure that I ended up\npositive on the Boston trip and then\nnumber four was the marathon trials so\nthe there was a marathon that was run in\nOrlando for the top American men and\nwomen to see who would go to the\nOlympics I went to go and spectate that\nrace chase the athletes around the\ncourse and try and film them doing their\nthings and being excellent uh and that\nbrought in\n$940 and then the fifth highest\nperforming was the London Marathon video\ncoming in at\n$928 now there was two London Marathon\nvideos that I made one was from the race\nitself and we kind of talked about that\nearlier on that high Revenue day that I\nhad this runnner weekend video is a\nvideo that I make later on talking about\nall the things that I did while I was\ntraveling the places I stayed the people\nI saw the things that I ate all that's\nkind of in that travel and running video\ntogether and that Runners weekend video\nfrom London rounds out the top five\nRevenue performances for 2024 now\nthere's a button down here there you\ncould see more and one of the things\nthings that I was trying to do is figure\nout what was my worst performing video\nof 2024 but it only goes up to 50 videos\nnow I only made 100 in one video so uh I\nwas hoping that maybe there's like an\narrow to click to next and maybe I could\nsort by lowest amount of Revenue that\nwasn't available but uh you can export\nyour top 500 videos throughout the\nentire channel for the period of 2024\nand when I did that uh I it gives you a\nseparate spreadsheet I open it up in a\nGoogle sheet and it looks like to me my\nworst performing video of 2024 was from\nabout a year ago January 12th it was my\nreview of the insta 360 Ace Pro uh that\nvideo brought in\n$557 which puts me way upside down on\nthe cost of that camera cuz I think it\nwas a $250 maybe a $300 camera something\nin that territory so uh that one\ndefinitely is a flop which makes sense I\ndidn't love the camera and so uh I'm not\na person that likes to go negative on\nthe internet uh and I think that my\nviewers don't like it when I go negative\non the internet so that's a video that I\nthink just didn't do well so uh that's\npretty much it from what I had planned\nto go over from uh all of my statistics\non this 200,000 YouTube subscriber\nchannel uh let me know in the comments\nif you have any other questions that you\nwant me to follow up on in terms of how\nthings work or any other metrics that\nare going on in the YouTube channel I'm\nhappy to share them with you you guys uh\nthis is a video that I've been making\nfor 7 years now I'll post links to all\nthe other ones that you could see uh\ndown in the description uh below so you\ncould check those out uh if you are near\none of those Milestone numbers uh to see\nwhere your channel Stacks up thanks\neverybody for making it all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nor whatever it is that you're doing and\nI will see you in 2025",

      "text": "over the past two and a half weeks I've\nbeen going over my favorite shoes of\n2024 but now it's time for the best of\nthe best I'm taking the winner of each\ncategory to see which shoe Can Come Away\nwith best in shoe these are my\ncontenders for shoe of the year\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kafui and\nI'm anite Runner who reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto go over my contenders for shoe of the\nYear 2024 but before I give you this\nlist I do want to go over some\ndisclosures these are all shoes that\nwere sent to me by their respective\nmanufacturers for the purpose of review\nso I did not have to pay for these shoes\nhowever nobody's paying me to make this\nvideo or to include their shoe on this\nlist and no one's going to get a chance\nto preview any of my footage of my\nthoughts before you guys get a chance to\nsee this video on YouTube so with that\ndisclosure out of the way let's talk\nabout the winners of each subcategory of\nrunning shoe that I've crowned already\nand because I've already talked about\nwhy I like these shoes so much I do want\nto spend a moment to talk about each of\nthese shoes where they fit in a rotation\nand why I think they're significant for\n2024 and going into 2025 first let's\nstart with the daily trainer that's\nwhere I always like to start whenever\nI'm thinking about running shoes and for\nthis year the daily trainer of the year\nwas from New Balance is the rebel\nversion 4 now I feel like this shoe is\nsignificant for a couple of reasons\nthere's an updated version of fuel cell\nin this shoe that is a peba blend so\nwe're starting to see race materials\nmake their way into more and more daily\ntraining applications and for that\nreason it's significant but for me it's\nsignificant because I've always thought\nthat pea blend meant some sort of a\ncompromise a price point compromise or a\ndurability compromise but the rebel\nversion 4 proved to me that I feel like\nthis foam is exactly what it needs to be\nand so they didn't just Chuck in a bunch\nof peba and make it a pure pea midsole\njust for the sake of having that line\navailable to them in marketing they\nactually made the midso do what it needs\nto do and the other reason why I think\nit's significant is again from like the\nmarketing perspective they didn't hide\nthe fact that it's a peba blend and so\nthey told us right from the beginning\nthat this is a little bit of peba a\nlittle bit of Eva mixed together into a\nsuper critical process to make this foam\nand even though fuel cell is the trade\nname for New Balances racing caliber\nFoams again they weren't afraid that it\nwould dilute the brand recognition of\nwhat fuel cell is by having one that\nmight they might use in racing\napplications like in the SC Elite\nversion 4 and a different kind of fuel\ncell that's available in the rebel\nversion 4 so they made the foam that\nthey needed to make for the type of shoe\nthat they wanted to make it ended up\nbeing an excellent shoe and they weren't\nscared of what the ingredients were in\norder to make that product and for that\nkind of transparency and for the\nExcellence of this product the rebel\nversion 4 made it to my daily trainer of\nthe year now from daily trainers the\nnext shoe that I typically like to add\ninto a rotation is a racing shoe and\nfrom the racing category Puma brought us\nthe Nitro Elite 3 this shoe is\nsignificant for two things one is\nbecause while it wasn't the first shoe\nto introduce us to aliphatic TPU as a\nrace caliber material it's one that uses\nit exceptionally well and so we're\ngetting all the benefits of that\naliphatic TPU the bounciness of it the\nshock absorption of it but also the\ndurability of it in a race product but\nit also is important because this shoe I\nthink marks the beginning of the next\nlevel of carbon plate shoe Wars which\nthe battlefield is going to be in the\nweight and this shoe is extremely light\nit's one of the lightest shoes that's\navailable on the market right now and\nwhile there are a couple of shoes\nlighter there are a very few number of\nshoes that are this light and also this\nsuitable for racing a Marathon distance\nnot only for Elites and Pros but also\nfor non- Elites as well and so for those\nInnovations and what I think it will\nMark the beginning of in the next few\nyears in terms of what we're going to\nsee race product doing I felt like the\nNitro Elite 3 deserved the top spot as\nthe racing shoe of the year and then\nanother shoe that I like to put kind of\nin between the daily trainer and the\nracing shoe is the tempo shoe or the\nsession shoe it kind of has some\nfeatures of the daily trainer but some\nfeatures of AO but I really like to use\nit for workouts and again we have\nanother entrant from puma and this is\nthe deviate Nitro 3 now one of the\nthings that's unique about this shoe is\nthat it didn't change all that much and\nfor me that's a really good thing\nbecause the DV8 Nitro 2 was my shoe of\nthe year last year but there were a\nlittle tweaks in the upper that made the\nfit a little bit more suitable to its\ntask and there were very small shape\nchanges to the MSL that I think made it\na little bit more exciting still\ncompared to the already excellent shoe\nof last year so this shoe I think is\nsignificant in the sense that it reminds\nme that if you have a really excellent\nshoe with really excellent material you\ndon't always have to reinvent the wheel\nevery single year in order to stay on\ntop the DV8 Nitro 3 remains an excellent\nshoe and it was my top Tempo trainer of\nthe year now let's get into the shoes\nthat you might want to run in when you\nare beat up from all those Tempo\nworkouts and from your racing and that's\nthe max cushion category and this year\nfor me this was the glisser and Mac this\nwas a completely new shoe type from\nBrooks and I think it is an a great\nexposition of what I'm looking for in\nmodern Max cushion now we still have the\nidea of the classic Max cushion we have\nthe Bondies the atmos the more version 5\nthose are shoes that I think we still\nneed in the running space but as far as\nwhat I like and what's more modern I\nlove what's going on with the glycerin\nMax it's giving us what I think is a\nreimagined version of what plushness and\ncomfort are it's not just stinging a\nwhole bunch of memory foam in a tongue\nand in a heel collar but instead it's\ngiving us Comfort up top and a great\namount of squishiness on the bottom that\nisn't too mushy and so you're not\ngetting completely mired down in\nquicksand as you're running it's just\nthe right amount of excellent softness\nit's super comfortable for me and I love\nwhat it could mean from the future of\nBrooks as they expand to appeal to\ndifferent types of running consumers\nthan they typically have been targeting\nand then the last category of shoe that\nI want to talk about at the far end of\nthe spectrum is I think a newer category\nof shoe a subgenre of the max cushion\nMarket if you want it is the long run\nshoe and these are shoes that can do a\nlot of the same things that Max cushion\nshoes do and maybe this category\ndisappears in a couple years depending\non what Max cushion does in the future\nbut for now I consider this a separate\nsubcategory because it uses a lot of\nracing materials in the midsole and it\ngenerally tries to keep things more\nminimal in terms of puffiness and\npadding in the upper if we look at the\nsuper Blast 2 I think it's a great\nexample of that we've got a bunch of FF\nturbo plus which is the foam that\nthey're using in their latest gen Racing\nshoes from as6 a little bit of daily\ntraining foam on the bottom to help keep\nthings stabilized and this heel collar\nhas less padding in it than the Glide\nride Max or the Nimbus might have so\nit's trying to keep things a little bit\nmore Nimble even though it's in this Max\ncushion type of package I've really been\nenjoying these YP of shoes for runs that\nare not only long but also have a little\nbit of pace changes in them those are my\nfavorite kind of long runs to do and\nthese are shoes that I feel like are\npurpose built for it this shoe along\nwith the Invincible I think pretty much\ninvented the category and it's been the\ntype of shoe that I've been most excited\nabout in the last couple of years and\nfor that reason the super Blast 2 is a\nsignificant shoe and not only just an\nexcellent example of its class and so\namongst these shoes I think you have a\nreally fantastic albe it expensive but a\nreally fantastic and fun running shoe\nrotation most people don't need to get\nall five of these shoes and if I were to\nboil it down to just one shoe to have of\nall these shoes that shoe for me would\nbe the Puma devi8 Nitro 3 this is going\nto be two for two a repeat for the devi8\nNitro Series in taking shoe of the year\nI think it can do easy running it can do\nfast running it could do long running\nit's maybe not the best recovery run\nshoe but I think that if you wanted to\nget one and only one shoe from racing to\nrecovery run the DV8 Nitro 3 could be\nthat shoe and for that reason that's why\nit's my 2024 shoe of the year so those\nare my thoughts on the best running\nshoes of 2024 it has been a great year\nto be a runner and I could say that from\na personal perspective it has been a\ngreat year to be a shoe reviewer I've\nhad a great time testing and reviewing\nthese shoes and I've particularly\nenjoyed talking to you guys about how\nthese shoes feel on foot I'm really\nexcited for what's to come in 2025 and\nI've already started testing a bunch of\nnew shoes hit the Subscribe button so\nyou could see those reviews as they\nbecome available next year but that's\ngoing to be the end of this video and\nthe end of my running shoe review videos\nfor 2024 thanks so much for making it\nall the way to the end of this video and\nthis year and I look forward to seeing\nyou in\n2025 yo what's going on\n[Music]\nn\n[Music]",

shoe that\nthere might be other shoes that I\nactually prefer running when it comes to\nMax cushion shoes but I'm going to put\nit in this five SWOT because of what it\nrepresents and that shoe is from New\nBalance it's the Fresh Foam X more\nversion 5 this shoe gets the number five\nspot for me this year because it\nrepresents the best of what's available\nin what I would consider traditional Max\ncushion this is a very tall stack height\nshoe that is a bit on the kind of firm\nside it's not as soft and cushioned as\nit might appear but that all comes in\nhandy because it's still giving you a\ngood amount of stability there's a\nreally nice wide footprint on it there's\nplenty of shoe for your foot to land on\nand that wide footprint prevents the\nshoe from kind of caving in one way or\nthe other and so it kind of provides a\nlittle bit of stability to go with all\nthat foam that's underfoot to provide a\nnice comfortable experience for a long\nperiod on feet the updates to the more\nfor the version 5 this year I think make\nit much more comfortable as a run walk\nshoe or a shoe that you're just going to\nbe in for several hours if you're going\nto be on your feet all day or running a\nlongdistance PR and even though this\nshoe isn't my favorite style of Max\ncushion shoes in 2024 I think it\ndeserves a spot on list cuz it is the\nbest of what 2024 had to offer in terms\nterms of this classic Max cushioning now\nin the number four spot we're going to\nstart to see some more modern\nadaptations some more updated takes on\nwhat Max cushion is and in the fourth\nspot for me is a shoe from a brand that\nhasn't really made it into a lot of my\ntop five lists previously but it's\nmaking it this year with the infinite\nElite this shoe is from Under Armour and\nit uses a foam that Under Armour isn't\ntelling us exactly what's in here but\nit's a beaded foam that reminds me a lot\nof either either older boost kind of\nlike remember the Pure Boost or Pure\nBoost HD days or a little bit more\nrecently than that it kind of reminds me\nof the foam that was in the Triumph 20\nor 21 it kind of has that power run plus\nfeel not power R PB which is a pea based\nuh beaded foam which is more racing\ncaliber but the power and plus which\nkind of had a little bit more of a pace\nversatility at the expense of that top\nend speed and I think that's kind of a\nlot of what we're getting with the Under\nArmour infinite Elite that beaded foam\nthat's in here gives a good amount of\ncushioning but a really nice amount of\nresponsiveness too and there's a lot of\ncomfortable plush padding in the upper\nwhich is kind of a signature of a lot of\nthese Max cushion shoes is that they go\nover the top in terms of padding so\nthere is a lot of heft to this shoe so\nit's not exactly something that I'd want\nto try and run very fast or very long in\nbut for those times where I want to have\na little bit of extra Comfort but still\nwant to have a little bit pep in there\nkind of have a cake and get to eat it\ntoo I feel like the under arour infinite\nis a pretty solid Max cushion shoe and a\nvery promising entry from under arour in\nthe performance running market now let's\nmove to the number three spot and this\nis a shoe that I think has basically\ncome back from the grave it's a shoe\nthat I thought was discontinued but now\nwe're seeing it resurrected as the Glide\nride Max now this is a shoe that was the\nfirst shoe in the A6 lineup to give us a\npre review of what FF blast Max that's\none of the layers of foam that's on this\nshoe and it does it in a pretty familiar\nupper it's very Nimbus likee in the\nupper here but the reason why I prefer\nthe Glide ride Max to the Nimbus and why\nI think the Glide ride Max makes it into\nthe number three spot of the best Max\ncushion shoes of the year is because of\nthe Foams that are in here you're\ngetting a really nice amount of Squish\nthat just feels so good if you've had a\nhard session the day before but the shoe\nalso roll really well so if you do have\na little bit of a longer easy run that\nyou want to be a little extra\ncomfortable on I feel like the Glide\nride Max is going to be an easy decision\nfor me to pick up now moving into the\ntwo spot is a shoe from puma and this\nshoe is brand new for this year in 2024\nand that is the mag Max this is a shoe\nthat is using Nitro Foams in a way that\nI think is very unique and Innovative\ncompared to what I would normally think\nabout nitrogen injected Foams typically\nI find that Nitro Foams can be a little\nbit firm for daily training or recovery\nrunning purposes but the way they've\ntinkered with the formulas on these\nFoams has made this shoe very soft but\nalso still very bouncy it is I think a\nbit on the heavy side and there is a\nvery wide footprint for you to land on\nhere and so I think the width of the\nshoe makes it a little bit harder to\nWrangle for if you wanted to pick up the\npace that combined with the weight makes\nit not really fit in that long run sub\ngenre of the max cushion category but I\nthink it makes for an excellent modern\nMax cushion shoe where you are getting a\nreally great amount of comfort it's a\npleasure to step into on a recovery run\nday but it's got so much bounce that the\nshoe is very eager to run for miles and\nmiles and miles so you don't really feel\nthat traditional penalty that you might\nnormally associate with Max cushion\nshoes it's been a real pleasure to run\nin this one and it I think it rounds out\nwhat has been a fantastic year from top\nto bottom from Puma now for the number\none spot is a shoe that I instantly fell\nin love with the Brooks Glycerin Max\nthis shoe has a very tall stack height\nof Brooks DNA tune foam which again is\nanother way that a brand has taken\nnitrogen injected Foams and tinkered\nwith them in a way that you get some\nsoftness and also peppiness at the same\ntime now the way that Brooks does it is\nwith two different densities of foam and\nthose two Foams work together really\nnicely to again give you a really great\namount of comfort while also giving you\na little bit of Pep now I think that in\nterms of the Comfort versus bounciness I\nthink that the Puma magmax kind of Balan\nthe two things really well so you get a\ngood amount of cushion and a good amount\nof Pep I think with the glycerin Max\nyou're really amping up the cushion and\nyou're losing a little bit on the pep\nbut this is the max cushion category\nafter all and so I feel like in this\ncategory I don't really penalize shoes\nfor being a little bit on the\nunnecessarily heavy side a little bit on\nthe unnecessarily plush side because\nthis is a shoe that I want to be really\ncomfortable in and when it comes to\ncomfort for me the max amount of comfort\nyou can get in the max cushion category\nfor 2024 is from the glycerin Max and\nbecause it's so different from the\ntraditional glycerin I'm really excited\nthat Brooks has found this kind of like\npermission structure to really\nexperiment with Foams and deliver\nexperiences that are different than what\nBrooks typically has to offer so I'm\nvery excited about what the future holds\nfor Brooks based on what the glycerin\nMax is doing and so that's why it takes\nthe number one spot for me those are my\nfavorite Max cushion shoes for 2024 let\nme know what you've been reaching for on\nrecovery run days or for those long slow\ndistance days put them in the comments\ndown below or better yet stop by the\nlive streams that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel love to talk to you guys over\nthere in the chat that's all I for today\neverybody thanks so much for making it\nall the way to the end of this video\nhopefully you guys are staying safe out\nthere on your runs and I will see you in\nthe next one yo what's going on\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

      "text": "we are now in the thick of it for my\npreparation for the half marathon at\nHouston and after a week six some people\nwere a little bit concerned that this\nrun up plan just might break me but now\nthat two more weeks have passed let's\nsee how I'm holding up this is a runup\nupdate at week 8\n[Music]\nyo what's going on kzi coming to you on\nlocation from my backyard last time it\nwas cold and snowing and today it is\ncold and snowing but in the interim a\nlot has happened weatherwise you're\ngoing to see that weather is a main\ncharacter for this 8 week update now\neven though the six week update was just\nlast week and one week later you're\nwatching this through the magic of\nediting I'm able to fit in 2 weeks of\ntraining with the Runa app let's see how\nit's been going starting with week s day\none Monday a\nsession Monday week s was a Tempo a\nworkout The Plan called for 2K over\nunders 2K at 720 per mile then 2K at 625\nper mile and then repeat that for a\ntotal of three continuous sets the\ntempts were really cold for this one 22\u00b0\nf with an icy wind and I had a hard time\nstaying in range for the faster portion\nof the first two sets I was in the adios\nPro 4 which is one of my favorite shoes\nright now that I'm currently testing and\nthey were great for this range of paces\nand for the last rep I was able to run\neven faster than what was prescribed and\ntypically I try not to overdo it when it\ncomes to Paces on a training plan you\nrun the pace that prescribed so you get\nthe workout and strain that is intended\nbut since I didn't quite hit the mark\nfor the first two reps I felt like it\nwas okay to try and make it up a bit on\nthe last one and then for apparel I ran\nin the two times U full tights which\naren't the warmest full tights that I\nhave but I have been loving them for\nhard sessions they are very expensive\nand I haven't had them for very long but\nthey are so worth it and have instantly\nbecome one of my fa favorite full\n[Music]\ntights Tuesday was a little bit warmer\nbut still pretty cold for my easy 9 1 12\nmile run I was wor testing another pair\nof shoes that I can't show you and I'm\nsorry about that but I promise that\nthere aren't too many more days like\nthis I ran one of my more usual Loops in\nthe area I start out by the police\nstation and then run over to the river\nand the temps have gotten cold enough\nthat the water is starting to freeze\n[Music]\nover Wednesday was another session day\nthis workout was called a drop set two\nreps each starting at 1K intervals then\n800 M then 600 M then 400 and then 200 M\nand as the Reps get shorter the paces\nget faster I reached for the Evo one for\nthis workout as they are one of the\nlightest and fastest shoes that I have\nright now and they were at about 55 Mi\nof total mileage before this workout and\nyou could see that there is some damage\non the left shoe I think that an energy\nRod is causing a bit of a cavity on the\nbottom of the shoe and that's what's\ncreating this dimple but as far as I can\ntell I don't have a broken rod\n[Music]\nnow I don't have a ton of experience\nrunning very fast intervals so my pacing\nwas a bit all over the place for this\none but on average I think I was right\nwhere I was supposed to be except on the\n200s I was way fast on the 200s it was a\ntough workout but it didn't feel like it\nwas an exceedingly hard workout it felt\nrigorous but\n[Music]\nmanageable Thursday was a recovery run\n5.5 m easy and it was cold 19\u00b0 fhe and\nwindy made it feel downright Arctic by\nthis point in any training block my body\nis starting to hurt kind of all over and\nthis Runa training plan is no different\nI've been pretty not good about keeping\nup with my usual pre-run Mobility\nroutine and I have been skipping pretty\nmuch all of my strength and conditioning\nand Mobility work that Runa has been\nassigning so even though this run was\nsupposed to be a recovery run it\nbasically just felt a little bit\nuncomfortable\nback in week one when I set up my\ntraining plan Runa gave me the option to\nadd in strengthened conditioning and\nMobility work and of course I said yes\nto each of those things even though I\ndon't have the best track record of\nkeeping up with either one of those and\nthat's because for some reason I thought\nthis Runa training plan would be a\nlittle on the easy side so I thought I'd\nhave plenty of time and plenty of energy\nto get all this essenc and Mobility work\ndone that hasn't exactly been the case\nfor me fortunately run it has a feature\nwhere if it notices you skipped or\nmissed a couple of strength and\nconditioning sessions it lets you go\nthrough and Autos skip all the things\nthat you missed so that way you don't\nhave to go through and individually\nclick that you're skipping those\nsections and that's\nconvenient Friday was a long run 16 Mi\nconversational Pace temps again were\npretty cold but I definitely overdressed\nfor this one I had a long sleeve a\njacket a neck gator and a winter cap on\nand after a while I could feel my back\ngetting soaked from sweat so I took off\nthe jacket and put it into my pack I had\nabout a liter of scratch in there but I\ndidn't bring any food for some reason I\nguess I figured it was an easy 16 so I\nshouldn't have to need to eat as long as\nI had enough fluids but I got pretty\nhungry at about the halfway point when I\nturned around I was testing the New\nBalance 1080 version 14 for this run I\ndidn't feel like I needed to worry about\ntaking this shoe out for 16 miles on my\nfirst run in them is I have loved every\n1080 that I've ever run\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nin but I didn't love version 14 it's not\nbad it's just not an improvement over\nversion 13 in my opinion I think new\nbalance is taking the 1080 in a\ndifferent\nway at one point during this run I just\nfelt really tired so I stopped and put\nmy jacket back on and I just stood there\nto catch my breath for a moment it was\nweird 16 Mi easy takes a long time but\nthey don't usually feel all that hard\nbut this felt like a lot for some reason\nI guess this is what happens when you\ntrain specifically for a half\nmarathon the weather got suddenly super\nwarm the next day like 25\u00b0 warmer over a\n24-hour period I think that's maybe a\n13\u00b0 CSUS swing and I ran in a long\nsleeve and a thin vest just in case\nthere was an icy wind but I was\ndefinitely overdressed I probably could\nhave run in just a t-shirt maybe some\ngloves but overall it was a nice easy\nsix on a ball me\n[Music]\nday Sunday was an 11m easy run it was\n51\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 C and compared to what things\nhave been like earlier in the week this\npretty much felt like\nsummer for this run I decided to drive\nover to Al gin which is the next town\nover and then I ran on the Prairie Trail\npretty much all the way back home now I\ncould have run this the other way around\nand saved myself a bunch of driving but\nby doing it this way it's uphill on the\nway out and downhill on the way back and\nI always will prefer to save the\ndownhill for the\n[Music]\nend now week 8 was a D Lo week and it\nwas my second D Lo week so far in this\nprogram and the idea with these is that\nit's kind of like a taper where you\nreduce your mileage but maintain\nintensity and that gives your body a\nchance to absorb all the work that\nyou've been doing before you get back at\nit the following week now at this point\nin the program by week s going into week\neight my body is feeling pretty creaky\nwhich is pretty normal for me and\nanytime I enter into a training program\nonce I get to kind of like the higher\nmileage and higher intensity weeks my\nbody really starts to feel it and so\ngetting up out of a chair takes a little\nbit of extra groaning and moaning as\nthings are a bit stiff and every time I\nwake up in the morning my feet always\nreally hurt for those first few steps of\nthe day so I thought for this D Lo week\nI was going to make extra sure that I\nwas going to do all of the strength and\nconditioning and more importantly the\nmobility work for week\n[Music]\nweek eight Monday is another session day\nand this was short and fast 10 * 400 at\n550 pace and then 10 * 200 at 530 I\nreached for the Puma Nitro Elite 3 for\nthis workout the angle of attack on that\nshoe works really well for when you want\nto turn over quickly and I felt strong\non this one again it wasn't easy rather\nit was pretty rigorous but it felt like\nsomething I could handle temps were\nquite warm again so I ran with the door\nlong sleeve which is one of the airiest\nthinnest long sleeves I have and I felt\nlike this was a good pick for the day I\nwas even warm enough to take off my\ngloves for a few of the 200 met reps and\nI was glad that it was mild for this\nsession trying to do this last week when\nit was colder would have been much more\ndifficult the day after a session like\nthat would normally be an easy run or a\ncomplete rest day for most plans\nespecially on a d week which week eight\nwas supposed to be but instead I had\nsessions 2 days in a row which made not\nall that much sense to me now I've run\ndouble threshold days before so I'm used\nto working on tired legs but there's\nsomething about big workouts on\nconsecutive days that still feels kind\nof wrong well unless your body has the\nresilience of a High School cross\ncountry Runner I do not so this workout\nwas a fem time trial so after a short 1K\nwarm-up Runner had me trying to run 5\nmiles at 620 Pace the day after I had\nrun I bunch of 400s and a bunch of 200s\nnow I feel like this would be a big\nsession even on fresher legs so at the\noutset I decided that if I could just\naverage 635 or 15 seconds slower than\ngoal Pace Runner would still consider\nthat within range but even that was hard\non my tired legs so early on in this\nworkout I tried not to worry about the\npace so much but instead I focused on\nthe things that I've been trying to\nremind myself this entire block first is\nthat I can trust myself to keep pushing\nand know that there will still be\nsomething left to finish out the rep so\nI don't have to back off and the other\nthing that I've been trying to do is\nrelish the painful parts and of course I\ndon't mean that I've been running\nthrough pain like injury pain but I mean\nthat I've been running through pain in\nthe sense that my muscles are yearning\nfor more oxygen and my blood is thirsty\nfor sugar that kind of pain being able\nto persist in that moment means that\nI've been working hard and that the plan\nhas been working and that a lot has gone\nright in order for me to reach that\npoint in the work out where I am faced\nwith the decision of can I keep pushing\nI want to relish that moment I want to\nrelish that decision and that entire\nfeeling and then also be able to say yes\nI do want to keep going this pain point\nis where all the good stuff happens and\nI'm trying to relish staying in these\nmoments\noverall though the average for the 5\nmiles was 643 which was slower than what\nRuna wanted even slower than I thought I\nwould be able to hit on the day but\noverall I was happy I was able to\nsurvive these last two days which were a\ngigantic stimulus that I know is going\nto pay dividends\n[Music]\nlater Wednesday I finally got my day day\noff and for the first time in a long\ntime I enjoyed a planned rest day but\nThursday was an easy 8.5 mile run and a\nlegs and core super set it was super\ncold that day 12\u00b0 f or11 c and I put on\nmy warmest running jacket which is\nactually from a snowboarding apparel\ncompany the Fox River which is that body\nof water that I run by frequently is\nstarting to freeze over pretty hard now\nand that's weird because it doesn't feel\nlike it was all that long ago that this\nspot was full of jet skis and pontoon\n[Music]\nboats that evening I took my daughter to\nrock climbing practice and used that\ntime to get in my strength work first\nthere were these squats that you do on\nyour toes then there were these toe\ntouches that look easy but quickly\nreminded me how much I've been\nneglecting core work over the past\nseveral years then there were these fire\nhydrants which felt pretty nice for my\nhip followed by Hew walks that I think I\nmust be doing wrong because they don't\nfeel like they're doing anything for me\nand then I went through all these\nexercises a second time now at this\npoint the workout shifted over to the\nhip thrust machine the workout called\nfor two sets of the following single leg\nhip thrust which I definitely felt in my\nglutes and then after that were these\nlunge presses there was a lot of reps in\neach set so I picked up the lightest\nkettle bell I could find but even that\nstarted to feel pretty heavy by the end\nof the set and then after that were some\nplanks which again I never do any core\nwork and so these were ridiculously\n[Music]\nhard it was about 14\u00b0 Fahrenheit on that\nFriday or about -10\u00b0 C and as cold as\nthat is I've definitely been\noverdressing for my run so far the past\ncouple weeks so today I had a very thick\nlong sleeve and a vest the long sleeve\nhas a built-in Bala clava in it and\nwhile it makes me look pretty goofy it\nis definitely warm for my head and face\nbut it took a while for my upper body to\nwarm up though and that's the tricky\npart about winter running you're either\ncomfortable at the beginning and Soggy\nand Cold by the end from sweating too\nmuch or you're cold at the beginning and\nthen just a bit less soggy at the end of\nthe run there never seems to be a\nperfect level of layering for winter\nrunning now Marine Hills is one of my\nfavorite places to run in the area I run\nhere A bunch of times but the only\ndownsides are that there's a couple of\nvery hilly parts and at times it can get\npretty windy and also there are Gates\nthat keep the part locked up until 8:00\na.m. so it's hard to get an early start\nfor your long runs here but otherwise\nit's pretty much a perfect 8 and a half\nmile\n[Music]\nLoop Saturday was another rest day and\nschedule wise this worked out one of my\ndaughters had a cheerleading competition\nthat day so we spent most of the day\nsitting in bleachers and by the end of\nit I was really in Need for some\nMobility work and Runa had a yoga\nsession planned for me now I was\ninitially a bit reluctant to film this\nbecause we're still working on building\nout a little home gym in the basement\nbut it's not done yet and the basement\nitself is unfinished and so I was\nworried that it might look a little bit\nunimpressive but then I noticed that the\nyoga session that had been scheduled for\nme that day was filmed in what appeared\nto be a basement or I guess since Runa\nis a British app this would be called a\ndungeon so if a dungeon was good enough\nfor a runner my unfinished basement is\ngood enough for this video now I love\nthe idea of yoga but I don't love actual\nyoga it did get me loosened up pretty\nnicely though and I felt good overall\nafterwards and then Sunday was supposed\nto be an easy 7.5m run but I had to do\nthis after driving for a few hours in\nsome difficult conditions we were\nactually supposed to drive to Grandma's\nhouse in Iowa after the cheerleading\ncompetition the day prior but ice storms\nkept us at home overnight temps had\nrisen quite a bit though so roads were\nclear but now things were very foggy\nSunday was supposed to be a Christmas\ncookie baking day at Grandma's house\nwith all the cousins so while the\nchildren baked with Grandma I went out\nfor my run the paved roads were all very\nclear but portions of the dirt road were\na bit crunchy and some of the less\ntravel Bridges were completely covered\nin ice the cows all seem to be enjoying\nthe foggy morning though and the quick\nrise in temps this week must have made\nconditions favorable for spreading\nfertilizer and I will admit that seeing\nthe farmers spreading literal poop into\nthe air made me feel a bit less bad\nabout the emergency pit stop I had to\nmake earlier in the Run\ncan I stay for a while cuz I don't know\nany\nbetter I should say something clever but\ncan't think\n[Music]\nwhatsoever I was also supposed to do a\nstrength session that day but we had to\ndrive back home that same day from\nGrandma's house so the kids could go to\nschool one last week before the holiday\nbreak so while I wanted to do every\nsingle session this week weather\nconditions left me with about 7 hours of\nTotal driving on Sunday and little time\nleft for\n[Music]\nstrength and I don't care about the\nconsequences I think you know that\ntoo so that's it for week eight of my\ntraining plan for the half marathon at\nHouston I'm feeling good feeling\nconfident most of the time time and I'm\nreally thankful that there's been a\nreduction in my work travel so that I\nhave the time and energy to get in some\nof these accessory sessions that I've\nnormally been either just too tired or\ntoo busy to do stay tuned now for week\n10 update that'll come in the beginning\nof 2025 that gets us really close to\ntaper time for Houston so at that point\nin the week 10 update we'll talk about\nwhat Runner thinks that I'm going to be\nable to run for Houston what I think I'm\ngoing to able to run for Houston and\nwhat the race PL going to be if you want\nto try run out for yourself use code\nkofuzi for two free weeks I don't get\npaid any extra whether you use the code\nor not but it's there if you want\nit slow it down take it easy I just keep\nstaring at my phone",

    "description": "I\u2019m creating a new category to reflect a shift I\u2019m seeing in max cushion shoes. While there are traditional max cushion shoes that we look to for plush easy days and relaxed recovery runs, there are some max cushion shoes that forgo the excess padding and use race caliber foams to deliver an experience that is both comfy and quick. Shoes like the Superblast, Invincible, and Cloud Eclipse have led the way in this new subgenre, and in 2024, it felt weird to keep ranking these shoes against the likes of the Bondi or Glycerin. So this year, I\u2019m ranking my Top 5 Best Long Run Shoes of 2024. \n\n0:00 intro\n1:46 Disclosures\n2:06 Mizuno Neo Vista\n3:08 New Balance Balos\n4:23 Topo Specter 2\n5:18 New Balance SC Trainer v3\n6:12 ASICS Superblast 2\n\ndisclosures: all the shoes in this video were provided by their respective manufacturer for the purpose of review during the normal course of the year.

      "text": "there is a new category of running shoe\nthat goes jumbo with the Foams but stays\nminimal with weight they use racing\nmaterials in their midsoles and they\ndon't always have a carbon fiber plate\nthese are the shoes that look like\nthey're Max cushion shoes but they run\nlike they could be your next marathon\nracer these are my top five long run\nshoes of 2024\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk about the best long run\nshoes of 2024 now this is a new category\nthat I've created and I think it might\ncause a little bit of confusion so let's\nstart off by kind of setting it straight\nas to why I made this new category of\nlong run shoe I've been seeing a kind of\ndivision happening within the max\ncushion category there's kind of the old\nschool max cushion that's super cushion\nsuper relaxed and usually super heavy\nand plush that's used for Recovery runs\nand then there's been this new\ngeneration of Max cushion shoes that\ndon't just want to go slow and I find\nthat they are best for those marathon\ntraining session long runs that have a\nlittle bit of pace Variety in there that\ncould go faster than just your easy run\nor your recovery run pace and enjoy\nrunning up to Marathon effort these are\nthe shoes that I've been reaching for\nwhenever I have a long run and I put\nthem into their own category but before\nI give you my list on my favorites in\nthis new category I do want to go over\nsome disclosures no one is paying me to\nmake this video or to include their shoe\non this list and no one's going to get a\nchance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the top long run shoes and\nlet's start with number five starting us\noff on this list is a new entrant from\nMuno and this is the Neo Vista this shoe\ncombines a very comfortable knit upper\nwith a brand new foam mizuno's enery NXT\nit's a shoe that is kind of like a super\ncritical foam Muno wouldn't tell me\nexactly what it is but Muno says that\nit's better than super critical Eva\nfoams it's a very squishy foam with a\nlot of movement to it compression and a\nsoft decompression and it's paired with\na Muno wave plate which is a glass fiber\nreinforced plastic plate all these\nthings put together create a shoe that I\ndidn't love for easy and Recovery Paces\nbut when you pick up the pace a little\nbit and really get rolling the amount of\ncompression and decompression works well\nfor those days where you need to bark a\nlittle bit faster than easy but because\nbecause of the fact that it disagrees\nwith me so much on those easy and\nRecovery Paces that's why it only barely\ncracks the list at number five now\nmoving into the number four spot is\nanother new shoe from a brand and that\nis the New Balance BOS now this is a\nshoe that uses Fresh Foam X but not just\nany fresh foam X this Fresh Foam X\nactually has a bit of peba mixed into\nthe blend and it reminded me a lot of\nthe 1080 version 13 which I Absol loved\nbut taken kind of like to the next level\nand there's more of that fun bounciness\nthat the 1080 version 13 had and while\nit is a little bit on the heavy side and\nnot necessarily something I would race\nin also there's no carbon fiber plate in\nhere it's just a lot of fun to take for\nthose efforts where you're going to pick\nup the pace a little bit maybe you got\nan uptempo run or a marathon training\nrun on Deck the Ballance is going to be\nreally fun now I did have some problems\nrunning in this shoe personally I've got\na weird thing with my foot every once in\na while while a shoe just tends to\naggravate it and the Ballance was\nunfortunately one of those shoes for me\nbut for the amount of time that I was\nable to run painfree in this shoe it is\ndelightful and it's a shoe that I've\nbeen trying to really recommend even\nthough I've had a hard time running in\nit it's a shoe that I've been really\ntrying to recommend to a lot of Runners\nlooking for exactly this type of shoe\nbecause the sensation it gives is so\nmuch fun moving into number three is a\nbrand that I always feel like is a\nlittle bit overlooked because it is a\nsmaller brand and a lot of the shoes\ndon't get the same hype that some of the\nbigger Global Brands can bring but at\nnumber four I want to talk to you guys\nabout the toppo Spectre 2 now this is a\nshoe that uses an all Beed pabx mid\nsooam it's got it right on the side of\nthe midsole here and it doesn't have a\ncarbon fiber plate so it's not\ntechnically a marathon racer but it's\ndesigned for Marathon road runners and\nthis is a fantastic shoe for anything\nfrom Easy runs all the way up to those\nlonger runs with Marathon on E for miles\nin them the beaded PE foam Works in here\nreally well there's a wide foot-shaped\ntoe box in here and a 5 mm drop all\nthings that I think set up very nicely\nfor a shoe that you're going to be in\nfor several hours at a time and also\nwanting to run fast now for the number\ntwo spot for me is a shoe that I think\nis going to be a number one spot for a\nlot of you out there because so many of\nyou have been able to run well in it and\nthat's from New Balance that's the SC\nTrainer version three they've got an\nupdated version of fuel cell in this\nshoe which is their racing caliber foam\nand this is the only shoe in this\ncategory that has a carbon fiber plate I\nfeel like this shoe is designed a little\nbit more for heel Strikers and so I\nthink that's why I don't always get\nalong with it as well as some of my\nother friends do but I also know that\nthis is shoe that even I can take for\nlong runs especially if there's some\nPace pickups in there and I know for a\nlot of people for whom like the regular\ncarbon fiber races are maybe a little\nbit too aggressive the SC Trainer series\nfrom version one all the way through\nversion three has been a perennial\nfavorite and is usually one of the first\nshoes that I recommend for those people\nwho want something a little bit\ndifferent than the normal carbon plated\nracer for their Marathon shoe and that\nbrings me to my number one shoe and this\nis the shoe that in my mind pretty much\ncreated the category because it is so\nbig but also because it is so light\nbecause it is so comfortable but because\nit can also move so quickly and that's\nthe A6 super Blast 2 it's got a big\nhelping of FF turbo plus the newest\nversion of A6 racing super foam and it's\ngot a layer of FF blast Plus on the\nbottom to help it stabilize without the\nuse of a plate this is a shoe that I\nknow a lot of you guys are using as a\nregular Max cushion shoe using it for\nyour easy runs and your recovery run\ndays but me personally I love it for\nthose long runs that are going to take\ntwo to three hours or more and I'm going\nto have to do a little bit of work Pace\nwise within that long run those the\nexact type of situations where I'm\nreaching for the super Blast 2 so those\nare my favorite shoes to reach for when\nI've got a long run a tough long run on\nthe calendar let me know what you've\nbeen logging your biggest longest runs\nin I'd love to hear about it in the\ncomments down below or better yet stop\nby the live stream that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking it all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]",

of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about my top five speedwork shoes\nand let's start with number five this\nFive Spot was actually pretty tough for\nme to fill there was a lot of shoes that\ncould have gone here but ultimately I\nlanded on the Hoka Mack X2 now this is a\nshoe that I didn't personally love but\nI'm putting it in the five spot because\nof the fact that so many of you guys\nhave been running really well in this\nshoe and you're using it exactly like\nhow I think a Tempo trainer should be\nused some of you are using it for your\ndaily training some of you are racing\nmarathons in it and a lot of you guys\nare using it for those days where you\nneed to pick up the pace there is a nice\ncombination of Foams in this shoe that\ndoes make it really suitable for for\nthose faster workouts and it has\nsomething a little bit extra than what\nyou would find in a regular daily\ntraining shoe and so even though it\ndoesn't completely line up with my\npreferences for a Tempo trainer because\nit has been so popular with you guys I'm\nmaking the People's Choice my number\nfive spot shoe for\n2024 now moving to number four is a\nbrand that a lot of you guys haven't\nheard of unless you're super into\nswimming or Triathlon and that's a shoe\ncoming from tier now they are new to the\nperformance running space and they came\nout with a bang in 2024 releasing this\nshoe the valkyrie speedworks and also a\nracing version of it the valkyrie Elite\nI particularly enjoy the valkyrie\nspeedwork because it has a beaded pea\nfoam and a nylon plate I feel like\nthey've done an excellent job with the\nfit of this shoe while also still giving\nit materials that are going to be able\nto withstand a bunch of workouts for\nrunners who really love the Endorphin\nSpeed 3 I feel like this is a shoe that\nyou're also absolutely going to love and\nthat you definitely should try I've been\nenjoying this shoe to wear casually for\ndaily training and also for workouts as\nwell and it's got my number four spot in\nthe speedwork category in 20124 now for\nnumber three is a shoe that kind of\nbreaks the mold a little bit in terms of\nthe definition but it's a shoe that I\ndefinitely reach for for very tough and\nespecially very fast workouts and that\nis the Tumi scent and the reason why\nthis Adidas shoe doesn't really fit in\nthe speedwork category shoe is because I\ndon't really see anyone using this shoe\nas a daily trainer so it doesn't have\nthat double duty rather this is a 5K 10K\nracing shoe and it's very low To The\nGround by 2024 standard but it has a\nhealthy dose of Adidas's Light Strike\nprobe their racing foam and it's got\nenergy rods in there as well to give it\na little bit of extra rigidity so you\ncan reach for it for those 5K races or\nfor those 00 M repeats or threshold mile\nrepeats that you might have on your\ncalendar it's just so much fun to do\nworkouts in and so much fun to race in\nthat it's a shoe that I perennially just\nabsolutely love and struggle to find the\nright category to put it in because I\nguess for me being Road Marathon focused\na 5k 10K racing shoe kind of is out of\nplace but that doesn't mean that I don't\nabsolutely love the tkumi in its 10th\niteration this year it comes in at\nnumber three in the training companion\ncategory now let's go to number two and\nif you've been watching all my videos\nthroughout the year this might be a\nsurprise that it's Fallen to the number\ntwo spot but the two spot goes to socony\nand that's the Endorphin speed 4 this is\na shoe that I've absolutely been loving\nand when I first reviewed it I thought\nthat it had shoe of the Year\ncapabilities because I absolutely love\nwhat they're doing with the power run PB\ntheir beaded peu foam and the nylon\nplate in the shoe they've created a shoe\nthat is lightweight really great and\ncomfortable for easy training but also a\nlot of fun for the peier stuff as well\nso if you got some threshold repeats or\na tempo run where you got long reps\nwhere you're running anywhere around\nMarathon effort or maybe just a little\nbit off of that this shoe is really fun\nto bring along for you I also think it\nlooks great and is very comfortable for\ncasual wear the shoe can pretty much do\nit all and that's why this year it comes\nin at the number two two spot but\nbecause it comes into the new number two\nspot the number one spot has to be a\nreally great shoe and I do think it\nreally is the Puma DV8 Nitro 3 not to be\nconfused with the Nitro Elite 3 the DV8\nNitro 3 is the top shoe in this category\nfor me this year and it was the top shoe\nin the category last year as well and\nthey really didn't Tinker too much with\nan already good thing they're using two\nkinds of nitro Foams in the shoe one of\nthose Foams being a nitrogen injected\npeo foam that is race caliber and it's\ngot a carbon fiber plate in here and the\ncombinations of foam and plate give this\nshoe the ability to go easy but also to\ngo fast really well now if I were to\ncompare the Endorphin speed 4 and the\ndevi8 Nitro 3 together I'd say the\nEndorphin speed 4 does daily training a\nlittle bit better but I think that the\nDV8 Nitro does work outs a lot better\nit's really fun to do fast workouts in\nand I think for a lot of people who\nmight think that traditional carbon\nplated Racers might be a little bit too\naggressive for them and not exactly\nsuiting what they're looking for in\ntheir Marathon Racing shoes and their\nhalf marathon Racing shoes I have been\nrecommending the DVA Nitro 3 as the next\nshoe that they should look at because I\nthink it has all those great quickness\ncapabilities but also has some comfort\nfeatures and durability features built\ninto it as well I think it really\nexemplifies the characteristics that I'm\nlooking for in a training companion or\nspeed workk type of shoe and it's just\nabsolutely delightful to run in whatever\nthe Run might be and that's why the DV8\nNitro 3 takes the top spot as Tempo\ntrainer of the year so those are my five\nspeedwork shoes that I've been loving\ndoing workouts in let me know what\nyou've been doing your tough and fast\nworkouts in put them in the comments\ndown below or better yet stop by the\nlive streams I do Mondays and Thursdays\nover on the kofuzi Run Club Channel love\nto talk to you guys over there in the\nchat that's all for today everybody\nthanks so much for making all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I will see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]",

      "text": "at age 45 I've been starting to think\nthat my PR days are behind me but I'm\nnow six weeks into my latest training\nblock getting ready for the half\nmarathon at Houston let's talk about how\nthings are\n[Music]\ngoing yo what's going on kofuzi here\ncoming to you on location from my\nbackyard starting a new series here and\nI thought we'd do something a little bit\ndifferent get away from the basement and\nmy two different sets that I have down\nthere so I thought I'd do this outside\nit is very cold getting colder and it\njust started snowing so this may be a\nreally bad idea but first things first I\nthink I should clarify that the event\nthat I am training for is at the Houston\nMarathon in January there's also a half\nmarathon that gets run at the same time\nso that's the event that I am running\nand this is an event that I ran before\nI've actually run both the full and the\nhalf ran the full in 2020 and then I ran\nthe half last year for a little bit of a\nPB\n1257 it was a long overdue to update\nthat PB but I was happy to notch that uh\nbut I did it in an annoying time CU it's\na\n1257 had I run 8 seconds faster I would\nbe A4 guy and that sounds just so much\nfaster than 125 I normally don't get to\nbothered with what my PBS are and\nmanaging little seconds like that but\nwhen it's that close it ends up being\nsomething that I've been thinking about\nfor the entire year now for that last\nbuild I was pretty much self-coached and\ndoing kind of the normal things that I\nnormally do for a marathon uh because I\ndon't really know how to trade myself\nfor a half marathon I did have a Little\nHelp from Sage giving me some pointers\non some workouts ahead of that half and\nthat was really helpful but this time I\nthought I would try using using the Runa\napp they are the sponsor for this series\nso let's take a look at what the\ntraining has been like so far and let's\nstart with week\nfive Mondays and Wednesdays are usually\nsession days but week five was the week\nI would be in Austin for the running\nevent so I rearranged my training in the\napp so that I could have a rest day that\ncoincided with my travel day and then\nTuesday was an easy run and I was going\nto be running with Tommy runs that\nmorning but to hit my mileage goal for\nthe day I needed to tack on a few miles\nbeforehand so I had to get up even\nearlier and run in the dark but the\nmiles went quickly the sunrise was\ngorgeous and then I was able to meet up\nwith Tommy now Tommy normally runs his\neasy runs faster than I do but this was\nhis first run since running the New York\nMarathon a couple weeks prior so that\nwas a bit of an equalizer and we had a\nfantastic run that morning\n[Music]\nthe next day Wednesday was a session day\nand it was a pretty big one at that 10 *\n800 with just 90 seconds of recovery\nthis is basically a yaso 800 a workout\nthat I typically do at the end of a\nmarathon training block when I'm super\nfit so I was a bit intimidated to find\nit here in the middle of a half marathon\ncycle just to up my things and go just\nto be free just want to Zone just to\nflow just to hang with the G sometime\nchill my the good news was that I was\nable to run in a secret prototype racing\nshoe from one of the shoe brands I was\nin town for the running event the bad\nnews is that I can't show it to you or\ntell you about it but I can say I think\nthat the shoe was really good and I\naveraged 3 minutes per 800 M repetition\nwhich means that the last 5 weeks of ARA\nhas put me in the equivalent of 3-hour\nmarathon Fitness and with how much I\nbeen struggling with running and work\ntravel over the last year I really never\nthought I'd be able to say I was near\nsub3 Marathon Fitness\n[Music]\nagain you know when\nthe Thursday was supposed to be an easy\n5 1 half miles but at the last minute I\nwas invited to help promote the A6\ntorches Taco run so I went to that event\nwith Drew whitcom and it was a really\ngood turnout a lot of friends were there\nbut the Run was a bit short in terms of\nwhat I needed for the day at about 3\nmiles so I thought about adding a couple\nmiles to fulfill my quota but the\nrunning event is always exhausting so I\nleft good enough alone and then on\nFriday I was supposed to run an easy 6\nbut this would end up being the first\nrunning session that I skipped with this\nRuna training block the night before was\nthe running event after party which is\ntypically a very fun but very long night\nSaturday I was back at home and back at\nit with an 11 Mile easy run and I feel\nlike I still had no voice after being at\nTR all week and I felt like I was on the\nverge of coming down with something but\nat least my legs felt good and I enjoyed\nthe\nrun and then on Sunday to wind up the\nweek I had my long run workout now this\nwas supposed to be a race simulator\nbased on the paces that Runa thinks that\nI can race a half marathon at right now\nand yaso 800s decides Runa thinks that I\nam in 640 per mile half marathon\nshape here we\ngo once\nagain one thing to keep in mind is that\nRuna started over in UK and Europe so I\nthink the training plans are written in\nkilometers and then converted over to\nmiles so a lot of times warm-ups will be\n6 or 1.2 M long or 1 to2 km and today's\nworkout was 3.7 M or 6K at 640 per mile\nand then 3.1 M or 5K at 640 per mile and\nthen there was an easy 2.5 miles or 4K\neach for warmup recovery and cool down\nfor total of about 14 Mi I was expecting\nto struggle and it was certainly hard\nbut I was able to hit the paces for\nthese longer intervals I've been really\nfocusing on keeping my foot on the gas\neven when I start to feel tired or\npanicked and I've been trying to remind\nmyself that I can keep holding on to the\neffort and the pace and just trust that\nI will still have more left in the tank\nto finish out the rest of the rep in a\nway it's been a leap of\nfaith so when I finish this run with the\nwork intervals at faster than G\nand after the successful yaso 800s\nearlier in the week I was starting to\nbelieve that this run app was actually\ngetting me into a level of really good\n[Music]\nFitness better check\n[Music]\nfor better Che the next week was the\nweek of Thanksgiving and because of how\nI rearranged last week I had to do a\nlittle bit of of rearranging for this\nweek also I wanted to do a Turkey Trot\nwith my daughter so that had to factor\ninto the rescheduling as well so Monday\nwhich is normally a session day was just\nan easy 7 miles and I can't show you any\nfootage of my shoes on this day either\nbecause I am we're testing a different\npair of shoes and there's an NDA I don't\nnormally like to running shoes that\naren't at least almost nearly production\nalready I'm only one person on this\nchannel and I can only run so many miles\nin a year so I like to kind of save my\nmiles for shoes that I'm actually going\nto review so I don't know why I agreed\nto do this wear\n[Music]\ntesting Tuesday we were at my in-laws in\nIowa for Thanksgiving and the workout\nwas\nk200 run a kilometer at 610 per mile and\nthen tack on an additional 200 at 530\nper mile so basically it was a 1200 met\nrepeats with a fast and then even faster\nPace in there the rest was just 90\nseconds and then repeat for a total of\neight reps this workout was really tough\nI brought the on cloud broom strike\nlight spray as I enjoy that shoe for\nvery fast work but even those shoes\ncouldn't help me hit these Paces I would\nconsider 610 for mile to be in between\n5K and 10K pace for me right now and\nthen having to speed up after a\nkilometer of that into a 200 M rep at\nessentially mile race space was so hard\nand so just when I thought I was getting\nthe hang of the Runa system it felt like\nthe rug was getting pulled out from\nunder me\n[Music]\nagain now back when I started this runup\nplan it led me select which race I Was\npreparing for it asked me what my level\nof experience was I don't consider\nmyself Elite but it's what I chose based\non Rena's definitions and it asked me\nfor a recent race result I just run\nBerlin Marathon about a month prior it\nasked me how many days per week I like\nto run every day please and it asked me\nwhat my long runs were like right now\nand from there it gave me a 13we\ntraining plan it was 13 weeks until the\nhalf marathon at Houston at the time and\nfrom day one the runup workouts have\nbeen very\ntough even the first day of the plan\nweek one day one was humbling it was a\nlong Tempo with paces that didn't seem\nall that intimidating on paper but I\nfelt like I had to give a race level\nallout effort on that day and I still\ndidn't hit the paces and it didn't get\neasier\n[Music]\n[Music]\nSo eventually at week four Runa did make\nan adjustment I Got a notification in\nthe app and after accepting the request\nfor changes it adjusted all my session\npaces and and once it did that\neverything was suddenly much more\nmanageable so much so that I thought\nthat maybe the app had\novercorrected but that K2 200's workout\ndefinitely put me back in my place this\nrun app was not going to cuddle\n[Music]\nme Wednesday was an easy run in the more\nversion 5 I had been so looking forward\nto running in a big mushy maxion shoe\nafter the K2 200s but the more version 5\ndidn't exactly deliver on what I was\nhoping for now it was exceptionally cold\non that day so I tried to keep that in\nmind as I was collecting my thoughts on\nthis shoe but this run wasn't as recover\nfull as I was hoping it would have\n[Music]\nbeen now Thursday was supposed to be an\ninterval session but it was also\nThanksgiving morning there was a Turkey\nTrot somewhat nearby that my daughter\nwanted to try the event is a very hilly\n2 and 1/2 Mile Loop and my daughter\ndecided she would race the one laap Loop\nwhile I raced the two they gave out\nturkeys as a prize to the winner of each\nage group and based on prior year\nresults it looked like my daughter and I\neach had a very small but nonzero chance\nof winning the tempts were super cold it\nwas the coldest my daughter has ever run\nin and we lined up a little bit off the\nstarting line as there were a lot of\nyoung fast Runners at this event my goal\nwas to make sure that she got out of the\nshoot safely before I took off but after\nabout half a mile I could still hear my\ndaughter Breathing heavily behind me at\nabout 610 pace and this was a bit too\nfast for each of us so I told her to\nslow down right as we took the first\ngiant downhill now I have really no idea\nhow to Pace a 5m race and I especially\ndon't know how to Pace a 5m race with\nthis kind of elevation change in it but\nI just went with the flow and it ended\nup with a 6-minute first mile the Second\nMile was all uphill but at least it was\ngradual and then we hit the really big\nhill it was over a 100 ft of gain in\nabout a third of a mile and I heavily\ndebated power hiking my arms were numb\nFrozen and burning at the same time then\nwe finally hit the crest and roll down\nto the starting line to end lap one and\nfor the second lap I was now able to see\nwho who I was actually racing against\nthere were a couple of guys around me my\nage and mostly children and I took the\nbig downhill a bit easier this time then\non the uphill Second Mile I pushed a bit\nharder than I did the first time and on\nthe last giant uphill I saw a guy about\nmy age and started to track him down I\nmanaged to pass him as we crested the\ntop and yelled at him to come with me to\nthe Finish but he wasn't able to keep up\nand I crossed the line\n[Music]\ninstantly I felt like I had paced myself\nincorrectly because I was tired at the\nFinish but not race tired does that make\nsense and then when I found my daughter\nwe looked up the results she had come in\nthird in her age group and I came in\nsecond there was another guy a guy I\ndidn't see who finished about 30 seconds\nahead of me but even though we didn't\nwin any turkey we had fun some people\neven recognized me at the event which is\nnot something I typically experience\nwhen I go to Iowa but no one asked me if\nI could run fast in my shoes so that was\na\nbummer Friday my father-in-law needed to\nbring his truck into Uncle David who is\na mechanic a couple Towns over it was\nsuper cold so I offered to take the\ntruck in for my father-in-law and I went\nfor a run while I waited for the truck\nto get serviced it was a nice easy run\nbut it was so cold\nI've technically run in colder\nconditions before but I didn't pack\nclothes for this level of cold it was\n16\u00b0 F with a feels likee temp of zero\nthat's about -7\u00b0 C my face\nfroze conditions would not improve much\nfor the following day in fact it was\npretty much the same except now it was\nwindy and also I had to do a workout\ntoday's long run was 7 1/2 M easy and\nthen 7 1/2 M at 720 Pace my face got so\ncold running into the headwind that I\ndecided to break up the easy and start\nthe work portion of the long run early\ninto the headwind for a bit before I\nturned\n[Music]\naround this was one of those runs where\nI worry that my Apple watch is going to\ndie from the cold and it did and I\nwouldn't have a way to call my wife to\ncome pick me up if I needed to help but\nfortunately running a couple miles hard\ninto the headwind warmed me up a little\nand then I was able to turn around and\nwarm up a little bit more the wind\nwasn't biting at my face anymore and I\nwas able to finish the workout again the\npaces didn't seem all that intimidating\non paper but this workout was hard but\nat least today I was able to hit the\npaces the next morning we were back in\nIllinois and and the tempts weren't much\ndifferent I had 12 easy miles to run so\nI headed over to busy Woods each Loop of\nthe park is a bit more than 7 m so I ran\nabout 1 and 1/2\nlaps busy Woods is typically a very\nwindy place even on days when it's not\neven windy but luckily today this was\none of those rare days when the winds\nweren't all that bad\n[Music]\nso that brings us up to date on the last\nsix weeks with the Runa app I really\ndidn't think that this training plan\nwould be so difficult I don't know why\nbut I just thought that it would be\neasier yet despite all the challenges\nthat this training plan has thrown my\nway I've been able to so far stay\nhealthy and I feel like I'm getting\nreally fit hit the Subscribe button so\nyou can get updates for the next\ninstallment of this series at after week\neight where I'm going to talk about\nstrength training Mobility work and\ndload weeks and if you want to try\nrunner for yourself you can use the code\nkofuzi in the app I don't get paid any\nextra if you do or don't but it's there\nif you want it\n[Music]",

      "text": "let's continue our look back at the best\nin running for the year these are my top\nfive Marathon Racing shoes of 20124\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys about my\nfavorite Marathon erasing shoes of 2024\nbut before I go into this list I do want\nto go over some disclosures no one's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe on this list and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my footage thoughts before you\nguys get a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the top five\ncarbon plated Racers of 2024 and let's\nstart with number five the Five Spot was\ndifficult there was a lot of shoes that\nI maybe could have put into this slot\nbut based on the things that I\npersonally love to see in carbon plated\nRacing shoes the shoe that I'm putting\nin this Five Spot is from Hoka and\nthat's the C X1 now a lot of people kind\nof discounted this shoe cuz it was a\nlittle bit on the big side a little bit\non the heavy side but the things that I\nsaw in this shoe that I really enjoy are\nthe fact that it's a pea based midsole\nfoam from Hoka but also they put a\ngigantic amount of foam in the for foot\nand they also put a lateral side cutout\nto make it easier to bend the carbon\nfiber plate that's in this shoe all\nthose things put together resulted in\nsomething that felt really good when\nyou're landing on that 4 foot and\ncrushing that foam and then having it\nbounce back with the aid of that carbon\nfiber plate so it it's a really fun and\nspringy experience that I got anytime I\ntook this shoe either for a long run\nwith some Marathon effort miles in it\nthreshold repeats or for anything that\nmight be even a little bit faster than\nthat I enjoyed it for all of those\nthings yes the weight definitely is an\nissue and it would be much higher on the\nlist if they could make that foam\ncompress and decompress a little bit\nmore dynamically and if they could shed\na little bit of weight but as it is the\nHoka cell X1 comes in at number five\nthat means at the number four spot is\nanother shoe that kind of looks a little\nbit unusual and has a large amount of\nfoam in the for foot that's going to be\na a theme that we're going to see\nthroughout this list and number four for\nme is from Puma it's the fast R2 in this\nyear's version of The Fast R they went\nto an aliphatic TPU foam which is\nsomething that I don't think I had\nexperienced prior to this year and I'm\nglad that Puma is using it in the way\nthat they are you're getting a great\namount of cushion and compress ression\nin that foam and then it also snaps back\nreally Lively but it's also durable kind\nof in two ways one it's durable in the\nsense that we all think about durability\nit'll last a lot of miles I have well\nover 100 miles in this shoe and it still\nfeels really fresh but it's also durable\nwith in one long run as well so that\nsense that like the foam is fading as\nyou get deeper and deeper into a long\nrun uh that doesn't happen as quickly\nwith the aliphatic TPU it feels just as\nSnappy at the end of a race as it does\nat the beginning of a race and it's just\nbeen really fun to put in fast efforts\nin this shoe and another big element of\nthat is this exposed carbon fiber plate\nwhich is very rigid and I just have such\na great time bouncing off of the front\nend of the shoe if it were a little bit\nlighter it would be a lot higher on the\nlist but because of the weight which is\nreally the only thing that holds it back\nin my mind this shoe comes in at number\nfour now moving into the three spot is\nis a shoe that has been making the\nheadlines all year long and that is the\nalphafly 3 this shoe not only has the\nmen's World Marathon record but it now\nhas the Women's World Marathon record as\nwell so elast have been able to run in\nthis really quickly and I feel like a\nlot of non Elites have been also able to\nrun well in the shoe the zumex that's in\nthe shoe feels like older original zoomx\nor closer to it and I think that's part\nof why this shoe ends up being so light\nthe only downside that I feel from this\nshoe and I guess there's two one is that\nI feel like the airpods moved in version\n3 a little bit more towards the center\nof the foot and for me in my footstrike\nit just feels like I'm kind of missing\nor Landing over or past the airpod so\nI'm not getting the full benefit of\nstomping on those airpods and then\nbouncing back as they decompress and the\nother thing is the way that the carbon\nfiber plate and the zoom airpods\ninteract at least for me and my non-\nElite foot strike it feels a little bit\nkind of rickety it feels like I'm\nrunning across like a plywood floor in a\nboxing ring and so there's a little bit\nof a uneasiness when I'm running in it\nit doesn't stop me from being able to\nrun really fast and have a lot of fun\nwhen I'm running in the shoe but it is\nsomething that I've noticed and it\ndoesn't quite feel as smooth as some\nother shoes on this list but all those\nlittle complaints aside it is a shoe\nthat a lot of people have been able to\nrun really well in and this year it\ntakes the number three spot moving into\nthe number two spot is a shoe that is\npretty much always on my list ever since\nthe shoe first hit the market market and\nthat's from as6 and it's the meta speed\nSky Paris this year the big change for\nthe metas speed is that the foam went\nfrom FF turbo to FF turbo plus which\nreally means that it went from a nylon\nbased foam to a pea based foam and the\nbig thing that I've noticed is that the\nfoam is a lot softer so when you are\nlanding on the forefoot of this shoe you\nfeel like you're really compressing a\nlot of that foam and it's coming back in\na nice and pleasant way I will say that\nI think that it's a little bit on the\nmushy side not to say that it's a mushy\nshoe but compared to the bounceback that\nI would get that was very quick and\nspringy from last year's version I feel\nlike The Meta speed Sky Paris is a\nlittle bit less springy than I would\nlike I love the compression I just wish\nit would decompress just a with a little\nbit more energy return but those little\ncritiques aside that hasn't stopped me\nfrom reaching for this shoe over and\nover again in fact I think that of all\nthe shoes that I've reviewed in 2024 the\nmost miles I put on any one shoe is with\nthe meta speed Sky Paris cuz I could\nkeep reaching for it again and again\nwhenever I have those really tough\nworkouts that's because I like the plate\nposition in this shoe I really like the\nfoam that they're using in the shoe and\nI love how lightweight it is it's one of\nthe lightest shoes on the market today\nnow moving into number one spot is\nanother shoe from Puma Puma is having a\nfantastic year this year and this is the\nNitro Elite 3 again this is using that\naliphatic TPU foam that I loved in the\nfast R2 but they're doing it in a very\nlightweight package this is also one of\nthe lightest Marathon Racing shoes on\nthe market and they've paired it with a\nvery lightweight and minimal racing\nupper that is very comfortable to wear\nthis like The Meta speed Sky Paris is a\nshoe that I've been reaching for for\nthose biggest workouts that always give\nme a little bit of stress as I'm looking\nat them on the calendar and the Nitro\nl83 have been able to help me hit those\nPaces in those really tough workouts now\nthe geometry of the Nitro Elite 3 is\nvery different than the geometry of the\nmeta speed Sky Paris the Nitro Elite 3\nseems to be designed for the kind of\nRunner who has a really quick turnover\nand that's normally not how I would\ndescribe myself but the shoe still works\nfor me in a really Pleasant and Powerful\nway and that makes me think that this is\na shoe that I could recommend to a wide\nrange of Runners and I think it will\nlikely work for them and because it's so\nlight because it's so much fun to run in\nand because I think that it can work for\na lot of different kinds of Runners\nthat's why the Nitro Elite 3 takes my\ntop spot as best Marathon racing shoe of\n2024 now I do have one additional shoe\nthat I think deserves some honorable\nmention and again it's from Adidas this\nis the adios Pro 4 I had a chance to\nerase the Berlin marathon in this\nearlier in the year but the reason why\nit's not in my 2024 list is because like\nthe evos SL for my daily trainers list\nthis shoe technically doesn't become\nglobally released until 2025 so I'm\ngoing to classify it as a 2025 shoe and\nwe're going to have to wait to see how\nthings shake out in 2025 to see where\nthe adios Pro 4 ends up in the best of\nlists so those are the shoes that I've\nbeen enjoying doing my toughest workouts\nand my Marathon racing in I'd love to\nhear what's been working well for you\nguys put it in the comments down below\nor better yet stop by the live stream\nthat I do Mondays and Thursdays over on\nthe kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to\nsee you guys over there in the chat\nthat's all for today everybody thanks so\nmuch for making it all the way to the\nend of this video hopefully you guys are\nstaying safe out there on your runs and\nI will see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\n[Music]",

      "text": "it's time to take a look back at the\nbest running shoes of the Year these are\nthe top five daily trainers of\n[Music]\n2024 yo what's going on my name is kzi\nand I'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys about the\nbest daily trainers of 2024 but before I\ngive you this list I do want to go over\nsome disclosures nobody is paying me to\nmake this video nobody's paying me to be\nincluded on this list and no one's going\nto get a chance to preview any of my\nfootage or my thoughts before you guys\nget a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the best daily\ntrainers of 2024 and let's start with\nnumber five in the Five Spot this year\nis a Adas it is the Ido SL2 I'm really\nliking the updates to this shoe it is a\nkind of two foam Construction in here\nthere's a light strike po core which is\ntheir rasing foam and then there's a\nlight strike a regular Eva carrier on\nthe outside the upper fits really great\nthere's not too much padding on it and\nthe whole package stays really light\nthis shoe has a little bit more ground\nfeel than I typically like in my daily\ntrainers but because of both the price\npoint of this shoe and the way that this\nshoe feels for runs that for me are\nabout an hour or less I feel like this\nis a really great shoe for those who\naren't necessarily training for a\nmarathon so high school and college\ncross country runners or anyone training\nfor 5K 10ks up to the half marathon feel\nlike this is going to be an excellent\ndaily trainer it also looks fantastic so\nit can also serve double purpose for\ncasual wear as well coming in at number\nfour is a shoe that I think is a little\nbit underrated and that is the Hoka Max\n6 cuz it is just so lightweight Nimble\nand fun to run in now the the big change\nfor the Mach 6 is Hoka left the kind of\ntwo foam proly construction that they\nhad been using and went with a single\ntype of foam in the shoe and it's a very\nfun foam it compresses really nicely\nwhen you're put it to the ground but it\nalso snaps back and decompresses in a\nreally quick and pleasant way for both\neasy running and for picking up the pace\nas well also the upper fits on me really\ngreat and there is minimal padding in\nthis shoe it even has a little bit of an\nAchilles flare to avoid biting at the\nback of your foot so it's a very\ncomfortable but also Fun Shoot to run it\nnow for the number three spot I guess\nit's a return of this shoe to the market\nit is the Pegasus plus now it does say\nthat it's a turbo but Nike is doing\ntheir whole kind of renaming of all the\nexisting franchises in their lineup so\nthe Pegasus turbo is now going to be\ncalled the Pegasus plus and naming\nconventions aside and how much I dislike\nwhat they're doing with the names aside\nI feel like the Pegasus plus is a very\nsuccessful daily trainer they're using a\nmodified version of zumex in here I\ndon't think it's exactly what you're\ngetting in say the alphafly or in the\nvaporfly but it is a really nice pea\nbased foam that's in the midsole that\ngives you a lot of great comfort for\ndaily training but is lightweight and\ncan definitely pick up the pace the\nupper also feels really nice and it\nreminds me a lot of the Mach 6 but it is\na Nike shoe so the fit is a little bit\nmore snug now moving into the number two\nspot is a shoe that is parentally near\nthe top of my top five daily trainer\nlist and that's from as6 that is the\nNova blast 5 this shoe only came out in\nthe last month or so but already I've\nbeen loving the miles I've been able to\nput in this shoe in 2024 the Nova blast\n5 got an update to its phone from FF\nblast Eco to FF blast Max it's even\nlighter even spongier even more energy\nreturn in the foam and it's just a very\nfun ride the new jard mesh upper also\njust feels really great and I think it\ngives a little bit more room in the\nforefoot than we saw in previous\niteration so the Nova blast 5 takes the\nnumber two spot and that means coming in\nat the number one spot is a shoe from\nNew Balance and that is the rebel\nversion 4 this is a shoe that came out\nall the way in the beginning months of\nthe year and it's a shoe that I\nabsolutely fell in love with pretty much\nright away it's really lightweight and\ncan do just about everything from a\nworkout all the way down to an easy long\nrun and a lot of that's because of the\nfuel cell that they put in here now this\nisn't the same fuel cell that they put\nin their Racing shoes instead it is a\npeba and Eva blend but whatever they've\ndone to make that blend I feel like it's\nabsolutely perfect for a daily training\napplication because it squishes the\nright amount but it also can stay\nresilient and comfortable throughout\neven a very long run and because of that\nwide versatility the rebel version 4\ntakes my number one spot as best daily\ntrainer of 2024 but I do have one\nhonorable mention that I got to talk\nabout and that's another shoe from\nAdidas that's the Evo SL and the reason\nwhy it gets honorable mention and\ndoesn't take a spot in the regular top\nfive lineup is because technically this\nshoe doesn't come out until 2025 now a\nlot of people have run in it already and\nthere have been trickle drops across the\ninternet here and there but I think\nunless something's changed the actual\nGlobal release date for the shoe doesn't\nhappen until well into 2025 so so stay\ntuned for next year's best of daily\ntrainers to see where that shoe ranks so\nthose are my picks for best shoes of the\nyears I would love to know what you've\nbeen running in most as far as daily\ntrainers go let me know in the comments\ndown below or better yet stop by the\nlive stream than I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel love to talk to you guys over\nthere in the chat that's all I have for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking it all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\nn\n[Music]",

      "text": "[Music]\nthe mo version 4 was my top Max cushion\nshoe back in 2022 and I guess it was so\ngood that New Balance didn't think it\nneeded updating for almost two full\nyears so was it worth the wait let's\nlace up the more version 5 and take it\nfor a\n[Music]\nrun heart beats going\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm a non Elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to tell you guys all about the\nNew Balance Fresh Foam X more version 5\nbut before I give you my thoughts on\nthis shoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nI bought myself nobody's paying me to\nmake this video or to include their shoe\nin this video and no one's going to get\na chance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the more version five and\nlet's start with the specs this is a\nvery tall shoe starting out at 44 mm of\nstacky in the heel with a 4 mm drop\ngiving us 40 mm of fresh foam X in the\nforefoot of the shoe and that's the only\nthing that's in the shoe just that Fresh\nFoam X goodness now the big thing that I\nnoticed with version 5 to version four\nis that there is a major Aesthetics\nchange the version five is basically\ngetting a design update to match the\nsame design language as the rest of the\nfresh FX line so if you've seen the\nchanges to the 1080 version 14 uh you'll\nsee that there are a lot of similarities\nto the more version 5 but it's not just\na cosmetic change there's a couple of\nreally big hints that newbounds drops in\nthe way that they talk about this shoe\nfor one thing when we look to the\noutsole of the shoe there is a bottomup\noutsole for additional 4ot stiffness and\nthe other thing that they've done is\nthat they've changed the rocker profile\nof the shoe so when you're looking at\nthese two shoes the way that these two\nshoes curl up as your foot moves through\nthe gate cycle is very different in the\nmo version 5 than in the mo version 4 so\nthose are going to be two very\nsignificant differences that are going\nto end up making a very big impact later\non when I talk about what the shoes\nactually like to run in my US men's size\n9 came in at a weigh measurement of 318\nG or 11.2 Oz\n[Music]\nnow that we've talked about what the\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on the road the more\nversion 5 is a very good Max cushion\nshoe the fit of the upper is true to\nsize it's not too baggy it's not super\nwide I feel like it's just right and the\nmaterials that they've chosen for this\nshoe are very comfortable especially if\nyou're putting this shoe on on a\nrecovery day or after a tough workout\nthe upholstery work on this shoe is\nexcellent and I think it's a great\nexample of how you can have a very\ncomfortable and luxurious feeling shoe\nwithout resorting to a bunch of excess\nfluffy padding that is only going to end\nup being a sweat sponge in some of those\nwarmer months so I feel like the fit on\nthe upper is exactly what I want which\nis also something that I could say about\nthe mo version 4 the fit of the mo\nversion 4 and the fit of the mo version\n5 are excellent fits but when it comes\nto the actual running in the shoe as a\nmore version 4 Super Fan I find that\nlike the mo version 5 a little bit less\nthe shoe feels like it's a little bit\nfirmer and a little bit more stable and\nthat's something that we saw in a lot of\nshoes across 2024 so it's not a surprise\nthat this is what happened to the mo\nversion 5 but overall The Sensation that\nI'm left with is that this is a shoe\nthat seems to be more intended for\nhigh-intensity walking than it is for\nhigh mileage running and there's nothing\nagainst a walking in a running shoe or\neven having a shoe that is really well\nsuited for run Walkers uh but it's just\nvery different than the experience that\nI felt in the mo version 4 and I really\nam kind of caught off guard I wasn't\nexpecting such a drastic change between\none and the other now the most common\nquestion that I got when it came to the\nmore version 4 was how is this shoe for\nwalking which indicates to me that a big\nportion of the at least more version 4\ncurious audience was not only is it good\nfor running but is it going to be a\ncomfortable shoe cuz it looks nice and\nbig and comfy is it going to be good for\nstanding in all day or for long periods\nof walking or if walking is your primary\nmode of outdoor activity and the thing\nthat I would say the most is because of\nthe aggressive rocker that was on the\nfront end of this shoe I really enjoyed\nit for running but I didn't like it as\nmuch for walking because I felt like\nthat transition felt a little bit\nawkward at the walking pace where as at\nthe running pace it was just right for\nbeing able to move this large amount of\nfoam now the change that they've made to\nthe rocker geometry which New Balance\ntold us about in all the documentation\nand this additional 4 foot stiffness\nthat they talk about is intended to make\nit less aggressive which then flips the\nscript on the more version 5 which makes\nit much more comfortable if you've got\nto be on your feet all day or if you're\nusing this for run walk or just walk but\nfor running I felt like it made the shoe\na little bit harder to Wrangle all this\nmidsole foam that was here so for me it\nfelt a little bit less exciting it felt\na little bit less like the more version\n4 that I fell in love with and it made\nit feel more like kind of traditional\nMax cushion shoes at the end of the day\nI'm not mad at New Balance or the more\nfor changing in the way it did I think\nthat this way the more version 5 is\ngoing to have much broader Commercial\nAppeal it's just not going to appeal as\nmuch to me\nnow before we wrap up this video let's\ntake a moment to zoom out and see where\nthe more version 5 fits within the\nbroader New Balance lineup and to\nunderstand New Balance you have to\nunderstand that they have two different\ntypes of foam they have fresh foam X\nwhich is what we've been talking about\nwith the more version 5 and they have\nfuel cell two different types of foam\nthat are intended to give two different\ntypes of experiences fuel cell is\nsupposed to give you speed rebound and\nresponsiveness and the Fresh Foam X is\nsupposed to give you softness and\ncomfort but let's take a look more\nclosely at the Fresh Foam X shoes\nbecause I think that's going to be more\nimportant in the discussion of the more\nversion 5 now within the Fresh Foam X\nshoes and there are a lot of fresh foam\nX shoes there are kind of three main\nshoes that I want to talk about there's\nthe 880 the 1080 and the more version 5\nnow the 880 has always been kind of the\ndaily training shoe and I think as you\ngo along this direction C on this\nspectrum you're getting more and more\ncushion and comfort the 1080 used to\nkind of be the max cushion shoe in this\nlineup now is until the more came to be\nand ever since the more existed in the\nlineup the 1080 has been shifting ever\nso slightly more towards the daily\ntraining side so there aren't clear cut\noffs as to when it's a daily trainer and\nwhen it's a Max cushion shoe it's all\nkind of a spectrum based on how much\ncomfort and how much cushion you want\nunderfoot these days as far as the Fresh\nFoam X daily trainers are concerned I'm\nreally loving the 1080 as the daily\ntrainer and the more version 5 as the\nmax cushion shoe now there is one\nadditional wrinkle because this year New\nBalance also introduced The Fresh Foam X\nBOS or BOS I've never really been sure\nhow to pronounce this shoe now while I\npersonally had some difficulty running\nin this shoe it gave me a little bit of\nof foot pain which is a weird thing that\nhappens to me once every like 30 to 50\nshoes certain shoes just disagree with\nwith my foot but this has been a really\ninteresting higher cushion shoe than the\n1080 which I really think is kind of an\neither or with the more version five I\nthink if you like traditional Max\ncushion shoes think shoes like the Bondi\nfrom Hoka then I think that the more\nversion 5 is going to be the max cushion\nshoe for you but if you like something\nthat's a little bit bouncier a little\nbit more kind of in my mind modern and\nfun then I feel like the BOS is kind of\nlike the runnner version of the more\nversion 5 and that's kind of how I\nunderstand the the Fresh Foam X shoes\nnow let's bring in also the fuel cell\nfoam shoes and in the interest of\nbrevity I'm not going to go through each\none of these individually but there are\nalso fuel cell foam shoes that kind of\ncover a lot of the same bases as the\nFresh Foam X shoes but keeping in mind\nthat fuel cell is a little bit more of\nkind of a performance oriented product\nthat's where the racing product from New\nBalance is going to sit so if we take\nthese shoes both the fuel cell and the\nfreshx and kind of Shuffle the deck and\nkind of mix everything together to make\nthe best five shoe rotation that you can\nhere's kind of how I would put that\ntogether in the daily training spot I\nwould pick Rebel version 4 in my opinion\nthis is one of the best daily trainers\nthat you can buy right now it's fun it's\nlightweight it's Snappy it can do fast\nstuff it can also go long distances as\nwell this would be the center piece of\nthe rotation and you can either put the\n1080 in that position or the 880 in that\nposition the all can kind of be\ninterchanged depending on the experience\nthat you are looking for now as far as\nrace product go then I would go to the\nSC Elite version 4 this is their\nMarathon racing shoe in the lineup and I\nthink kind of in between these two shoes\nis the SC Pacer version 2 now this could\nalso be the marathon racer for some\npeople and I really feel like this year\nnewbounds tried to make this an\nalternative Marathon racer a lot of\nBrands now have two different\nexperiences for your their marathon Race\nproduct but for me this one just felt a\nlot firmer than I would like for\nMarathon distance and I'd kind of put it\nhere as a workout session shoe for\nsomething that I'm going to try to go a\nlittle bit faster than Marathon workouts\nmight normally entail and I feel like\nthis is more of like a 5k 10K racer now\nas far as the max cushion goes that's\nwhere I think you can bring in a shoe\nlike the mo version 5 or if it works for\nyou I think the BOS is a lot more fun of\nan experience so because this is a more\nversion 5 video I'll leave the more\nversion 5 in this position even though\npersonally if it did work for me I would\ngo with the BOS and then you've got the\nSC Trainer version 3 which kind of fits\non the end over here in that new\ngeneration of long run shoes where\nthey're very comfortable but also still\nvery peppy and performance oriented and\nfor a lot of people this like long run\nshoe category is where a lot of people\nmight be picking out their Marathon\nRacers if traditional carbon plated\nRacers aren't working for them so this\nwould be like the five shoe lineup that\nI would pick from New Balance but if\nwe're going to trim this down to three\nshoes then I think the shoes that I\nwould eliminate from this discussion\nwould be the pacer version 2 and the SC\nTrainer version three the rebel version\n4 would be your daily trainer and your\nworkout shoe the more version 5 would be\nyour time on feet and Recovery run shoe\nand then for your toughest workouts and\nfor your Marathon racing you'd go with\nthe SC Elite version 4 and then if we're\ngoing to drill that back even further to\njust a shoe rotation then I think you\ncould have a lot of fun with just the\nrebel version 4 and the SC Elite version\n[Music]\n4 now let's wrap up the video by going\nover the buying guide and we'll also\ndiscuss some of the Alternatives that\nyou'll likely want to consider the more\nversion 5 is a classic Max cushion\nrunning shoe with a healthy dose of both\ncomfort and stability it's going to be a\ngreat shoe for those looking to set time\non feet PBS as well as those looking for\na really good RunWalk or pure walking\nexperience this shoe has been out for a\nlittle while but it's still selling for\nthe retail price of\n$155 and I think for the amount of shoe\nand the kind of shoe that you're getting\nhere I feel like that's a pretty good\nprice but if you are looking for the\nmore runnable of the two options I would\nlook at last year's more version 4 and\nyou can find it at discount in some\nselect sizes there's not a lot left\nremaining but you might be able to find\nit at a discount in your size at\n$110 but there's also competition from\nother brands that you're going to want\nto consider and let's take a look at\nthose the first one that I think we\nreally need to take a look at because I\nfeel like it's the barometer against\nwhich all kind of classic Max cushion\nshoes are mentioned is from Hoka and\nthat's the Bondi this is the Bondi 8 and\nI feel like this is a very mature shoe\nit's not going to be changing a ton year\nover-ear you're going to be getting a\npretty consistent experience and that\nexperience is something that's really\ngreat for people who are on their feet\nall day and want something comfortable\npeople that want a RunWalk shoe or\npeople that want to set time on feet PBS\nand want something that provides both\ncomfort and stability and that's a lot\nof the same ways that I would explain\nthe more version 5 now I feel like the\nBondi is kind of the most old-fashioned\nof the max cushion shoes if we can kind\nof talk about them that way so I think\nthere's a little bit more firmness and a\nlittle bit more stability in that shoe\nso depending on what you want the Bondi\nmight be the better choice but even\namongst these two shoes for people\nlooking squarely at this type of shoe I\nthink that the more version 5 is still a\nbit more comfy and a bit more fun now\nthe Bondi retails at 165 but it's been\nout for a little while and you might be\nable to find it at about a 20% discount\nat 132 bucks and then the last two that\nI think we should talk about kind of\nsits in the middle between I guess the\nmodernity of the more version 5 and the\nBondi 8 and that's from toppo and this\nis the atmos now when I reviewed the\natmos I kind of felt like this is what\nthe Bondi should be looking to in terms\nof staying true to what a Bondi is but\nalso being able to take advantage of\nsome modern techniques and materials\nthat can go into shoe construction and\nso a lot of the things that I've been\nsaying about the mo and that I've been\nsaying about the Bondi apply to the\natmos as well but I feel like it's kind\nof like a step elevated from the Bondi 8\nin terms of being a little bit more fun\nto run in and a a little bit peppier and\nthe Topo Atmos comes in at 160 so a\nlittle bit more expensive than the more\nversion 5 but kind of splits the\ndifference between what you're getting\nin the Bondi 8 and what you're getting\nin the more version 5 so we've got kind\nof three flavors of classic Max cushion\nshoes here for you to choose from if you\nhave any other questions about the mo\nversion 5 or any other shoes that I\ntalked about today feel free to put them\nin the comments down below or better yet\nstop of the live stream that I do\nMondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi\nRun Club Channel love to see you guys\nover over there in the chat that's all\nit for today everybody thanks so much\nfor making it all the way to the end of\nthis video hopefully you guys are\nstaying safe out there on your runs and\nI will see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\n[Music]",

      "text": "if there is a preseason in the running\nshoe world it's the running event it's a\nrunning brand convention that showcases\nwhat's coming up in the next year and\neveryone looks like they've got a shot\nat winning it's also a pretty great time\nto catch up with some friends and\ncolleagues so let's hop on a plane and\nhead to Austin this is a runner's\nweekend at the running event 2024\n[Music]\nyo what's going on just made it to the\nAirbnb in Austin this is the same place\nthat I stayed last year a kafui run Club\nmember owns this Airbnb so I love to be\nable to throw some business her and her\nfamily's way it's going to be a busy\nwork week so even though it's been a\nreally long travel day and I'm exhausted\nI just want to go get some dinner but\nfirst we got to go meet up with Tommy\nand Caitlyn who is the head organizer of\nthis entire running event\n[Music]\nshow Tommy was staying at the main TR\nHotel the Hilton and I didn't film any\nof the two main meetings we had one was\nwith the TR organizers as Tommy and I\nwere going to be doing a social media\ntakeover of the TR IG account the next\nday and then Tommy and I met separately\nbecause we were doing a seminar on\nsocial media for running stores also the\nfollowing day afterwards Tommy and I got\ntacos at the hotel restaurant a\nproductive efficient and quiet way to\nstart TR\n[Music]\n2024 good morning it's a little bit\nbefore 6:00 a.m. here is in Austin on a\nTuesday my watch tells me I got 4 hours\nof sleep last night although it feels\nlike I got a lot less a lot of tossing\nand turning last night bed was perfectly\nfine I just think I had a little bit too\nmuch coffee too late in the day\nyesterday and I just couldn't fall\nasleep got another busy day today first\nthing I got to do is I'm going to try to\nget in a little bit of extra mileage in\nbefore I meet Tommy for a run\n[Music]\nit was definitely a bit discouraging\nwhen I woke up and it was so dark to get\ngoing for this run but now that I'm on\nladyb bird there are so many other\nRunners out here it's really quite nice\nto see\n[Music]\nall right got in a little bit more than\n5 miles let's go find\nTommy on the run this is Tommy's first\nrun since finishing six marathons in one\nyear\n[Music]\nthat is the trail cleanup that I really\nwanted to do today because last year\nthey had an option for you could pick up\ntrash while you're\njogging but there was also a kaying\noption and I was too afraid I'd fall in\nthe water last year to do it this year I\nbrought special clothes to do it so I\nwas going to get him the kayak but I\nforgot that we had to film all this\nstuff now so I'm going to have to skip\nout on this year maybe another time\n[Music]\nTommy runs Tommy kzi say your own name\nfirst hold on I want to get this\nactually\ny ready hold\non oh God that's all in the\nmic I'm going to need a new microphone\nnow I didn't realize it was going to be\nthat aggressive all right ready I think\nI don't have Burgers I got Burgers\nyou're dad you're\ngood yo what's going on it is a kofuzi\nTommy runs takeover of the TR social\nmedia account yep\nyep yo what's going on it is a kofuzi\nTommy runs take over the TR social today\nis the first so it took us a few takes\nbut Tommy and I got what we needed on\nthe bridge and then we ran back to our\nhotels to get ready for our our next\nthing that we had to do for the ti\nsocial takeover but nothing is\nstraightforward at TI everywhere you go\nyou'll run into some friends morning how\nare you hi good morning\nYouTube how are you you doing great

soon\n[Music]\nquiet a quick shower and a quick bite to\neat later I was back with Tommy at the\nconvention hall our mission was to find\npeople to interview about why they were\nexcited to be at TR all right we're here\nat TR what is your name my name is\nAmanda and who are you with Melora and\nwhat is your most what are you looking\nforward to the most here I'm looking\nyeah I'm looking forward to having\ngenuine real authentic conversations\nwith uh like-minded people but really\nfocusing on having authentic\nconversations surrounding like diversity\nsustainability amplifying marginalized\nvoices and giving them the platform that\nthey deserve to have year round I'm\nexcited about all those things I love\nthat let's go let's do it what's up guys\num first off let me know what who what\nyour names are who you're here with and\nwhat you're excited about here at TR\nsweet uh I'm Joe H I'm Kevin ginan we're\nhere we have an agency called footstep\ncreative and we're just here we've been\nbuilding in kind of stealth mode the\nlast like two years so we're just trying\nto get in front of brands people in the\nindustry and yeah what's your name\nCarlos who are you with we are media\nfrom Spain we're Road running review all\nright and what are you excited about for\nTR this week we're waiting for a lot of\nshoes lot good stuff new carbon plates\nnew people of Pham so\n[Music]\nexcited we had some time before our\nseminar so Tommy and I got some coffee\nthen we went to the keynote session\nwhich featured lunch and then it was\ntime for us to give our talk on social\nmedia for running retail now even though\nTommy and I did this talk last year I\nwas still pretty nervous the session was\nwas really well attended the last time\nand we had a lot of return attendees as\nwell as a number of media colleagues and\nfriends so I felt like expectations were\nhigh but overall I think it went well\nTommy did great we had a lot of good\nquestions from the audience and I got a\nchance to really emphasize one of my\ncore philosophies of the past couple\nyears which is that running Brands\nrunning retail and running media can\nwork together in alignment in win winwin\nscenarios and in the past those groups\nweren't always exactly on the same team\nI just don't think it has to be that way\nand I'm trying to change\n[Music]\nthat all right just finished the session\nI think it went well I feel like I\ntalked too much but uh we had some good\nquestions at the end so that was good uh\nnow I'm going to meet up with running\nWarehouse we're going to film something\nfun for YouTube I was going to walk over\nthere by myself but the guys are all\nhere checking in so I'm just going to\nhop in an Uber with them and we'll head\nover do something\nfun earlier in the year in Boston Connor\nfrom running Warehouse took the believe\nin the Run crew up to the Charles to\ncheck out what real Runners were\nactually wearing for their daily runs\nand now it was my turn to do some shoe\nspotting along ladyb bird Lake in Austin\nthe whole thing was a bit overproduced\nwith three cameramen and four cameras\nbut it was a nice way to actually spend\nsome time chatting about shoes with a\nfriend and I think the video we made is\ngoing to be pretty good head on over to\nthe running Warehouse YouTube channel\nAnd subscribe to see when that video\ndrops finished shooting sneaker spotting\nwith running Warehouse that was a lot of\nfun we saw a lot of shoes a really wide\nvariety and ran into a bunch of friends\nso a really fun time to G out over shoes\nand reconnect with some\npeople now I'm going to head back over\nto the convention center the hotel\nacross the street is where the Hoka\nreception is so let's go check that\n[Music]\nout this was a lively and Loud affair\nwith drinks food and a lot of people we\ngot to see some displays of some\nupcoming shoes I caught up with some\nfriends and then it was time for me to\nhead to my next spot for the evening TR\nis a lot like graduation weekend\neveryone has a lunch in or a gathering\nthat you're invited to so you got to\nkeep moving in order to see everybody\nand my next stop was the as6 event I had\na workout scheduled for the next morning\nso it was a bunch of hinin 0.0 for me\nbut it was nevertheless really good to\nconnect with everyone\n[Music]\ngood morning it is a little bit before\n7:00 a.m. on a Wednesday here in Austin\ndidn't have too late a night last night\nI got home uh about 9:30 and then I was\nasleep by about 11: I think so I'm\nfeeling pretty good about that had a\nmuch better night's sleep and that's a\ngood thing cuz today I've got a big\nsession on Deck but I have a little bit\nof surprise help for this workout one of\nthe things that can kind of happen at\nthe running event is you might have a\nchance encounter get a chance to run in\nan upcoming development or secret shoe\nso I ran into someone last night and\nthat person asked if I was going to go\nfor a run today I said I have some\nintervals on deck and they said that\nwould be perfect for a upcoming\nprototype shoe that they'd love to get\nsome early non-elite Runner feedback on\nthey have some pros who have run in it\nand they want to know what non- Elites\nmight think about it so I said I have\nsome 800 m on deck and they gave me a\npair of shoes to run in now I can't show\nyou the shoes I can't photograph the\nshoes can't really tell you much about\nthe shoes either but I'm really looking\nforward to it it should be fun so\napologize that uh I can't show them to\nyou but uh I'm pretty excited about it\n[Music]\nfinished the\nworkout that was hard but this shoe is\namazing I still do have a lot of notes\ncan't wait to tell you about it don't\nknow when that would be for now I'm\ngoing to finish this cool down and then\nget ready to head with the exhibit hall\n[Music]\nFlor all showered up let's get ready to\nhead over to the running event I got a\nday jam-packed full of appointments with\nall of the running shoe brands my plan\nof attack for today is to do all the\nshoe brands on Wednesday and then the\napparel and Nutri brands on Thursday\nfirst thing before I do any of that\nthough is I got to get some coffee and\nsome\n[Music]\nsnacks yo if you could bring back one\nshoe what would it be oh I'm so excited\nabout the new stuff and need something\nold give me something old uh I'm going\nto go with the original Nike epic react\nuh or no the lunar lunar the lunar epic\nis my favorite the high top with the\nstretchy knit upper and then uh I would\ngo for a run with\nkzi energy levels are already high\neveryone's here everyone's excited\nthings are shiny and new can't wait\nfirst appointment is with\ndiodora diodora is an Italian running\nshoe brand that has recently rededicated\nitself to Performance running and\nthey've only recently started reaching\nout to me to review their shoes so for\nour meeting I was happy to be able to\nspeak with the product people to get an\nintroduction to the entire lineup\ndiodora also has a 100 steps philosophy\nto their shoe design their design\nprototyping and run testing departments\nall sit within 100 steps from each other\nin their headquarters in Northern Italy\nallowing for quick feedback with little\nLost in\n[Music]\nTranslation that's going to be it from\ndeodora it's good to get a complete\nrundown of the lineup from them well not\na complete but uh everything except the\nstability shoes and now let's go see k\nrun I've never talked to them before so\nthat should be interesting let's see\nwhat they\ngot kiun is a te cathlon brand and if\nyou don't know what T cathlon is it's\nkind of like a Trader Joe's but for\nsports equipment they sell a bit of\neverything but all the brands are\ninhouse and they're pretty good but\nvalue oriented so Ki and trying to stand\nout sep separately as a performance\nrunning brand it's kind of like if that\nTrader Joe's frozen pizza you like we're\ntrying to compete in an actual pizza\nmaking competition but also in a lot of\nways Ki Run's challenges are kind of the\nsame as the challenges that Sketcher\nperformance faces in relations to its\nparent Sketchers we spent some time\ntalking about the shoes at kiun and\nabout how they could try and make their\ndebut into the US market given the\nchallenges that they might be facing and\nit'll be interesting to see what they\nget up to in the next few\nyears 11:00 I'm supposed to be somewhere\nI don't know\nwhere okay so my next appointment was at\nBrooks and they always show up big for\nTR for 2025 they're tweaking their Foams\nagain DNA tune is going to be an update\nto their super critical Foams where\nthey're using dual density Source\ncompounds that when placed under\npressure and heat and then injected with\nnitrogen gas in other words super\ncritical IED it results in Foams that\nhave firm sidewalls and squish G centers\nit's a format that we've seen Puma use\nto great success with their forever run\nand I look forward to seeing it in the\nglycerin I'm also really excited for DNA\ngold which is Brooks's long awaited\nentry into the Pea midsole Market the\nHyperion Max will hopefully be getting\nthe true max treatment with the use of\npartial DNA gold next year and we will\nalso see an all DNA gold shoe from\nBrooks later in\n2025 and finally I'm particularly\nintrigued by this update to the the\nghost Max it looks like it's getting\ntreatment similar to what we've seen in\nthe glycerin Max and I hope this shoe is\nas fun to run in as it looks that's it\nfrom the Brooks Booth a lot of exciting\nchanges coming very happy with what I'm\nseeing there all the things that I\nwanted to happen to Two Shoes\nspecifically Hyperion Max and Hyperion\nElite 5 are happening I don't think I\ncould tell you very much more about\nhyper5 but we did hear a lot about it\nand it's you're going to be surprised\ngoing be surprised uh now I have a\nlittle bit of time before our next\nappointment so let's get something to\neat my plan originally was to try and\navoid eating food at Teri because the\nconcessions are always pretty\ndisappointing for vegetarians I did have\nan empanada and a bean taco in my bag\nthat I had picked up in the morning from\nthe convenience store but since I did\nhave some bonus time in my schedule I\nthought I'd give concessions another try\nI got some kind of chicken noodle dish\nminus chicken and while I appreciate\neveryone who worked very hard to make\nthis dish tasty I did not enjoy it\nfinished with lunch actually had to eat\nlunch today that was nice now let's\ncheck out what these guys are\nto for those who can't make it in person\nto tr there is a live stream of the show\nhosted by my friends at PR project this\nis the second year that Aaron Tommy and\nGary were hosts for this two-day live\nshow and this year this set was a much\nmore chill living room Vibe with video\nproduction and streaming hosted by flow\ntrack\nTommy hello how's it how's PR project\ngoing PR project is going really well TR\nlive is is uh is is popping we had a lot\nof great guests and we covered some\nreally cool things and talked about a\nlot of the Innovation that's happening\nin the industry as a whole uh Gary\ncrushed it Aaron crushed it and and big\nshout out to the guests all right two\nquestions two what are those these are\nthe on cloud monster I mean Cloud Surfer\n2 nice I like the color blocking on that\nyeah all right second question yeah if\nyou could bring back any one running\nshoe what would it be oh man oh oh oh\num that's a really good question oh I I\nbring back the first uh Nike Infinity\nall right react I like that a lot I like\nthat a lot\nthanks my next appointment was with\nAdidas now a few years ago there was an\nissue with me filming some shoes that\nthey had put on display in their booth\nand on their mannequins and since then\nAdidas has switched up how they present\nat TR now they have a facade to their\nBooth but all discussions happened\nbehind closed doors and to make my life\neasier I pretty much consider everything\nwe talked about back there to be under\nembargo and besides anything that is\nreally interesting will end up on my\ndesk later when the time comes and I can\nactually run in it so I'm not in a hurry\nto post about stuff that's coming later\nalthough because I am a reference size I\ndid get to try on a lot of stuff and I\nwill say that 2025 is going to be a good\nyear for\nAdidas just got done with a lengthy\nmeeting with Adidas it was really good\nvery excited for what's to come can't\ntell you about any of that quite yet\nnext let's go visit some friends at Muno\nI think they've been up to some stuff\n[Music]\nmauno is a Japanese brand that has been\nstruggling with how to modernize without\nalienating their legacy fan base there\nis a very clear road map on exactly how\nto do this laid out by some of their\ncompatriot competition and this year\nmauno seems to finally be taking that to\nheart with their mystery shoe lineup for\nTR mauno unveiled a series of four\nmystery shoes that are intended to both\nmove the company forward while also\nre-energizing the base mystery shoe 01\nhowever pequs my interest the most as it\ndoesn't have a wave plate plus it's got\na knitted upper and a super squishy foam\nit's all the things I like so I'm really\nlooking forward to testing this\n[Music]\none just finished at\nluno I like it when Brands modernize and\nI feel like that's what's happening with\nthe zuno very interested to see what's\ngoing on with the secret shoe 0102 03\nand 04\ngetting very\ntired but still have to continue to more\nappointments next let's go to under\narour I don't recall if under arour has\nbeen to tr before but it's the first\ntime that I can remember visiting them\nI've reviewed a couple of their shoes\nrecently but it was good to get a walk\nthrough on the rest of their running\nshoe lineup\nthey also showed me this double boa\nspeed Len collab the velocity Elite 3\nProto that Sharon ly wore in New York\nand I got to meet Sharon L and wey kotti\nI had seen Sharon speak at an Under\nArmour event in New York earlier in the\nmonth but it was good to actually get a\nchance to introduce myself and I've also\nseen Wy win the usatf 5K championships a\ncouple of times in New York so it was\ngreat to finally meet her too so I\nintroduce myself as a Mike and then as\nI'm leaving Sharon goes to way and goes\nthis is kofuzi he has a really good\nmakes really good running content and\nthen waynie was like oh I've seen that\nbefore so that was really flattering and\nmaybe she has maybe she hasn't but I'm\ngoing to take it as a win and look at\nthis guy good to see you man how are you\nup I'm doing great Hoka had a lot to\ndiscuss at TR the Clifton and the Bondi\nwill be getting updates this year and\nthe impression that I got is that these\nmodels will more Target the RunWalk\nconsumer and this seems to be an\nindustry wide Trend where the Legacy\nfranchises are designed to be intra\npoints for those who are curious about\nthe brand or for those Runners who don't\nlike their running shoes changing all\nthat much these core franchise models\nwill become Dependable year-over-year\nexperiences for the shoe NS who want\nsomething a bit more modern Hoka has\nupdates for you too the clo X1 2.0 not\nthe clo X2 but the clo X1 2.0 gets a\nmajor redesign the cutout will flip from\nthe lateral to the medial side for\nsmoother superation I'm told the shoe\nwill lighten up quite a bit and Hoka was\nalso proud to announce that the laces\nwill be changing on this shoe which I've\ngone on record multiple times saying\nthat the laces on the original C X1 were\njust fine the Mach X will also get an\nupdate but it's just an upper update\nthis year with an aes's flare which\nmakes it less distinguished visually\nfrom the regular Mack but it should\nresolve the issue that many of you had\nwhere the back of the shoe bit into your\nAchilles hey it's m what's up everyone\nif you could bring back one shoe from\nhistory what would it be that's a great\nquestion okay if I could bring back one\nshoe from history I think it's going to\nbe the Reebok float ride energy 3 it's\nonly a couple years old but I I really\nthought that was a solid daily trainer\nit was Priced Right and it was just a it\nwas a good shoe a few years ago Sketcher\nperformance kicked me out of their booth\nat TR and I haven't been back since but\nthis year they actually requested a\nmeeting now they didn't want me filming\nanything unless they could approve it\nprior to publication so I ended up just\nnot filming anything but they did let me\ntry on a shoe and run on it in a\ntreadmill and it was pretty\nfun on was very selective in what they\nshowed me which I appreciated I prefer\nthe new cloudtech phase shoes and that's\npretty much all they showed me for next\nyear there will be three major updates\nthe cloud Surfer will get a bit less\nmushy in the midsole but a bit more\npuffy in the upper the cloud Surfer next\nwill be a speedier cloud Surfer\nexperience and the cloud Eclipse will\ncease to exist and will instead become\nthe cloud Surfer Max it will lose a\ntorsion plate that I thought was pretty\nuseless anyway the arrangement of the\ncloudtech phase changes significantly\nand I think most importantly for many of\nyou they are putting tiny little ridges\nin the clouds so that it shouldn't\nsqueak they also showed me the cloud\nboom Max which is another one of those\nattempts at a carbon plated shoe for the\nmasses a race day shoe for middle and\nback of the pack personally I think\nevery other Brand's attempt at this kind\nof shoe has been either patronizing and\noverpriced or underwhelming and dull and\nwhile this one is going to be expensive\nalthough not that expensive for an on\nshoe the way that they explained the\ndesign and construction of the shoe\ndidn't feel like it was gatekeeping to\nme so I'm not mad at this one at least\nnot for now\nStephen you know what question I'm going\nto ask I do if you're going to bring\nback one shoe from any time in history\nwhat would it be oh anytime in history\noh does have to be like the last year\nlike do you have a favorite old shoe oh\nyeah from any time that you can think of\nand you wish you could bring it back\nshoe that instantly popped into my mind\nwas the Hoka Nepali okay I loved the\nNepali so lightweight it was like a\ncheap shoe I could throw on my feet and\ngo run tons of miles in I Lov that ship\n[Music]\nfor the past couple of years A6 has\nfocused on one main shoe only at TR and\nthis year it was the Nimbus 27 it gets a\npretty mild update and will remain a\npretty comfy shoe I did get a chance to\nrun in the shoe the following morning\nand I can say that it feels a bit\nsmoother than the Nimbus 26 which felt a\nbit clunky to me so I appreciate the\nsmall\n[Music]\nchange next up is my faite Underdog\ntoppo I reviewed the Cyclone 2 a while\nback so I'm excited to try the upper\nupdate for the Cyclone 3 and I'm also\nexcited to delve further into the Topo\nlineup with a shoe I haven't tried\nbefore the Phantom 4 and it's updated\nzip\n[Music]\nfoam okay that is the last meeting I\nhave for today now it's happy hour time\npretty much like every other booth has a\nlittle bit of a spread and a little bit\nof like viations to celebrate the end of\nday\none I am going to try and find the TAA\nhappy hour cuz I told them I'll stop\nup back in college I used to live in the\ntea mush flipflops I bought pair after\npair after pair and after college it\nalways felt like a real Miss to me that\ntea didn't quite catch the recovery\nslide wave so this year I accepted the\nrequest to stop by forh hour with the\nhopes that I would find a way to fall in\nlove with tea again and while the hiking\nwater sports and running sandals don't\nreally resonate with me I am quite\nliking some of the winter and casual\nwear boots that tea is\n[Music]\nmaking Megan if you could bring back one\nshoe from history what would it be oh\nman I loved the Hoka elvon it was the\nbest shoe sort of responsive little bit\nclunky sometimes but it was just a\nconsistent good shoe and then it just\ndisappeared if you could bring back one\nshoe which would it be okay I'm going to\ngo to the 808s 1981 air Mariah my\nMarathon PR shoe if you could bring back\none shoe what would it be the mauno\nElixir I think I know what the answer is\nbut if you could bring back one shoe\ninto production what would it be it\nwould be the Nike alphafly one mow here\nif you could bring back one shoe what\nwould it be tart Edge as T Edge Hoka\nplease if there are any size 10 and a\nhalf samples still in the back room I\nwill pay for them Evo Speedo it is in my\nopinion not just the greatest Trail shoe\nof all time but I'll run on the road or\nthe treadmill whatever in that shoe so\nsend it my way the Nike Lunar Glide I\nwore that thing all the time every\nsingle day I don't know if it's the best\nrunning shoe but it just meant so much\nto me in like high school or middle\nschore or whatever it was please bring\nit back Sketchers Go Run speed Trail\nhyper sorry you brought back a Sketchers\nyeah I know I love the throwback waffle\nRacers the ogs I think there's something\nabout that is just like very pure\nhonest and um just kind of like very\nmuch of the time so I would bring those\nback\n[Music]\nthe next morning started early at 7:00\na.m. for a group run at torches tacos\nthe local as6 Tech rep Chris Anton who\nput together the group run I did in\nAustin over the summer was The\nMastermind behind this Noel blast\ntorches collab we took a huge group\nphoto and then we were off and\n[Music]\nrunning hey coming out good to see you\nnice and early we're just hicking over\nthe street here look at this\n[Music]\na lot of people were demoing the Nova\nblast 5 but I was in the new Nimbus 27\nDrew was there as was Taylor Thomas\nJarrett and Robbie the air was a bit\nchilly but it was a refreshing way to\nwake up after a long day and a long\n[Music]\nnight\nJ cameras around we got to run\ncome on it let's go let's go let's go\nlet's go back at torches there was a\nfree t-shirt free tacos and some\ngiveaways and little would I know that\nthis would be the only real meal I would\neat for the next 12 or so\n[Music]\nhours all\nright getting a start on day two\nI guess we already started the day with\nthe run but the start of the day for me\nat the running event first meeting is\nwith\nrabbit day one of TR was all about shoes\nday two was all about apparel and\nnutrition in the main thing I talked\nabout with rabbit was plans for more\ncollab merch for the kafui Run club we\nalso talked about some updates coming to\nthe Dreamchaser shoe my friend Greg iara\nwas also at the rabbit booth and he was\ndesigning a skateboard to be raffled on\noff at the end of TI in addition to\npromoting his itahar designs rabbit\n[Music]\nkit so the last two meetings that I had\nI went to the booths usually what I do\nis I have a meeting that I get set up\nwith somebody and then I go to the booth\nat the time I'm supposed to be there and\nI kind of just wait if I don't know who\nthat person is\nalready usually that person spots me and\nwe have the\nmeeting what happens frequently with the\napparel\nBrands is that someone like usually a PR\nCompany gets hired to help the brands\nfill their calendars um during these two\ndays and a lot of times the apparel\nBrands I don't know if the pr person\ndoesn't come on site or what but the\nlast two meetings that I had I went\nthere stood in the\nbooth\nwaited and then just left cuz no one was\nlike talking to me so that's okay I\ndon't hold it against anyone but I don't\nmind missing or not having meetings\ngetting things cleared off my calendar\nthat's also not nice but\nit's weird when it happens twice in a\nrow my next stop was at tracksmith they\nbrought their coffee truck to TI and\ntheir new racing shoe it uses a similar\nconcept as the Elliot Runner with a\nthick peba midsole insert but it's tuned\nfor racing and has an upper to\nmatch after track smid I stopped by the\nscratch Booth they're coming out with a\nbunch of new flavors for chews bars and\ndrinks they sent me home with a bunch of\nsamples that I've already had a chance\nto try on the live stream there's some\nflavors that I don't exactly love but\nthe flavors I do like I really\n[Music]\ndo CLA is a French Canadian brand that\nmost people know for their hats but I\nbeen loving their apparel for years now\nthey haven't been to TI in a while and\nit was good to see them here again their\napparel always has clean lines it's\nwellmade and as you'd expect from French\nCanadians they're excellent with cool\nand cold weather performance\n[Music]\napparel my last schedule meeting was\nwith goo they've recently become a\nmember of 1% for the planet which is a\ngroup of companies that pledges to\ndonate 1% % of revenues to charitable\ncauses they sent me home with a bunch of\nflavors of their liquid energy and Fruit\nChews and I'll say that their chews\ntaste the most like just regular gummies\nthan any other brand very\n[Music]\ntasty at this point I was done with\nmeetings but had a bit of time left to\nwander the hall this was Bandit's first\nyear at Terry so I stopped by to say hi\nI also stopped by the Wahoo Booth to\ncheck out their new treadmill that I am\nabsolutely obsessed with and then I was\njust Milling around the Puma Booth when\nof my friends Drew Ashley and Amanda\nBrooks came by for an appointment and so\nI joined in one of my recent favorite\nPuma surprises has been the forever run\nwhich happens to also be a favorite\namongst Puma's pro athletes but because\nthis will be getting a significant\nupdate in the more stability direction\nit'll be interesting to see how it's\nreceived\nthe other shoe that we talked about was\nthe deviate Elite Trail the Nitro Elite\nfoam firms up just a bit and the carbon\nplate softens a bit to better suit it\nfor running through the\n[Music]\nwoods all right guys I am\nout of\nenergy I got no steam left I'm going to\nhead back over to diodora see if I can\nget a\ncoffee ah I should probably just go but\nI'm too tired to even\nleave you\n[Music]\nlike hi I'm here today with Mike Co AKA\nkafui and we're a little low energy\nwe've been spending a lot of time on the\nfloor at the running event that's right\nso this is going to be kind of more of a\nmellow conversation Mike and I were\nsitting here and we were discussing how\nwe felt about the majors adding Sydney\nand how they reward you for running the\nevent and just kind of thought maybe we\nshould um bring this to you in a short\nform very low energy conversation yeah\nyeah low energy podcast I feel like\nthat's what it's going to be called\nyes the the co with the low Co with the\nlow Co with the low yeah I mean I think\nthat I think it's great that there's a\nseventh I think it's great it's on the\nother side of the world so people over\nthere W have to keep coming to the\nUnited States I think it's weird that\nit's like it's a major but it's not\nthey'll still have to come to the United\nStates if they want do six but I'm like\nif we like say like yeah if you wanted\nto do all seven but\nlike before it was like if you lived in\nsay Japan or Asia you had to come to the\nUS three times for Majors you know cuz\nit would been hard to get to Tokyo\nalready you know and so now there's just\nmore opportunties to have this caliber\nof race on that side of the world so\nthat's good so we've been really\nfortunate we've gotten a lot of\nopportunities to run these\nmarathons but you can't help but think\nall right if you have a\nsix-star and you're paying your way to\ngo to all of\nthem it's quite expensive it's very\nexpensive yeah so there is kind of an\nentry to barrier you got to have the\nmoney for travel MH and that includes\nhotels flights food when you're there\ntime off to time off exactly so adding a\nseven do you think that's a good idea or\ndo you think it would be kind of cool to\nhave like two sides of the world have\nlike they could have their six we could\nhave our six and then if you wanted to\nget all 12 you could\ntravel that's interesting cuz then would\nyou take Tokyo out of our six and add\nanother six another one for us I think\nyou would I think that you would go\nahead and kind of do Western Hemisphere\nEastern Hemisphere and then if you want\nto get cuz it's going to they're going\nto bump it up to nine uhhuh so we're\nalmost at 12 anyway okay I mean they'll\ndo three more you know it's going to\nkeep going now you might as well be 12\nright but do like cuz then you could you\ncould get six stars on the Western\nHemisphere you can get six stars on the\nEastern Hemisphere and then if you want\nto be a megalomaniac you could do 12\nStars\nyeah yeah that's an interesting idea I\nlike that because it it makes it so the\ntravel is not so honorous so that's\ninteresting but I also feel like my\nfavorite one was Tokyo mine too and if\nthere were like a western hemisphere six\nI definitely would never have gone to\nTokyo I also think that that was your\nbest kit for any major you looked sharp\nin that one I like the light green like\nyou look strong you ran that one pretty\nwell too that was a strong marath R wow\nokay that's also maybe why it was your\nfavorite I liked it do it because there\nwas out and backs and so running a\nslower Pace than someone like you uhhuh\nI got to see you several times going\nback and forth so I really enjoyed that\npart of it but we were talking about you\nhave a six-star medal and everybody's\nfamiliar that's almost iconic at this\npoint yeah Sydney comes along you're\nthinking oh they're going to make a\nsevenstar medal they're not I know yeah\nhow do you feel about that I feel like\nit's I get the reasoning if they're\ngoing to add two more in relatively\nquick\nsuccession\num but I also feel like if you don't get\na new medal when you complete all seven\nis it are they all really Majors not all\nmajors are created equal it feels like\nyou know and so that's where I feel like\nthey should have make a sevenstar medal\nthey should make an eight star medal and\nthey should make a Nine Star medal or\nwait till all three races are ready at\nthe same time and make a nine I agree\nwith that like like it's almost like if\nyou're going to you know you they're\ntalking about adding Shanghai and what\nwas Cape Town so Shanghai Cape Town and\nSydney why not just add the three and\njust be like let's do it Nine Star metal\nyeah I mean I think the hard thing is\nthey have to help all those cities ramp\nup right they have to make sure that\nthey can handle twice as many more like\nRunners as they currently handle um and\nthat's not something you can just ly\ndoing one year and that's why there's a\nprocess right but I feel like run all of\nthem through the process at the same\ntime you know like instead of doing one\ncity at a time like I'm going to say\nsomething\ncontroversial it just seems like a lot\nif you've got to do nine now like that's\na lot of money like it's already really\nexpensive to do the six-star mhm now you\ndon't have to do all the majors in the\nworld but you know people are going to\nwant to it's kind of like a Pokemon\nthing collect them all collect them all\nand how are you going to sit there and\njust go ahead and add three more\nmarathons and let's just talk Financial\nif you just say Okay each Marathon entry\nfee around $200 right so that's the\nleast expensive thing yeah travel you're\nprobably talking to get to each one now\nat least 5 grand mhm right wouldn't you\nsay cuz it's you're going to be paying\n$500 a night for your hotel right and\nairfare and all that stuff meals all\nthat so if you add three let's just\nlet's be conservative and say it's 5,000\nper per Marathon per person you may have\nto bring a family member so you don't\nyou know get into trouble you're talking\nright there\n$15,000 to collect three more marathons\ny it's expensive for sure it's not a\ncheap sport when you're doing\nmarathoning like this isn't it funny\nwhen you get started you're like ah it's\na chose need a pair of anymore not\nanymore but I think that the reason why\nI'm not like necessarily offended by the\nnine uh or even 12 if we got to 12 is\nthe idea that like\nyou know there's friends of ours who did\nall six in one\nyear I feel like when you make it N9 or\nyou make it 12 then you're really\ntalking about something that is a real\nlifelong Pursuit and so the\nthe the metal at the end becomes more\nthan just like yeah I went and did these\nsix races it's like no I've dedicated\nmyself to a lifetime of running and this\nis the kind of crowning achievement\noverall so what year did you do your\nfirst major cuz you probably didn't\nstart at the level you are now right\nwhat year was your first major 2017 and\nwhat was it Chicago Hometown uhhuh was\nit easier to get was that part of the\nreason you did it was it was a HomeTown\nMarathon yeah yeah did you have any like\naspirations to run all sixs at that time\nno no I just wanted to run Chicago a\nbunch of times that's you know it is fun\nin your home City to watch like kind of\nlike the explosion that like Chicago's\nthe first one I did and to see an entire\ncity transformed into running I thought\nall the marathons from then on out were\ngoing to be kind of like that and\nthere's plenty of marathons where you go\nand the city doesn't even know what\nmarathon's going on exactly like you're\nhaving dinner and they're like oh what\nare you here for yeah the what oh\nthere's a race tomorrow oh okay man\ntraffic going to be bad you know all\nright well Mike they're closing up the\nuh running event we've pretty much\nclosed it out I'm sure you've been busy\nyou're going to have tons of content to\nshare with your fans uh was there\nanything that you thought you was like\nthe most exciting thing here I get that\nquestion a lot for everyone the answer\nI've been giving them is the answer I\nusually give every year I'm really\nexcited about Brooks this year oh really\nmhm I have to say the addition of\npeba we to talk about that that we talk\nabout that right yeah oh wait cuz I\nalready published a video on it the four\nPB yeah okay and the PB gold the DNA\ngold yeah DNA gold okay yeah so they're\ncoming out with the racer this spring\nthat's going to have it's the same as\nthe four but it's going to have packs in\nit Y which you may or may not if you\nhaven't watched believe in the Run know\nthat it was a little thorn in my side\nand it took took to this point to get it\nnot he was disappointed\nyeah and you may have been grounded but\nthat's coming out and then a entirely\nnew racer is coming out in the fall um\nyou can check it out\nuh I'm sure Mike you'll have videos on\nit uh I thought that was in embargo for\na little while I didn't film it oh they\nlet us they let us do it so if you don't\nwant to watch it on my channel go over\nto believe in the run and see it over\nthere see it yeah um but yeah their\nproduct is\ngetting I'd say they they kind of got\ninto a boring rut and we're starting to\nsee some excitement come out of there\nwhich is to me important for their brand\nand they're doing it in a way that still\nis true to their existing customer but\nthey're bringing in new people which I\nthink is a great thing to do yeah I have\nto say you didn't ask but I have to say\nI was really impressed with the way that\nsatisfy is growing the brand and how\nthey're kind of creating\nthis dress to run brand and it it's has\nperformance it works it works on the\ntrails not just fashion but it certainly\nis it's like a style or a vibe that is\njust kind of\nelevating the entire sport I think\nyou're going to see some of the things\nare doing trickle into Brands because\nthey're going to have to provide that\nlevel of of beautiful product into their\nline I I mean I didn't get the chance to\ngo to the satisfy Booth but I appreciate\nwhat they're doing in terms of like\nrunning clothes can be very functional\nbut they can also be a really great way\nif you want to express yourself with\nwhat you're wearing when you run there's\nan option for you and again I think\nthat's important and we can't really\ntalk about\nspecifics but they've done a lot of shoe\ncollabs with Poca and norta and some\nother shoe brands they're finally coming\nout with their own shoe okay and it's\nit's beautiful um very thoughtful um I\nthink you're going to dig it all right\ncool I can't wait all right that's it\nfrom the running event with the slow Co\nlow energy show oh man thanks everybody\nI like that slow Co energy show or low\nenergy show yeah there we go thanks\nhouse\nall right guys I think that's going to\nbe it from TR I've seen all the brands\nwent to all the meetings sampled all the\nsamples now I'm going to head out by the\nway for me if I could bring back one\nshoe it would be the gakuo turbo that\nthing was\n[Music]\ngorgeous now of course TR doesn't and\njust because the showroom floor is\nclosed there was a happy hour at flow\ntracks headquarters just down the street\nand then there was the Brooks Afterparty\nwith y'all Out Boy I don't have a ton of\nfootage from either of these events for\na few reasons first I don't love filming\npeople when it's socializing time and\nwe're off the clock second I was\nexhausted and didn't feel like filming\nand third I just wanted to enjoy time\nwith my friends for what might be the\nlast time in a long time this trip was\nmy last trip of an incredibly busy\ntravel year and going forward I'll be\nrethinking where I spend my time in the\nRunning World I've had so many great\nmemories but if I want to make room for\nnew experiences I know it means I will\nhave to let go of some old ones in this\nentire TR I've been quietly and\nsometimes not so quietly letting people\nknow that I might not be back again next\nyear and while that might be very\ndifficult ult and counterintuitive for\nsomeone who reviews shoes for a living\ntoo I at least know that this conference\nthat I have enjoyed so thoroughly the\npast several years is in good hands\n[Music]\nw\n[Music]",

But I am a bit disappointed.\nThe most common question I got from my More v4 review what whether it was good for walking. And I would frequently reply that the sharp rocker makes the large midsole manageable for running but awkward for walking. It feels like the More v5\u2019s design changes address this issue exclusively. For some, that will be great. For me, not so much. \n.\nDisclosures: no one paid me to make this video or to include their brand in this video\n.\nHat: Carhartt. None. \nJacket: Bandit. I have done paid work with this brand, but I bought this particular jacket. \nMittens: Craft. I have done unpaid public appearance work for this brand, and I\u2019m not sure how I got these mittens.

      "text": "this is the novablast 5 and once again\nthey're changing the midsole foam this\nyear the Nova blast will feature FF\nblast Max a foam that is lighter than\nthe foam in a last year's Nova blast but\nwith the trend of super Foams making\ntheir way into daily trainers will FF\nblast Max be enough for as6 to keep up\nit's time to lace up the no blast 5 and\ntake it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non Elite Runner reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the A6\nNova blast 5 but before I give you my\nthoughts on this shoe I do want to go\nover some disclosures this is a pair of\nshoes that is accent to me for the\npurpose of revie so I did not have to\npay for these shoes however nobody's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my footage of my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the Nova\nblast 5 and let's start with the specs\nthis is a 41.5 MM stack heite shoot with\nan 8 mm drop giving us 33.5 mm of Stack\nheight in the for foot I believe those\nare the same specs as last year as far\nas stack height and drop now the women\ndo get a different stack height the drop\nstays the same but they're a millimeter\nlower in the heel and in the forfoot and\nthe big story for this year is the\nupgrade of the Nova blast to FF blast\nMax this is a brand new foam that is\nsupposed to provide a more responsive\nbounce according to A6 and it's also\nsupposed to be lighter so even though\nthese two shoes the Nova blast 4 and the\nNova blast 5 look very similar and if\nanything it looks to me like the novast\n5 has a little bit more foam to it the\nNova blast 5 does come in a little bit\nlighter now on the outsole on this shoe\nthere is a very familiar kind of pattern\nof rubber that's on here it is slightly\ndifferent than what we saw in last\nyear's version 4 but we're getting the\nsame rubber compound and we're basically\ngetting it in the same areas and to the\nsame depth so the rubber is still a\nlittle bit on the thick side if you ask\nme moving to the upper we have a brand\nnew upper material as well this year the\nNova BL goes to a jaquard mesh it's a\ndouble layer mesh that is very stretchy\nand also very breathable it also feels a\nlittle bit thinner than the material\nthat we saw in the Nova blast 4\nsomething that isn't thinner though and\nsomething that I think unfortunately\nisn't thinner is that the tongue is\nstill kind of on the puffy side and I\nfeel like as the years have gone on the\ntongue on the Nova Blast has gotten\npuffier and puffier even though I'm\nreally wishing they would just take the\nknit tongue from the Nimbus series and\nput that into NOA blast I think that\nwould be really fun to run in and in the\nheel cup of this shoe we're still seeing\nthat same overly padded puffy foam it\nmakes for a very comfortable slip-in\nexperience when your foot goes into the\nshoe and wearing it around casually it\nis really nice but I feel like for\nrunning especially in hot days it's not\nreally that hot here in Crystal Lake\nanymore but on hot days that's\ndefinitely going to be a bit of a sweat\ncollector as the Nova Blast has been\npretty consistently in the heel for the\npast couple of years we do still retain\nthe pull tab though for easy on in the\nshoes and overall this shoe comes in at\nan updated weight of 255 G or just at 9\n[Music]\noz now that we talked about what this\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on the road the Nova\nblast 5 is a faithful successor to the\nNova blast lineage there's a great\namount of cushion in this shoe and\nthere's a great amount of Bounce I feel\nlike it also picks up the pace as well\nso not only can it do your daily\ntraining run and handle those\nrun-of-the-mill everyday runs that\nyou're doing most of the week most of\nthe time but if you've got a light\nworkout like a fart lick or an uptempo\nrun or maybe you just got an easy run\nwith them strides in it the Nova blast 5\nis going to be really fun and really\ncomfortable for you to be able to put\nthose miles in now I think that the word\nthat a lot of you guys who have been\nwatching me review the Nova Blast for\nthe last five iterations are probably\nlooking for is whether it's chaotic and\nI will say that the Nova blast 5 isn't\nchaotic it's more like the Nova blast 4\nthan it is like the Nova Blast 3 but I\ndo think that the FF blast Max foam is\ndoing a really good job of kind of\ngiving me more Nova blast 3ish sensation\nwithout it feeling chaotic so I feel\nlike it kind of splits the difference\nbetween the Nova Blast 3 and the Nova\nblast 4 fans and so it's not as\npotentially unstable to as many people\nbut it's still a lot of fun to be able\nto run in the upper on the shoe is is\nreally comfortable even more comfortable\nthan the Nova blast was last year and I\nthink because the material is thinner I\ndoes feel like there's a little bit more\nroom and it's a little bit more\nforgiving in terms of fit in the forfoot\nso those of you who are kind of on the\nbubble between sizes last year because\nit might have been a little bit too snug\nfor you I think you might be able to\nstay at your regular size for the Nova\nblast 5 I do feel like overall the upper\nis a big improvement over last year\nalthough I would love to see the tongue\nstop being so overbuilt and the Heel Cup\nbeing so overly padded as far as the\nouto goes I feel like we have a very\nsimilar setup it's the same compound and\narranged in pretty much the same pattern\nand thickness as it was last year so if\nyou've been able to run in the Nova\nblast 4 without any traction or grip\nissues you should be definitely fine in\nthe Nova blast 5 personally I feel like\nI could go with a little bit less rubber\ncuz I feel like it would further enhance\nthe experience you're getting from the\nFF blast Max I think as it is the amount\nof rubber that's on the outsole is\nmuting The Experience just a little bit\nthat being said I think the Nova blast 5\nis a set it and forget it kind of shoe\nI'm having a lot of fun with it I can\nrun in it all day long and it's an\nexcellent example of a daily\n[Music]\ntrainer before we close out the video\nLet's zoom out and see where the noble\nS5 sits within a broader A6 lineup now\nwhenever I take a look at a running shoe\nbrand I like to start with the daily\ntrainer and that's exactly what a Nova\nblast is it's the shoe that sits in the\nmiddle of your running shoe rotation\nit's kind of the base of it all the shoe\nthat you're running in most often it's\nbuilt to be comfortable enough to be\nused multiple times per week and also be\ndurable enough to handle that kind of\nmileage and then for racing the carbon\nplated shoe that I like from A6 is the\nmeta speed sky and this is the meta\nspeed Sky Paris that's going to go over\nhere now in between these two shoes for\nsomething that is maybe a little bit\nfaster than you might want for every day\nbut maybe not quite as special that\nyou'd have to break out your erasing\nshoes that's where a training companion\nor session shoe like the magic speed 4\ncomes into play it's got a little bit of\ndaily training features it's got a\nlittle bit of race day features built in\nnow for days where you're going to be\nspending a lot of time on feet maybe\nit's a recovery run you want to be a\nlittle bit nicer to your body that's\nwhere a shoe like the Glide ride Max\ncomes into play it's a little bit more\ncushioned a little bit more chill and\nhas a lot more comfort features built\ninto it it's also the first shoe that we\nsaw that introduced at least a little\nbit of FF blast Max foam in here and\nthen from as6 there's also a fifth shoe\nthat kind of is a category straddler but\nthis is the super Blast 2 this has\nracing foam in it FF turbo plus the same\nturbo plus that's in the race sto but\nit's in a really tall sack heite and it\nhas no carbon fiber plate it also has a\nlittle bit of daily training film on the\nbottom to help with longevity and also\nto stabilize this foam this is a shoe\nthat some people use as a kind of long\nslow distance kind of shoe or recovery\nday shoe and it does a good job of that\nbut I kind of like it for longer runs\nwhere I might have to pick up the pace a\nlittle bit and having that super foam is\na nice little touch so this is like a\nfive shoe rotation from as6 that I think\ncould be really fun but I I'm not\nrecommending that people go out and buy\nall five of these shoes in fact there's\na lot of ways that I think that kind of\nlike this can be paired down so the\nfirst thing I'm going do is I'm going to\nremove two shoes from this and I feel\nlike if I wanted to go with a three shoe\nrotation from A6 I'd get rid of the glid\nride Max and the magic speed 4 not that\nthey're not good shoes but I just feel\nlike if we're trying to consolidate a\nlittle bit this is a really good way to\nconsolidate here use your Nova Blast for\nyour everyday your super Blast 2 for\nyour long runs and long run workouts and\nthen for your fastest stuff that's where\nyou reach for the race day shoot now if\nI were to really push it and force\nmyself to have only two a six shoes in a\nrotation I think the shoe that I would\nremove would be the Nova blast 5 not\nthat I don't love that shoe but I feel\nlike the super Blast 2 is pretty\nversatile it can handle everyday running\nand it can also do some workouts as well\nand then you've got the meta speed Sky\nParis as your race Day Option and I feel\nlike this could be an expensive but\ndoable two shoe rotation cuz keep in\nmind the super Blast 2 is $200 now you\nmight be asking well what about the\nother Marathon racing shoe that A6 has\nand that is the meta speed Edge Paris\nand I feel like this is an either or\nwhether you're using a two shoe three\nshoe five shoe rotation you're probably\neither going to like the metaed edge\nParis or The Meta speed Sky Paris I kind\nof use them in the same rotation because\nI happen to have both of them but\nrealistically for most Runners it's\ngoing to be an either or and I prefer\nthe metas speed\n[Music]\nSky now let's wrap up the video by going\nover the binding guide and we'll talk\nabout some Alternatives that you want to\nconsider the Nova blast 5 is an\nexcellent example of a daily trainer it\ncan do a little bit of everything from\nrecovery runs your everyday runs to\nmoderate workouts and strides this shoe\ngoes on sale soon December 1st at a\nprice of $140 so inflation has not hit\nthe Nova blast series yet but because\nthe Nova Blast has been around for a\nwhile there are also some other options\nto consider in the Nova blast family for\nexample you can get $10 discount right\nnow on the Nova blast 4 and in some very\nselect sizes you can find the Nova Blast\n3 still around for\n$100 so those are some other options\nthat you might want to also consider\nbecause while there are some differences\nbetween these shoes amongst the Nova\nblast Fanatics for most people getting\nan earlier version of novablast to save\nyou a couple of bucks is definitely\nsomething that is a viable option but\nthere's also a lot of heat coming from\nother brands in 24 and into 5 so let's\ntake a look at some of those I think the\nbiggest competition that the novablast 5\nfaces is from Adidas and that's going to\nbe the Evo SL this is a shoe that has\nall racing super foam in the midlle the\nsame Light Strike Pro that was in the\nadios Pro 3 but it doesn't have a carbon\nfiber plate or those energy rods that\nthe adios Pro Series has had the upper\nis built more for daily training but it\ndoesn't have a super puffy tongue or\nheel cup and I feel like this shoe is an\nexcellent daily as well and it does a\nvery good job of even moderate to hard\nworkouts it'll be interesting to see how\nthis shoe holds up as a daily trainer as\nwe don't typically associate Light\nStrike Pro with longevity and durability\nthat you'll need for daily training but\nif it could even come kind of close to\nthe kinds of numbers in terms of miles\nthat you can run in this shoe before it\nuses its usable life I think this is\ngoing to be an incredibly difficult\nshoot for any brand to compete against\nin 202 5 and it's only $10 more than the\nNova blast 5 the Evo SL comes out at\n$150 which I believe is a very\naggressive price now there are trickle\ndrops here and there where you might be\nable to get this shoe now but supplies\nare very limited in each of those little\nmini drops the broader release doesn't\nhappen until March of 2025 which for me\nor depending on how much you run might\nbe plenty of time to pick up a NOA blast\n5 and then pick up an Evo SL if you're\nonly going to get one of those two shoes\nand I feel like people watching this\nchannel regularly are probably not going\nto only get one of these two shoes but\nif you're only going to get one and\nyou're deciding between the Evo SL and\nthe Nova blast 5 and you can wait till\nMarch of 2025 and probably pick the Evo\nSL now the other shoe that I want to\ntake a look at is another shoe that uses\nsuper foam and I'll use super foam in\nair quotes here because it's zumex in\nthe Pegasus plus and I'm using air\nquotes with this because I don't really\nthink and I haven't heard officially\nfrom Nike one way or the other but I\ndon't think that the zoomx foam that's\nin the Pegasus plus is the same zoomx\nfoam that we're seeing in the actual\nrace product like in the alphafly 3 or\nin the vapor fly but it is a really good\ndaily training foam and a lot of the\nsame things that I would say nicely\nabout the Nova blast 5 I can kind of\ncopy paste and put onto the Pegasus plus\nas well it's a really great daily\ntrainer you could take it for some\nmoderate workouts I do feel though that\nthe Pegasus plus has a little bit more\nof an aggressive geometry with a 10 mm\ndrop versus no Nova blast 8 and I do\nfeel like there is slightly less foam\nthat you're standing on in the shoe in\nterms of what it feels like underfoot so\nit feels like it's a little bit less\ncushioned and it is a little bit more\nsnug in the forefoot and the Pegasus\nplus comes in at a substantial premium\nof $180 so while the Pegasus plus is one\nof my favorite daily Trainers for 2024 I\ndefinitely would pick the Nova blast 5\nso do I think that going into 2025 that\ndaily trainers absolutely have to have\nsuper Foams as table stakes in in order\nto be competitive I think the answer is\nno and I think that the FF blast Max and\nthe Nova blast 5 are really good\nexamples of that but I do think that as\nwe go and as that trend of putting super\nFoams into daily trainers continues what\nyou're doing with those Foams is going\nto have to be pretty special in order to\nkeep up if you have any other questions\nabout this shoe or any of the shoes that\nI mentioned today feel free to put them\nin the comments down below or better yet\nstop by the last thing I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I'll see\nyou in the next one yo what's going on\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

      "text": "I was skeptical when Puma first told me\nabout their new alphatic TPU super foam\nespecially when they told me that it was\nnot only fast but highly durable and\nwhile the super foam has delivered in\nthe performance Department how is it\nholding up after extensive use let's\ntalk about the fast R2 after 100 miles\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi I'm\na non Elite Runner who reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the Puma\nfast R2 after 100 miles but before I\ngive you my thoughts on this shoe I do\nwant to go over some disclosures this is\na pair of shoes that Puma sent to me for\nthe purpose of review so I did not have\nto pay for these shoes however nobody's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my players or my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the Puma\nfast R2 after 100 miles and let's start\nwith how I've been using the shoe I\ndidn't have a chance to race in this\nshoe unfortunately but I have been using\nit for a lot of race type situations in\nother words I've been using it for my\ntoughest workouts and my most rigorous\nlong runs those long runs that have a\nlot of marathon effort work in them but\nmy absolute favorite way of using this\nshoe is for threshold mile repeats or\nany other types of threshold work where\nyou'd benefit from that really strong\nsense of carbon spring and power that\nI'm getting from each step in this shoe\nbut at the same time there's also a lot\nof cushion in this shoe as well so\nyou're getting the Best of Both Worlds\nwhere you're getting impact absorption\nbut it also still feels like a very fast\nand bounding type of shoe the upper\nfurry has been very comfortable it is a\nbit on the snug side but it hasn't been\ncrunching my toes at all and just about\nthe only thing that I'd warn you guys\nabout is this little point in the back\nof the heel cup here there's a little\nseam that runs along the back of the\nshoe that can be a little bit abrasive\nif you're not wearing a sock that comes\nat least over the top of the shoe\notherwise I've been really enjoying the\nfit on this one it's plenty breathable\nwith this semi-transparent Ultra weave\nmaterial that they've been using and I\nthink just about the only downside that\nI have for this shoe is it's a little\nbit on the heavy side it comes in at a\nstated weight of 240 G or just under 8.5\no with put it pretty much in the middle\nof daily trainer\ncategory now that we talked about how\nI've been using the shoe let's talk\nabout how the shoe has physically been\nholding up now I had big expectations\ncoming into this 100 mile review because\nwhen I talked with Puma about it this\ntime last year when the shoe was first\nintroduced to the public they told me\nthat this new aliphatic TPU foam that\nthey have is not only the lightest\nmaterial that they've ever used and also\nthe springiest material they've ever\nused but it's also the most durable\nsuper foam material that they've ever\nused as well they're telling us that it\ncould get up to 400 km of use or about\n250 useful miles Which is far beyond\nwhat I would normally expect for a shoe\nin this category of Premium race day\nproduct and for me I would say that the\nfoam is still holding up really well I\ndo think that it feels a little bit\ndifferent than it felt right out of the\nbox from a year ago but that's to be\nexpected even the most durable daily\ntraining or even Max cushion shoe Foams\nare going to feel different out of the\nbox than they do at 100 miles but I do\nfeel like this shoe is holding up better\nthan most Ras product holds up after the\ncourse of a year of usage as it took me\nto get to 100 miles in this shoe I'm\nstill feeling a lot of that great impact\nabsorption from the road and I'm still\ngetting a really strong sense of push\noff and decompression of that foam that\nnice pop Sensation that I'm looking for\nnow a lot of that is aided by the carbon\nfiber plate that is very springy in this\nshoe but both the plate and the foam\nhere are part of the same midsole system\nand that whole midsole system is working\nreally well here now I know that\ncreasing of the foam really isn't an\naccurate indicator of how modern super\nFoams are or are not degrading but there\nisn't really a lot of creasing on the\nfoam that I'm seeing on this shoe and\nthe only kind of like foam degradation\nthat I'm really seeing is from the\ncolorization of it now I think that like\nother modern super Foams I don't know\nthat this foam can really take color\nlike Eva for example can take color and\nso it looks like part of the paint layer\nthat's on the shoe is definitely coming\noff but other than that the the foam\nitself is holding up really nicely on\nthe outsole the pumer grip that's here\nis really robust and also doing really\nwell I feel like I've not been babying\nthis shoe at all in fact some of my\nearly runs that I did on this shoe were\non dirt roads or gravel roads that were\nnot the most forgiving and pretty rough\nin terms of nonuniform sizes of rocks\nthat were on the surface and Puma did\nreach out to me and thank me for even\ntrying to test the shoe in those kinds\nof situations as well because a lot of\npeople are concerned about that exposed\ncarbon fiber plate and how a shoe like\nthis that's intended for road racing\ncould handle a variety of different\nsurfaces now I'll say that I probably\nwouldn't use this shoe for a trail race\nbut it's not a shoe that you have to\nreally worry about it breaking or it\nbeing too fragile to take on anything\nexcept for some of the most pristine\nrace like conditions this is a shoe that\nyou can really beat up and that's all\nthat I've done with it in a variety of\ntemperatures in a variety of surfaces\nthe shoe has held up really well and the\nrubber outsole is doing a fantastic job\nof protecting the foam that is here in\nthis shoe even going to the upper I feel\nlike it's holding up well it's\ndefinitely molded a bit to the shape of\nmy foot again that seam in the back is\nkind of starting to fray a little bit\nand I think that's friction between that\nlittle seam and uh my sock as I'm\nrunning in the shoe but it's not at risk\nof becoming undone everything's still\nholding together really well now I don't\nplan on taking this shoe to 250 Mi to\nfully test Puma's claims on the\ndurability and longevity of the shoe but\nbased on how excited I am even in the\nlast month to get back in the shoe to do\nsome tough sessions and workouts I feel\nlike there's still plenty of life left\nin this shoe and it's going to be one of\nthe more durable Premier race product\nshoes that you're going to be able to\nfind on the market\n[Music]\ntoday before we wrap up this video Let's\nzoom out a little bit and see where the\nPuma fast R2 fits within the broader\nPuma lineup now whenever I take a look\nat a running shoe brand as a whole I\nalways like to start with the daily\ntrainer and for Puma that's going to be\nthe velocity Nitro 3 it's got a really\nnice Nitro foam or a nitrogen infused\nsuper critical foam in the midsole that\nmakes for a nice Snappy experience it's\nalso highly durable both in the midsole\nout soole and upper so it can handle\nbeing the shoe that you go to most\nfrequently in your daily training lineup\nand then for your races that's where I\nwould reach for a shoe like the fast R2\nthat's going to sit over here on the far\nend of the speed Spectrum this is the\nshoe that you're going to save for your\nraces and your biggest most tough\nworkout now anything that's kind of in\nbetween what you would use for a daily\ntrainer and what you would use for your\nrace race day I think that's where a\nshoe like the DV8 neure 3 comes in it's\na session shoe or a training companion\nto your race shoes and it's one of the\nbest in its class at doing that as it\ncombines a lot of daily training\nfeatures and a lot of race like features\nnow on a day where you're recovering\nafter a big workout or a big race that's\nwhere a really nice comfy shoe like the\nPuma mag Max comes in it's a very tall\nvery squishy but also a bit bouncy of a\nshoe so it's still a lot of fun even\nthough it's for of those days where you\nprobably feel the least like running on\nthat day it's a great shoe to have and\nthis is a nice Puma running rotation for\n20124 now you might be asking a question\nlike well what about the other carbon\nplated racing shoe that Puma has the DV8\nNitro Elite 3 this is going to be an\neither or situation for the race option\nyou're either going to use the fast R2\nor you're going to use the nitro Elite 3\nthere are two different options\ndepending on what you're looking for in\nyour carbon plate eraser this is a\nlittle bit more of a a fast turnover\nreally powerful clawback sensation\nrather than a really powerful push off\nsensation and that's how I differentiate\nthese too I have been really enjoying\nthis for my fastest intervals and my\ntoughest speedwork sessions although I\nthink overall even though that one is\nmuch lighter I am leaning towards the\nfast R2 as my favorite between the two\nPuma race product options this is a lot\nof shoes four potentially five shoes to\nbe able to sort from from a rotation I\nknow most people don't run like that if\nI were try to reduce it down to three\nshoes the shoe from Puma that I would\neliminate would be the velocity I feel\nlike for me it's a little bit on the\nfirm side and a lot of the daily\ntraining tasks could be shifted over to\nthe deviate Nitro 3 so this could be a\nreally fun three shoe rotation but\nbecause of the durability of the\naliphatic TPU that's available in the\nfast R2 and also in the DV8 Nitro Elite\n3 I think that you can really get away\nwith a very fun and very functional two\nshoe rotation from puma and for that as\nmuch as it pains me to eliminate one of\nmy favorite shoes the DV8 Nitro 3 I\nthink you could really do it with just\ntwo shoes in the Puma lineup right now\nyou could do all of your easy running in\nthe magmax because even though it is big\nand heavy and cushioned it still got a\nlittle bit of Pep to it so you can still\nuse it very easily for all your daily\ntraining miles your recovery miles\neverything you use a daily trainer 4\nthis is going to be a good option\nespecially if you're one of my bigger\ntaller friends and then when it comes to\nanything that needs to go fast you can\nreach for your fast R2 and because it\nhas that durability in that new\naliphatic TPU foam it's going to be able\nto handle all of your workouts in\naddition to your racing and this could\nbe a really fun two shoe\n[Music]\nrotation now let's wrap up the video by\ngoing over the buying guide and we'll\nalso talk about some Alternatives that\nyou might want to consider the Puma fast\nR2 is one of my favorite carbon plated\nRacing shoes and it's going to be a\nreally fun option for you if you like a\npowerful push-off Sensation from a\nquickly decompressing foam and a springy\ncarbon fiber plate but at $260 I feel\nlike it's a touch expensive and maybe\nI'm picking nits here but I feel like it\nshould come down about at least $10 to\nmake up for a little bit of the extra\nweight that you're going to have to\ncarry around to be in this shoe now\nthere is a prior version of The Fast R\nthe fast R1 or just the fast R but it's\na substantially different shoe and it's\nnot really something that I would\nconsider to be a viable alternative so\nlet's take a look at some other brands\nto see what's available as an option to\nalso consider now the first shoe that I\nwant to talk about really doesn't feel\nthe same or similar to the fast R2 but I\nthink it's built for the same type of\nRunner and that's going to be from as6\nand this is the meta speed Sky Paris now\nI feel like even though this is on the\nother end of the weight Spectrum as the\nfast R2 the fast R2 is one of the\nheavier carbon plated shoes you can buy\nand the metas speed Sky Paris is one of\nthe lightest I feel like the way that\nthe plate is positioned on this shoe and\nthen the way that the foam is being\nutilized here it's also trying to\ncapitalize on Runners who really enjoy a\nstrong sense of push off from the forf\nfoot in their Marathon shoe so if you're\nkind of drawn to one you'll be drawn to\nthe other even though they have very\ndifferent Sensations but the metas speed\nSky Paris comes in at $250 price point\nthat I like for premium race product now\nthe next shoe that I'm going to talk\nabout I think feels more similar to the\nfast R2 in terms of the runner who it's\ndesigned for and the way that the shoe\nfeels and that shoe is from Hoka it's\nthe very underrated clo X1 now both of\nthese shoes I think are targeting that\nsame powerful stride and push off\nsensation I think there's a lot of\nsimilarities in the geometry and the way\nthat these shoes are built that they're\ntrying to achieve those goals now with\nthe cell X1 I think you are getting even\nmore cushion and impact absorption from\nthe road although I think that the push\noff sensation is slightly muted compared\nto the fast R2 so there's a little bit\nof give and take there the other thing\nabout the cello X1 which is maybe why\nit's not so underrated and maybe\nproperly rated is that the cello X1 is\neven heavier coming in at almost 9\nounces which puts it in Pegasus plus\nterritory Nova blast 5 territory in\nterms of weight and it comes in at a\nretail price of\n$275 so $25 more expensive than I really\nthink the shoe should be so it's a it's\na very viable and interesting\nalternative but it has a lot of the same\ndrawbacks as the fast R2 does but those\nare my thoughts on the fast R2 and the\ncompetition that's out there let me know\nin the comments down below if you have\nany other questions about this shoe or\nany of the shoes that I talk aled about\ntoday or better yet stop the live stream\nthat I do Mondays and Thursdays over on\nthe kuuu Run Club Channel love to see\nyou guys over there in the chat that's\nall I for today everybody thanks so for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]\noh",

what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm an non Elite Runner reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I'm\ntalking to you guys all about the on\ncloud booom strike LS but before I give\nyou my thoughts on this isso I do want\nto go over some disclosures this is a\npair of shoes that on sent to me for the\npurpose over review so I did not have to\npay for these shoes however nobody's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my footage or my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the on cloud\nboom strike light spray and let's start\nwith the specs we got 40 mm of sack\nheite in the heel with a 5 mm drop\ngiving us 35 mm of stack heite in the 4\nfoot and in this shoe as far as the\nmidsole goes there's two components\nthere's helon HF that's on super foam it\nis a biobased PBX material that uses at\nleast 40% biobased materials I believe\nit is the same compound that we see in\nthe nonl spray version of the cloud boom\nstrike now something to keep in mind\nabout these two shoes is that other than\nthe differences in the upper there are\nsome significant differences in the\nmidsoles of these shoes even though they\ndo share a Midol foam compound one of\nthe things that you'll know if you look\nat them kind of carefully is that there\nare four clouds or those holes in the\nmidsole that an is known for in the\ncloud boom strike LS and there's only\nthree in the midsole of the cloud boom\nstrike and the other thing to keep in\nmind is that these clouds are in a\ndifferent position both vertically in\nthe stack of the shoe and forward to\nback in terms of position of the shoe\nthe clouds in the cloud boom strike are\nin the heel there's three of them here\nand they're below the main portion of\nfoam that runs the length of the shoe in\nthe cloud boom strike LS we have four\nclouds that run along the side of the\nshoe they don't go all the way through\nlike a lot of clouds do in different on\nshoes but they're also kind of in the\nmiddle layer of the shoe here which is\nsomething that I had wished that the\nregular on cloud boob strike had done\nbecause those clouds although they seem\nkind of decorative they actually do have\na significant impact in the way that the\nfoam deflects and deforms something that\nis similar though I believe between both\nof those shoes is that they have a\ncarbon fiber speedboard now speedboard\nis kind of like a carbon fiber plate but\non uses them in a wide variety of a lot\nof their shoes and they're not always\nmade out of carbon when an is talking\nabout speed boards but the cloud boom\nstrike and for the cloud boom strike LS\nthose speed boards are made out of\ncarbon now on the outsole of the shoe we\nhave a pretty standard array of rubber\nthat we see in a lot of racing shoes\nwe've kind of got like the front third\nof the shoe covered basically where\nyou're going to be pushing off from and\nthen we have got two little patches of\nrubber along the heel now on the inside\nof the shoe there is no strobo board\nthere's no insole in fact we have a\nsetup that I think is pretty similar to\nwhat we saw in their Cloud boom strike\nwhere they have like a kind of a drop in\ninsole SL midsole chunk that they put in\nthe shoe and at least when I asked them\nabout the regular Cloud boom strike on\nsays that they do this so that they can\nremove the Strobel board and remove the\nneed for a separate insole you're\nstanding directly on that biobased PBX\nnow I I'm not brave enough to try and\nremove the insole from the cloud boom\nstrike LS with the way it's constructed\nI feel like it's an integral part of the\nshoe It's seems more than just glued\ndown and now the the main story about\nthis shoe is the upper I had a chance to\ngo to New York for the popup that they\nhad set up there for the New York\nMarathon and see the machine in action\nuh I will say that it looks pretty much\nexactly like what the promo videos for\nlight spray machine looks like online on\nhas put together a really cool video\nthat only takes 3 minutes to watch from\nbeginning to end about how this compound\nis sprayed onto the shoe very much in a\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs kind\nof way uh cured and then painted and\nthen kind of they go through the steps\nit's not like you do all the spraying\nall the curing and then all the painting\nit kind of goes back and forth steps at\na time depending on what needs to be\ndone with the shoe uh but still\nnevertheless it's a really fast and\nfascinating process the one thing that\nI'll say is when I watch the videos that\nan puts together it kind of looks like\nyou could see the stream of the\nsubstrate being applied to the shoe no\nmatter how close I looked at it and the\nlighting wasn't perfect for trying to\ndepict this I couldn't see that spray it\njust kind of looked like a sprayon wet\nmaterial was being applied to the shoe\nand then as you kind of like stepped\nback and like figuratively zoomed out\nyou could see that like material was\nbeing added onto it and then every once\nin a while they had to like run it under\na brush to kind of smooth everything\nthat had been sprayed onto the shoe then\nthey would cure it and then they would\nadd some more and then do a little bit\nof painting and kind of repeat all those\nprocesses until you were all done and\nthe result is a very lightweight\nmaterial that I believe is made out of\nTPU I'm still waiting for confirmation\nfrom on I'll update either in the\ndescription or in a comment below if I\never get a follow-up confirmation on\nthat but based on some of the stickers\nand labels that they had to put inside\nthis shoe to prepare it for mass\nproduction and for sale uh I believe\nthat the upper is made out of TPU and uh\ndespite what you might think it's\nactually pretty robust I mean you can\nreally kind of Yank on it quite a bit\nand it will stretch a little and the way\nthat they told me to try this on when I\nhad a chance to try it on in New York\nwas to kind of like stretch it a bit and\nbe aggressive with it so that way you\ncan open up the the opening by the ankle\nto get your foot inside and then kind of\nuse your fingers as shoehorns to let\nyour foot get inside and then once your\nfoot's in it it all kind of like goes\nback and morphs back into its original\nposition and and some of the sensations\nthat I'll say that I feel is that it\nfeels a lot less snug than I thought I\nwould it's certainly snug because\nthere's no laces on this thing uh but I\nreally thought that it was going to\nCrunch and almost like vacuum seal in\nall my toes I didn't get that at all but\nI am getting like pressure across like\nthe widest part of my foot I feel like\nit's um if I could use my hand as an\nexample if these are the pads of my feet\nlike right here at the ends of the pads\nof my feet that's where I feel a little\nbit of tension and I feel some tightness\non the shoe but otherwise it's really\ncomfortable and it doesn't really feel\nlike it's all that different at all\nwhich is kind of what I want out of a\nlot of technology I don't want it to\nreally feel all that different I just\nwant it to work and this upper\ndefinitely works for me the other thing\nthat I was worried about is that kind of\nlike this Edge uh looks kind of\nUnfinished and based on a lot of kind of\nknit shoes which is the closest thing\nthat I was kind of mentally comparing it\nto anytime there are these unfinished\nedges and this goes high it's kind of\nlike a midtop uh I was worried that this\nwas going to cut into my skin and I\ndidn't have any problems with that at\nall my low cut socks didn't always come\nup over the edge of the light spray\nmaterial and even though there was a lot\nof rubbing against my ankle none of it\never caused any irritation uh much less\nany chafing so that was a real surprise\nas far as the upper goes and then when\nyou're touching the inside of it it's\nreally smooth almost creepy smooth kind\nof like a synthetic leather fake skin\nkind of texture on the inside it's it's\nreally quite amazing now altogether an\nsays that this shoe comes in at 170 G\nand that is just incredibly light but\nthe size of shoe that they're using for\nthat 170 G figure is an 8.5 in US men's\nwhich is smaller than a reference size I\ndo happen to be reference size and a US\nmen's size 9 for me in this pair of\nshoes on my scales came in at 188 G\nwhich is still incredibly light cuz it's\na me near 6.6 o making it one of the\nlightest shoes on the market\n[Music]\ntoday now that we've talked about what\nthis Sho is like on paper let's talk\nabout what it's like on the road I'm\nreally enjoying the tweaks to the\nmidsole experience that we have in the\ncloud boom strike LS I feel like there's\nmore cushion and softness in this shoe\nbut it's still exception Al good at fast\nrunning when I'm running V2 max type\nefforts or faster getting all the way up\nto mile race Pace I feel like there is\nan incredible smoothness to the entire\nexperience almost as if the shoe itself\nis carving the asphalt that I'm running\nalong and it just really works well for\nwhen I want to be as powerful and as\nquick of a turnover as my legs will\nallow me to produce but then when I dial\nit back to some of the more intended\neffort levels of the shoe when I'm\nrunning threshold level or towards\nMarathon effort Pace uh and I'm landing\na little bit more in the midfoot I feel\na little bit more of the kind of\nTechnology of the shoe I'm feeling the\nclouds a little bit more because I'm\nlanding more midfoot and I'm feeling a\nlittle bit more of the interaction I\nguess there's more time for my body to\nsense the interaction between the foam\nand the carbon fiber plate and and how\nall those things are interacting with my\nstride and my pushup and I feel like\nit's all working in a really nice and\nPowerful way now on Marathon shoes have\na tendency for me to be a little bit\nfirmer than I'd like and I still think\nthat that applies to this Shue here and\nI guess to kind of translate the\nexperience into something that I think a\nlot of you will have tried before is I\nthink that kind of what I'm feeling in\nthe cloud boom strike LS reminds me a\nlot of like the adios Pro one like the\nLight Strike Pro that was in that shoe\num that was a little bit on the firm\nside but ultimately had a good amount of\ncushion and had a really great amount of\npop and give you a really powerful push\noff and stride sensation I feel like I'm\ngetting a lot of those similar kinds of\nfeelings in the on cloud boom strike\nlight spray and I I know that a lot of\nyou guys have probably come here wanting\nto hear all about this upper and and\nhave me go into Exquisite detail about\nlike how this is different from a\ntraditional running experience but I\nthink it's like running in a a shoe that\nhas a really good knit or otherwise\nminimal upper but it's doing it in a way\nthat's extremely lightweight there's no\nlike potential problems that I'm really\nforeseeing with this so far it fit\nreally well for me I took it on a really\ntight turns and tangents and I didn't\nfeel like I was sliding around I feel\nlike a lot of the concerns that people\nhave with knit uppers are kind of being\nrecycled and reased for this shoe but\nthe material is both strong and flexible\nit's both stretchy but also retains its\nshape at at the the same time I'm not\nreally sure chemically scientifically\nhow all those things can go together but\nthey all seem to be going together\nreally well in this shoe I will be\nkeeping an eye on for a longterm usage\nuh if the upper is going to stretch and\nmold to my foot and kind of the\nbarometer that I'll be comparing it\nagainst is not whether it stretches even\na little bit or not but does it stretch\nmore than say a traditional racing upper\ndoes it stretch or deform more than a\nknit upper and how much of that\ndeformation is happening relative to the\nlife expectancy of this midsole foam so\nI don't need this upper to last like 300\nmiles like I would for a daily training\nupper I just need it to be able to last\nas long as the racing foam is going to\nbe good and that's something that I'll\ndefinitely be keeping an eye on but for\nthose of you that are still like really\nconcerned about like how fragile uh this\nmaterial might be just know that they\nare putting this into some racing Spike\nprototypes so they feel like it's strong\nenough to handle the even greater\npressures and forces that would have\nfrom track athletes so I feel like that\ngives you a good indication of how\nresilient and strong that on thinks that\nthese materials are and I'm tending to\nagree with them at least in my testing\nof this shoe so far I'm not that\nconcerned about the longevity of this\nupper\n[Music]\nnow before we wrap up the video let's\ntake a moment and step back and see\nwhere the cloud bam strike LS fits\nwithin the broader on lineup especially\nnow that they have multiple marathon\nRace product and then I'll also kind of\ntalk about some of the daily training\nproduct that I especially like coming\nfrom on now on has a lot of different\ntypes of shoes that are for different\ntypes of experiences of the ones that I\ntend to like are the ones that use their\nnew shape of clouds the cloud Tech phase\nuh clouds again are these holes that onp\nputs into their shoes and the cloud teac\nphase are the ones that are not as\nrounded they're more kind of triangular\nand the shape tends to change depending\non where in the shoe that they are and I\nthink a really great example of this\ntechnology working well or this approach\nworking well is in the cloud Surfer I\nthink it's a really nice spongy comfy\ndaily trainer that's really comfortable\nfor easy miles and even a lot of\nrecovery miles as well and then the\nother shoe that I would look to would be\nthe oncloud Clips this is a little bit\ntaller of the shoe and it can be used as\na recovery shoe and I like using it for\nthat but I also feel like it works\nreally well as kind of a good long run\nshoe something that has some uptempo\nmiles in it maybe you're getting up to\nmarathon pace and maybe you've got some\neasy miles and a couple of pace changes\nbetween easy and marathon and I feel\nlike this shoe is really great for that\nand again it's using that on cloud Tech\nphase the new kind of cloud from on and\nthese would kind of be my daily training\nthe two two shoes that I would use in\nthe on lineup rotation and then for\nanything faster than what these shoes\ncould really give me or if I had a\nreally long workout uh a long run with a\nlot of marathon miles in it and a lot of\npace changes in it then that's when I'm\ngoing to reach for the race product and\nwe'll put these aside for now because\nhere's where I think it gets a little\nbit complicated now on currently has\nthree different shoes in the lineup uh\nthat are all considered Marathon product\nand I've asked on about it and none of\nthese are going to be replacing each\nother I think they're all going to\ncoexist in the on lineup at the same\ntime going forward for how much for more\nforward I'm not really sure on didn't\nreally say but at least for now these\nare all going to exist in the product\nlineup at the same time and the first\none that I'll talk about is the one that\nkind of came out first and this is the\ncloud boom Echo 3 now the cloud boom\nEcho used to be the only plate carbon\nplated race shoe in the lineup and this\nis where I feel like you know on says\nthat it's a marathon shoe but I really\nfeel like it's a 5k 10K racer it's a\nmuch lower stack heite it's a much\nfirmer experience um and it's a very\nSnappy type of shoe it doesn't have the\nkind of like compression decompression\nthat I'm looking for in something that\nI'm going to be running in for about 3\nhours at a time I think an explained it\nas a shoe that's really designed for\npeople that want to run really fast and\nhave a lot of ground feel which I think\nis a nice way of saying it's firm and\nthen there is the cloud boom strike\nwhich came out uh shortly after that in\nthe year uh a lot of people thought that\nthis is the same shoe that Helen o was\nracing in but it's it turns out it's\nquite different and the the light spray\nis really the the shoe that's closest to\nwhat she's been racing in but this is a\nshoe that I feel like kind of adds some\nstack height adds some softness to the\nexperience as well I think the plate\nposition gets tweaked a little bit in\nthis shoe too uh but you're feeling a\nlot more of kind of like super Foams uh\nin the cloud boom strike and then I\nthink like the softest and I think most\nforgiving and I think also the most\nexciting at the same time shoot of the\nthree is the cloud boom strike LS again\nit's got the four clouds higher up in\nthe stack so it's closer to your foot uh\nbut also I feel like the combination of\nthe the featherweight upper and also the\nmidsole which feels like it might be a\nlittle bit lighter and aier of a midsole\nif you ask me um makes for just a really\nfantastic experience and so these are\nkind of three different but coexisting\noptions that are available for people\nthat really want to race in on shoes I\ndefinitely have a favorite in here but\ndepending on kind of the level of\nfirmness or ground feel that you're\nlooking for in your race product there\nis an option for you at\n[Music]\non now let's wrap up the video by going\nover the the buying guide and we'll also\ntalk about some Alternatives that you'll\nwant to consider if you're interested in\nthe cloud boom strike LS I think that\nthe on cloud boom strike LS is the best\nMarathon shoe that on has ever made it's\nfast it's incredibly lightweight it's\nflexible I hope that on continues in\nthis direction of making Marathon shoes\nthat are more runnable to a wider array\nof both Elite and non- Elite Runners but\nfor now at a retail price of $3 $30 for\nthe cloud boom strike Ls I'm not sure\nthat this is a shoe that I'm going to be\nable to recommend to anyone except for\nthe most Avid shoe nerds and the most\nfervent shoe collectors let's take a\nlook at some other shoes that are on the\nmarketplace right now that you might\nwant to consider instead so the first\nthing that I will take a look at is\nanother shoe that I think is definitely\na little bit too expensive but it's the\nclosest experience that you're going to\nbe able to get and that's the shoe that\nwe've already talked about quite a bit\ntoday that's the on cloud boom strike\nand remember this isn't just a\ndifference in uppers there is a\ndifference in midsole design across both\nof these shoes that I think makes a\npretty big difference I think that for\nthose of you who like a little bit less\ncushion but a little bit more\nresponsiveness out of your race day\nshoes I feel like this is the shoe that\nyou're actually going to really prefer\nuh but for me I feel like it's on that\nborderline of like I think I could take\nit for the marathon distance but I'm not\nsure I definitely personally would\nprefer the light spray version of this\nshoe that being said the upper here is\nreally comfortable it's still really\nlightweight it does come in at almost an\nounce heavier though because it's using\ntraditional racing upper materials but I\nfeel like you're getting a lot of\nsimilar experiences and this shoe comes\nin at a I guess it's a more reasonable\n$280 now the other shoe that I think we\nshould take a look at is a lot more\nreasonably priced and that's from Adidas\nand that's the adios Pro 3 and I\nspecifically I'm going to highlight the\nthree and not the four which will be\ncoming out later in 2025 uh and the\nreason why I specifically want to talk\nabout the 3es because I feel like this\nversion of a Light Strike Pro is a foam\nthat feels more similar to the foam\nthat's in the on cloud boom strike light\nspray and I feel like there is a\nresponsi to it it's definitely feels\nfast and you're getting a lot of bounce\nback from the foam uh and I feel like\nthere's a little bit of firmness to it\nas well it's not uncomfortable it's not\nhard by any means uh but it's a little\nbit more firm than it would be say\ncushioned and so there is a little bit\nless of the compression but there's a\nreally quick and satisfying\ndecompression that comes with both of\nthese shoes now the adios Pro 3 is even\nheavier still compared to the cloud boom\nstrike LS and the cloud boom strike but\nit is readily available it's pretty easy\nto buy even right now and it comes in at\na retail of\n$250 so $80 cheaper than the light spray\nso those are my thoughts on the OD Cloud\nboom strike LS it's definitely a shoe I\nlike more than I thought I would and I\ndo think it is the best Marathon shoe\nthat an has put out hopefully this is a\ntechnology that can become a little bit\nmore affordable and a little bit more\nproducible so that way they can make it\nin inventory numbers where more of you\ncan try this out uh I don't think it's a\nmusthave technology but it is certainly\nvery interesting to try and for you sho\nnerds out there you're going to want to\nat least find a place to be able to try\nit on and get a chance to experience it\nhopefully you'll get a chance to do just\nthat if you have any other questions\nabout the cloud boom strike LS or any of\nthe shoes that I talked about today feel\nfree to put them in the comments down\nbelow or better yet stop by the live\nstream I do Mondays and Thursdays over\non the kfoi Run Club Channel I'd love to\ntalk to you guys over there in the chat\nthat's all I have for today everybody\nthanks so much for making it all the way\nto the end of this video hopefully you\nguys are staying safe out there on your\nruns and I will see you in the next one\nyo what's going on\n[Music]",

We\u2019ve previously seen a bit of this foam in the Glideride Max which showed us a great amount a comfort without excessive squish, and I\u2019m getting a lot of similar sensations here. Really agreeable ride. Nice sense of cushion and spring, but it\u2019s not unstable. \nPutting it side by side with the last version, it certainly looks like there\u2019s more foam in version 5. But this new foam is lighter, making the seemingly bigger shoe a bit lighter.\nSince taking it on a first run, I\u2019ve run a 7 mile easy day after a hard workout yesterday, and I really enjoyed the shoe. It feels like it can run forever. I\u2019d like to get some more strides in them to get a better feel for how this shoe feels at some faster paces, but I\u2019ve enjoyed it for some slightly fast bursts of speed so far. \nFull review will probably go up next week after another couple of runs. \n.\nDisclosure: ASICS sent these shoes to review so I did not have to pay for them. No one is paying to make this video or to include their brand in this video. No one previewed this before it published.",

half\naway Drew did take us the right way and\nthe subway got us to the on popup pretty\nquick but we still got to the podcast a\nfew minutes late so it was already a\npacked house when we arrived I've been\nlistening to the coffee Club podcast for\na while it was good to be able to see a\nlive taping they had trivia Q&A from the\naudience and even a little bit of\nheckling of the OAC rookies it was a fun\nshow all I long to say to you oh\ndownstairs there was a bit of running\nshoe history from on which is the kind\nof thing that I always love to nerd out\non and then a chance to watch the\nShoemaker robot and even try on a demo\n[Music]\npair yeah you make me so\nnervous yeah say it's\ntrue tight and\ntwisted that's what you\ndo my hands sh\n[Applause]\nit\n[Music]\nCL all right that's it for the on store\nthat was pretty amazing that robot's\ncool I welcome our robot overlords as\nlong as they make good\nshoes now we're going to head over to\nBandit\nI think a lot of people forget that\nBandit is still a very young apparel\nbrand I have been to every New York\nMarathon popup they've done and that\ntradition only goes back to 2022 want to\nwelcome you guys to our uh first popup\nthey've come a long way in that amount\nof time and this year they're releasing\na collab collection with a major running\nshoe brand and personally I love the R\nherana theme\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nrace day morning started early for me\nwith a wake up time of about 4:30 a.m. I\ndid a big a digging to find out which\nhotel is the athlete hotel and I wanted\nto try and get some Paparazzi style\nfootage of the athletes as they boarded\ntheir buses to Staten Island but like in\nChicago and in Boston the athlete hotel\nis also a hotel for a lot of marathon\nparticipants so it's a pretty busy\natmosphere in the morning people I know\nboth personally and professionally kind\nof all over the place the athletes\nthough seem to be in really good spirits\nmost of them seemed chipper despite the\nearly hour but they were just very\n[Music]\nrelaxed after the athletes left I had a\ncouple hours to put together a pre-race\nreel and then I met Drew for\n[Music]\nbreakfast okay we've got off the train\nwe got a little bit of time before the\nathletes get in here let's get into\nposition we started the morning in\nBrooklyn as we always do and this is my\nfavorite spot to watch the race as it's\nearly enough that all the pros are still\nbunched up together but it's also\nrelatively less crowded so I can do my\nthing running along with the athletes to\nfilm them I put together a separate race\nvideo that is more of a contemporaneous\naccount of everything that happened that\nday so here what I'll do is I'll give\nyou a bit more of the behind the scenes\nnow with the way that the race waves are\nstaggered we always see the women first\nand then the proen but in between there\nis the MasterCard secret wave my friend\nAshley was in that wave as was feno who\nis getting his six star while running in\na tuxedo of all things and then there\nwas Alexi p who is another perennial\nrunner in this\nwave after we saw the men Drew and I had\nto hustle to catch the train last year\nwe got super Lucky by connecting to the\nexpress six train that took us up to see\nthe runners at Mile 19 with just a\nmoment to spare this year though we were\ntrying to get to 59th and see the pros\nright after Queensboro Bridge at Mile 16\nwe knew the women would be far too fast\nfor us to see them there but we thought\nwe might have a chance for the men but\nthe train took longer than we expected\nand the men were already gone before we\nwere out of the subway fortunately we\nhad Chase on the team to grab footage\nfor us at a couple of spots along the\ncourse he saw the pros coming up first\nab and then again in the park near the\nend of the race meanwhile Jew and I had\nto run across Manhattan and then\nnavigate through security and the paths\nof Central Park to get to the bleachers\nof the East\ngrandstand there we had really good\naccess to see the athletes as they came\nto the finish and because most people\nwho buy East grandstand tickets do so to\nsee their friends and family finish the\nrace and not to see the pros there was\nample space there there's also a private\nset of porta potties there too which Jew\nand I took advantage of after seeing the\npros come in and before we headed back\nout on the course to find our\n[Music]\nfriends now there's a special magic to\nthe New York Marathon the first is that\neven though this race is gigantic and\nthis year's race would end up being the\nlargest Marathon ever you can usually\nfind your friends just a couple of weeks\nago I had loaded up a bunch of friends\ninto my tracker for the Chicago marathon\nand I somehow ended up missing almost\nall of them in New York though you'll\nend up finding everyone you were looking\nfor and you'll also run into people you\ndidn't even know were racing like my\nfriend Nicholas who is one of the\nfounders of Chicago run crew 3 Run 2 and\neven though you don't plan it you'll\nalso find Friends Along the course that\nare always cheering like Hela who I\nfirst met a few years ago while we were\neach cheering for friends along the\ncourse of the New York Marathon at Mile\n8 in Brooklin Pro tip though cheering\nfor the New York Marathon is an\nendurance event unto itself make sure\nyou eat Drew and I usually stop by this\nShake Shack that is on the course and as\nwe're eating if we see that one of our\nfriends is about to come through on the\ntracker one of us stays in the\nrestaurant with the food while the other\ngoes out to cheer and we take turns this\nyear I was able to find Chloe who is a\nrunner who lives in the next town over\nfrom me out in the suburbs of Chicago we\nnever actually met in person but we each\nnotice that we sometimes have some\nfamiliar looking backgrounds in our\nrunning videos and that's how we started\nconnecting this was Chloe's first\nmarathon and she did such a good job\nwhile also raising a bunch of money for\ncharity\nthe last bit of magic that New York\noffers is the final finishers even\nthough Aid stations may have to shut\ndown and the slowest Racers may have to\nmove to the sidewalks as roads Rea in to\ncar traffic the Finish Line itself waits\nfor every Runner to complete the mission\nmore than 10 hours after the last wave\nstarts in Staten Island there are still\nRunners crossing the line in Central\nPark and the New York Marathon keeps the\ncameras rolling the lights are still on\nand crowds line up to give these final\nfinishers a proper\nwelcome Ted metalis the race director\nwho is there to welcome the first\nfinisher of the race he also welcomes\nthe last finisher as they crossed the\nline\ntoo this year that last finisher was\nSuper Mario a 74-year-old Italian man\nwho finished his\n35th New York Marathon\nTed gave me a hug as I finished my\nmarathon in Berlin and completed my six\nstars a couple months ago so I can tell\nyou when I see Ted hug someone else at\nthe end of the race that Ted gives out\nthe best hugs and let me tell you\nanother New York Marathon Secret inside\nthe pouch that Ted wears is a packet of\nwet whips and as Super Mario was getting\nphotograph\nand about to be interviewed for TV Ted\nmade sure to First wipe the sweaty crust\nfrom Mario's mouth so he would look his\nbest in his television\ninterviews at a time where maybe your\nfaith in the goodness of people may be a\nbit\nrattled know that the people you see\nhere are good people\nknow that empathy still does\nexist thank you New York for this\nreminder we need it now more than\n[Music]\never you\nyou\n[Music]",

    "description": "I got a chance to check out the On shoemaker robot while in New York. The thing really can make a shoe in 3 minutes (it sprays, paints, and cures the upper onto a pre-assembled midsole+outsole. \n.\nOn sent me home with a pair of the shoes (note: the shoes I have were not the ones that I saw being made), and I took them for a speed workout. For paces from mile to threshold, the shoe was more than up to the task. The faster you go, the smoother the ride is. \n.\nThe foam, which is 40% bio-based Helion HF, reminds me a bit of the Adios Pro 1. And the change in the clouds in the Cloudboom Strike LS. S the regular Cloudboom Strike is noticeable and welcome. Overall, it\u2019s a bit on the firm side,  it there is a really nice sense of pop and ping. \n.\nThe upper is snug, but not as snug as you\u2019d think. There\u2019s more room in the toes than average for a racing shoe. Instead, I\u2019m feeling g tightness across the widest part of my feet along the base of my toes. \n.\nGetting into the shoe takes a bit of work, but it\u2019s easier to get into than some of my other favorite racing shoes. The lack of laces didn\u2019t give me any issues on turns and tangents. The upper is not fragile as you might think. \n.\nFurther testing is necessary. I\u2019d love to get in a long run with some marathon effort miles to get a better sense of what this shoe is like for its intended purpose. \n.\nDisclosures: On provided the shoe for me to review. They are not paying me to make this video and have no editorial review or control. I was able to view the shoemaker robot at On\u2019s New York City popup at an event that was free and open to the public.",

Instead, Sheila Chepkirui was the one who took the mantle of racing Obiri stride for stride and elbow for elbow. In the end, Chepkirui had a bit more kick and secured her first New York title. \n.\nThe American women also performed quite well. I had predicted that Jess McClain would have a great day, which she did by coming in 8th overall as 2nd American. She was nudged out by last minute addition, Sara Vaughn, who had DNF\u2019d in Chicago just a few weeks ago. I felt like Sara Vaughn finally got that solid marathon result that she\u2019s been looking for in the past several builds, as did Kellyn Taylor, who came in 10th as the third American.\n.\n\ud83d\udcf9 Kofuzi, @chaseflemingphoto",

recently\nannounced adios Pro 4 and now even more\nof that lineage is making its way into\neveryday product this is the azero Evo\nSL and it's time to take it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm an an elite Runner who used running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the adero\nEvo SL but before I give you my thoughts\non this shoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nAdidas sent to me for the purpose of\nreview so I didn't have to pay for these\nshoes however nobody's paying me to make\nthis video or to include their shoe in\nthis video and no one's going to get a\nchance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the a zero Evo SL and let's\nstart with the specs I think the\nheadline spec is that it's Light Strike\nPro midsole foam in this shoe and unlike\nother shoes from other brands that use\nthe same name as their racing Foams even\nif the daily training versions are\nchemically different this is actually\nracing caloro in this shoe I've\nconfirmed with Adidas that it is Light\nStrike Pro in this shoe and nothing but\nLight Strike Pro in this shoe and the\nsame exact Light Strike Pro that's in\nthe adios Pro 3 and there is a slight\nvariation in terms of Stack kite and\ndrop in the Evo SL versus its racing big\nsiblings where the Evo SL starts out at\n38.5 mm of stacky in the heel and ends\nwith 32 mm of sa in the 4 foot for a 6\nand 1/2 mm drop and like I said there's\nno stabilizing element whatsoever in the\nmidsole of the shoe so you're getting a\nreally great opportunity to experience\nwhat pure Light Strike Pro really feels\nlike now another element that they've\nborrowed from the Evo one other than the\nAesthetics of the shoe and it does look\nabsolutely stunning and it does look\nvery similar is that they've borrowed\nthe 60% rocker position and so what that\nmeans is the rocker is the point at\nwhich the front of a running shoe kind\nof curls up a little bit and it helps\nyou as you're running forward to get\nover the foam and through the foam so\nthat way you can push off for your next\nstride now if we measure from 0% all the\nway to the full length of the shoe 100%\nwhere the rocker position starts is at\n60% of the length from 0 to 60 over here\nis where the rocker position starts and\nthis is really early compared to a lot\nof other shoes in the Adidas lineup even\nthe adios Pro 3 started at closer to 70%\nof the length of the shoe uh before it\nstarted in that rocker geometry but the\nEVO One and the adios Pro 4 both start\nat 60% and the evos SL is mimicking that\ngeometry here now to protect all this\nmidsole foam we've got a generous\nhelping of Continental rubber there is\npretty wide coverage in the forefoot of\nthe shoe and then two little strips in\nthe back of the heel now while there is\na good surface area amount of coverage\nthe rubber that's on here isn't very\nthick but as we've seen from other cont\nental Rubber products the durability on\nthese rubber outsoles is pretty high so\nthe thickness of the rubber doesn't\nreally bother me here moving to the\nupper we have what looks very similar to\nwhat we saw in the Evo one but what\nfeels in fact very different the upper\nfor the Evo one was almost transparent\nit was almost see-through and extremely\nlightweight yet also strong now we have\na little bit more of a traditional upper\nin terms of what we see on the EVO SL\nbut it is very breathable and the design\nis still very clean and minimalistic\njust like what we saw in the Evo SL\nwhich makes the three stripes that go\nacross the shoe even that much more\nstriking then the other really big\ndifference that I know between the EVO\nOne upper and the Evo SL upper is in the\ntongue and in the padding in the heel\ncup the EVO One tongue was kind of\ndifficult to deal with this one is much\nmore kind of traditional and standard\nit's still very thin and I I like it\nvery much and then in terms of padding\nin the back you could tell that this\nshoe is built a a little bit more for\ndaily training and not necessarily for\nracing because there is a lot more\ncomfort features built into this there's\na lot of padding around the back of the\nheel cup and a little bit of structure\nas well altogether Adidas tells us that\nthis shoe should come in at 224 G and\nwhen I weighed my usmen size 9 my\nreference size shoot it came in at\nexactly 224 G or 7.9 Oz\n[Music]\nnow that we talked about what this shoe\nis like on paper let's talk about what\nit's like on foot and I got to tell you\npure racing foam in a daily trainer is\nreally nice or at least it's really nice\nin the way they've implemented it here\nin the Evo SL I've taken the shoe out\nfor Recovery run efforts daily training\nand for some speedier work as well I\nthink it excelled in all three areas\nalthough it is doing certain things\nbetter than others I find that there's a\nreally nice squish to it the foam is\ncompressing nice ly and decompressing\nreally well although I think that some\npeople are going to find that the way\nthat this shoe is set up it's going to\nbe a little bit unstable at some of the\neasier paces and I found that like the\nshoe kind of felt a little bit muddled\nafter long extended periods of easy\nrunning in the shoe I do feel like the\nshoe does speedier running or like kind\nof uptempo running really well though\nand what I mean by uptempo Paces is\nstuff that's maybe a little bit slower\nthan your marathon Race pace and all the\nway up to half marathon or maybe up to\nthreshold efforts I feel like that range\nof speed which is a pretty broad band of\neffort levels at those Paces that are\nfaster than easy I feel like the foam is\nreally starting to perk up and respond\nlike a super foam wood where it's\ngetting a great amount of compression\nand decompression and I'm enjoying the\namount that the foam is deflecting but I\nalso enjoy kind of the the the Rhythm or\nthe pace at which it's deflecting as\nwell cuz I feel like it's really\nmatching with my foot strike and my\nstride and I think that when you're\npicking up the pace a little bit in this\nshoe that's where I think that the 60%\ngeometry of The Rocker that's in the\nshoe feels the most kind of sensible I\nfeel like at some of the easier Paces\nthe 60% rocker where the rocker starts\nso early uh makes it feel a little bit\nmore aggressive than the shoe\nnecessarily needs to be it's a 6 and\nhalf millim drop shoe and I feel like it\nfeels like a much taller drop because of\nthat aggressive rocker that start starts\nso early but when you're picking up the\npace even just a little bit that's where\nI feel like the whole thing really just\nmakes a lot of sense together and if you\nthink about it it should make a little\nbit more sense that way because it's\nborrowing so much Heritage from the\nadios Pro 3 the adios Pro 4 and the evo1\nkind of all put together and distilled\ninto this daily training package and at\nthe end of the day I feel like calling\nit a daily trainer is a little bit\nreductive or calling it a session shoe\nalso is a little bit reductive because\nit's not\nstrictly a session shoe at certain Paces\nwhen I want to go faster than threshold\nand certainly if I were to do a a big V2\nMax workout I I would want something\nthat's a little bit snappier here and\nthat's where I'm missing the pop of a\nplate in this shoe but the fact that\nthis shoe can kind of handle a lot of\nwhat an average Runner is going to\nencounter during a marathon or half\nmarathon training block I think is it\nwas really quite amazing that they've\nable to put that all into one shoe I do\nfeel like the big biggest attractor I'd\nsay for this shoe is the upper the\nmaterials that they've chosen look great\nbut I think that every material that's\nhere is a bit of a sweat collector so on\nthose hot days on those really big\nworkouts that you're going to put into\nthis shoe your shoes are going to be\nsoaking up a lot of\n[Music]\nliquid now before we wrap up the video\nlet's take a moment and see where the\nEvo SL could fit within a broader Adidas\nrunning shoe rotation now the evos for\nme fits as a daily trainer it can\ncertainly do a lot of different types of\nthings but the bulk of the time that\nyou're going to be using this shoe\nyou're probably going to be using it for\nyour everyday runs your easy runs taking\nup the bulk of your weekly mileage and\nthen for racing you're going to look to\nits sibling the adios Pro 4 as the\nracing option there are similarities in\nGeometry a lot of similarities in feel\nthese two shoes alone are going to make\nfor a really fun running SHO rotation if\nyou wanted to go with just two but let's\nadd some more into the conversation I\nthink one way to go really crazy and\nwild with this is to bring in the prime\nX2 strong this is more of a long run\nshoe but not just any long run shoe if\nyou've got a long run with some speedier\nmiles built into it or you have just a\nbig workout where you want a lot of\ncushion and this has a lot of cushion\nand double carbon fiber plates this is a\nreally fun albeit expensive way uh to\nadd some spice into your your long runs\nand now there's some gaps in between\neach of these shoes and this is where\nthis running shoe rotation is going to\nget a little bit I don't know about\ncontroversial but it get a little bit\ninteresting and the reason why I'm going\nto kind of play around with it a little\nbit is because when I reviewed the adios\nPro 4 I went through the similar lineup\nkind of conversation and then went\nthrough the I think more traditional\ntake on the Adidas running shoe lineup\nbut let's spice things up a little bit\nespecially because Adidas has so many\ndifferent shoes in its Arsenal I think\none shoe that I could put here here in\nkind of like the max cushion category or\nin the long slow distance category where\nyou just want to be chill and comfy is\ngoing to be the Boston 12 now this isn't\nnormally where the Boston sits normally\nI put the Boston here as kind of a\nsession shoe but the way that the Boston\n12 is built and the way that the Boston\nhas been going for a lot of years is to\nput it more in kind of like this uh\nlonger run time on feet category of shoe\nit's really comfortable for casual wear\nit's really comfortable for long longer\neasy runs it does have some Light Strike\nPro in it and some form of energy rods\nin there so it can pick up the pace a\nlittle bit but for me it doesn't love\npicking up the pace so I'm going to put\nit here in this kind of Max cushion more\ncomfy category of shoe and then in this\nspeed category spot I'm going to put in\nthe adios 8 now normally I would say I\ncan't imagine why you would pick the\nadios 8 over the Tumi sen which is the\nnormal shoe that I put in this spot but\nkeep in mind that these are 202 five\nshoes that we're talking about here the\nEvo SL is coming out in 2025 the adios\nPro 4 is coming out in 2025 each of\nthese shoes won't make it into my 2024\nyear and wrap-up videos and comparison\nvideos because they're 2025 videos so as\na placeholder for now I'm going to put\nin the adios 8 here watch this space for\n2025 cuz I think what they're bringing\nis going to be I don't know if it's\ngoing to be better than the Tumi sen but\nit's certainly going to be in the\nconversation of the Tumi sen for what\nthe next audios is going to be so I'm\ngoing to talk about this here in that\nspeed category when you want to go a\nlittle bit faster than what your daily\ntrainer can do but maybe don't have as\nbig or maybe have a faster workout in\nterms of Paces than what you might do in\nyour Marathon racer and this I think is\nanother very valid way of putting\ntogether an Adidas running shoe lineup\nin 2025\n[Music]\nnow let's wrap up the video by talking\nabout the buying guide and we'll also go\nover some Alternatives that you will\nlikely want to consider the azero Evo SL\nis the best daily trainer in the Adidas\nlineup and it's a really great example\nof how good and versatile Light Strike\nPro can be for people who are looking\nfor their first marathon racing shoe and\ndon't necessarily want to get into\ncarbon this is going to be a really\ngreat choice for people that are looking\nfor an extra cushioned session shoe it's\nalso going to be a really great choice\nand for anyone that just wants to be a\nlittle bit extra and have an all Light\nStrike Pro Mido foam as their daily\ntrainer the Evo SL is going to make you\npretty happy as well this shoe won't be\navailable until 2025 but when it does\nrelease it'll be coming in at\n$150 which yes is a lot of money but I\nreally think that it's quite a bargain\nlet's take a look at some of the\ncompetitor to see what they come in at\nto see where that 150 stack up and the\nfirst shoe that I'm going to talk about\nis the Pegasus plus this is a shoe that\nproudly labels that it has zoomx foam in\nit but anyone who has run in this shoe\nand also run in any other zoomx Racing\nshoes know that they're not exactly the\nsame kind of zumex that's in it now\nwhile I think it's wildly misleading to\nthe consumer to give the same name to\nthe phone that's in the alphafly 3 and\nin the Pegasus plus I think that given\ndifferent names I don't think that\nthere's anything wrong with tinkering\nwith the formula ation of the materials\nin order to achieve a desired effect in\na daily trainer and I do think that this\nis a really great daily training\nexperience it feels very much like a\npegasus and it feels very much like a\npeg turbo as well kind of wrapped into\none splitting the difference in a lot of\nways and each of these shoes would be a\ngreat choice for daily trading or for\nworkouts and sessions the other thing\nabout this shoe is that it comes in\nalmost an ounce heavier and $30 more\nexpensive cuz going to be paying $180 to\nget to the peg plus now the next shoe\nthat I want to talk about and again both\nthese shoes that I'm going to compare to\nthe evos SL are shoes that I really like\nin 2024 uh and the other one is from New\nBalance it's the rebel version 4 this\nagain is using a foam that is called\nfuel cell which is the same name as the\nracing foam that New Balance uses but\nit's a a different formulation than\nwhat's in their race product their race\nproduct has peba in it this is a peba\nEva blend and I think that that's it's a\nsuccessful combination I kind of take\noffense to the fact that they call it\nthe same thing but overall at the end of\nthe day the material that's in here is\nreally nice it's lightweight it squishes\nthe right way it bounces back in the\nright way and it makes for a really\nlightweight fun running experience it's\nabout the same weight as the azero Evo\nSL and I would use these two shoes in a\nlot of very similar ways the big\ndifference for me though in the rebel\nversion 4 and why I might not reach for\nit in as many kind of fart lick workouts\nor even longer Tempo progression runs\nthat I might use the Evo SL for is that\nthere's a lot of width to the bottom of\nthis shoe it's wider at the pads of the\nfeet it's wider underneath the arch and\nit's much wider through the heel and I\nthink what they're trying to do is\nprevent this shoe from getting too\nunstable and so they're trying to\nstabilize it with width which I think\ndoes the job that'll certainly make it\nmore stable but also makes it a little\nbit less Nimble and a little bit less\nexcit exting you're getting a little bit\nof discount though for those trade-offs\nbecause the rebel version 4 comes in at\n$140 so those are my thoughts on the\nazero EO Asel and the competition let me\nknow in the comments if you have any\nother questions or better yet stop by\nthe live stream that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I'll\nwill see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\na\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video no\none's going to get a chance to review\nany of my footage or my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the meta\nspeed Sky Paris after 100 miles and\nlet's start with how I've been using\nthese shoes I've been using these shoes\nfor racing fast workouts and my longest\nrun so for racing I raced the London\nmarathon in them earlier this year I\nreally enjoyed them for that race\nalthough I didn't have the best day it's\nnot something that I can blame on the\nshoes and my fastest run was probably my\nmost recent run which was also other\nthan a quick taper session it was the\nshortest run I did in the shoe which was\na total of 11 miles and I had 400 met\nrepeats to run at about I think they\nwere assigned to be about 5k Pace but\nthe paces I was given made them closer\nto maybe a 3K pace for me and the\nlongest run I ever did in them other\nthan the marathon was a 22m long run and\nI felt like for all three of those use\ncases very fast running very long\nrunning and Marathon racing I felt like\nthe as6 meta speed Sky Paris did really\nwell for me I think the magic of this\nshoe is the foam which gives it the\ncushion and also the responsive that I'm\nlooking for in a racing shoe but it also\ngives it an incredible lightness this is\none of the lightest Racing shoes on the\nmarket today and at a time when shoes\nare still getting bigger and bigger and\nhaving more and more foam keeping a shoe\nlightweight is still really a killer\nfeature now I do think that it's a\nlittle bit more cushioned in terms of\nthe foam than the last version of the\nmetas speed Sky Plus was and I think\nthat makes it a little bit less\naggressive of a shoe which can be good\nor bad depending on exactly what type of\nexperience you're looking for in your\nrace shoes and if I had a half marathon\nor a marathon coming up and I had to\npick between the metas speed Sky Paris\nand the metas speed Sky Plus for me in\nmy preferences I think I might go with\nthe meta speed Sky Plus today although\nthat just might be my sentimentality\ncoming through as I've had really good\nsuccessful race days in The Meta speed\nSky Plus\n[Music]\nnext let's take a look at how the shoe\nhas physically been holding up over the\nlast 100 miles uh and first I want to\nsay that this is race product we're\ntalking about here so it's not going to\nhave the same levels of longevity and\ndurability as what a shoe that you're\nusing as your daily trainer and this is\na trade-off that I think that we're all\nwilling to make when it comes to race or\nPinnacle Performance Products that being\nsaid at least visually it looks like the\nfoam on my metas speed Sky Paris has\ntaken quite a beating especially around\nsome of the edges and in some of the\npainted areas of the mid so foam uh it\ndoes look like there are some gashes and\nbits of scraping that are starting to\nhappen which is frankly a little bit\nmore damage than I typically see for me\nand my race shoes at 100 miles just keep\nin mind that a lot of this wear is\npurely cosmetic a lot of these Foams\ncan't really take on color like\nintrinsically so that color has to be\npainted on and I do think that most of\nthe worst looking damage is just the\npaint That's starting to Chip and wear\naway but I could say that the foam\nitself still feels really good it still\nfeels like there's a lot of life left\ninto it still a great amount of cushion\nstill a great amount of bounceback so\nit's compressing and decompressing\nreally well even at 100 Mil in fact I\nhave closer to 120 Mi now on this\nparticular pair of shoes and I do think\nthat I could get another Marathon out of\nthese if I needed to and after that\nafter about 150 160 mil or so of kind of\nusing these as a race shoe I think I\ncould then kind of relegate them or\ndemote them to being a really great\nworkout shoe in my rotation the one\nthing that I will note though is I think\nthat the shoe is getting slightly\nmushier over time and I think that's the\nbiggest difference between the metas\nspeed Sky Paris and the metas speed Sky\nPlus is that the foam is a little bit\nmore compressed\nand maybe similarly or slightly less\ndecompressive there's less push back\nfrom it and I think as the miles have\nbeen wearing on for the meta speed Sky\nParis I feel like it's becoming even\nmore cushioned and bouncing back with\njust a little bit less pep than I at\nleast than I remember from having a\nfresh pair of shoes but my most recent\nworkout was the fastest workout that I\ndid in the shoe and it still felt great\nfor use in workouts so it's not\nsomething that I think is anywhere near\nits end of life\nas far as the rubber on the out soole\ngoes there is a couple of spots where\nit's wearing down a little bit where\nit's becoming smooth and I'm not really\nconcerned about that amount of wear\nthat's something that I would expect to\nsee after 100 Mil in a Rao something\nthat does concern me though is that\nthere is a bit of wear at the\nintersection of the mids Sole and the\nout soole in a couple of spots on the\nshoe there's a point where the foam is\nfraying away from where the edge of that\noutsole is I think a lot of that happens\nbecause of the way that this foam\ncompresses and decompresses so much but\nit is a potential source of Detachment\nand that is something that concerns me\nas far as the upper goes I think it's\nholding up very well it still looks to\nme like a very fresh shoe as far as the\nupper is concerned and it smells\nsurprisingly not bad so I think that the\nupper is fantastic on the metas speed\nSky Paris it's the best upper that ASX\nhas put on their metas speed series\nshoes\nthat being said it still is a little bit\nof a pinky toe Crusher it's not that the\nlast is squeezing these toes as I'm\nrunning in it there's just something\nabout what's happening with my foot\ninside the shoe that these pinky toes\nare still feeling a little bit of\npressure towards the end of every\nworkout or long run that I put into the\n[Music]\nshoe now before we wrap up the video\nLet's Take a moment to talk about the\nas6 brand more generally and see what a\nrotation would look like if you are a\nmeta speed Sky Paris fan now whenever I\nthink about a running shoe rotation or\napproach a running shoe brand I always\nlike to start with the daily trainer and\nFromm as6 the one that I prefer is the\nNova blast and this is the Nova blast 4\nthis is a shoe that is fun bouncy and\ncushion you can do the bulk of your\ndaily training in and it's got the\ndurability to handle the majority of\nyour weekly runs and this is a really\nfun example of a daily trainer and then\nI think that the meta speed Sky Paris\nwould come in as the racing shoe that\nyou're going to be using to pair along\nwith the Nova blast 4 now this could be\na really fun two shoe rotation in and of\nitself but if you want to add a couple\nmore shoes in or just understand how the\nother A6 shoe in the brand fit in let's\ntalk about some more if you want\nsomething that's a little bit more\ncushioned as a daily trainer maybe you\nneed a little bit more cushion and a\nlittle bit more stability than what the\nNova Blast has then I would take a look\nat the Glide ride Max and this is the\nmax cushion shoe in the A6 lineup that I\nhave been really enjoying it's really\ncomfortable it's really cushioned for\ndays where I just want to be really nice\nto my feet this is the shoe that I would\nbe reaching for and then for your speed\nworkouts where it's something where you\nwant something a little bit faster and a\nlittle bit more kind of purpose-built\nthan the Nova blast 4 and it's kind of\ndoit all nature is built and something\nthat maybe isn't quite as important or\nas big of a as you would reach for your\nrace sto I think that I would look at\nthe magic speed 4 from A6 for that\nexperience it has some daily training\nFoams in it like the Nova blast 4 it has\na little core of race foam in it like\nThe Meta speed Sky Paris and it's got a\ncarbon fiber plate so it's got a little\nbit of both worlds built into it and\nthen if you wanted to go real crazy and\nadd a fifth shoe to this rotation I\nwould look at the super Blast 2 this is\none of my favorite shoes that A6 is\nmaking at the moment it's a bunch of FF\nturbo plus that same foam that's in the\nmeta speed Sky Paris uh but it's got\nalso a little bit of daily training foam\nin it as well and I put it on this side\nof the spectrum because I think of this\nshoe as a really great long run workout\nshoe and what by that what I mean is it\ncan do really easy running and kind of\nreally low and slow relaxed stuff kind\nof like the Glide ride maxwood but it's\nalso really great because of the foam at\npicking up the pace so if you've got a\nlong run with a bunch of Marathon miles\nin there something where you got to pick\nup the pace and do a race type effort\nthe extra comfort and cushion of the\nsuper Blast 2 plus its race day Heritage\nmake it a really fun and fantastic\nchoice now there's certainly a lot of\nAlternatives that you can go through in\nthe A6 lineup A6 has a bunch of shoes\njust like a lot of the other very big\nbrands do that you could Sub in and out\nfor the noble blast 4 you could bring in\nthe cumulus for the Glide ride Max you\ncan bring in the Nimbus and actually for\nme one thing that I would change and not\nsomething that I'm recommending but\nsomething that I personally have been\ndoing uh in this spot for your workout\nor session shoe is to actually reach out\nfor the other Marathon racer from A6 and\nthat's the meta speed Edge I think that\nthe difference in the way that this shoe\nturns over and prioritizes snappy\nturnover and quick bounce back from your\nfootstrike make it a really fun shoe for\nmy fastest of workouts so in reality\nwhile the meta speed Sky Paris is my Rao\nI'm also using it for my big workouts my\nmile repeats my longer threshold efforts\nand then for my faster stuff that's more\ntowards VO2 max that's where I\npersonally as someone that is a sky\nperson that's where I have been reaching\nfor the edge cuz I just feel like it's a\ngreat shoe for like 5K 10K efforts for\nme now I'm not recommending that people\ngo out and buy The Meta speed Edge\nspecifically for that but in reality in\nterms of how I use that shoe this is\nwhere has been fitting in for me\n[Music]\nnow let's wrap up the video by talking\nabout the buying guide and we'll also\nlook at some Alternatives that you'll\nlikely want to consider the metas speed\nSky Paris is one of the lightest Racing\nshoes on the market today and it's a\ngreat combination of cushion and speed\nas6 currently has two different sets of\nmarathon Racing shoes in its lineup\nthough the meta speed Sky Paris and The\nMeta speed Edge Paris and I think those\ntwo shoes are targeted at different\ntypes of Runners depending on the way\nthat your foot hits the ground the way\nthat your legs turn over and basically\njust the sensations that you're looking\nto prioritize in your race product and\nif you like what the meta speed Sky\nParis has to offer I think that at $250\nit is a fantastic price now it is going\nto be hard to get and all the shoes that\nI'm about to talk to you guys about are\ngoing to be difficult to get because\nright now we are at the tail end of fall\nMarathon racing season and it's like\nthat scene in Fast and the Furious when\nthey're looking for their stolen engines\nand they're freaking out because it's\nrace Wars next week and when else are\nyou going to be able to get another pair\nof engines this quickly same thing is\ngoing on for race shoes nevertheless\nlet's take a look at the other shoes\nthat are out there that you're going to\nwant to consider once inventory levels\nget back to normal and the first shoe\nthat I want to talk about is one that I\nrecently just spent a lot of time\ntalking about when I did my Adios Pro 4\nreview now I feel like both Nike and the\nother brand that I'm going to talk about\ntoday have two different types of\nmarathon Racing shoes that are each\ntargeted at again a different type of\nRunner so Nike A6 and the third brand\nthat I'll talk about later in the video\nare all kind of doing the same thing\ninstead of making one and only one type\nof race shoe depending on the different\npreferences of Runners they're making\ndifferent types of race Pinnacle product\nwhich I think is an incredibly good\nthing and a sign of how lucky we are as\nRunners to be running today in 2024 now\nI think that the person that likes the\nmeta speed Sky Paris is probably also\ngoing to like the types of Sensations\nthat are going on in the alphafly I feel\nlike it suits the similar type of Runner\nI think there's a great amount of\ncushion in the alphafly 3 and a good\namount of decompression and bounceback I\npersonally don't love the alphafly 3 as\nmuch as prior iterations of the alphafly\nand I think that a lot of that has to do\nwith the changes that they' made to the\nzoom airpods I think the zoom airpods\nare the real Secret Sauce to the\nalphafly series and I think I don't know\nif it's just a visual trick that's\nhappening to me or what but it seems\nlike they've changed changed the\nposition of the zoom airpods in the\nalpha fly 3 moving them further back or\ncloser to the middle of your arch behind\nthe pads of your feet and I feel like\nthey've also made them smaller than they\nused to be in say the alphafly one and I\nfeel like with the alphafly 1 I was\nLanding the pads of my feet right on\nthose zoom airpods and as those toes\nwere starting to push off and I was\ngetting some leverage off of the pads of\nmy feet that's when the zoom airpods\nwere pushing up against them and giving\nme that really wonderful and seemingly\neffortless bounce that you get from\nalphafly I feel like with the change in\nthe position of the airpods moving more\ntowards the arch of the shoe it feels\nlike I'm kind of missing the airpods and\nit's not doing the same thing it's kind\nof like when you're bouncing off a\ntrampoline and like the timing is not\nright and your knees Buckle a little bit\nI'm kind of getting a very micro\nsensation of that in the alphafly 3\nnevertheless if the alphafly 3 depending\non your foot strike and gate works for\nyou I feel like it's a shoe that's going\nto really work well for you and we've\nseen some of the fastest athletes in the\nworld run with great success in this\nshoe and I think the metas speed Sky\nParis is ultimately trying to Target a\nvery similar type of sensation where\nyou're getting that great amount of\ncushion in the forefoot and then popping\noff pushing up against the pads of the\nfeet so I feel like both of these shoes\nare trying to do very similar things\nalthough they're doing it with very\ndifferent types of Technology if you are\nlooking to get into a pair of alphafly 3\nthere is going to be a premium there\nthough because this shoe comes in at\n$285 $5 now the next brand that I want\nto talk about is puma and they're\nanother brand that has two different\ntypes of Rao again targeting two\ndifferent types of Runners and I feel\nlike Puma is also targeting the same two\ntypes of Runners that both Nike and as6\nare targeting and the shoe that I want\nto talk about today is going to be the\nPuma fast R2 I feel like the Puma fast\nR2 gives you a really nice sense of\ncompression when your foot hits the\nground and that carbon fiber plate I\nfeel is very rigid and you get a really\nstrong push-off sensation as your foot\nleaves the ground into your next stride\nI love the sensation that's going on\nwith the combination of the thick carbon\nfiber plate and the aliphatic TPU foam\nit's probably one of my favorite Foams\nthat it's on the market today uh the\nonly downside to this shoe being that\nit's quite a bit heavier so if the\nlightness of the metas speed Sky Paris\nis one of its biggest benefits the\nheaviness of the fast R2 is one of its\nbiggest weaknesses I still think it's a\nreally fun and fast shoe to run in\ndespite the weight but that's something\nyou definitely want to keep in mind and\nagain it's targeting that really big\namount of compression in the forefoot\nwith a really strong toe off sensation\nthat's happening for those big powerful\nstrides even if the speed or frequency\nof your turnover may suffer just a\nlittle bit just like the other two shoes\nthat I've talked about in this review\nnow the fast R2 also comes in a little\nbit more expensive than the meta speed\nSky Paris the Puma fast R2 comes in at\n$260 so $10 more to get into that one\nand then I think the last shoe that I\nwant to talk about is the shoe that I've\ntalked about a little bit already today\nand that's the meta speed Sky plus it's\nthe last version of The Meta speed now\nfrom what I can tell as6 is still\nselling this shoe on its website and I\ndon't think it's just that they have a\nlot of leftover inventory I think that\nit could be a sign of a very maturing\nrace product Market where it's it's not\nthat each shoe is Leaps and Bounds\nbetter than the previous year shoe but\nnow we're going to have different models\nthat again are focusing very small\nsubsets of preferences and so if you do\nstill like the difference in feeling in\nThe Meta speed Sky Plus or if you want\nthe newer version which has a little bit\nmore cushion to it and prioritizes the\ncompression a little bit more than the\ndecompression then the meta speed Sky\nParis is going to be the option for you\nboth of these shoes come in at $250\nthough so it's going to be the same\nprice for either of the two and like I\nsaid when it comes to raising it might\njust be that I had a really good day in\nthese but I think if I were to race\ntoday of these two shoes I'd pick the\nmeta speed Sky Plus so those are my\nthoughts on the metas speed Sky Paris\nafter 100 miles let me know if in the\ncomments if you have any questions about\nthis shoe or any of the shoes that I\ntalked about today or better yet stop\nwith the live stream I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run clip\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all I for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all all the way to the end of\nthis video hopefully you guys are\nstaying safe out there on your runs and\nI will see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\n[Music]",

include their\nshoe in this video no one's going to get\na chance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the Under Armour infinite\nElite and let's start with the specs\nthis is a at least on paper a 36 mm\nstack heite shoe with an 8 mm drop\ngiving us 28 mm of stack heite in the\nforefoot now this is a very big shoe and\nI I get that like sometimes shoes want\nto make the shoe appear even bigger and\ntaller than it actually is or sometimes\nthey just want to create sidew walls for\nyour foot to kind of sit inside and so\nthe foam comes up higher than what your\nheel or the bottom of your foot actually\nsits on but I think with 36 mm as the\nstated stack height for this sh I think\nthey may be just giving us the number of\nthe foam that's in this shoe and then\nthe actual measure sack I think is\neasily going to be way over 40 mm cuz\nthis shoe is very big now the main thing\nthat's in this shoe or the only thing\nthat's in this midsole is under armour's\nnew hover plus midsole foam material now\nUnder Armour isn't disclosing exactly\nwhat the formulation of hover Plus is or\nat least I don't have that information\navailable to me at this time but it is\none of those beaded Foams that to me\nlooks and feels a lot like the power run\nplus that we used to see in the older\nversions of the S Triumph series and\nvery similar at least in appearance uh\nto what we used to see in Adidas back\nwhen they had just regular boost now to\nprotect all this midsole foam Under\nArmor is applying what they're calling\nthin web Rubber outo and there are some\nexposed areas of foam in the shoe to\nhelp keep some weight down but even\nthough it's called thin web there is a\nvery generous and thick application of\nthat outsole material on the shoe\nespecially in some of the higher wear\nareas there is a lot of rubber on the\nbottom of this shoe moving to the upper\nwe have what Under Armor is calling\ntheir intella knit it looks like a knit\nmaterial and it has the word knit in it\nbut it doesn't exactly feel like a knit\nmaterial it's not as stretchy\nsoft or as comfortable as I would\nnormally think of when I'm thinking\nabout a knit material now there is also\na lot of padding and foam on the tongue\nand around the heel cup and onto this\nAchilles flare to help try and make sure\nthat the fit is accommodating to a wide\nvariety of heel shapes and also to make\nit feel a little bit more luxurious and\nthere is a big TPU heel clip to help\nmake the shoe stay stable all these\nthings add up to quite a bit of weight\nUnder Armour lists this shoe coming in\nat a a chart topping 11.8 o for a usmen\nsize 9 I actually weighed mine and mine\ncame in substantially lighter still\nheavy but it came in half an ounce later\nat 11.3 Oz and 320\nG now that we've talked about what the\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on foot and despite the\nheavy weight of this shoe this under\narour infinite Elite is a very promising\nshoe and it gives me some excitement for\nwhat Under Armour may be able to release\nin the future now it was a bit firm for\na daily training shoe for my preferences\nas someone that loves super squishy shoe\nand I didn't exactly love it when I used\nit for cool down miles after a workout\nso it's not exactly a Max cushion shoe\nfor me either although for my bigger\ntaller friends this may be just right\nbut for me this shoe became most\ninteresting when I was picking up the\npace just a little bit every everything\nin that kind of easy to moderate range\nthat's where this foam really started to\nget exciting so if you've got a run with\nsome light past changes in there this\nshoe is a really fun Cruiser now I\nmentioned earlier that it visually\nreminds me of sakon's power run plus and\nit definitely on foot feels a lot like\nsome of those older versions of power\nrun plus and it even kind of reminds me\nof power run PB or at least some of the\nreally early versions of power run PB\nwhen it was a little bit firmer of a\nformulation overall it kind of reminds\nme a lot of Styrofoam but in a good way\neven when I pick it up and touch\nit it kind of has that styrofoam kind of\nfeel to it and while that might not\nsound the most kind of exciting when you\nare putting just a little bit more into\nthe shoe when you're picking up the pace\na little bit I feel like then the\ncompression and decompression works just\nright for me and it gives me a nice\nsense of Rhythm and bounciness that I'm\nreally enjoying for some of those daily\ntraining runs that might have a little\nbit of spice spilt in to them it's\nunfortunate for me though that the shoe\nis quite heavy cuz otherwise I think\nthat this shoe really could give the\nsuper blast or the Invincible a run for\ntheir money now the other area where I\nfeel like this shoe comes uh quite a bit\nshort is in the upper now I love a good\nknit material and I feel like I'm the\nlast Advocate left out there for\nbringing knit materials back into\nrunning shoes I think they're super\ncomfortable I love to wear them I feel\nlike they're great for a running\nperformance product but it's a material\nthat seems to be going away I appreciate\nthat Under Armour is trying to bring it\nback here but this execution just isn't\nit it's not stretchy like it should be\nit's not comfortable like a knit\nmaterial should be or at least when I\nhear the word knit or if you're going to\nput the word knit into a trademarked\nproduct name and I feel like especially\nvisually speaking there's just a a lot\nleft to be desired with the way that\nthis shoe is executed there's just\nsomething about it that's really frumpy\nthat I'm just not enjoying in terms of\nthe visual aesthetic of the upper it it\nfits reasonably well it's overly padded\nand it's a little bit of a sweat sponge\nfrom a visual perspective and from a\nperformance perspective there's a lot\nmore that could have been done to really\nelevate a shoe that's going to be called\ninfinite Elite but if you're old school\nand are the kind of person that says we\ndon't choose a running shoe by color or\nit doesn't matter what a running shoe\nlooks like then I feel like the Under\nArmour infinite Elite is something you\nshould definitely consider because\nalthough it is a little bit heavy it's a\npretty fun shoe to run\n[Music]\nin now this is normally the part of the\nvideo where I like to take a moment to\nstep back and see where the shoe I'm\nreviewing might fit within a broader\nlineup of shoes within a running shoe\nbrand the only difficulty here is that\nUnder Armour hasn't always been the most\nconsistent when it comes to their\ndedication to the performance running\nspace now I've been running in Under\nArmour shoes for years uh remember one\nof my favorite Under Armour shoes that\nthey've ever made was the CGR hover mid\nit was a midrise winter shoe that had a\nknit material that I actually really\nenjoyed it had like the Bluetooth chip\ninside the heel and it connected to map\nmy run so I was an early adopter of\nUnder Armour performance running and I\nreally like those shoes but I just feel\nlike over the years they didn't really\nchange those shoes very much UnderArmour\nrunning shoes kind of always look the\nsame like UnderArmour running shoes so\nI've kind of lost interest in what they\nhad to offer although this under arour\ninfinite Elite definitely is a big step\nin the right direction and I feel like\nif I were to kind of build an\nUnderArmour running shoe rotation with\nthe product that they have now at least\nthe product that I'm aware of that I've\ntested it would kind of basically be\nbuilt around the Under Armor infinite I\nwould use it for my easy runs my\nrecovery runs even my long runs with\nsome Pace changes in it uh this is the\nshoe that I would use for the most of my\ntraining even more so than in another\nBrand's running shoe lineup for their\ndaily trainer just because there just\naren't as many other Under Armour models\nthat I'm as excited about right now and\nthen the only other shoe in the rotation\nthat I would probably put in would be uh\nThe Rao if you wanted to stay within\nunder arour for your race product as\nwell and this is the under armor flow\nvelocity Elite version 2 it has a great\ntrack record Sharon Leti has won the New\nYork Marathon in it came in fourth in\nthe Paris Olympics in it came second in\nthe Boston Marathon in it so the shoe\nhas quite a pedigree uh but it's a shoe\nthat I haven't exactly loved it has\nbiopbs in it which is a little bit\nfirmer than regular packs but I do\nappreciate the attempt at some\neco-friendliness there and it does have\na carbon fiber plate but it also has\nthis bottom layer of super critical foam\nand in the heel there's quite a a bit of\nit and so I feel like this is a fast\nshoe that some people like Sharon loes\nof the world can run fasten but for me\nit's not really a shoe that I love for\nmarathons it's something that I would\ntake for like 5K 10K racing maybe up to\nthe half marathon but as far as like\nwhat's in the Under Armour lineup now\nthese are kind of the two shoes and you\ncan certainly have a really great time\nrunning with a two shoe rotation and for\nUnder Armour this is what it would look\nlook\nlike now let's wrap up the video by\ngoing over the buy and guide and we'll\nalso talk about some Alternatives that\nyou may want to also consider the Under\nArmour infinite Elite is a pretty good\noption for long runs and for daily\ntraining for my high mileage Runners and\nfor my bigger taller friends this might\nbe the perfect level of cushion for you\nfor your daily training needs and I\nthink if you're an athlete coming over\nfrom a different sport or a team sport\nor a ball sport like a lot of under\narour customers are I feel like this is\ngoing to be a really good option for you\nto get into the running community and at\n$160 I think that the price is very fair\nbut let's take a look at some of the\ncompetition to see what that $160 will\nget you now already in this video we've\ntalked quite a bit about the sakon power\nR plus Foams so let's talk about one of\nmy favorite Power R plus shoes from\nsakon and that's the Triumph and I'm\nlooking specifically at versions 20 and\n21 which were I think pretty much the\nsame shoe maybe just a different upper\nor a slightly changed upper version 22\ngot substantially different it got a\ndifferent foam so that's going to be a\nlittle bit different of an experience\nand I think less similar to what you're\ngetting in the infinite Elite now the\npower on plus is also a beaded foam and\nit looks and feels very similar to what\nwe're getting out of the Under Armour\ninfinite elit hover plus mids foam and I\nfeel like those two shoes can be used\nvery similarly both of these shoes are a\nlittle bit firm for my daily training\npreferences and they're kind of built\nlike Max cushion shoes but I feel like\nonce you start moving in them just a\nlittle bit quicker than easy that's when\nthe shoes start to really come to life\nand that's why I feel like the\ncushioning for me feels at its best the\nTriumph 20 and 21 used to retail at the\nsame price as the Under Armour infinite\nElite at $160 but since the Triumph 21\nhas been around for a while you can find\nit still some places for around $120 and\nI feel like that's something you should\ndefinitely consider and then the other\nshoe that I think we should take a look\nat is the shoe that I always compare the\nTriumph against because it's another\nshoe that has beaded Foams as one of the\nfirst shoes to use beaded Foams that's\nfrom Adidas and that's the ultra boost\nthis is the ultra boost 5x and it's got\na different formulation of boost this\ntime it's got light boost in it which is\na lighter formulation of the regular\nboost material that initially made the\nultra boost line so popular now the\nlight boost material as the name implies\nmakes the foam a little bit lighter but\nI also feel like it's got a little bit\nless rebound to it it's a little softer\nand a little bit mushier which for a\nshoe that's called Ultra boost and is\nkind of in that Max cushion category I\nfeel like that's the right move and\nprogress for that shoe so if you want\nsomething that's a little bit more\ncomfortable looks a lot better and a\nlittle bit more cushioned then I would\nsay go with the ultra boost it is going\nto be at a premium though cuz it comes\nin at\n$180 so those are my thoughts on the\nUnder Armour infinite Elite let me know\nin the comments if you have any other\nquestions or better yet stop by the live\nstream that I do over on the kofuzi Run\nClub Channel Mondays and Thursdays I'd\nlove to see you guys over there in the\nchat that's all I for today everybody\nthanks so much for making all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I will see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]\nn\n[Music]",

The shoe certainly has that aggressive rocker of its bigger sibling, but the difference in foams make the SL version of the Evo a versatile shoe that can handle everything a daily trainer can do and then some. \n.\nI only had a short run with some strides on the calendar, but so far, I\u2019m loving what I\u2019ve experienced. I would like to take it out for a fartlek or other light workout to see how it fares at speed for longer periods. But this very well could be the Peg Turbo or Rebel that I\u2019ve been waiting for. \n.\nTesting continues, and I\u2019m trying not to get ahead of myself after just an hour in the shoe, but I suspect that the Evo SL is going to be challenging a lot top dogs in a variety of categories. \n.\nAlso, it\u2019ll be just $150 \n.\nDisclosures: I received these shoes from Adidas to review.

      "text": "I've been flying all over the world to\nenjoy racing and the running community\nand now it's my turn to play host and\nwelcome everyone to my home turf so it's\ntime to hop on the L and head to the\nloop this is a runner's weekend at the\nChicago marathon\n[Music]\nyo what's going on it is about 2 o'clock\nin the afternoon on a Thursday race\nweekend here in Chicago I'm currently at\nthe Expo which doesn't make sense\nbecause I'm not running for the first\ntime in a long time but I'm here because\nI'm doing something I've never done at\nChicago and that's talk on a panel in\nthe expo hall I'm going to be doing that\nwith Lindsey hind in just a little bit\nI'm early though so let's take a look\ninside and see what the marathon XO has\nto offer this year\n[Music]\nthe packet pickup area looked pretty\nempty very organized Chicago is always\nvery efficient let's see if I can find\nany\nfriends look at look at this\nguy\n[Music]\nW just stopped by the rabbit Booth\nthey're doing some Screen\nPrinting and basically the main thing I\nwant to do is say hi to everybody make\nsure we're all set for the event\ntomorrow and then also take a quick\nphoto so I can put out a reminder that\nthe event is tomorrow for\neveryone and let's see what else is\n[Music]\naround yes of course my new\n[Music]\nfian it's starting to get a little bit\nbusy in\nhere most of the booths are are kind of\nsmall looks like an has a pretty big\n[Music]\nBooth got a little bit of\ntime very thirsty let's find something\nto drink\n[Music]\nguys it's almost time for me to get up\non\nstage I don't\nsee around\nanywhere I'm sure Lindsay will be here\nsomewhere he's got a little bit of time\nI feel like Lindsay's been on stage all\nday today\nmost people watching this already know\nwho Lindsay Hine is but for those who\ndon't Lindsay has her own successful\nrunning podcast and she and I are part\nof a larger group of personalities who\nare on a different podcast called relay\nthis session was supposed to feature a\ncouple additional relay members and we\nwere going to talk about our favorite\nMarathon memories but flights got\nimpacted coming into Chicago so it's\njust Lindsay and me yo what's going on\nLindsay had never actually interviewed\nme before so we dug deep down into the\nkofuzi origin story now panels at Expose\nare always hard because the Acoustics\nare terrible and people are constantly\ncoming in and out but Lindsay is a great\ninterviewer and a good number of people\nstuck around afterwards there was some\nselfie time and Lindsay and the sound\nguy from the Expo could have just been\nbeing nice but they did say that gayen\nRuff was also on a panel earlier in the\nday and more people got in line for\nselfies with me than they did for him\nit's not a contest but that did put a\nlittle feather in my\n[Music]\ncap that is all the\nSelfies Lindsay left she's going to go\nto her hotel she said but I think there\nis a industry like Social Hour happy\nhour so everyone that's at like the Expo\nexhibiting is going to be doing like\nthere's a party I guess so I've never\nheard of that that before so let's check\nthat\n[Music]\nout the Expo is shedding down the bar is\ngetting set\n[Music]\nup started here in 5 minutes the bar is\nnow open though if you would like to\ngrab a drink before we get started\napparently at the end of the first day\nof the Expo there's a little party for\nall the exhibitors the race director for\nthe Chicago marathon says a few words\nabout how many people came through the\nexpo hall that day and he thanks\neveryone for helping make the Chicago\nMarathon Expo a\nsuccess the charity groups are invited\nto and it was a nice surprise to see\nsome friends there and the baa guy who I\nsee everywhere but I've never met was\nit's also there that's it from the XEL\nand the industry Social\nHour the happy hour now we're going to\nget some dinner\n[Music]\nLindsay had made dinner reservations for\na bunch of us and we went to Robert's\nPizza which I had never been to before\nit's in streeterville locals don't ever\nreally eat in streeterville but the food\nwas good and Peter finally made it into\ntown the Ambiance was delightful and it\nwas good to have a quiet dinner with\nfriends before things got really hectic\ngood morning it is currently a little\nbit after 9:00 a.m. on a Friday here in\nChicago this year my Chicago Marathon\ncoverage is going to be different than\nwhat I normally do because normally I\nrun the race this year I'm going to try\nand cover it more like a journalist\nlet's go pick up my media\n[Music]\ncredentials months ago I had applied for\nmedia credentials I was hoping for a\nstarting Corral and finish line access\nis part of my coverage of the American\nPro women specifically at first Chicago\nmarathon was all confused and kept\nasking what Outlet am I from and I told\nthem I'm just a YouTuber but I cover\nraces and sent them links to some of my\nprevious\n[Music]\nwork eventually they came back and said\nI could have some access although not\nbehind the finish line and I felt like\nthat was good enough at least they\ndidn't say no but when I kept getting\nemails about scheduling for the press\nconference and which athletes would be\nin attendance there I thought that my\nlevel of access included being able to\ngo to the press conference but\napparently that was not the case they\nwere really nice about it but they\nweren't allowing me in all right thank\nyou very\nmuch all right guys so I was not allowed\ninto the press conference I have some\ncredentials but my credentials Aren't\nEnough credential to get into the press\nconference on the plus side I found\nPeter hey also rejected from the press\nconference yeah so I feel a little bit\nless Bad Peter didn't get in also P\nAlvarez who shoots really great stuff\nand is here to shoot for A6 also\ncouldn't get to the press conference so\nI feel like I'm in good company is but\nnow we've got some extra time on the\ncalendar so we're going to go check out\ntracki the tracksmith pop pu has been in\nthe same space for several years now and\nwhile part of me wishes they would try\nsomething different the fact that they\nare choosing tradition over novelty is\njust about the most East Coast thing\nthat this New England brand could do\nit's still one of the best opportunities\nyou'll have to touch and feel so much of\nthe tracksmith catalog in one place at\none time and their Marathon Majors merch\nis always topnotch plus they had\ntracksmith bananas\n[Music]\nall right that's it from the tracksmith\npopup it's always so dark in there it's\nhard to really photograph but they\nalways do such a nice\njob now let's head over to\n[Music]\nbandit in contrast to the tradition of\ntracksmith bandit has reinvented itself\nevery year in Chicago this year's theme\nwas Architects Studio which works well\nfor a city that has had to rebuild\nitself from literal ashes and whose\nArchitects were charged with the Mantra\nmake no small\nplans it took us over an hour to get\ninto the space but the time passed\nquickly I was in line with friends and I\nkept bumping into other people I knew\nthis line for Bandit is super long never\nseen anything like\n[Music]\nthis hey how's it going camera good to\nsee you again man how are you yeah I'm\ndoing good good to see you\n[Music]\nyeah once inside the space delivered on\nthe architect's theme race product was\nflying off the shelves and there was\ncoffee and going back to that\narchitect's Mantra the full quote from\nDaniel Burnham goes like this make no\nsmall plans for they have no magic to\nstir men's blood and probably the eles\nwill not be\nrealized I've always thought that this\nwas a good quote for both Architects and\nRunners left the Bandit popup it was a\nreally long wait but very well done in\nthere they\nalways have such a great takes on what\nmodern retail should look like it's\namazing uh Peter's going to head back to\nthe Expo I don't know what he's doing\nthere but he's got to go back suggested\nhe take a divy bike uh and now\nI think I have enough\ntime to go for a run so I'm going to\nstop on my car change real quick and\nthen hit the L from cuz I haven't done\nthat in a long\ntime before we moved out to the far\nsuburbs a couple years ago I used to run\nthese routes every day and I've been\nback since but for some reason on this\nparticular run I was feeling nostalgic\nthe old shoes that I really love testing\nhere the frustrations of low heart rate\ntraining and the Relentless windiness of\nWinter the memories all came flooding\nback today and for a moment I wondered\nif maybe perhaps the pavement remembered\nme too it didn't feel like it did and\nwhile I was feeling suddenly very lonely\nit was overall good to turn the legs\nover and enjoy the Run\nhalfway into the run about 3 and 1 half\nmiles from\ndowntown sure do\n[Music]\nmiss now I've been thinking about the\npress conference thing all morning and I\nwas kind of sour about it but before any\nanyone gets all mad at Chicago marathon\num I do want to say that they did turn a\nlot of people away from the press\nconference like hoe uh kzy couldn't get\nin there um I think they ultimately let\nhim in but he forgot his like\ncredentials up in his hotel room and\nwhen he didn't have them they wouldn't\nlet him in so I mean they were pretty\nstrict about who they were letting into\nthe press conference um\nbut I'm not sure but I think that when I\nrequested media credentials\nI only requested like start line and\nfinish line access I don't know if I had\nto specifically state that I wanted\naccess to the press conference or\nnot if that's the case and I didn't then\nthat's on me but I'm not sure I don't\nremember\nanyway I thought that the uh ShakeOut\nrun was like kind of far and I thought I\nmight have to move my car but it's\nactually just up the street so I'm going\nto leave my car here and head over\n[Music]\nthe first ShakeOut run that I would be\nhosting for Chicago marathon weekend was\nat industry ALS it's a pretty new spot\nin Chicago and it was gorgeous on the\ninside rabbit was there to support the\nkafui Run club by letting us demo their\nnew Dreamchaser shoe and most\nimportantly they provided a space for us\nall to\n[Music]\nmeet oh\non I love it I love it\nawesome after we put on some new shoes\nand chatted for a bit rabbit Sam\nwelcomed everyone and explained the\nroute and then we were off for a sunset\nrun\nyo all right thank you guys thank\nyou the route took us over to the\nlakefront and over to the Planetarium at\nthe turnaround point we waited for the\nentire group to assemble and then of\ncourse we took a selfie we are a mile\nand a half into the\nRun got beautiful sunset Chicago is\nreally treating us\ntoday fun fact this is where my wife and\nI took our wedding photos about 17 years\nprior we then took the same route back\nto Industry ALS and headed to the\nupstairs bar for some rehydration with a\nspecial rabbit 26.2 Brew there was food\nrabbit raffled off a bunch of prizes and\nthe atmosphere was perfect for a Friday\n[Music]\n[Music]\nnight good morning everybody it is 8:15\nin the morning in Chicago on a\nSaturday the day before the marathon So\ntoday we're going on a ShakeOut run\nlet's go meet in Lincoln Park find\neveryone at as6 and\n[Music]\nFleet for coming pretty much from the\nmoment I got to the a6m Fleet Feet event\non Saturday morning I was sworn for\nselfies this was incredibly flattering\nand I'm always honored to do it it means\nso much to me that on the day before\nyour marathons you all would wait in\nline just to spend a moment with with me\nI love hearing about how far you've come\nto get where you are what your goals are\nfor the race and I'm always happy to\ngive tips for Chicago marathon or for\nyour cheer squad to get around the city\nbut at a certain point after all the A6\ndemo shoes were handed out Fleet feed\nmade sure that I got everyone together\nfor our group photo before we headed out\nfor the run all right welcome\n[Music]\n[Applause]\neverybody there's a lot of people here\nif it's your first Mar thought tomorrow\nraise your\nhand\nawesome a lot of you guys have been\nasking me for one piece of advice and\nthe one thing that I'll tell you is\neverything you need to do tomorrow you\nalready have within you to do tomorrow\nyou're going to be able to do it you've\nalready put in the work you guys are\nready go out there and enjoy those\n[Applause]\n26.2 you guys ready yeah\nyo and then we were off Fleet Fe\nprovided the Pacers to lead out multiple\ngroups and we went North along the\nlakefront what's going on man good to\nsee you how are you thanks for\ncoming it was a bit windy which made the\nwaters choppy and it was like Chicago\nwas saying yesterday was about the\nskyline and to today is about the Great\nLake guys we've hit the turnaround point\nwe got 1.7\nmiles we're going to head back let have\nT-shirts pancakes and\ncelf when we got back to Lincoln Park\nas6 and Fleet Feet provided pre-race\npancakes and syrup my apologies to all\nthe Canadians who attended for the\ncaliber of our maple syrup we do the\nbest we can on this side of the border\nand the shirts that as6 made for the\nkafui Run Club this year were incredible\nas6 has been making kafui run Club\nshirts for the Chicago ShakeOut every\nyear and every year it's one of my\nfavorite things that I get to be a part\nof a couple notes about the t-shirts\nthough I know some of you didn't get a\nshirt even though you had a confirmed\nRSVP and that the distribution setup\nbenefits the fastest Runners I'm aware\nof the issue and I will try to figure\nout something different for next year\nalso I don't know know why the shirts\nsay 2025 I did approve the final\ngraphics and I don't recall there being\nany year on the shirt at all but it's\nalmost 100% certain that I didn't catch\nthe error so that one's on me last thing\nI want to say about the event is thank\nyou to chase Fleming my videographer for\nthe weekend he not only helped me\nprovide footage from this event but he\nalso helped film The Rabbit event the\nnight before and also some key moments\nfrom the marathon itself this entire\nvideo just wouldn't be the same without\nhis contribution and I'll be working\nwith him again in New York so if you see\nhim make sure to say\nhi all right\nguys ran all the miles took all the\nSelfies I did not eat any of the\npancakes though I didn't have time for\nthat but hopefully you guys enjoyed the\nbreakfast now Chase and I we're going to\ngo check out the on\n[Music]\nstore an did team up with a local\nBrewery and run club for a Chicago\npresence this year but I had scheduling\nconflicts for a lot of those events so\ninstead Chase and I went to check out\ntheir new permanent location near Rush\nand Division which is the exact right\nlocation for an on store if you know\nChicago the store was pristine and I\nlove the slide out shoe shelves there\nwere a lot of shoes that I had not ever\nseen before and while some were pretty\nexciting that excitement is tempered by\nthe fact that I often can't tell if if\nan on shoe is a running shoe or just run\ninspired the apparel though was crisp\nand neat on has always excelled in the\napparel and accessories Department\neverything they make is just so\n[Music]\ngood finished checking out the on store\nhas a nice new permanent space there I\nlove the way that they do\nretail I then dropped off chase at his\nhotel think we might be meeting up for\ndinner later we'll see what his schedule\nends up being like but I've got a little\nbit of extra time\ntoday I wasn't sure if I was going to\nmake it but now I'm glad that I am going\nto be able to make it to the Pioneers\n[Music]\nP Pioneers is a blackowned running\napparel brand that Tommy runs first put\nme on to a couple years ago since then\nI've had a chance to meet the founder\nSid Baptista and see the company grow\nwith popups in Boston and New York and\nnow I was excited to see what Sid and\nteam had brought to\n[Music]\nChicago the space looked amazing\nPioneers has recently announced a formal\npartnership with Brooks so there was\nglycerin Max and water bottles\ndecorating the space and the pioneer and\nGRC run Club collab merch looked\nincredible the whole thing was in the\ndrip Collective space I did get a coffee\nwhile I was there I drank it at the\ncounter and it was a welcome moment of\ncalm and an otherwise frenetic weekend\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nall right I had a delicious coffee in\nthere and just sat for a minute kind of\nzoned out on my phone for a little while\nand had a chance to kind of recover\nwhich was much needed the space in there\nis awesome hopefully you had a chance to\ncheck it out you're in\nChicago um man I'm I'm just so happy for\nSid and for years uh to making such\ngreat\nprogress now I just heard from Ali\nFeller she told me she can get me on the\nlist for her live show today which I\nwasn't sure if I'd be able to go or not\ncuz I can never RSVP fast enough to get\na ticket for any of her live shows so\nI'm happy to get on the list it's not\ntill 4: so I've got a little bit of time\nI think I might be able to squeeze in a\nlittle bit of an extra run\nanybody who I'm\nanybody anybody who I'm anybody who I'm\nanybody all right guys just hit the\nthree mile Mark going to turn it around\nhead back get ready for the live\nshow after changing quickly at my car I\ngot to the alley on the Run live show\nabout 30 minutes early and even then the\nline to get in was around the block\nsince I didn't exactly have a ticket to\nthis show though I kind of hid towards\nthe back of the space once I got in and\nwatched as everyone eagerly rushed in to\nget a seat near the\nstage fun fact after I had gotten denied\nat the press conference the day prior I\nhad bumped into alley on my way out of\nthe athlete Hotel I was feeling pretty\nbummed about the situation and Ally was\nnice enough to buy me a coffee to cheer\nme up and while we were talking I had\nmentioned that at least I had got a\nchance to see Emily sis that morning\nwalking back to the hotel after an early\nrun and although I've seen her race many\ntimes I'd never actually had the chance\nto say hello but Emily appeared to be on\nthe phone at the time so I didn't bother\nher for a photo that's when Ally said\nthat I should just come to the live show\nsince Emily Sison was going to be the\nguest so this was a real treat for me\nthanks Ally for the invite\n[Music]\nthat was a lot of fun in there I hate to\nleave early I wanted to save for the\nwhole time thanks Ellie for making sure\nthat I could attend today uh it was\nsuper fun but I have dinner plans as\nwell so we going to hop back in the car\nand pick up Tommy we're going to get\nsome pizza and poly\ncheese Tommy had asked me a while ago if\nwe could go to dinner the Night Before\nthe Race he knows that I know he's vegan\nand as a local I'd know a good\nspot I picked paully G's cuz I like the\npizza there they have a vast menu of\nvegan and vegetarian offerings and\nbecause it was in Wicker Park and not in\nthe loop or streeterville it wouldn't be\nslammed with other marathoners looking\nto carb up we went there with Tommy's\nfriend Dante who was running her first\nChicago on a Nike bib like Tommy was and\nI'd like to think it was a nice low-key\ndinner for the night before a race\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right the athletes are\noff it's time to get into position\n[Music]\nall right guys they are off

wait it's\ntime to lace up the adios pro4 and take\nit for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm an not only Runner reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the adios\nPro 4 but before I give you my thoughts\non this shoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nAdidas sent to me for the purpose of\nreview so I didn't have to pay for these\nshoes however no one's paying me to make\nthis video or to include their shoe in\nthis video no one knows which other\nshoes I'm going to include in this video\nand no one's going to get a chance to\npreview any of my footage or my thoughts\nbefore you guys get a chance to see this\nvideo on YouTube so with that disclosure\nout of the way let's talk about the\nadios Pro 4 and let's start with the\nspecs this is a 39 mm stack heite shoe\nwith a 6 mm drop giving us 33 mm of\nStack height in the 4 foot and in this\nshoe we have two components the first is\nLight Strike Pro and the second is the\nenergy rods 2.0 now as far as the Light\nStrike Pro goes it's the same name that\nthey're using for the foam that goes in\nthis shoe that they used for last year's\nadios Pro 3 but it's a different\nformulation of foam than what's in the\nadios Pro 3 it's also different than the\nsimilarly named Light Strike Pro foam\nthat's in the adios Pro Evo one so now\nwe have three different Foams from\nAdidas they are all labeled Light Strike\nPro but they're all very different as\nfar as the energy rods are concerned\nthough I believe that energy rods 2.0\nare the same energy rods that were used\nboth in the adios Pro 3 and in the Evo\none so there isn't to much different\ngoing on there but those energy rods are\nintended to serve a function that's very\nsimilar to what a carbon fiber plate\nwould do in a marathon racing shoe now\nto protect all this foam and energy rods\nwe have light traction on the outsole as\nwell as a little island of Continental\nrubber now the light traction portion is\nthe rubber that used to be almost kind\nof clear that's on this shoe here now\nit's a little bit stained and dirty from\nthe miles that I put on this shoe and\nthen the Continental is this colored\npiece of rubber right here right\nunderneath kind of where the big toe\nwould be now Adidas tells me and I don't\nknow if they were supposed to tell me\nthis or if I'm supposed to be telling\nyou but I'm going to tell it to you\nanyway now Adidas tells me that the\nrubbers that they have been developing\nthe rubber compound that they've been\ndeveloping for the outsoles of their\nracing product have similar\ncharacteristics in terms of traction and\ndurability as the Continental product\nbut they tell me that their Elite\nathletes as well as their customers\nreally enjoy seeing that Continental\nco-branding that's on the outo there so\nthat's why they've maintained certain\naspects of content to rubber on their\nshoes I'm not positive that's the only\nreason why there's a small section of\ncontent rubber on the adios Pro 4 but I\ndo know that that is the case for the\nrubber compound that they made for the\nadios Pro Evo one even though there are\nsome Elite athletes that prefer to have\na more traditional Continental rubber\nouto on their Evo ones moving to the\nupper we have a new oper for this year\nas well it's Adidas's light lock\nmaterial it looks very similar in terms\nof the Aesthetics and the design of the\nevo1 but the materials are quite\ndifferent if we look at the Evo one's\nupper it's almost seethrough and Adidas\ntells me that that transparency or near\ntransparency is a met4 for the absolute\nlightness of the shoe with the light\nlock we're getting kind of a rip stop\ntype of material material with a diamond\npattern through here but it's still very\nlightweight although it's not the most\nbreathable of materials overall it kind\nof feels like kind of like a fabcy paper\nalmost like currency like like money and\none of the things that I really\nappreciate about the tongue on this shoe\nis that they've kind of taken a lot of\nthe similar materials that they used in\nthe tongue of the adios Pro 3 and made\nit in the shape of the tongue on the EVO\nOne although they did make it a little\nbit bigger so it's a bit easier to get\nyour foot into the shoe and it's also a\nlot easier to get the tongue settled as\nyou're lacing down and cinching\neverything up there's a little bit of\nbumper pads around the back of the heel\nin fact there's a little bit more I\nthink in the adios Pro 4 than have been\nin some of the previous shoes like the\nEVO One and the adios Pro 3 but all\nthese are intended to make the shoe a\nlittle bit more comfortable and help\nkeep your heel in place I did feel like\ngetting a really good lock down in the\nheel was a little bit difficult and took\na little a little bit of effort and I\nthink for some of you who kind of\nconstantly have problems with heel lock\ndown this one still might not quite be\nprecise enough for your liking otherwise\nI felt like in terms of fit goes this\nshoe was true to size for me I went with\nmy usual running shoe size 9 and I felt\nlike that was the perfect size altoe\nthis shoe comes in at a very lightweight\nAdidas says that this shoe should come\nin at around 200 g for a reference size\nI do happen to be reference size US\nmen's signs 9 mine came a little bit\nheavier than that 206 G and 7.2\n[Music]\nOz now that we've talked about what this\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat the shoe is like on foot I'm\nabsolutely loving the updates to the\nadios Pro 4 it feels like a lighter shoe\nthat allows for quicker turnover there's\na great amount of compression in the\nfoam and I'm liking the updates to this\nnew Light Strike Pro not only is the\nfoam lighter but I also feel like it's\ncompressing a little bit more while\nstill retaining a really great amount of\nthe responsiveness and bounciness that\nlight strike pro has always been known\nfor running in the two shoes kind of\nlike in series one after another I find\nthat I'm gravitating towards the foam\nthat's in the adios Pro 4 and every time\nI go from adios Pro 4 back to adios Pro\n3 the adios Pro 3 almost feels firm for\nme and what my foot and stride ER I'm\ndefinitely enjoying the response that\nI'm getting back in terms of compression\nand decompression from the Light Strike\nPro in the adios Pro 4 now there's some\nchanges to the geometry of the shoe that\nI think make for some improvements in\nthe shoe and the first kind of way that\nthe geometry is different is that\nthey've kind of made the adios Prof for\na little bit narrower it at the front of\nthe shoe and that's something that I\nappreciate because we've seen a trend in\nthe last year or maybe more where every\nshoe seems to be getting wider in in the\nhopes of making that shoe a little bit\nmore stable without having to add a ton\nof stability elements and that's even\ninfiltrated into some of our race\nproduct that we see on the market today\nnow I don't necessarily think that's\nwhat was going on with the adios Pro 3\nuh I think that this is wide in the\nforfeit because they were trying to make\nthis kind of like gigantic almost\ncircular landing pad for you to be able\nto hit the ground and push off on now in\nthis year's version they have kind of\nnarrowed that a little bit it's still\nreally wide almost kind of like at that\nbase of the pad under your pinky toe but\nthen it kind of flares in a little bit\nmore aggressively but it does make the\nshoe narrower as you are Towing off and\nI feel like what that does is it makes\nthe shoe feel a little bit more Nimble\nnow the other way in which that the\ngeometry is changed is that they moved\nwhere the rocker starts on this shoe now\nthey've adopted at least what they say\non paper is a 60% rocker position and\nbut what they mean by that is as you go\nthrough the 100% length of the shoe The\nRocker starts at the 60% position I'm\nI'm not positive on it but I believe\nwith the aios Pro 3 The Rocker didn't\nstart or this curl on the shoe didn't\nstart till 70% into the shoe now the\nthing that they say is that the 60%\nnumber is pulled directly from the Evo\none I'm not sure if it kind of actually\nis or if it just is because there's a\nbevel over on this part of the shoe but\nthe main rocker starts maybe at 65 % in\neither it feels earlier than it did in\nthe I Pro 3 but it doesn't feel quite as\nearly as in the EVO One But at the end\nof the day I do feel the change and I\nappreciate wherever this number actually\nis I like the position where it is on\nthe adios pro4 I feel like on the EVO\nOne The Rocker starts maybe just a\nlittle bit too early at least for a non-\nelite Runner like me now when it comes\nto sizing and Fit I feel like the adios\nPro 3 has the most generous fit and it\nalso has some of those similar problems\nwhere the heel can be a little bit\nfinicky to lock down especially with the\nthin laces that Adas is using they\naren't very grippy at all so it's hard\nto kind of like selectively apply\npressure in different areas of the shoes\ndepending on where you might need it on\nthe other hand even though there is the\nsame slippery laces in the evo1 I feel\nlike that upper is just a lot more snug\non the foot and so it's a lot harder to\nget in the shoe when you're in it the\nmaterial wraps on to your foot a little\nbit more tightly and it feels like\nthere's just a little bit less room in\nthere I don't think that the size is\nwrong I think that's just the cut and\nfit that they're looking for the adios\nPro 4 sits in between those two where it\nhas a little bit less room than the\nadios Pro 3 and a little bit more room\nthan the EVO\n[Music]\nOne now before we wrap the video Let's\nzoom out for a moment and see where the\nadios Pro 4 fits Within an Adidas lineup\nand while there are a lot of different\nkinds of shoes that Adidas makes and\nthose all cater to different preferences\nlet's build a lineup that I would enjoy\nand I think someone who's enjoying the\nadios Pro 4 would also enjoy and so\nwhenever I talk about shoes and a\nrotation I always like to start with the\ndaily trainer and for Adidas right now I\nthink the best one is the Azo SL it's\nthe shoe that you're going to run a lot\nof daily training miles in and this\none's really great for it because it\ndoes have Light Strike Pro Different\nLight Strike Pro that's what in the\naudio Pro 4 but a Light Strike Pro foam\nwhich is really nice and then it has a\nmore daily training foam as a carrier\naround that core of foam but it's great\nto log those everyday miles and it's got\nplenty of durability built into it and\nthen where the adios Pro 4 would fit in\nis as the racing shoe that you would\nreach for on race day uh so this is for\nyour biggest workouts your races uh this\nis the shoe that you're going to really\nenjoy now for your recovery runs and for\nruns that are going to be a little bit\nmore chill and relax in what you want\nfor your daily trainer there's a couple\nof options out there but right now let's\ntalk about the ultra boost 5 and the\nultra boost 5x the difference between\nthose two models is that one has a cage\nover here that kind of uh plastic piece\nthat gives you a little bit more support\nI prefer the one that doesn't have the\nplastic cage on it and I'm going to put\nthat over here cuz it's for days where\nyou want to be a little bit more relaxed\nyou're not worried as much about pace\nyou're wored a little bit more about\njust pampering yourself now if you have\nworkouts that are going to be a little\nbit faster than what might need for your\ndaily trainer and maybe not quite as big\nor maybe not quite as long uh as what\nyou're going to use for your Marathon\nracer that's where I think a shoe like\nthe tkumi senent comes into play the\nTumi sent has been penally one of my\nfavorite shoes that Adidas makes every\nyear uh and this one is really great for\n5K 10K racing and any of those faster\nworkouts anything that's faster than you\nmight want to use for a marathon Racing\ntype of shoe and then if you really want\nto go crazy and add a fifth shoe to this\nlineup that's s a shoe like the prime X\nX2 strong can come in this is a shoe\nthat has two layers of carbon fiber\nplates and Light Strike Pro all\nthroughout the shoe although again a\nDifferent Light Strike Pro than what's\nin the adios Pro 4 and this is a really\nfun shoe for long runs if you're going\nto be putting some speed into those long\nruns so it is a jumbo shoe but it's not\nexactly like a MX cushion super relaxed\nplush shoe uh it is comfortable but it's\nreally designed for those times where\nyou're going to be in your shoes for a\nlong time and but still want a little\nbit of extra oomph to it because you're\ngoing to be putting in either marathon\npace miles or uptempo miles that are\nfaster than just easy and certainly\nfaster than recovery and so this would\nbe kind of like the five shoes that I\nthink right now make a lot of sense\ntogether as an Adidas running\n[Music]\nlineup now let's wrap up the video by\ntalking about the buying guide and we'll\nalso talk about some Alternatives that\nyou're likely already considering the\nAdidas adios Pro 4 is a lighter and\nfaster shoe I think it's a really great\nblend of its predecessor and also the\nEVO One I feel like it takes really\ngreat aspects of each of the shoes to\nmake a great product that I think Pros\nare going to enjoy but I think that non-\nElites especially are going to really\ngravitate towards it'll be on sale in\nJanuary of 2025 for\n$250 and that's quite a bit of time away\nso let's take a look at some of those\nAlternatives that are available now and\nI'm using air quotes because we're\nhalfway through or more than halfway\nthrough fall Marathon season so while\nthey're technically on the market they\nmay be a little bit difficult to find\nbut in either event let's talk about\nsome of that competition I mean I feel\nlike the first two shoes that I need to\ntalk about are the shoes we've already\nbeen talking about this entire video and\nthat's going to be either the EVO One or\nthe adios Pro 3 these are two shoes that\nare currently available although I'm not\nreally recommending the EVO One and the\nmain reason for that is that it's a $500\nshoe that doesn't really have the\ndurability that I would want for a shoe\nthat I'm going to recommend to you guys\nto spend\n$500 on and I do think that's it's\nprobably the closest thing to the adios\nPro 4 but for most people the\nalternative that I'm really going to be\nrecommending is the adios Pro 3 this is\na shoe that's been available for about 2\nyears at this point at the time this\nvideo was shot and you can find it\nusually for $250 at the full price for\nsome of the latest colors or you might\nbe able to find it at a discount for\nsome of the other colors that are\navailable it's still a really great shoe\nnow that I running the adios Pro 4 the\nadios Pro 3 has lost a little bit of its\nshine but until you run in the adios Pro\n4 if you haven't done it yet the adios\nPro 3 is probably going to be the racing\nshoe from Adidas that I'm going to be\nrecommending to people if you are part\nof that three stripes life but now let's\ntake a look at the one shoe from another\nbrand that I'll talk about today that I\nthink doesn't really feel the same but I\nknow a lot of you guys are going to be\nthinking about and that's from the\nswoosh and this is the alphafly version\n3 currently I think it's fair to say\nthat this is the fastest shoe in the\nworld at least when it comes to Marathon\nbecause this shoe is the shoe that\nKelvin Kipton ran the men's World\nMarathon record in and it's the same\nshoe that Ruth chapen Getti ran the\nwomen's world record marathon in just a\ncouple weeks ago in Chicago in fact both\nof those records were set on the streets\nof the Chicago in this shoe now the\ndifferences between these shoe are\nsubstantial in comparison to the fit of\nthe adios Pro 4 the fit on the alpy 3 is\ngenerous if not almost baggy which is a\nweird thing to say about an alpha 5 3\ncuz the alpha 5 typically every year\nhave been a bit of a toe cruncher this\none the fit is much more accommodating\nthe one thing that I will say though is\nwhile I do love a really good knit\nmaterial and this is really good racing\nknit material the edges of of this shoe\nare very harsh so if you like to wear\nlow socks and you're old like I am uh\nyou're going to have to be careful\nbecause uh anytime it does touch your\nbare skin it's going to make you bleed a\nbit of your old blood but in terms of\nthe real Essences of these shoes let's\ntalk about the midsoles and the midsole\nTechnologies I feel like the Zoom\nairpods that are in the alphafly 3 feel\nvery different in comparison it almost\nfeels a bit clunky and a bit harsh when\nyou're landing on those foot pads it\nkind of reminded me of like when you're\nrunning across a kind of like a plywood\nsubfloor where there's like a bounce to\nit and it's noisy uh those are the kind\nof two things that I felt when I was\nrunning in the alpha 5 3 most recently\nI'm not really sure what the exact right\nword for it is that it's kind of feels\nrickety in in comparison to the\nsmoothness that I'm feeling out of the\nadios Pro 4 but then on the other hand\nlike the noise aside the ritin aside and\nkind of that almost mechanical feeling\nthat I get from the zoom airpods that\nare in here I feel like there's still an\nefficiency to the shoe that can't be\ndenied I feel like it's a really great\nset it and forget it kind of shoe it\nknows how to find what your Marathon\nlevel effort is and it helps you just\nrun in that for mile after mile after\nMile and it's an excellent racing shoe\nit just feels very different than what\nyou're getting in the adios Pro 4 but to\nthe Alpha's credit even though it feels\nlike it's a heavier shoe and the adios\nPro 4 feels like it's a much lighter\nshoe the alha 5 3 only comes in 2/10 of\nan ounce heavier at 7.4 oun so it's also\na very lightweight and efficient shoe so\ndepending on what you like I think\nthat's going to help you decide which\none is the best for you and I think\nthat's something that's going to be a\ntheme for all of the super shoes that\nare reviewing in 2024 into 2025 we're at\na point where it's not just one brand\nhaving one great product that's way\nbetter than everything else many brands\nhave a good race product if not multiple\nreally good race product and which one\nis the best is really going to depend on\nwho's doing the running in them it's\nabout matching the right Runner with the\nright tool so those are my thoughts on\nthe adios Pro 4 let me know in the\ncomments if you any questions about this\nshoe or any of the shoes that I talked\nabout today or better yet stop by the\nlive stream that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run cpub\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking it all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]",

I don\u2019t get a feeling of extra sponginess or extra plushness (the regular Supernova Rise is plenty plush as it is), but the shoe is just more pleasant to run in for longer distances. It\u2019s still not quite a max cushion shoe, imo. There\u2019s just a bit more foam under the forefoot, which improves the experience. \n.\nDisclosures: Adidas provided the shoes. They are not paying me to make this video. No one previewed this video before it published. I made it in the car on the way to my daughter\u2019s cross country meet and uploaded it from the highway. \n.\nHat: Terrex. I have received product from this brand, although I bought this particular hat. \nShirt, socks, and half tights: adidas. I have done paid public appearance work with this brand and have received product from this brand, but I did happen to buy the shirt. \nSunglasses: goodr. I have received product from this brand. \n.\n#runningshoes",

      "text": "when it comes to running shoes softness\nis a deceptively complex feature and\npreviously Brooks's take on softness for\nme personally always felt uncomfortably\nfirm but this is the new glycerin Max\nwith its new foam and bold design will\nthis be the max cushion Brooks that I've\nalways been wanting it's time to lace up\nthe glycerin Max and take it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non Elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\nallnew Brooks Glycerin Max but before I\ngive you my thoughts on this shoe I do\nwant to go over some disclosures this is\na pair of shoes that Fleet Feet sent to\nme for the purpose of review so I did\nnot have to pay for these shoes however\nnobody's paying me to make this video or\nto include their shoe in this video and\nno one's going to get a chance to\npreview any of my footage or my thoughts\nbefore you guys get a chance to see this\nvideo on YouTube so with that disclosure\nout of the way let's talk about the\nBrooks Glycerin Max and let's start with\nthe specs this is a tall shoe 45 mm of\ntotal stack height in the heel with a 6\nmm drop giving you 39 mm of Stack height\nin the 4 foot and the main story for\nthis shoe at least for me is that\nthey're using an all new foam in this\nshoe Brooks calls this foam DNA tuned\nit's a Nitro based foam which means\nthey're using nitrogen gas is part of\nthe manufacturing process and it's kind\nof a two foam system in a way it seems\nto me like it's all kind of like one\npiece of foam but there are two\ndifferent size cells that they're using\nin the foam itself and by cells there're\nusing little beads of material Source\nmaterial compressing it and heating it\nup to a very high level and then\ninjecting the gas in it and that makes\nbubbles and then they're using larger\ncells or larger bubbles in the heel of\nthe shoe and then smaller bubbles in the\nforefoot and Brooks tells me that the\nreason for that is that the larger cell\nfoam gives them more cushiness more\nsoftness and then the smaller cell foam\nis more tightly compressed and packed\ntogether and so that's going to give you\na little bit more sense of Bounce and I\nthink there's two main things that are\nnotable about this one is that I'm\nexcited when ever Brooks experiments\nwith new Foams they're notoriously a\nlittle bit reluctant or conservative\nwhen it comes to experimenting with\ntheir shoes especially for a storyed\nline from Brooks like the glycerin and\nthat's why I think there's this glycerin\nMax which is an offshoot that lets them\nplay around a little bit more but the\nother thing that's notable about this is\nthat it switches the Paradigm that\nBrooks typically uses in their shoes so\nlike at least in older shoes like the\nshoes that I first started testing in\nBrooks which would have been like the\nBrooks ghost 10 several years years ago\nthey flipped it around where the firmer\nfoam was in the heel and the softer foam\nwas in the forefoot and the idea being\nwhen you come crashing down on that heel\nthey needed that part of the shoe to be\nfirmer so they could better absorb the\nfull force of your foot and body hitting\nthe ground and then inevitably because\nof that 12 mm drop when your foot\nslapped down you needed to have a soft\nmaterial to absorb the impact from that\nHeel To Toe slapping that a 12 mm drop\ncan create for some people like it did\nfor me now it's reversed where the\nsofter foam is in the heel so you have a\nsofter Landing if you are a heel Striker\nand then as you're rolling forward\nyou're bouncing and pushing off of a\nmore responsive foam and that whole\nmotion is aided by what Brooks calls its\nGlide roll rocker geometry in other\nwords the front of the shoe is carved a\nlittle bit so that way it helps you roll\nforward and this large stack height is a\nlittle bit easier for your foot to\nmanage now to protect all this fo Brooks\nhas put a bunch of rubber on the outsole\nit's not full coverage rubber outsole so\nwe're not looking at some of those old\nBrooks ghost 10 uh there is some exposed\nfoam in here to help shed weight and\nmake it easier for this foam to bend and\nsquish uh but also there is plenty of\nrubber where there is rubber on the shoe\nso not only do I think that this foam\nbased on the way they've made it is\ngoing to last a long time I think this\nrubber is also going to give you plenty\nof grip for a long time as well moving\nto the upper I think that the design on\nthis shoe is fantastic and the upper is\nvery comfortable as Brooks uppers always\ntend to be we're using a pretty standard\nmaterial for a Brooks shoe in the upper\nhere uh the tongue I think is pulled\nstraight from uh Brooks ghost uh and\nthere is a decent amount of padding in\nthe back of the heel and into this\nAchilles flare a little bit more padding\nthan I would have liked to have seen uh\nand there's also a lot of structure in\nthis heel cup again more than I would\nhave liked to have seen but something\nthat's pretty common for shoes in this\ncategory of Max cushion shoe and overall\nI do really like the design I also\nreally enjoy this Brooks logo that they\nput on the side of this shoe it's over\nthe top and it definitely adds\nunnecessary weight but I do think it\noverall adds to the aesthetic that makes\nthis probably the best looking Brooks\nshoe that I've ever seen now Brooks\ntells me that this shoe comes in at a\nweight of 10.5 o for their reference\nsize but I am reference size and my size\nn that Brook sent to me came in a little\nbit heavier coming in at 10.8 Oz or 308\nG now that we've talked about what the\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on foot and I got to say\nthe Brooks Glycerin Max is the max\ncushion shoe from Brooks that I've\nalways been waiting for I love the\namount of cushion and softness that I'm\nfeeling in this shoe I'm feeling\nabsolutely pampered every time I put my\nfoot into it the softness here is what I\nthink softness should be every time my\nfoot hits the ground I feel like I'm\ncompressing the foam really nicely it's\nabsorbing the impact of my foot strike\nand then I'm rolling through with that\ngly roll rocker geometry and then the\nfoam is decompressing and giving me a\nnice pleasant amount of Pop as I head\ninto the next step I feel like it's a\nvery modern shoe and a very comfortable\nshoe I feel like they're using\ntechnology to the runner's benefit in it\nit's comfortable it's going to be great\non feet for a long period of time\nwhether you're running a recovery run or\nlooking to set a longdistance PR this is\na very comfortable shoe to be in it's\nalso looks great and very comfortable\nfor all day casual wear the one thing\nthat I wouldn't do in this shoe is take\nit for workouts it is a heavy shoe with\nmy size 9 weighing in over 300 G and\nover 10 o by a hefty margin uh you can\ndo things like uh strides where you're\npicking up the pace for a very short\nbursts of time and the actual speed\nreally isn't the point of strides but\nanything that's longer than strides in\nterms of picking up the pace workouts I\nreally would reach for something else uh\nand and save the Brooks Glycerin Max for\na day where I just want to have a\ncomfortable experience now there is a\nquite wide footprint on this shoe as\nwell and so that's going to help the\nshoe from getting too unstable when your\nfoot hits the ground so without having\ntraditional stability elements the shoe\ndoes have some stability or motion\ncontrol kind of built into it I didn't\nfind this to be a problem and I felt\nlike the shoe was ultimately quite\ncomfortable and it all made sense to me\nbut for those of you who are traditional\nglycerin fans you might find this shoe\nto be a little bit too mushy and a\nlittle bit too wobbly so you might want\nto stay away from something that's this\nsoft I went true to size for my glycerin\nMax and that worked out really well for\nme if you're familiar with Brooks I\nwould go with your normal Brooks sizing\n[Music]\nnow before we wrap up this video let's\ntake a step back and look at the Brooks\nlineup a little bit more generally to\nsee where the glycerin Max fits in and\nright now with Brooks they have pretty\nmuch an entire lineup of Max shoes so\nlet's try and make a lineup using that\nwith the daily trainer we have the ghost\nMax which is the ghost that I've always\nwished that Brooks would make and so\nthat's going to be the kind of\ncenterpiece of a Brooks lineup if you\nlike the Max shoes and then I think for\nworkouts a shoe that you can hop into is\nanother Max shoe and that's the Hyperion\nMax I think that would go over here\nthat's something you could use whever\nyou want to go a little bit faster than\nyou might want to go in your ghost or\nghost Max that's where I reached for the\nHyperion Max the Hyperion being one of\nmy favorite shoes that Brooks had ever\nmade at the time that it first came out\nnow there's a Max version of it a little\nbit more stack height a little bit more\nsoftness to it but still very much a\nspeed oriented shoe not a shoe that I\nwould necessarily reach for for every\nday but for the fast days that's when\nI'd reach for the Hyperion Max and then\nthe glycerin Max fits in on the other\nside of the spectrum over here for those\ndays where you want to be on feet for a\nlong time and as comfortable as possible\nthis is where I would reach for the\nglycerin Max now for racing there is the\nHyperion Elite shoe and technically that\nwould fit over here it has a carbon\nplate in it and it's even lighter the\nupper is absolutely fantastic very\nminimal padding very floppy heel cup the\nkind of things that I want to see when I\nwant to go fast but I don't actually\nlove this shoe and I think that this\nrotation is better served if you just\nleave it at these three shoes use the\nghost Max for every day glycerin Max for\nRecovery days and long runs and then you\nreach for your Hyperion Max for your\nworkouts and for your racing I think\nright now the Hyperion Max is the best\nracing shoe that Brooks makes now\nChicago marathon was earlier this week\nand I did just see it what looked like\nmaybe perhaps just a color update but I\nthink there's a little bit more to that\nstory I don't have any information\nthat's been confirmed yet that I can\nreport on so keep an eye out for\nsomething new from Brooks in the race\ncategory but for now this is the lineup\nthat I would go with and I will note\nthat both the ghost Max and the Hyperion\nMax do have updates so we're on version\ntwo of each of these shoes I have put in\na request to Brooks to see if they would\nsend me a pair of those those are all on\nthe way so stay tuned And subscribe if\nyou want to see updates of those videos\nbut this is the Brooks lineup that I am\nreally excited\n[Music]\nabout now let's wrap up the video by\ntalking about the buying guide and then\nwe'll also go into some Alternatives\nthat you're going to want to consider if\nyou're interested in the glycerin Max\nthe Brooks Glycerin Max is the max\ncushion shoe that I've always been\nwanting for Brooks to make and I hope\nthat shoes like this and the ghost Max\nare signs of shoes to come and not just\none-off experiments that languish in the\nBL labs this is a brand new shoe so\nthere isn't a PRI years version that you\nmight be able to save a couple of bucks\non and I also think that this shoe is\nsubstantially different than the\nexisting glycerin Series so I don't\nreally feel like these are meaningful\nsubstitutes so if you want to get your\nfoot into the new newness from Brooks\nyou're going to be looking at $200 I\nthink that price is a little bit High I\nwish it were lower than that but let's\ntake a look at some of the competition\nto see where that $200 Stacks up the\nfirst shoe I want to talk about I think\nis the shoe that is the closest to the\nglycerin Max and it's also a shoe that I\nvery recently reviewed on the channel\nand that's from Puma it's the mag Max\nanother Max suffix shoe like the\nglycerin Max this is a very tall shoe\nusing Nitro based Foams The Source\nmaterial for the magmax is a little bit\ndifferent and I think that's the main\ndifferentiator between these two shoes\nwell they both look like they could be\nbig cushy comfortable shoes and in many\nrespects they are I do think that the\nmagmax is a little bit bouncier and a\nlittle bit less mushy or in other words\nthe glycerin Max is a little bit more\ncomfortable and a little bit more plush\nbut they're both really great examples\nof the max cushion genre the mag Max\nthough comes in at a $20 discount of 180\nbucks and then the other shoe that I\ndon't think really lines up all that\nwell but I think because of the pricing\nand because of the size of the shoes a\nlot of you guys have been asking me to\ncompare these two so I will and that's\nfrom as6 that's the super Blast 2 these\nare both very tall shoes that look like\nthey're going to be all day low and slow\nCruisers but I actually use these two\nshoes quite differently the giser max is\nan excellent example of Max cushion shoe\nwhere I don't care about Pace but I'm\ntrying to log time on feet and get those\nmiles in in the most comfortable way\npossible the super Blast 2 can be used\nthat way and it's pretty good for that\nbut at $200 I think that's overkill for\nthat task the way I love to use the\nsuper Blast 2 is for something where I\nam going to be on feet for a long time\nbut it's a situation where I'm going to\nwant to go fast for an extended period\nof time now it doesn't have a carbon\nfiber plate so it's not per se a race\nshoe but it does have racing foam in it\nas its main ingredient there's also a\ndaily training foam on the bottom to\nhelp kind of stabilize all this foam and\nkeep it from getting too unstable but\nthis is a shoe where if I have a long\nrun where I'm going to be running a lot\nof marathon pce miles or if I'm going to\nbe doing a workout where the reps are\nvery long this is a really great shoe\nfor for me to be in so it gives me that\ncombination of Max cushion and racing\nshoe kind of sandwiched into one in a\nway that on paper doesn't always Mak\nsense but on foot it just does even then\nI think that $200 is touch high for what\nthe super blast offers but they both\ncome in at the same price and depending\non what you want out of your big shoe I\nthink that's really going to Define\nwhich of these two options you're going\nto pick so those are my thoughts on the\nBrooks Glycerin Max great job Brooks I\nreally love this one let's see more just\nlike it if you have any questions about\nthis shoe or any of the shoes that I\ntalked about today feel free to put them\nin the comments down below or better yet\nstop by the live stream that I do\nMondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi\nRun Club Channel I'd love to talk to you\nguys over there in the chat that's all I\nfor today everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]\nI",

He was a tiny guy in a gigantic puffy coat, and he had the best smile I\u2019d ever seen. \n.\nThe American men had a pretty good day with CJ and Zach working together for much of the race. Reed Fischer ran with grit for the 3rd American spot. \n.\nPacer Matt Centrowitz was all smiles as he came through the finishing chute, as was Rory Linkletter, who lost Annie Frisbie and (I think) decided to catch up to Lindsay Flanagan to assist her to a second American finish. \n.\nFriend and fellow YouTuber Matt Fox also had a good day, finally hitting that elusive sub 2:20 mark.\n.\n#chicagomarathon",

      "text": "on shoes have a tendency to start off\nstrong for me but the love affair Fades\nfast and I just lose interest but after\na summer of running did the peba 4f foot\nand no speedboard of these shoes help\nBuck this trend let's talk about the on\ncloud Monster hyper after 100 miles\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who views\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\non cloud Monster hyper after 100 miles\nbut before I do I do want to go over\nsome disclosures this is a pair of shoes\nthat on sent to me for the purpose of\nreview so I did not have to pay for\nthese shoes however nobody's paying me\nto make this video or to include their\nshoe in this video and no one's going to\nget a chance to preview any of my\nfootage or my thoughts before you guys\nget a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the oncloud\nMonster hyper after 100 miles and let's\nstart with how I've been using the shoe\nnow I initially thought that I might use\nthis shoe as a daily trainer slash long\nrun shoe something that I could put in a\nlot of miles and even pick up the pace\ngiven that there's that race calor foam\nin the for foot but that's not how I\nended up liking using this shoe instead\nI ended up using this shoe as pretty\nmuch a standard daily trainer for any\nday where I was just loging easy regular\neveryday miles or if I wanted to use\nsomething for a recovery run and wanted\na little hint of stability because I do\nfind the shoe to be relatively stable\nfor a neutral shoe now it was easy for\nme to reach for the shoe on those\nrecovery days and those regular easy\ndays the shoe was very pleasant and\nagreeable to run in it just wasn't all\nthat interesting I really felt like I\nshould have been getting more out of a\nshoe that had so much peba in the\nforefoot and that was so bold as to\nremove the speedboard from a shoe model\nthat typically has always had a\nspeedboard I did enjoy my time in the\nshoe but it was just a bit underwhelming\nthey went through all these changes they\nincreased the price by a whole bunch and\nI just wasn't feeling any benefit of the\ncloud Monster hyper over its sibling the\nregular Cloud monster\n2 next let's talk about how the shoes\nhave been holding up physically after\n100 miles I feel like the shoes are\nholding up very well there's very few\nsigns of wear and tear putting my foot\ninto the shoes they feel like pretty\nmuch a brand new pair of shoes and\nVisually everything's holding up really\nwell nothing's wearing down too quickly\nand everything seems like it's a pretty\nfresh shoe I did run with these all\nthroughout the summer so they don't\nsmell the freshest but otherwise\neverything is holding up really nicely\nlooking at the outo there is a little\nbit of wear that's occurring on some of\nthe higher wear areas of the rubber but\nnothing that I wouldn't expect for a\n100m shoe and one thing that you guys\nalways ask me about when it comes to on\nshoes is whether or not I'm getting a\nsqueak from the shoe and for the most\npart I don't get squeak from my on shoes\nthe only time I get them and that's the\ncase for this shoe too is after I've run\nthrough a big puddle that's where I will\nstart to hear a squeak because I think\nthe extra moisture that's in the shoe is\nhelping to create some of that squeaking\nsound I think that it's not an issue for\nme maybe because of my size I think for\nmy bigger taller friends it might be\nmore of an issue and the one thing that\nI do want to say that I really didn't\nlike in terms of the construction of the\nshoe which otherwise is I think is\nspectacular is that the laces are just\nterrible they're a little bit on the\nlong side which is kind of nice because\nmost of the shoes that I've come across\nthese days have laces that are way too\nshort the length on these laces is\npretty good more than I need but if\nyou're trying to actually do a run or\nnot there's plenty there but the laces\nget untied all the time now they do have\nthese little grippy bits on the back\nside of the laces to help kind of\nprevent them from getting accidentally\nuntied as you run but even that doesn't\ndo very much to keep these shoes from\ngetting untied on their own I typically\nfind myself triple knotting these shoes\notherwise I'm going to be stopping\nsomewhere\n[Music]\n[Music]\nmid-run before we wrap up the video\nlet's take a moment to talk about on a\nlittle bit more generally at least on\nrunning shoes uh and see where the\noncloud Monster hyper fits within the\nbroader on running lineup now when it\ncomes to on a lot of people think about\nthe clouds in other words these holes\nthat are in the sides of the shoe as\nkind of like the defining feature of\non-running shoes and while in a large\npart you're correct you're not wrong for\nme the defining thing about on shoes is\nthe speedboard there's like a little\npiece of plastic that's in between the\nupper and the midsole of the shoe that's\nintended to serve a little bit of a\ncarbon fiber plate style of function now\nfor a lot of the on shoes the First on\nshoes that were developed for the first\nseveral years of the Brand's existence\nthey all had some level of speedboard\nand they had a variety of different\nlevels of rigidity to them some were\nmore flexible and more of kind of like a\nrock plate and others were more rigid\nand acting more like a carbon fiber\nplate and so a shoe like the CL Monster\nversion one had a speedboard and regular\nshaped clouds now on also makes race\nproduct and I think what distinguishes\ntheir race product from their regular\nproduct like this shoe the on cloud boom\nEcho 3 is that the speed board in these\nshoes is actually made out of carbon so\nit's a carbon fiber plate this one you\ncan kind of see in the spaces in between\nuh the top and lower layers of this\nmidle foam here this one I feel like is\nmore of a 5k 10K racing option and they\nalso have the cloud strike which again\nhas a carbon fiber plate or a carbon\nspeedboard note that this is very\ndifferent than the cloud strike light\nspray the Fantastic like 3D printed\nsprayon shoe that we saw they have the\nsame name uh but this shoe is a little\nbit different but these are two\ndifferent Racing shoes it's going to be\nan either or decision in terms of which\nshoe to race in now the other kind of\nshoe that on makes is a shoe with no\nspeedboard at all that's a relatively\nnew development I think last year was\nthe first year they started doing that\nand that's shoes like this the cloud\nSurfer which is probably my second\nfavorite on shoe ever made uh this has\nno speedboard at all and a slightly\ndifferent shape of cloud I think to kind\nof compensate for the lack of a\nspeedboard and there's also the cloud\nEclipse which is my favorite on shoe\nthat they've ever made it's more of a\nlong run shoe it's something that could\nsoak up a lot of miles and pick up the\npace a little bit that's another kind of\nshoe that exists here now within kind of\nboth of these lines the speedboard and\nno speedboard there's an entire lineup\nof shoes that exist with the speed\nboarded shoes there is a Max cushion\nshoe like the oncloud monster there's a\ncloud Stratus and there's other shoes\nthat are fitting the daily trainer and\nthe session shoe category and the type\nof Runner that those shoes appeal to I\nbelieve are those that prefer more of a\nEuropean style of running shoe and daily\ntrainer something that's a little bit\nmore stable and a little bit more firm\nnot as squishy spongy as we may prefer\nin North America and so that's kind of\nhow I understand the speed boarded shoes\nfrom on and I feel like the modern take\non that is the no speed boarded shoes\nfrom on which use the cloudtech phase I\nreally prefer these and I feel like\nthese are targeted squarely at the North\nAmerican Market where we want something\nthat's a little bit spongier for our\neasy runs like the cloud Surfer or our\nlong runs and Max cushion runs like with\nthe on cloud eclipse and then you have\nthe race product no matter which of\nthese two styles of shoes speedboard or\nno speedboard you like you're going to\nbe bumping up to the carbon plated\nproduct if you want to have an entire\nlineup with on but these are kind of two\nparallel verticals well sometimes there\nmight be some crossing over in terms of\nwhat people like but for the most part I\nthink these are designed for two\ndifferent kinds of Runners and now\nwhat's unusual is that the cloud Monster\nhyper kind of fits in the cloud monster\n1 and Cloud monster 2 category of the\nspeed boarded shoe but because of the\nway they introduce the peba foam in this\nmidfoot there actually is no speedboard\nso it kind of sits in the middle\nalthough functionally it still feels\nvery much like a speed boarded shoe so\nthat's where it fits now I know this is\na little bit different than the normal\nkind of like shoe rotation that I might\nset out for a brand but I thought it\nmight be helpful to kind of like\nunderstand on in terms of these three\nparallel\npillars now let's close out the video by\ngoing over an updated buying guide now\nthat the shoe's been out for a little\nwhile and we'll go over some updated\nrecommendations of other shoes that you\nmight want to also consider the oncloud\nMonster hyper is what the cloud monster\n2 really should have been I don't really\nunderstand why there's two different\nshoes in the lineup this year and while\nthis is a pretty good shoe at\n$220 this is just way too expensive even\nfor an on shoe if you are absolutely\ndead set on getting an on cloud monster\nI'd say go back to version one they look\nvery similar and you can get into that\nshoe for\n$170 the difference in performance\nbetween those shoes really isn't that\ndifferent but the thing that I would\nprobably steer you toward more if I\ncould would be the oncloud eclipse at\n180 that is my favorite on shoe but\nlet's take a look at some Alternatives\nthe first shoe that I want to take a\nlook at is from Hoka and that is the\nSkyward X this is another shoe that I\nthink sounded really intriguing but\nended up being a little bit\nunderwhelming for me although I know\nthere's a lot of you guys out there that\nabsolutely love this shoe and love what\nit has to offer and what it has to offer\nis a pea top layer and some super\ncritical foam it has a kind of a carbon\nfiber plate in here so on paper it's at\nleast designed to be a big cushion shoe\nthat can pick up the pace which is I\nkind of think what the oncloud Monster\nhyper was trying to accomplish and I\nthink both of these shoes do a decent\njob at that task of being kind of like a\nMax cushion shoe slash a long run shoe\nbut they just don't really suit my\npreferences and they don't really work\nwell for me I do think that each of\nthese shoes is going to be something\nthat's going to appeal to some of my\nbigger taller friends or for some of you\nthat want a little bit more stability in\nyour long run shoes and this shoe\nactually is priced pretty similarly to\nthe on cloud minder hyper the Hoka\nSkyward X comes in at\n$225 which I definitely think that's way\ntoo expensive for that shoe but at least\nwe're talking about the same price\nranges for each of these two shoes now\nif you're like me you think both of\nthose shoes are way out of whack when it\ncomes to what they're priced at I got\nanother shoe that I think you should\ntake a look at and that's from saky\nthat's the Triumph 22 again I think that\nwhat this shoe is trying to do this year\nis very similar to what the oncloud\nMonster hyper is trying to do and I\nthink they're both kind of achieving the\nsame level of success that the Triumph\n22 uses an all power power run PB\nmidsole foam this year that means it has\na beaded peba midsole foam that is the\nsame type of foam that they use in their\nrace product but it's shaped differently\nand there isn't a carbon fiber plate to\ngive this more of a daily trainer\nrecovery run kind of feel in effect I\nfind this shoe to be a little bit less\ninteresting than what the paper specs\nwould suggest but it is a very reliable\ndaily training shoe that you can also\nuse for your recovery runs but it's\nlacking that a little bit of something\nthat I was hoping that I would have just\nlike the oncloud Monster hyper the plus\nside though for this shoe is that it\ncomes in at a bargain relatively\nspeaking price of\n$160 the oncloud Monster hyper does look\na lot better though so those are my\nthoughts on the oncloud Monster hyper\nlet me know in the comments if you have\nany questions about this shoe or any of\nthe shoes that I talked about today or\nbetter yet stop by the live stream that\nI do Mondays and Thursdays over on the\nkofuzi Run clip Channel I'd love to talk\nto you guys over there in the chat\nthat's all I have for today everybody\nthanks so much BR here all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I will see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]",

But on foot, the Active Foot Frame made the whole thing feel like an old Clifton with a little bit of Arahi. Overall, it\u2019s not bad. I was able to get into a pretty decent rhythm with it, and it\u2019s one of those shoes that people will be swearing to me feels better after about 100 miles or so. But out of the box, the whole thing is a bit stiff and motion controlled. \nI think there\u2019s certainly a market for this kind of shoe, and Hoka OG\u2019s who don\u2019t like the new Clifton may have their new champion. But at $160, I\u2019m not sure why someone wouldn\u2019t just reach for the Arahi at $145 instead. \nIt is quite comfortable for walking though. \n.\nDisclosures: Hoka sent this shoe for review, so I did not have to pay for it.

      "text": "this is the Puma mag Max and it's got a\ndouble tall dose of nitro foam will it\nbe the max cushion Cruiser that the name\nimplies or will this just be another big\nshoe that ends up being a bit too firm\ntime to lace up the mag Max and take it\nfor a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm a non-elite runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\nPuma mag Max but before I give you my\nthoughts on this shoe I do want to go\nover some disclosures this is a pair of\nshoes that Puma sent to me for the\npurpose a review so I didn't have to pay\nfor these shoes however nobody's paying\nme to make this video or to include\ntheir shoe in this video and no one's\ngoing to get a chance to preview any of\nmy footage of my thoughts before you\nguys get a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the Puma mag\nMax and let's start with the specs this\nis a very tall shoe starting out at 46\nmm of stack heite in the heel and\ndropping down to 38 mm of Stack height\nin the 4 foot giving us an 8 mm drop and\nthe only thing as far as I know from\nthis shoe is that there is Nitro foam in\nthis shoe now a lot of times when I\nthink about Nitro Foams I think of it as\nbeing lightweight and fast but I don't\nalways think of it as being soft and so\nseeing this much stack heite of nitro\nfoam initially gave me a lot of concerns\nbut stay tuned for the what's it like\nsection of the video where I can talk\nabout what it's like to actually run in\nthe shoe now protecting all this stack\nheite is Puma grip it's a nice thick\nlayer of rubber on the outsole Puma is\ntending for this shoe to give you 500\nmil or for more of durability so they're\ngoing to need a lot of rubber to protect\nthe midsole foam and that midsole foam\nhas to be a highly durable material\nwhich Nitro foam historically have been\nmoving to the upper we have an\nengineered mesh which is supported by\npower tape there is a very comfortable\nknit tongue which I'm very much enjoying\nand a minimal amount of padding\nrelatively speaking for a shoe of this\nsize and of this type there is a little\nbit of rigidity built into the back of\nthis Heel Cup and the foam definitely\nkind of Scoops up around the back of the\nheel and on the sides of your ankle to\ngive you a little bit of support and\nfurther aiding in that support is the\nvery wide footprint so that way your\nfoot doesn't move around too much\nwhenever it hits the ground now in terms\nof fit I do want to mention something\nspecifically Puma normally sends me my\nusual running shoe size that's a US\nmen's n in this shoe they sent me a 9\nand a half I don't know if that's just\nthe tester sizes they had remaining\nbecause sometimes I get kind of whatever\nthe brands have left to send out to\ntesters or if they thought that this was\nsomething that needed me to size up I\nwill say that the 9 and A2 which is a\nhalf size up from what I normally wear\nwas really comfortable and for most of\nmy testing of this shoe I kind of forgot\nthat I was a half size up so I would say\nif you're the type that sometimes sizes\nup size up on this one now Puma says\nthat this shoe comes in at a stated\nweight of 290 G but that would be for\nthe usmen size 9 the size 9 1/2 that I\nhad came in a little bit heavier at 302\nG and 10.6 6\n[Music]\noz now that we've talked about what this\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on foot I'm absolutely\nloving the Puma magmax and I feel like\nit sets the new standard for what Max\ncushion shoes should be like in 2024 for\na long time we've been getting a lot of\nbigger taller Max cushion shoes but they\nhaven't been getting commensurately soft\nand cushioned the Puma mag Max proves\nthat you can do both of those things get\nbigger get taller get more cushion and\nget a more comfortable experience using\nnew techniques and new Foams now I\nmentioned earlier in the video that\nsometimes Nitro foam gets to be a little\nbit on the firm side I don't think that\nsoftness is Nitro Forte but I'm not sure\nhow they've tweaked the formula of this\nNitro foam or if just adding more Nitro\nfoam like this makes it feel softer\nunderfoot but they're doing a fantastic\njob of balancing and cushioning and\nbounce in this shoe in other words it is\na big soft shoe but it's not mushy\nunderfoot which is something we get a\nlot of times in these Max cushion shoes\nand I usually take that as an acceptable\ntrade-off for a shoe that I just want to\nbe in for a long period of time or just\nwant to take for a really comfy relaxed\nrecovery run but this lets me have kind\nof The Best of Both Worlds where it has\nthat daily trainer feel while still\nhaving that extra level of comfort and\ncushion now I do think that you could\neven pick up the pace and do a couple of\nshort bursts of speed in this like if\nyou had some strides at the end of an\neasy run but I think that even with the\nfoam that's in this shoe uh the size and\nthe weight of the shoe would make it a\nlittle bit cumbersome for anything\nlonger than just a couple of strides\nlike I wouldn't want to take it out for\na workout but if you've got a long slow\ndistance run or just a regular everyday\nrun or recovery run this shoe is going\nto be really fun and comfortable for you\nto put your foot into I started testing\nthis shoe out before I ran the Berlin\nmarathon and I loved it for just regular\neasy run days and then I also tested it\nafter I came back from Berlin and used\nit for a recovery run and it was just\nthe thing that my feet\n[Music]\nneeded now before we wrap up this video\nlet's take a step back and look at where\nthe magmax might fit within a broader\nPuma lineup now whenever I take a look\nat a running shoe brand I always like to\nstart with the daily trainer and from\nPuma that's going to be the velocity\nNitro 3 it also has Nitro foam in here\nbut it's a little bit lower to the\nground so you could use it for a wider\nvariety of paces and kinds of runs it's\nalso built for high levels of durability\nand that's going to be kind of the\nanchor and center point of a puma lineup\nnow when it comes to racing there's two\ndifferent options that Puma has\navailable depending on your preferences\nand the one that I'm going to talk about\ntoday is the devi8 Nitro Elite 3 it's\none of the lightest most Nimble Racing\nshoes on the market it's got an updated\nversion of nitro Elite foam which is\neven more premium type of racing foam\nand it's got a carpon fiber plate that's\ngoing to go right here you might also in\nthe alternative use the Puma fast R2\nwhich is a shoe that I particularly like\nbut it's going to be an either or\nsituation you're either going to use the\nfast R2 or you're going to use the DVA\nNitro Elite 3 and then kind of in\nbetween these two shoes when it comes to\nlike some faster workouts that maybe you\ndon't need to reach for the race day\nshoe but you want something a little bit\nfaster than your daily training option\nthere is the DV8 Nitro 3 not to be\nconfused with the Nitro Elite 3 just the\nNitro non- Elite 3 it's got a little bit\nof daily trainer DNA and a little bit of\nrace DNA in it and it's a really fun\nshoe for logging in a lot of workouts\nand where the mag Max fits in is on the\nother side of the speed Spectrum when\nyou just want to get out there and log\nsome time on feet and just take care of\nyourself a little bit more have a little\nbit of extra cushion and the paces can\nslip a little bit cuz it's that kind of\nrun that's where the ma Max fits in\nreally well and it's a nice comfy way to\nround out this Puma\n[Music]\nlineup now let's wrap up this video by\ntalking about the buying guide and also\nsome Alternatives that I think you\nshould consider the Puma magmax is a\nrefreshing update on the max cushion\ngenre and it's one of the best examples\nI've tested in a very long time this is\nthe first year of the shoe so there\nisn't a prior Year's version that you\nmight be able to save some money at so\n180 is what you're going to be looking\nto spend in order to get in these shoes\nand I always feel like 180 for a Max\ncushion shoe kind of feels like a lot\nbut let's take a look at some of the\ncompetition to see where that price\nStacks up the first shoe that I think\nStacks up really well against the Puma\nmag Max is a shoe that I haven't\nreviewed yet so hit the Subscribe button\nif you want to see this review but it\ncomes from Brooks and it's the glycerin\nMax and I think a lot of similarities\nbetween these two shoes that make them\nline up really well and are both going\nto be the contenders for Max cushion\nshoe of 2024 both of these shoes have a\nNitro foam in them and both of them are\nexceptionally soft while also being\nsurprisingly Nimble and if you haven't\nliked previous Brooks glycerins don't\nworry I haven't been a fan of the\nprevious glycerins either but this\nglycerin Max is excellent you are going\nto pay a price for that Excellence\nthough cuz that shoe comes in at\n$200 and then the other shoe that I want\nto talk about comes in a little bit\nunderneath what the Puma magmax comes in\nat and that's going to be from as6 this\nis the Glide ride Max coming in at\n$170 so $10 cheaper than the mag Max I\nfeel like this is also a really great\nexample of a Max cushion shoe although\nit leans a little bit more on the firm\nstable side than the mag Max or the\nglycerin Max does I'm not saying it's\nnot a very soft shoe it's actually what\nI really wish the Nimbus 26 would have\nbeen if it weren't for the mag Max and\nthe glyer max the Glide ride Max would\nhave been probably my choice for a Max\ncushion shoe of the year so it's\ncertainly a year of Max so if you're a\nbig fan of the max cushion genre 2024 is\ndefinitely your year there is a bumper\ncrop of fantastic options if you have\nany questions about the mag Max or any\nof the shoes that I talked about today\nfeel free to put them in the comments\ndown below or better yet STP by the live\nstream that I do Mondays and Thursdays\nover on the kofuzi Run clip Channel love\nto talk to you guys over there in the\nchat that's all for today everybody\nthanks so much for making all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I'll see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]",

  "text": "on shoes have a tendency to start off\nstrong for me but the love affair Fades\nfast and I just lose interest but after\na summer of running did the peba 4f foot\nand no speedboard of these shoes help\nBuck this trend let's talk about the on\ncloud Monster hyper after 100 miles\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who views\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\non cloud Monster hyper after 100 miles\nbut before I do I do want to go over\nsome disclosures this is a pair of shoes\nthat on sent to me for the purpose of\nreview so I did not have to pay for\nthese shoes however nobody's paying me\nto make this video or to include their\nshoe in this video and no one's going to\nget a chance to preview any of my\nfootage or my thoughts before you guys\nget a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the oncloud\nMonster hyper after 100 miles and let's\nstart with how I've been using the shoe\nnow I initially thought that I might use\nthis shoe as a daily trainer slash long\nrun shoe something that I could put in a\nlot of miles and even pick up the pace\ngiven that there's that race calor foam\nin the for foot but that's not how I\nended up liking using this shoe instead\nI ended up using this shoe as pretty\nmuch a standard daily trainer for any\nday where I was just loging easy regular\neveryday miles or if I wanted to use\nsomething for a recovery run and wanted\na little hint of stability because I do\nfind the shoe to be relatively stable\nfor a neutral shoe now it was easy for\nme to reach for the shoe on those\nrecovery days and those regular easy\ndays the shoe was very pleasant and\nagreeable to run in it just wasn't all\nthat interesting I really felt like I\nshould have been getting more out of a\nshoe that had so much peba in the\nforefoot and that was so bold as to\nremove the speedboard from a shoe model\nthat typically has always had a\nspeedboard I did enjoy my time in the\nshoe but it was just a bit underwhelming\nthey went through all these changes they\nincreased the price by a whole bunch and\nI just wasn't feeling any benefit of the\ncloud Monster hyper over its sibling the\nregular Cloud monster\n2 next let's talk about how the shoes\nhave been holding up physically after\n100 miles I feel like the shoes are\nholding up very well there's very few\nsigns of wear and tear putting my foot\ninto the shoes they feel like pretty\nmuch a brand new pair of shoes and\nVisually everything's holding up really\nwell nothing's wearing down too quickly\nand everything seems like it's a pretty\nfresh shoe I did run with these all\nthroughout the summer so they don't\nsmell the freshest but otherwise\neverything is holding up really nicely\nlooking at the outo there is a little\nbit of wear that's occurring on some of\nthe higher wear areas of the rubber but\nnothing that I wouldn't expect for a\n100m shoe and one thing that you guys\nalways ask me about when it comes to on\nshoes is whether or not I'm getting a\nsqueak from the shoe and for the most\npart I don't get squeak from my on shoes\nthe only time I get them and that's the\ncase for this shoe too is after I've run\nthrough a big puddle that's where I will\nstart to hear a squeak because I think\nthe extra moisture that's in the shoe is\nhelping to create some of that squeaking\nsound I think that it's not an issue for\nme maybe because of my size I think for\nmy bigger taller friends it might be\nmore of an issue and the one thing that\nI do want to say that I really didn't\nlike in terms of the construction of the\nshoe which otherwise is I think is\nspectacular is that the laces are just\nterrible they're a little bit on the\nlong side which is kind of nice because\nmost of the shoes that I've come across\nthese days have laces that are way too\nshort the length on these laces is\npretty good more than I need but if\nyou're trying to actually do a run or\nnot there's plenty there but the laces\nget untied all the time now they do have\nthese little grippy bits on the back\nside of the laces to help kind of\nprevent them from getting accidentally\nuntied as you run but even that doesn't\ndo very much to keep these shoes from\ngetting untied on their own I typically\nfind myself triple knotting these shoes\notherwise I'm going to be stopping\nsomewhere\n[Music]\n[Music]\nmid-run before we wrap up the video\nlet's take a moment to talk about on a\nlittle bit more generally at least on\nrunning shoes uh and see where the\noncloud Monster hyper fits within the\nbroader on running lineup now when it\ncomes to on a lot of people think about\nthe clouds in other words these holes\nthat are in the sides of the shoe as\nkind of like the defining feature of\non-running shoes and while in a large\npart you're correct you're not wrong for\nme the defining thing about on shoes is\nthe speedboard there's like a little\npiece of plastic that's in between the\nupper and the midsole of the shoe that's\nintended to serve a little bit of a\ncarbon fiber plate style of function now\nfor a lot of the on shoes the First on\nshoes that were developed for the first\nseveral years of the Brand's existence\nthey all had some level of speedboard\nand they had a variety of different\nlevels of rigidity to them some were\nmore flexible and more of kind of like a\nrock plate and others were more rigid\nand acting more like a carbon fiber\nplate and so a shoe like the CL Monster\nversion one had a speedboard and regular\nshaped clouds now on also makes race\nproduct and I think what distinguishes\ntheir race product from their regular\nproduct like this shoe the on cloud boom\nEcho 3 is that the speed board in these\nshoes is actually made out of carbon so\nit's a carbon fiber plate this one you\ncan kind of see in the spaces in between\nuh the top and lower layers of this\nmidle foam here this one I feel like is\nmore of a 5k 10K racing option and they\nalso have the cloud strike which again\nhas a carbon fiber plate or a carbon\nspeedboard note that this is very\ndifferent than the cloud strike light\nspray the Fantastic like 3D printed\nsprayon shoe that we saw they have the\nsame name uh but this shoe is a little\nbit different but these are two\ndifferent Racing shoes it's going to be\nan either or decision in terms of which\nshoe to race in now the other kind of\nshoe that on makes is a shoe with no\nspeedboard at all that's a relatively\nnew development I think last year was\nthe first year they started doing that\nand that's shoes like this the cloud\nSurfer which is probably my second\nfavorite on shoe ever made uh this has\nno speedboard at all and a slightly\ndifferent shape of cloud I think to kind\nof compensate for the lack of a\nspeedboard and there's also the cloud\nEclipse which is my favorite on shoe\nthat they've ever made it's more of a\nlong run shoe it's something that could\nsoak up a lot of miles and pick up the\npace a little bit that's another kind of\nshoe that exists here now within kind of\nboth of these lines the speedboard and\nno speedboard there's an entire lineup\nof shoes that exist with the speed\nboarded shoes there is a Max cushion\nshoe like the oncloud monster there's a\ncloud Stratus and there's other shoes\nthat are fitting the daily trainer and\nthe session shoe category and the type\nof Runner that those shoes appeal to I\nbelieve are those that prefer more of a\nEuropean style of running shoe and daily\ntrainer something that's a little bit\nmore stable and a little bit more firm\nnot as squishy spongy as we may prefer\nin North America and so that's kind of\nhow I understand the speed boarded shoes\nfrom on and I feel like the modern take\non that is the no speed boarded shoes\nfrom on which use the cloudtech phase I\nreally prefer these and I feel like\nthese are targeted squarely at the North\nAmerican Market where we want something\nthat's a little bit spongier for our\neasy runs like the cloud Surfer or our\nlong runs and Max cushion runs like with\nthe on cloud eclipse and then you have\nthe race product no matter which of\nthese two styles of shoes speedboard or\nno speedboard you like you're going to\nbe bumping up to the carbon plated\nproduct if you want to have an entire\nlineup with on but these are kind of two\nparallel verticals well sometimes there\nmight be some crossing over in terms of\nwhat people like but for the most part I\nthink these are designed for two\ndifferent kinds of Runners and now\nwhat's unusual is that the cloud Monster\nhyper kind of fits in the cloud monster\n1 and Cloud monster 2 category of the\nspeed boarded shoe but because of the\nway they introduce the peba foam in this\nmidfoot there actually is no speedboard\nso it kind of sits in the middle\nalthough functionally it still feels\nvery much like a speed boarded shoe so\nthat's where it fits now I know this is\na little bit different than the normal\nkind of like shoe rotation that I might\nset out for a brand but I thought it\nmight be helpful to kind of like\nunderstand on in terms of these three\nparallel\npillars now let's close out the video by\ngoing over an updated buying guide now\nthat the shoe's been out for a little\nwhile and we'll go over some updated\nrecommendations of other shoes that you\nmight want to also consider the oncloud\nMonster hyper is what the cloud monster\n2 really should have been I don't really\nunderstand why there's two different\nshoes in the lineup this year and while\nthis is a pretty good shoe at\n$220 this is just way too expensive even\nfor an on shoe if you are absolutely\ndead set on getting an on cloud monster\nI'd say go back to version one they look\nvery similar and you can get into that\nshoe for\n$170 the difference in performance\nbetween those shoes really isn't that\ndifferent but the thing that I would\nprobably steer you toward more if I\ncould would be the oncloud eclipse at\n180 that is my favorite on shoe but\nlet's take a look at some Alternatives\nthe first shoe that I want to take a\nlook at is from Hoka and that is the\nSkyward X this is another shoe that I\nthink sounded really intriguing but\nended up being a little bit\nunderwhelming for me although I know\nthere's a lot of you guys out there that\nabsolutely love this shoe and love what\nit has to offer and what it has to offer\nis a pea top layer and some super\ncritical foam it has a kind of a carbon\nfiber plate in here so on paper it's at\nleast designed to be a big cushion shoe\nthat can pick up the pace which is I\nkind of think what the oncloud Monster\nhyper was trying to accomplish and I\nthink both of these shoes do a decent\njob at that task of being kind of like a\nMax cushion shoe slash a long run shoe\nbut they just don't really suit my\npreferences and they don't really work\nwell for me I do think that each of\nthese shoes is going to be something\nthat's going to appeal to some of my\nbigger taller friends or for some of you\nthat want a little bit more stability in\nyour long run shoes and this shoe\nactually is priced pretty similarly to\nthe on cloud minder hyper the Hoka\nSkyward X comes in at\n$225 which I definitely think that's way\ntoo expensive for that shoe but at least\nwe're talking about the same price\nranges for each of these two shoes now\nif you're like me you think both of\nthose shoes are way out of whack when it\ncomes to what they're priced at I got\nanother shoe that I think you should\ntake a look at and that's from saky\nthat's the Triumph 22 again I think that\nwhat this shoe is trying to do this year\nis very similar to what the oncloud\nMonster hyper is trying to do and I\nthink they're both kind of achieving the\nsame level of success that the Triumph\n22 uses an all power power run PB\nmidsole foam this year that means it has\na beaded peba midsole foam that is the\nsame type of foam that they use in their\nrace product but it's shaped differently\nand there isn't a carbon fiber plate to\ngive this more of a daily trainer\nrecovery run kind of feel in effect I\nfind this shoe to be a little bit less\ninteresting than what the paper specs\nwould suggest but it is a very reliable\ndaily training shoe that you can also\nuse for your recovery runs but it's\nlacking that a little bit of something\nthat I was hoping that I would have just\nlike the oncloud Monster hyper the plus\nside though for this shoe is that it\ncomes in at a bargain relatively\nspeaking price of\n$160 the oncloud Monster hyper does look\na lot better though so those are my\nthoughts on the oncloud Monster hyper\nlet me know in the comments if you have\nany questions about this shoe or any of\nthe shoes that I talked about today or\nbetter yet stop by the live stream that\nI do Mondays and Thursdays over on the\nkofuzi Run clip Channel I'd love to talk\nto you guys over there in the chat\nthat's all I have for today everybody\nthanks so much BR here all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I will see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]",

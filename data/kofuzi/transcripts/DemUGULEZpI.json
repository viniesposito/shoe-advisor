  "text": "one of the promises of the adios Pro Evo\n1 is that the learnings from this shoe\nwould trickle down into Adidas's\nmainstream product we've seen some of\nthat promise fulfilled in the recently\nannounced adios Pro 4 and now even more\nof that lineage is making its way into\neveryday product this is the azero Evo\nSL and it's time to take it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm an an elite Runner who used running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the adero\nEvo SL but before I give you my thoughts\non this shoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nAdidas sent to me for the purpose of\nreview so I didn't have to pay for these\nshoes however nobody's paying me to make\nthis video or to include their shoe in\nthis video and no one's going to get a\nchance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the a zero Evo SL and let's\nstart with the specs I think the\nheadline spec is that it's Light Strike\nPro midsole foam in this shoe and unlike\nother shoes from other brands that use\nthe same name as their racing Foams even\nif the daily training versions are\nchemically different this is actually\nracing caloro in this shoe I've\nconfirmed with Adidas that it is Light\nStrike Pro in this shoe and nothing but\nLight Strike Pro in this shoe and the\nsame exact Light Strike Pro that's in\nthe adios Pro 3 and there is a slight\nvariation in terms of Stack kite and\ndrop in the Evo SL versus its racing big\nsiblings where the Evo SL starts out at\n38.5 mm of stacky in the heel and ends\nwith 32 mm of sa in the 4 foot for a 6\nand 1/2 mm drop and like I said there's\nno stabilizing element whatsoever in the\nmidsole of the shoe so you're getting a\nreally great opportunity to experience\nwhat pure Light Strike Pro really feels\nlike now another element that they've\nborrowed from the Evo one other than the\nAesthetics of the shoe and it does look\nabsolutely stunning and it does look\nvery similar is that they've borrowed\nthe 60% rocker position and so what that\nmeans is the rocker is the point at\nwhich the front of a running shoe kind\nof curls up a little bit and it helps\nyou as you're running forward to get\nover the foam and through the foam so\nthat way you can push off for your next\nstride now if we measure from 0% all the\nway to the full length of the shoe 100%\nwhere the rocker position starts is at\n60% of the length from 0 to 60 over here\nis where the rocker position starts and\nthis is really early compared to a lot\nof other shoes in the Adidas lineup even\nthe adios Pro 3 started at closer to 70%\nof the length of the shoe uh before it\nstarted in that rocker geometry but the\nEVO One and the adios Pro 4 both start\nat 60% and the evos SL is mimicking that\ngeometry here now to protect all this\nmidsole foam we've got a generous\nhelping of Continental rubber there is\npretty wide coverage in the forefoot of\nthe shoe and then two little strips in\nthe back of the heel now while there is\na good surface area amount of coverage\nthe rubber that's on here isn't very\nthick but as we've seen from other cont\nental Rubber products the durability on\nthese rubber outsoles is pretty high so\nthe thickness of the rubber doesn't\nreally bother me here moving to the\nupper we have what looks very similar to\nwhat we saw in the Evo one but what\nfeels in fact very different the upper\nfor the Evo one was almost transparent\nit was almost see-through and extremely\nlightweight yet also strong now we have\na little bit more of a traditional upper\nin terms of what we see on the EVO SL\nbut it is very breathable and the design\nis still very clean and minimalistic\njust like what we saw in the Evo SL\nwhich makes the three stripes that go\nacross the shoe even that much more\nstriking then the other really big\ndifference that I know between the EVO\nOne upper and the Evo SL upper is in the\ntongue and in the padding in the heel\ncup the EVO One tongue was kind of\ndifficult to deal with this one is much\nmore kind of traditional and standard\nit's still very thin and I I like it\nvery much and then in terms of padding\nin the back you could tell that this\nshoe is built a a little bit more for\ndaily training and not necessarily for\nracing because there is a lot more\ncomfort features built into this there's\na lot of padding around the back of the\nheel cup and a little bit of structure\nas well altogether Adidas tells us that\nthis shoe should come in at 224 G and\nwhen I weighed my usmen size 9 my\nreference size shoot it came in at\nexactly 224 G or 7.9 Oz\n[Music]\nnow that we talked about what this shoe\nis like on paper let's talk about what\nit's like on foot and I got to tell you\npure racing foam in a daily trainer is\nreally nice or at least it's really nice\nin the way they've implemented it here\nin the Evo SL I've taken the shoe out\nfor Recovery run efforts daily training\nand for some speedier work as well I\nthink it excelled in all three areas\nalthough it is doing certain things\nbetter than others I find that there's a\nreally nice squish to it the foam is\ncompressing nice ly and decompressing\nreally well although I think that some\npeople are going to find that the way\nthat this shoe is set up it's going to\nbe a little bit unstable at some of the\neasier paces and I found that like the\nshoe kind of felt a little bit muddled\nafter long extended periods of easy\nrunning in the shoe I do feel like the\nshoe does speedier running or like kind\nof uptempo running really well though\nand what I mean by uptempo Paces is\nstuff that's maybe a little bit slower\nthan your marathon Race pace and all the\nway up to half marathon or maybe up to\nthreshold efforts I feel like that range\nof speed which is a pretty broad band of\neffort levels at those Paces that are\nfaster than easy I feel like the foam is\nreally starting to perk up and respond\nlike a super foam wood where it's\ngetting a great amount of compression\nand decompression and I'm enjoying the\namount that the foam is deflecting but I\nalso enjoy kind of the the the Rhythm or\nthe pace at which it's deflecting as\nwell cuz I feel like it's really\nmatching with my foot strike and my\nstride and I think that when you're\npicking up the pace a little bit in this\nshoe that's where I think that the 60%\ngeometry of The Rocker that's in the\nshoe feels the most kind of sensible I\nfeel like at some of the easier Paces\nthe 60% rocker where the rocker starts\nso early uh makes it feel a little bit\nmore aggressive than the shoe\nnecessarily needs to be it's a 6 and\nhalf millim drop shoe and I feel like it\nfeels like a much taller drop because of\nthat aggressive rocker that start starts\nso early but when you're picking up the\npace even just a little bit that's where\nI feel like the whole thing really just\nmakes a lot of sense together and if you\nthink about it it should make a little\nbit more sense that way because it's\nborrowing so much Heritage from the\nadios Pro 3 the adios Pro 4 and the evo1\nkind of all put together and distilled\ninto this daily training package and at\nthe end of the day I feel like calling\nit a daily trainer is a little bit\nreductive or calling it a session shoe\nalso is a little bit reductive because\nit's not\nstrictly a session shoe at certain Paces\nwhen I want to go faster than threshold\nand certainly if I were to do a a big V2\nMax workout I I would want something\nthat's a little bit snappier here and\nthat's where I'm missing the pop of a\nplate in this shoe but the fact that\nthis shoe can kind of handle a lot of\nwhat an average Runner is going to\nencounter during a marathon or half\nmarathon training block I think is it\nwas really quite amazing that they've\nable to put that all into one shoe I do\nfeel like the big biggest attractor I'd\nsay for this shoe is the upper the\nmaterials that they've chosen look great\nbut I think that every material that's\nhere is a bit of a sweat collector so on\nthose hot days on those really big\nworkouts that you're going to put into\nthis shoe your shoes are going to be\nsoaking up a lot of\n[Music]\nliquid now before we wrap up the video\nlet's take a moment and see where the\nEvo SL could fit within a broader Adidas\nrunning shoe rotation now the evos for\nme fits as a daily trainer it can\ncertainly do a lot of different types of\nthings but the bulk of the time that\nyou're going to be using this shoe\nyou're probably going to be using it for\nyour everyday runs your easy runs taking\nup the bulk of your weekly mileage and\nthen for racing you're going to look to\nits sibling the adios Pro 4 as the\nracing option there are similarities in\nGeometry a lot of similarities in feel\nthese two shoes alone are going to make\nfor a really fun running SHO rotation if\nyou wanted to go with just two but let's\nadd some more into the conversation I\nthink one way to go really crazy and\nwild with this is to bring in the prime\nX2 strong this is more of a long run\nshoe but not just any long run shoe if\nyou've got a long run with some speedier\nmiles built into it or you have just a\nbig workout where you want a lot of\ncushion and this has a lot of cushion\nand double carbon fiber plates this is a\nreally fun albeit expensive way uh to\nadd some spice into your your long runs\nand now there's some gaps in between\neach of these shoes and this is where\nthis running shoe rotation is going to\nget a little bit I don't know about\ncontroversial but it get a little bit\ninteresting and the reason why I'm going\nto kind of play around with it a little\nbit is because when I reviewed the adios\nPro 4 I went through the similar lineup\nkind of conversation and then went\nthrough the I think more traditional\ntake on the Adidas running shoe lineup\nbut let's spice things up a little bit\nespecially because Adidas has so many\ndifferent shoes in its Arsenal I think\none shoe that I could put here here in\nkind of like the max cushion category or\nin the long slow distance category where\nyou just want to be chill and comfy is\ngoing to be the Boston 12 now this isn't\nnormally where the Boston sits normally\nI put the Boston here as kind of a\nsession shoe but the way that the Boston\n12 is built and the way that the Boston\nhas been going for a lot of years is to\nput it more in kind of like this uh\nlonger run time on feet category of shoe\nit's really comfortable for casual wear\nit's really comfortable for long longer\neasy runs it does have some Light Strike\nPro in it and some form of energy rods\nin there so it can pick up the pace a\nlittle bit but for me it doesn't love\npicking up the pace so I'm going to put\nit here in this kind of Max cushion more\ncomfy category of shoe and then in this\nspeed category spot I'm going to put in\nthe adios 8 now normally I would say I\ncan't imagine why you would pick the\nadios 8 over the Tumi sen which is the\nnormal shoe that I put in this spot but\nkeep in mind that these are 202 five\nshoes that we're talking about here the\nEvo SL is coming out in 2025 the adios\nPro 4 is coming out in 2025 each of\nthese shoes won't make it into my 2024\nyear and wrap-up videos and comparison\nvideos because they're 2025 videos so as\na placeholder for now I'm going to put\nin the adios 8 here watch this space for\n2025 cuz I think what they're bringing\nis going to be I don't know if it's\ngoing to be better than the Tumi sen but\nit's certainly going to be in the\nconversation of the Tumi sen for what\nthe next audios is going to be so I'm\ngoing to talk about this here in that\nspeed category when you want to go a\nlittle bit faster than what your daily\ntrainer can do but maybe don't have as\nbig or maybe have a faster workout in\nterms of Paces than what you might do in\nyour Marathon racer and this I think is\nanother very valid way of putting\ntogether an Adidas running shoe lineup\nin 2025\n[Music]\nnow let's wrap up the video by talking\nabout the buying guide and we'll also go\nover some Alternatives that you will\nlikely want to consider the azero Evo SL\nis the best daily trainer in the Adidas\nlineup and it's a really great example\nof how good and versatile Light Strike\nPro can be for people who are looking\nfor their first marathon racing shoe and\ndon't necessarily want to get into\ncarbon this is going to be a really\ngreat choice for people that are looking\nfor an extra cushioned session shoe it's\nalso going to be a really great choice\nand for anyone that just wants to be a\nlittle bit extra and have an all Light\nStrike Pro Mido foam as their daily\ntrainer the Evo SL is going to make you\npretty happy as well this shoe won't be\navailable until 2025 but when it does\nrelease it'll be coming in at\n$150 which yes is a lot of money but I\nreally think that it's quite a bargain\nlet's take a look at some of the\ncompetitor to see what they come in at\nto see where that 150 stack up and the\nfirst shoe that I'm going to talk about\nis the Pegasus plus this is a shoe that\nproudly labels that it has zoomx foam in\nit but anyone who has run in this shoe\nand also run in any other zoomx Racing\nshoes know that they're not exactly the\nsame kind of zumex that's in it now\nwhile I think it's wildly misleading to\nthe consumer to give the same name to\nthe phone that's in the alphafly 3 and\nin the Pegasus plus I think that given\ndifferent names I don't think that\nthere's anything wrong with tinkering\nwith the formula ation of the materials\nin order to achieve a desired effect in\na daily trainer and I do think that this\nis a really great daily training\nexperience it feels very much like a\npegasus and it feels very much like a\npeg turbo as well kind of wrapped into\none splitting the difference in a lot of\nways and each of these shoes would be a\ngreat choice for daily trading or for\nworkouts and sessions the other thing\nabout this shoe is that it comes in\nalmost an ounce heavier and $30 more\nexpensive cuz going to be paying $180 to\nget to the peg plus now the next shoe\nthat I want to talk about and again both\nthese shoes that I'm going to compare to\nthe evos SL are shoes that I really like\nin 2024 uh and the other one is from New\nBalance it's the rebel version 4 this\nagain is using a foam that is called\nfuel cell which is the same name as the\nracing foam that New Balance uses but\nit's a a different formulation than\nwhat's in their race product their race\nproduct has peba in it this is a peba\nEva blend and I think that that's it's a\nsuccessful combination I kind of take\noffense to the fact that they call it\nthe same thing but overall at the end of\nthe day the material that's in here is\nreally nice it's lightweight it squishes\nthe right way it bounces back in the\nright way and it makes for a really\nlightweight fun running experience it's\nabout the same weight as the azero Evo\nSL and I would use these two shoes in a\nlot of very similar ways the big\ndifference for me though in the rebel\nversion 4 and why I might not reach for\nit in as many kind of fart lick workouts\nor even longer Tempo progression runs\nthat I might use the Evo SL for is that\nthere's a lot of width to the bottom of\nthis shoe it's wider at the pads of the\nfeet it's wider underneath the arch and\nit's much wider through the heel and I\nthink what they're trying to do is\nprevent this shoe from getting too\nunstable and so they're trying to\nstabilize it with width which I think\ndoes the job that'll certainly make it\nmore stable but also makes it a little\nbit less Nimble and a little bit less\nexcit exting you're getting a little bit\nof discount though for those trade-offs\nbecause the rebel version 4 comes in at\n$140 so those are my thoughts on the\nazero EO Asel and the competition let me\nknow in the comments if you have any\nother questions or better yet stop by\nthe live stream that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I'll\nwill see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\na\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

  "text": "there is a new category of running shoe\nthat goes jumbo with the Foams but stays\nminimal with weight they use racing\nmaterials in their midsoles and they\ndon't always have a carbon fiber plate\nthese are the shoes that look like\nthey're Max cushion shoes but they run\nlike they could be your next marathon\nracer these are my top five long run\nshoes of 2024\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk about the best long run\nshoes of 2024 now this is a new category\nthat I've created and I think it might\ncause a little bit of confusion so let's\nstart off by kind of setting it straight\nas to why I made this new category of\nlong run shoe I've been seeing a kind of\ndivision happening within the max\ncushion category there's kind of the old\nschool max cushion that's super cushion\nsuper relaxed and usually super heavy\nand plush that's used for Recovery runs\nand then there's been this new\ngeneration of Max cushion shoes that\ndon't just want to go slow and I find\nthat they are best for those marathon\ntraining session long runs that have a\nlittle bit of pace Variety in there that\ncould go faster than just your easy run\nor your recovery run pace and enjoy\nrunning up to Marathon effort these are\nthe shoes that I've been reaching for\nwhenever I have a long run and I put\nthem into their own category but before\nI give you my list on my favorites in\nthis new category I do want to go over\nsome disclosures no one is paying me to\nmake this video or to include their shoe\non this list and no one's going to get a\nchance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the top long run shoes and\nlet's start with number five starting us\noff on this list is a new entrant from\nMuno and this is the Neo Vista this shoe\ncombines a very comfortable knit upper\nwith a brand new foam mizuno's enery NXT\nit's a shoe that is kind of like a super\ncritical foam Muno wouldn't tell me\nexactly what it is but Muno says that\nit's better than super critical Eva\nfoams it's a very squishy foam with a\nlot of movement to it compression and a\nsoft decompression and it's paired with\na Muno wave plate which is a glass fiber\nreinforced plastic plate all these\nthings put together create a shoe that I\ndidn't love for easy and Recovery Paces\nbut when you pick up the pace a little\nbit and really get rolling the amount of\ncompression and decompression works well\nfor those days where you need to bark a\nlittle bit faster than easy but because\nbecause of the fact that it disagrees\nwith me so much on those easy and\nRecovery Paces that's why it only barely\ncracks the list at number five now\nmoving into the number four spot is\nanother new shoe from a brand and that\nis the New Balance BOS now this is a\nshoe that uses Fresh Foam X but not just\nany fresh foam X this Fresh Foam X\nactually has a bit of peba mixed into\nthe blend and it reminded me a lot of\nthe 1080 version 13 which I Absol loved\nbut taken kind of like to the next level\nand there's more of that fun bounciness\nthat the 1080 version 13 had and while\nit is a little bit on the heavy side and\nnot necessarily something I would race\nin also there's no carbon fiber plate in\nhere it's just a lot of fun to take for\nthose efforts where you're going to pick\nup the pace a little bit maybe you got\nan uptempo run or a marathon training\nrun on Deck the Ballance is going to be\nreally fun now I did have some problems\nrunning in this shoe personally I've got\na weird thing with my foot every once in\na while while a shoe just tends to\naggravate it and the Ballance was\nunfortunately one of those shoes for me\nbut for the amount of time that I was\nable to run painfree in this shoe it is\ndelightful and it's a shoe that I've\nbeen trying to really recommend even\nthough I've had a hard time running in\nit it's a shoe that I've been really\ntrying to recommend to a lot of Runners\nlooking for exactly this type of shoe\nbecause the sensation it gives is so\nmuch fun moving into number three is a\nbrand that I always feel like is a\nlittle bit overlooked because it is a\nsmaller brand and a lot of the shoes\ndon't get the same hype that some of the\nbigger Global Brands can bring but at\nnumber four I want to talk to you guys\nabout the toppo Spectre 2 now this is a\nshoe that uses an all Beed pabx mid\nsooam it's got it right on the side of\nthe midsole here and it doesn't have a\ncarbon fiber plate so it's not\ntechnically a marathon racer but it's\ndesigned for Marathon road runners and\nthis is a fantastic shoe for anything\nfrom Easy runs all the way up to those\nlonger runs with Marathon on E for miles\nin them the beaded PE foam Works in here\nreally well there's a wide foot-shaped\ntoe box in here and a 5 mm drop all\nthings that I think set up very nicely\nfor a shoe that you're going to be in\nfor several hours at a time and also\nwanting to run fast now for the number\ntwo spot for me is a shoe that I think\nis going to be a number one spot for a\nlot of you out there because so many of\nyou have been able to run well in it and\nthat's from New Balance that's the SC\nTrainer version three they've got an\nupdated version of fuel cell in this\nshoe which is their racing caliber foam\nand this is the only shoe in this\ncategory that has a carbon fiber plate I\nfeel like this shoe is designed a little\nbit more for heel Strikers and so I\nthink that's why I don't always get\nalong with it as well as some of my\nother friends do but I also know that\nthis is shoe that even I can take for\nlong runs especially if there's some\nPace pickups in there and I know for a\nlot of people for whom like the regular\ncarbon fiber races are maybe a little\nbit too aggressive the SC Trainer series\nfrom version one all the way through\nversion three has been a perennial\nfavorite and is usually one of the first\nshoes that I recommend for those people\nwho want something a little bit\ndifferent than the normal carbon plated\nracer for their Marathon shoe and that\nbrings me to my number one shoe and this\nis the shoe that in my mind pretty much\ncreated the category because it is so\nbig but also because it is so light\nbecause it is so comfortable but because\nit can also move so quickly and that's\nthe A6 super Blast 2 it's got a big\nhelping of FF turbo plus the newest\nversion of A6 racing super foam and it's\ngot a layer of FF blast Plus on the\nbottom to help it stabilize without the\nuse of a plate this is a shoe that I\nknow a lot of you guys are using as a\nregular Max cushion shoe using it for\nyour easy runs and your recovery run\ndays but me personally I love it for\nthose long runs that are going to take\ntwo to three hours or more and I'm going\nto have to do a little bit of work Pace\nwise within that long run those the\nexact type of situations where I'm\nreaching for the super Blast 2 so those\nare my favorite shoes to reach for when\nI've got a long run a tough long run on\nthe calendar let me know what you've\nbeen logging your biggest longest runs\nin I'd love to hear about it in the\ncomments down below or better yet stop\nby the live stream that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking it all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]",

  "text": "this is the novablast 5 and once again\nthey're changing the midsole foam this\nyear the Nova blast will feature FF\nblast Max a foam that is lighter than\nthe foam in a last year's Nova blast but\nwith the trend of super Foams making\ntheir way into daily trainers will FF\nblast Max be enough for as6 to keep up\nit's time to lace up the no blast 5 and\ntake it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non Elite Runner reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the A6\nNova blast 5 but before I give you my\nthoughts on this shoe I do want to go\nover some disclosures this is a pair of\nshoes that is accent to me for the\npurpose of revie so I did not have to\npay for these shoes however nobody's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my footage of my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the Nova\nblast 5 and let's start with the specs\nthis is a 41.5 MM stack heite shoot with\nan 8 mm drop giving us 33.5 mm of Stack\nheight in the for foot I believe those\nare the same specs as last year as far\nas stack height and drop now the women\ndo get a different stack height the drop\nstays the same but they're a millimeter\nlower in the heel and in the forfoot and\nthe big story for this year is the\nupgrade of the Nova blast to FF blast\nMax this is a brand new foam that is\nsupposed to provide a more responsive\nbounce according to A6 and it's also\nsupposed to be lighter so even though\nthese two shoes the Nova blast 4 and the\nNova blast 5 look very similar and if\nanything it looks to me like the novast\n5 has a little bit more foam to it the\nNova blast 5 does come in a little bit\nlighter now on the outsole on this shoe\nthere is a very familiar kind of pattern\nof rubber that's on here it is slightly\ndifferent than what we saw in last\nyear's version 4 but we're getting the\nsame rubber compound and we're basically\ngetting it in the same areas and to the\nsame depth so the rubber is still a\nlittle bit on the thick side if you ask\nme moving to the upper we have a brand\nnew upper material as well this year the\nNova BL goes to a jaquard mesh it's a\ndouble layer mesh that is very stretchy\nand also very breathable it also feels a\nlittle bit thinner than the material\nthat we saw in the Nova blast 4\nsomething that isn't thinner though and\nsomething that I think unfortunately\nisn't thinner is that the tongue is\nstill kind of on the puffy side and I\nfeel like as the years have gone on the\ntongue on the Nova Blast has gotten\npuffier and puffier even though I'm\nreally wishing they would just take the\nknit tongue from the Nimbus series and\nput that into NOA blast I think that\nwould be really fun to run in and in the\nheel cup of this shoe we're still seeing\nthat same overly padded puffy foam it\nmakes for a very comfortable slip-in\nexperience when your foot goes into the\nshoe and wearing it around casually it\nis really nice but I feel like for\nrunning especially in hot days it's not\nreally that hot here in Crystal Lake\nanymore but on hot days that's\ndefinitely going to be a bit of a sweat\ncollector as the Nova Blast has been\npretty consistently in the heel for the\npast couple of years we do still retain\nthe pull tab though for easy on in the\nshoes and overall this shoe comes in at\nan updated weight of 255 G or just at 9\n[Music]\noz now that we talked about what this\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on the road the Nova\nblast 5 is a faithful successor to the\nNova blast lineage there's a great\namount of cushion in this shoe and\nthere's a great amount of Bounce I feel\nlike it also picks up the pace as well\nso not only can it do your daily\ntraining run and handle those\nrun-of-the-mill everyday runs that\nyou're doing most of the week most of\nthe time but if you've got a light\nworkout like a fart lick or an uptempo\nrun or maybe you just got an easy run\nwith them strides in it the Nova blast 5\nis going to be really fun and really\ncomfortable for you to be able to put\nthose miles in now I think that the word\nthat a lot of you guys who have been\nwatching me review the Nova Blast for\nthe last five iterations are probably\nlooking for is whether it's chaotic and\nI will say that the Nova blast 5 isn't\nchaotic it's more like the Nova blast 4\nthan it is like the Nova Blast 3 but I\ndo think that the FF blast Max foam is\ndoing a really good job of kind of\ngiving me more Nova blast 3ish sensation\nwithout it feeling chaotic so I feel\nlike it kind of splits the difference\nbetween the Nova Blast 3 and the Nova\nblast 4 fans and so it's not as\npotentially unstable to as many people\nbut it's still a lot of fun to be able\nto run in the upper on the shoe is is\nreally comfortable even more comfortable\nthan the Nova blast was last year and I\nthink because the material is thinner I\ndoes feel like there's a little bit more\nroom and it's a little bit more\nforgiving in terms of fit in the forfoot\nso those of you who are kind of on the\nbubble between sizes last year because\nit might have been a little bit too snug\nfor you I think you might be able to\nstay at your regular size for the Nova\nblast 5 I do feel like overall the upper\nis a big improvement over last year\nalthough I would love to see the tongue\nstop being so overbuilt and the Heel Cup\nbeing so overly padded as far as the\nouto goes I feel like we have a very\nsimilar setup it's the same compound and\narranged in pretty much the same pattern\nand thickness as it was last year so if\nyou've been able to run in the Nova\nblast 4 without any traction or grip\nissues you should be definitely fine in\nthe Nova blast 5 personally I feel like\nI could go with a little bit less rubber\ncuz I feel like it would further enhance\nthe experience you're getting from the\nFF blast Max I think as it is the amount\nof rubber that's on the outsole is\nmuting The Experience just a little bit\nthat being said I think the Nova blast 5\nis a set it and forget it kind of shoe\nI'm having a lot of fun with it I can\nrun in it all day long and it's an\nexcellent example of a daily\n[Music]\ntrainer before we close out the video\nLet's zoom out and see where the noble\nS5 sits within a broader A6 lineup now\nwhenever I take a look at a running shoe\nbrand I like to start with the daily\ntrainer and that's exactly what a Nova\nblast is it's the shoe that sits in the\nmiddle of your running shoe rotation\nit's kind of the base of it all the shoe\nthat you're running in most often it's\nbuilt to be comfortable enough to be\nused multiple times per week and also be\ndurable enough to handle that kind of\nmileage and then for racing the carbon\nplated shoe that I like from A6 is the\nmeta speed sky and this is the meta\nspeed Sky Paris that's going to go over\nhere now in between these two shoes for\nsomething that is maybe a little bit\nfaster than you might want for every day\nbut maybe not quite as special that\nyou'd have to break out your erasing\nshoes that's where a training companion\nor session shoe like the magic speed 4\ncomes into play it's got a little bit of\ndaily training features it's got a\nlittle bit of race day features built in\nnow for days where you're going to be\nspending a lot of time on feet maybe\nit's a recovery run you want to be a\nlittle bit nicer to your body that's\nwhere a shoe like the Glide ride Max\ncomes into play it's a little bit more\ncushioned a little bit more chill and\nhas a lot more comfort features built\ninto it it's also the first shoe that we\nsaw that introduced at least a little\nbit of FF blast Max foam in here and\nthen from as6 there's also a fifth shoe\nthat kind of is a category straddler but\nthis is the super Blast 2 this has\nracing foam in it FF turbo plus the same\nturbo plus that's in the race sto but\nit's in a really tall sack heite and it\nhas no carbon fiber plate it also has a\nlittle bit of daily training film on the\nbottom to help with longevity and also\nto stabilize this foam this is a shoe\nthat some people use as a kind of long\nslow distance kind of shoe or recovery\nday shoe and it does a good job of that\nbut I kind of like it for longer runs\nwhere I might have to pick up the pace a\nlittle bit and having that super foam is\na nice little touch so this is like a\nfive shoe rotation from as6 that I think\ncould be really fun but I I'm not\nrecommending that people go out and buy\nall five of these shoes in fact there's\na lot of ways that I think that kind of\nlike this can be paired down so the\nfirst thing I'm going do is I'm going to\nremove two shoes from this and I feel\nlike if I wanted to go with a three shoe\nrotation from A6 I'd get rid of the glid\nride Max and the magic speed 4 not that\nthey're not good shoes but I just feel\nlike if we're trying to consolidate a\nlittle bit this is a really good way to\nconsolidate here use your Nova Blast for\nyour everyday your super Blast 2 for\nyour long runs and long run workouts and\nthen for your fastest stuff that's where\nyou reach for the race day shoot now if\nI were to really push it and force\nmyself to have only two a six shoes in a\nrotation I think the shoe that I would\nremove would be the Nova blast 5 not\nthat I don't love that shoe but I feel\nlike the super Blast 2 is pretty\nversatile it can handle everyday running\nand it can also do some workouts as well\nand then you've got the meta speed Sky\nParis as your race Day Option and I feel\nlike this could be an expensive but\ndoable two shoe rotation cuz keep in\nmind the super Blast 2 is $200 now you\nmight be asking well what about the\nother Marathon racing shoe that A6 has\nand that is the meta speed Edge Paris\nand I feel like this is an either or\nwhether you're using a two shoe three\nshoe five shoe rotation you're probably\neither going to like the metaed edge\nParis or The Meta speed Sky Paris I kind\nof use them in the same rotation because\nI happen to have both of them but\nrealistically for most Runners it's\ngoing to be an either or and I prefer\nthe metas speed\n[Music]\nSky now let's wrap up the video by going\nover the binding guide and we'll talk\nabout some Alternatives that you want to\nconsider the Nova blast 5 is an\nexcellent example of a daily trainer it\ncan do a little bit of everything from\nrecovery runs your everyday runs to\nmoderate workouts and strides this shoe\ngoes on sale soon December 1st at a\nprice of $140 so inflation has not hit\nthe Nova blast series yet but because\nthe Nova Blast has been around for a\nwhile there are also some other options\nto consider in the Nova blast family for\nexample you can get $10 discount right\nnow on the Nova blast 4 and in some very\nselect sizes you can find the Nova Blast\n3 still around for\n$100 so those are some other options\nthat you might want to also consider\nbecause while there are some differences\nbetween these shoes amongst the Nova\nblast Fanatics for most people getting\nan earlier version of novablast to save\nyou a couple of bucks is definitely\nsomething that is a viable option but\nthere's also a lot of heat coming from\nother brands in 24 and into 5 so let's\ntake a look at some of those I think the\nbiggest competition that the novablast 5\nfaces is from Adidas and that's going to\nbe the Evo SL this is a shoe that has\nall racing super foam in the midlle the\nsame Light Strike Pro that was in the\nadios Pro 3 but it doesn't have a carbon\nfiber plate or those energy rods that\nthe adios Pro Series has had the upper\nis built more for daily training but it\ndoesn't have a super puffy tongue or\nheel cup and I feel like this shoe is an\nexcellent daily as well and it does a\nvery good job of even moderate to hard\nworkouts it'll be interesting to see how\nthis shoe holds up as a daily trainer as\nwe don't typically associate Light\nStrike Pro with longevity and durability\nthat you'll need for daily training but\nif it could even come kind of close to\nthe kinds of numbers in terms of miles\nthat you can run in this shoe before it\nuses its usable life I think this is\ngoing to be an incredibly difficult\nshoot for any brand to compete against\nin 202 5 and it's only $10 more than the\nNova blast 5 the Evo SL comes out at\n$150 which I believe is a very\naggressive price now there are trickle\ndrops here and there where you might be\nable to get this shoe now but supplies\nare very limited in each of those little\nmini drops the broader release doesn't\nhappen until March of 2025 which for me\nor depending on how much you run might\nbe plenty of time to pick up a NOA blast\n5 and then pick up an Evo SL if you're\nonly going to get one of those two shoes\nand I feel like people watching this\nchannel regularly are probably not going\nto only get one of these two shoes but\nif you're only going to get one and\nyou're deciding between the Evo SL and\nthe Nova blast 5 and you can wait till\nMarch of 2025 and probably pick the Evo\nSL now the other shoe that I want to\ntake a look at is another shoe that uses\nsuper foam and I'll use super foam in\nair quotes here because it's zumex in\nthe Pegasus plus and I'm using air\nquotes with this because I don't really\nthink and I haven't heard officially\nfrom Nike one way or the other but I\ndon't think that the zoomx foam that's\nin the Pegasus plus is the same zoomx\nfoam that we're seeing in the actual\nrace product like in the alphafly 3 or\nin the vapor fly but it is a really good\ndaily training foam and a lot of the\nsame things that I would say nicely\nabout the Nova blast 5 I can kind of\ncopy paste and put onto the Pegasus plus\nas well it's a really great daily\ntrainer you could take it for some\nmoderate workouts I do feel though that\nthe Pegasus plus has a little bit more\nof an aggressive geometry with a 10 mm\ndrop versus no Nova blast 8 and I do\nfeel like there is slightly less foam\nthat you're standing on in the shoe in\nterms of what it feels like underfoot so\nit feels like it's a little bit less\ncushioned and it is a little bit more\nsnug in the forefoot and the Pegasus\nplus comes in at a substantial premium\nof $180 so while the Pegasus plus is one\nof my favorite daily Trainers for 2024 I\ndefinitely would pick the Nova blast 5\nso do I think that going into 2025 that\ndaily trainers absolutely have to have\nsuper Foams as table stakes in in order\nto be competitive I think the answer is\nno and I think that the FF blast Max and\nthe Nova blast 5 are really good\nexamples of that but I do think that as\nwe go and as that trend of putting super\nFoams into daily trainers continues what\nyou're doing with those Foams is going\nto have to be pretty special in order to\nkeep up if you have any other questions\nabout this shoe or any of the shoes that\nI mentioned today feel free to put them\nin the comments down below or better yet\nstop by the last thing I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I'll see\nyou in the next one yo what's going on\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

  "text": "it's time to take a look back at the\nbest running shoes of the Year these are\nthe top five daily trainers of\n[Music]\n2024 yo what's going on my name is kzi\nand I'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys about the\nbest daily trainers of 2024 but before I\ngive you this list I do want to go over\nsome disclosures nobody is paying me to\nmake this video nobody's paying me to be\nincluded on this list and no one's going\nto get a chance to preview any of my\nfootage or my thoughts before you guys\nget a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the best daily\ntrainers of 2024 and let's start with\nnumber five in the Five Spot this year\nis a Adas it is the Ido SL2 I'm really\nliking the updates to this shoe it is a\nkind of two foam Construction in here\nthere's a light strike po core which is\ntheir rasing foam and then there's a\nlight strike a regular Eva carrier on\nthe outside the upper fits really great\nthere's not too much padding on it and\nthe whole package stays really light\nthis shoe has a little bit more ground\nfeel than I typically like in my daily\ntrainers but because of both the price\npoint of this shoe and the way that this\nshoe feels for runs that for me are\nabout an hour or less I feel like this\nis a really great shoe for those who\naren't necessarily training for a\nmarathon so high school and college\ncross country runners or anyone training\nfor 5K 10ks up to the half marathon feel\nlike this is going to be an excellent\ndaily trainer it also looks fantastic so\nit can also serve double purpose for\ncasual wear as well coming in at number\nfour is a shoe that I think is a little\nbit underrated and that is the Hoka Max\n6 cuz it is just so lightweight Nimble\nand fun to run in now the the big change\nfor the Mach 6 is Hoka left the kind of\ntwo foam proly construction that they\nhad been using and went with a single\ntype of foam in the shoe and it's a very\nfun foam it compresses really nicely\nwhen you're put it to the ground but it\nalso snaps back and decompresses in a\nreally quick and pleasant way for both\neasy running and for picking up the pace\nas well also the upper fits on me really\ngreat and there is minimal padding in\nthis shoe it even has a little bit of an\nAchilles flare to avoid biting at the\nback of your foot so it's a very\ncomfortable but also Fun Shoot to run it\nnow for the number three spot I guess\nit's a return of this shoe to the market\nit is the Pegasus plus now it does say\nthat it's a turbo but Nike is doing\ntheir whole kind of renaming of all the\nexisting franchises in their lineup so\nthe Pegasus turbo is now going to be\ncalled the Pegasus plus and naming\nconventions aside and how much I dislike\nwhat they're doing with the names aside\nI feel like the Pegasus plus is a very\nsuccessful daily trainer they're using a\nmodified version of zumex in here I\ndon't think it's exactly what you're\ngetting in say the alphafly or in the\nvaporfly but it is a really nice pea\nbased foam that's in the midsole that\ngives you a lot of great comfort for\ndaily training but is lightweight and\ncan definitely pick up the pace the\nupper also feels really nice and it\nreminds me a lot of the Mach 6 but it is\na Nike shoe so the fit is a little bit\nmore snug now moving into the number two\nspot is a shoe that is parentally near\nthe top of my top five daily trainer\nlist and that's from as6 that is the\nNova blast 5 this shoe only came out in\nthe last month or so but already I've\nbeen loving the miles I've been able to\nput in this shoe in 2024 the Nova blast\n5 got an update to its phone from FF\nblast Eco to FF blast Max it's even\nlighter even spongier even more energy\nreturn in the foam and it's just a very\nfun ride the new jard mesh upper also\njust feels really great and I think it\ngives a little bit more room in the\nforefoot than we saw in previous\niteration so the Nova blast 5 takes the\nnumber two spot and that means coming in\nat the number one spot is a shoe from\nNew Balance and that is the rebel\nversion 4 this is a shoe that came out\nall the way in the beginning months of\nthe year and it's a shoe that I\nabsolutely fell in love with pretty much\nright away it's really lightweight and\ncan do just about everything from a\nworkout all the way down to an easy long\nrun and a lot of that's because of the\nfuel cell that they put in here now this\nisn't the same fuel cell that they put\nin their Racing shoes instead it is a\npeba and Eva blend but whatever they've\ndone to make that blend I feel like it's\nabsolutely perfect for a daily training\napplication because it squishes the\nright amount but it also can stay\nresilient and comfortable throughout\neven a very long run and because of that\nwide versatility the rebel version 4\ntakes my number one spot as best daily\ntrainer of 2024 but I do have one\nhonorable mention that I got to talk\nabout and that's another shoe from\nAdidas that's the Evo SL and the reason\nwhy it gets honorable mention and\ndoesn't take a spot in the regular top\nfive lineup is because technically this\nshoe doesn't come out until 2025 now a\nlot of people have run in it already and\nthere have been trickle drops across the\ninternet here and there but I think\nunless something's changed the actual\nGlobal release date for the shoe doesn't\nhappen until well into 2025 so so stay\ntuned for next year's best of daily\ntrainers to see where that shoe ranks so\nthose are my picks for best shoes of the\nyears I would love to know what you've\nbeen running in most as far as daily\ntrainers go let me know in the comments\ndown below or better yet stop by the\nlive stream than I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel love to talk to you guys over\nthere in the chat that's all I have for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking it all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\nn\n[Music]",

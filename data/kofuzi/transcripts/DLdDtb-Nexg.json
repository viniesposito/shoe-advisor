  "text": "over the past two and a half weeks I've\nbeen going over my favorite shoes of\n2024 but now it's time for the best of\nthe best I'm taking the winner of each\ncategory to see which shoe Can Come Away\nwith best in shoe these are my\ncontenders for shoe of the year\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kafui and\nI'm anite Runner who reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto go over my contenders for shoe of the\nYear 2024 but before I give you this\nlist I do want to go over some\ndisclosures these are all shoes that\nwere sent to me by their respective\nmanufacturers for the purpose of review\nso I did not have to pay for these shoes\nhowever nobody's paying me to make this\nvideo or to include their shoe on this\nlist and no one's going to get a chance\nto preview any of my footage of my\nthoughts before you guys get a chance to\nsee this video on YouTube so with that\ndisclosure out of the way let's talk\nabout the winners of each subcategory of\nrunning shoe that I've crowned already\nand because I've already talked about\nwhy I like these shoes so much I do want\nto spend a moment to talk about each of\nthese shoes where they fit in a rotation\nand why I think they're significant for\n2024 and going into 2025 first let's\nstart with the daily trainer that's\nwhere I always like to start whenever\nI'm thinking about running shoes and for\nthis year the daily trainer of the year\nwas from New Balance is the rebel\nversion 4 now I feel like this shoe is\nsignificant for a couple of reasons\nthere's an updated version of fuel cell\nin this shoe that is a peba blend so\nwe're starting to see race materials\nmake their way into more and more daily\ntraining applications and for that\nreason it's significant but for me it's\nsignificant because I've always thought\nthat pea blend meant some sort of a\ncompromise a price point compromise or a\ndurability compromise but the rebel\nversion 4 proved to me that I feel like\nthis foam is exactly what it needs to be\nand so they didn't just Chuck in a bunch\nof peba and make it a pure pea midsole\njust for the sake of having that line\navailable to them in marketing they\nactually made the midso do what it needs\nto do and the other reason why I think\nit's significant is again from like the\nmarketing perspective they didn't hide\nthe fact that it's a peba blend and so\nthey told us right from the beginning\nthat this is a little bit of peba a\nlittle bit of Eva mixed together into a\nsuper critical process to make this foam\nand even though fuel cell is the trade\nname for New Balances racing caliber\nFoams again they weren't afraid that it\nwould dilute the brand recognition of\nwhat fuel cell is by having one that\nmight they might use in racing\napplications like in the SC Elite\nversion 4 and a different kind of fuel\ncell that's available in the rebel\nversion 4 so they made the foam that\nthey needed to make for the type of shoe\nthat they wanted to make it ended up\nbeing an excellent shoe and they weren't\nscared of what the ingredients were in\norder to make that product and for that\nkind of transparency and for the\nExcellence of this product the rebel\nversion 4 made it to my daily trainer of\nthe year now from daily trainers the\nnext shoe that I typically like to add\ninto a rotation is a racing shoe and\nfrom the racing category Puma brought us\nthe Nitro Elite 3 this shoe is\nsignificant for two things one is\nbecause while it wasn't the first shoe\nto introduce us to aliphatic TPU as a\nrace caliber material it's one that uses\nit exceptionally well and so we're\ngetting all the benefits of that\naliphatic TPU the bounciness of it the\nshock absorption of it but also the\ndurability of it in a race product but\nit also is important because this shoe I\nthink marks the beginning of the next\nlevel of carbon plate shoe Wars which\nthe battlefield is going to be in the\nweight and this shoe is extremely light\nit's one of the lightest shoes that's\navailable on the market right now and\nwhile there are a couple of shoes\nlighter there are a very few number of\nshoes that are this light and also this\nsuitable for racing a Marathon distance\nnot only for Elites and Pros but also\nfor non- Elites as well and so for those\nInnovations and what I think it will\nMark the beginning of in the next few\nyears in terms of what we're going to\nsee race product doing I felt like the\nNitro Elite 3 deserved the top spot as\nthe racing shoe of the year and then\nanother shoe that I like to put kind of\nin between the daily trainer and the\nracing shoe is the tempo shoe or the\nsession shoe it kind of has some\nfeatures of the daily trainer but some\nfeatures of AO but I really like to use\nit for workouts and again we have\nanother entrant from puma and this is\nthe deviate Nitro 3 now one of the\nthings that's unique about this shoe is\nthat it didn't change all that much and\nfor me that's a really good thing\nbecause the DV8 Nitro 2 was my shoe of\nthe year last year but there were a\nlittle tweaks in the upper that made the\nfit a little bit more suitable to its\ntask and there were very small shape\nchanges to the MSL that I think made it\na little bit more exciting still\ncompared to the already excellent shoe\nof last year so this shoe I think is\nsignificant in the sense that it reminds\nme that if you have a really excellent\nshoe with really excellent material you\ndon't always have to reinvent the wheel\nevery single year in order to stay on\ntop the DV8 Nitro 3 remains an excellent\nshoe and it was my top Tempo trainer of\nthe year now let's get into the shoes\nthat you might want to run in when you\nare beat up from all those Tempo\nworkouts and from your racing and that's\nthe max cushion category and this year\nfor me this was the glisser and Mac this\nwas a completely new shoe type from\nBrooks and I think it is an a great\nexposition of what I'm looking for in\nmodern Max cushion now we still have the\nidea of the classic Max cushion we have\nthe Bondies the atmos the more version 5\nthose are shoes that I think we still\nneed in the running space but as far as\nwhat I like and what's more modern I\nlove what's going on with the glycerin\nMax it's giving us what I think is a\nreimagined version of what plushness and\ncomfort are it's not just stinging a\nwhole bunch of memory foam in a tongue\nand in a heel collar but instead it's\ngiving us Comfort up top and a great\namount of squishiness on the bottom that\nisn't too mushy and so you're not\ngetting completely mired down in\nquicksand as you're running it's just\nthe right amount of excellent softness\nit's super comfortable for me and I love\nwhat it could mean from the future of\nBrooks as they expand to appeal to\ndifferent types of running consumers\nthan they typically have been targeting\nand then the last category of shoe that\nI want to talk about at the far end of\nthe spectrum is I think a newer category\nof shoe a subgenre of the max cushion\nMarket if you want it is the long run\nshoe and these are shoes that can do a\nlot of the same things that Max cushion\nshoes do and maybe this category\ndisappears in a couple years depending\non what Max cushion does in the future\nbut for now I consider this a separate\nsubcategory because it uses a lot of\nracing materials in the midsole and it\ngenerally tries to keep things more\nminimal in terms of puffiness and\npadding in the upper if we look at the\nsuper Blast 2 I think it's a great\nexample of that we've got a bunch of FF\nturbo plus which is the foam that\nthey're using in their latest gen Racing\nshoes from as6 a little bit of daily\ntraining foam on the bottom to help keep\nthings stabilized and this heel collar\nhas less padding in it than the Glide\nride Max or the Nimbus might have so\nit's trying to keep things a little bit\nmore Nimble even though it's in this Max\ncushion type of package I've really been\nenjoying these YP of shoes for runs that\nare not only long but also have a little\nbit of pace changes in them those are my\nfavorite kind of long runs to do and\nthese are shoes that I feel like are\npurpose built for it this shoe along\nwith the Invincible I think pretty much\ninvented the category and it's been the\ntype of shoe that I've been most excited\nabout in the last couple of years and\nfor that reason the super Blast 2 is a\nsignificant shoe and not only just an\nexcellent example of its class and so\namongst these shoes I think you have a\nreally fantastic albe it expensive but a\nreally fantastic and fun running shoe\nrotation most people don't need to get\nall five of these shoes and if I were to\nboil it down to just one shoe to have of\nall these shoes that shoe for me would\nbe the Puma devi8 Nitro 3 this is going\nto be two for two a repeat for the devi8\nNitro Series in taking shoe of the year\nI think it can do easy running it can do\nfast running it could do long running\nit's maybe not the best recovery run\nshoe but I think that if you wanted to\nget one and only one shoe from racing to\nrecovery run the DV8 Nitro 3 could be\nthat shoe and for that reason that's why\nit's my 2024 shoe of the year so those\nare my thoughts on the best running\nshoes of 2024 it has been a great year\nto be a runner and I could say that from\na personal perspective it has been a\ngreat year to be a shoe reviewer I've\nhad a great time testing and reviewing\nthese shoes and I've particularly\nenjoyed talking to you guys about how\nthese shoes feel on foot I'm really\nexcited for what's to come in 2025 and\nI've already started testing a bunch of\nnew shoes hit the Subscribe button so\nyou could see those reviews as they\nbecome available next year but that's\ngoing to be the end of this video and\nthe end of my running shoe review videos\nfor 2024 thanks so much for making it\nall the way to the end of this video and\nthis year and I look forward to seeing\nyou in\n2025 yo what's going on\n[Music]\nn\n[Music]",

  "text": "this is the adios Pro 4 and by the time\nit releases it will have been 2 and 1/2\nyears since this shoe has gotten an\nupdate and while it's certainly a\nstunning shoe was it worth the wait it's\ntime to lace up the adios pro4 and take\nit for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm an not only Runner reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the adios\nPro 4 but before I give you my thoughts\non this shoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nAdidas sent to me for the purpose of\nreview so I didn't have to pay for these\nshoes however no one's paying me to make\nthis video or to include their shoe in\nthis video no one knows which other\nshoes I'm going to include in this video\nand no one's going to get a chance to\npreview any of my footage or my thoughts\nbefore you guys get a chance to see this\nvideo on YouTube so with that disclosure\nout of the way let's talk about the\nadios Pro 4 and let's start with the\nspecs this is a 39 mm stack heite shoe\nwith a 6 mm drop giving us 33 mm of\nStack height in the 4 foot and in this\nshoe we have two components the first is\nLight Strike Pro and the second is the\nenergy rods 2.0 now as far as the Light\nStrike Pro goes it's the same name that\nthey're using for the foam that goes in\nthis shoe that they used for last year's\nadios Pro 3 but it's a different\nformulation of foam than what's in the\nadios Pro 3 it's also different than the\nsimilarly named Light Strike Pro foam\nthat's in the adios Pro Evo one so now\nwe have three different Foams from\nAdidas they are all labeled Light Strike\nPro but they're all very different as\nfar as the energy rods are concerned\nthough I believe that energy rods 2.0\nare the same energy rods that were used\nboth in the adios Pro 3 and in the Evo\none so there isn't to much different\ngoing on there but those energy rods are\nintended to serve a function that's very\nsimilar to what a carbon fiber plate\nwould do in a marathon racing shoe now\nto protect all this foam and energy rods\nwe have light traction on the outsole as\nwell as a little island of Continental\nrubber now the light traction portion is\nthe rubber that used to be almost kind\nof clear that's on this shoe here now\nit's a little bit stained and dirty from\nthe miles that I put on this shoe and\nthen the Continental is this colored\npiece of rubber right here right\nunderneath kind of where the big toe\nwould be now Adidas tells me and I don't\nknow if they were supposed to tell me\nthis or if I'm supposed to be telling\nyou but I'm going to tell it to you\nanyway now Adidas tells me that the\nrubbers that they have been developing\nthe rubber compound that they've been\ndeveloping for the outsoles of their\nracing product have similar\ncharacteristics in terms of traction and\ndurability as the Continental product\nbut they tell me that their Elite\nathletes as well as their customers\nreally enjoy seeing that Continental\nco-branding that's on the outo there so\nthat's why they've maintained certain\naspects of content to rubber on their\nshoes I'm not positive that's the only\nreason why there's a small section of\ncontent rubber on the adios Pro 4 but I\ndo know that that is the case for the\nrubber compound that they made for the\nadios Pro Evo one even though there are\nsome Elite athletes that prefer to have\na more traditional Continental rubber\nouto on their Evo ones moving to the\nupper we have a new oper for this year\nas well it's Adidas's light lock\nmaterial it looks very similar in terms\nof the Aesthetics and the design of the\nevo1 but the materials are quite\ndifferent if we look at the Evo one's\nupper it's almost seethrough and Adidas\ntells me that that transparency or near\ntransparency is a met4 for the absolute\nlightness of the shoe with the light\nlock we're getting kind of a rip stop\ntype of material material with a diamond\npattern through here but it's still very\nlightweight although it's not the most\nbreathable of materials overall it kind\nof feels like kind of like a fabcy paper\nalmost like currency like like money and\none of the things that I really\nappreciate about the tongue on this shoe\nis that they've kind of taken a lot of\nthe similar materials that they used in\nthe tongue of the adios Pro 3 and made\nit in the shape of the tongue on the EVO\nOne although they did make it a little\nbit bigger so it's a bit easier to get\nyour foot into the shoe and it's also a\nlot easier to get the tongue settled as\nyou're lacing down and cinching\neverything up there's a little bit of\nbumper pads around the back of the heel\nin fact there's a little bit more I\nthink in the adios Pro 4 than have been\nin some of the previous shoes like the\nEVO One and the adios Pro 3 but all\nthese are intended to make the shoe a\nlittle bit more comfortable and help\nkeep your heel in place I did feel like\ngetting a really good lock down in the\nheel was a little bit difficult and took\na little a little bit of effort and I\nthink for some of you who kind of\nconstantly have problems with heel lock\ndown this one still might not quite be\nprecise enough for your liking otherwise\nI felt like in terms of fit goes this\nshoe was true to size for me I went with\nmy usual running shoe size 9 and I felt\nlike that was the perfect size altoe\nthis shoe comes in at a very lightweight\nAdidas says that this shoe should come\nin at around 200 g for a reference size\nI do happen to be reference size US\nmen's signs 9 mine came a little bit\nheavier than that 206 G and 7.2\n[Music]\nOz now that we've talked about what this\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat the shoe is like on foot I'm\nabsolutely loving the updates to the\nadios Pro 4 it feels like a lighter shoe\nthat allows for quicker turnover there's\na great amount of compression in the\nfoam and I'm liking the updates to this\nnew Light Strike Pro not only is the\nfoam lighter but I also feel like it's\ncompressing a little bit more while\nstill retaining a really great amount of\nthe responsiveness and bounciness that\nlight strike pro has always been known\nfor running in the two shoes kind of\nlike in series one after another I find\nthat I'm gravitating towards the foam\nthat's in the adios Pro 4 and every time\nI go from adios Pro 4 back to adios Pro\n3 the adios Pro 3 almost feels firm for\nme and what my foot and stride ER I'm\ndefinitely enjoying the response that\nI'm getting back in terms of compression\nand decompression from the Light Strike\nPro in the adios Pro 4 now there's some\nchanges to the geometry of the shoe that\nI think make for some improvements in\nthe shoe and the first kind of way that\nthe geometry is different is that\nthey've kind of made the adios Prof for\na little bit narrower it at the front of\nthe shoe and that's something that I\nappreciate because we've seen a trend in\nthe last year or maybe more where every\nshoe seems to be getting wider in in the\nhopes of making that shoe a little bit\nmore stable without having to add a ton\nof stability elements and that's even\ninfiltrated into some of our race\nproduct that we see on the market today\nnow I don't necessarily think that's\nwhat was going on with the adios Pro 3\nuh I think that this is wide in the\nforfeit because they were trying to make\nthis kind of like gigantic almost\ncircular landing pad for you to be able\nto hit the ground and push off on now in\nthis year's version they have kind of\nnarrowed that a little bit it's still\nreally wide almost kind of like at that\nbase of the pad under your pinky toe but\nthen it kind of flares in a little bit\nmore aggressively but it does make the\nshoe narrower as you are Towing off and\nI feel like what that does is it makes\nthe shoe feel a little bit more Nimble\nnow the other way in which that the\ngeometry is changed is that they moved\nwhere the rocker starts on this shoe now\nthey've adopted at least what they say\non paper is a 60% rocker position and\nbut what they mean by that is as you go\nthrough the 100% length of the shoe The\nRocker starts at the 60% position I'm\nI'm not positive on it but I believe\nwith the aios Pro 3 The Rocker didn't\nstart or this curl on the shoe didn't\nstart till 70% into the shoe now the\nthing that they say is that the 60%\nnumber is pulled directly from the Evo\none I'm not sure if it kind of actually\nis or if it just is because there's a\nbevel over on this part of the shoe but\nthe main rocker starts maybe at 65 % in\neither it feels earlier than it did in\nthe I Pro 3 but it doesn't feel quite as\nearly as in the EVO One But at the end\nof the day I do feel the change and I\nappreciate wherever this number actually\nis I like the position where it is on\nthe adios pro4 I feel like on the EVO\nOne The Rocker starts maybe just a\nlittle bit too early at least for a non-\nelite Runner like me now when it comes\nto sizing and Fit I feel like the adios\nPro 3 has the most generous fit and it\nalso has some of those similar problems\nwhere the heel can be a little bit\nfinicky to lock down especially with the\nthin laces that Adas is using they\naren't very grippy at all so it's hard\nto kind of like selectively apply\npressure in different areas of the shoes\ndepending on where you might need it on\nthe other hand even though there is the\nsame slippery laces in the evo1 I feel\nlike that upper is just a lot more snug\non the foot and so it's a lot harder to\nget in the shoe when you're in it the\nmaterial wraps on to your foot a little\nbit more tightly and it feels like\nthere's just a little bit less room in\nthere I don't think that the size is\nwrong I think that's just the cut and\nfit that they're looking for the adios\nPro 4 sits in between those two where it\nhas a little bit less room than the\nadios Pro 3 and a little bit more room\nthan the EVO\n[Music]\nOne now before we wrap the video Let's\nzoom out for a moment and see where the\nadios Pro 4 fits Within an Adidas lineup\nand while there are a lot of different\nkinds of shoes that Adidas makes and\nthose all cater to different preferences\nlet's build a lineup that I would enjoy\nand I think someone who's enjoying the\nadios Pro 4 would also enjoy and so\nwhenever I talk about shoes and a\nrotation I always like to start with the\ndaily trainer and for Adidas right now I\nthink the best one is the Azo SL it's\nthe shoe that you're going to run a lot\nof daily training miles in and this\none's really great for it because it\ndoes have Light Strike Pro Different\nLight Strike Pro that's what in the\naudio Pro 4 but a Light Strike Pro foam\nwhich is really nice and then it has a\nmore daily training foam as a carrier\naround that core of foam but it's great\nto log those everyday miles and it's got\nplenty of durability built into it and\nthen where the adios Pro 4 would fit in\nis as the racing shoe that you would\nreach for on race day uh so this is for\nyour biggest workouts your races uh this\nis the shoe that you're going to really\nenjoy now for your recovery runs and for\nruns that are going to be a little bit\nmore chill and relax in what you want\nfor your daily trainer there's a couple\nof options out there but right now let's\ntalk about the ultra boost 5 and the\nultra boost 5x the difference between\nthose two models is that one has a cage\nover here that kind of uh plastic piece\nthat gives you a little bit more support\nI prefer the one that doesn't have the\nplastic cage on it and I'm going to put\nthat over here cuz it's for days where\nyou want to be a little bit more relaxed\nyou're not worried as much about pace\nyou're wored a little bit more about\njust pampering yourself now if you have\nworkouts that are going to be a little\nbit faster than what might need for your\ndaily trainer and maybe not quite as big\nor maybe not quite as long uh as what\nyou're going to use for your Marathon\nracer that's where I think a shoe like\nthe tkumi senent comes into play the\nTumi sent has been penally one of my\nfavorite shoes that Adidas makes every\nyear uh and this one is really great for\n5K 10K racing and any of those faster\nworkouts anything that's faster than you\nmight want to use for a marathon Racing\ntype of shoe and then if you really want\nto go crazy and add a fifth shoe to this\nlineup that's s a shoe like the prime X\nX2 strong can come in this is a shoe\nthat has two layers of carbon fiber\nplates and Light Strike Pro all\nthroughout the shoe although again a\nDifferent Light Strike Pro than what's\nin the adios Pro 4 and this is a really\nfun shoe for long runs if you're going\nto be putting some speed into those long\nruns so it is a jumbo shoe but it's not\nexactly like a MX cushion super relaxed\nplush shoe uh it is comfortable but it's\nreally designed for those times where\nyou're going to be in your shoes for a\nlong time and but still want a little\nbit of extra oomph to it because you're\ngoing to be putting in either marathon\npace miles or uptempo miles that are\nfaster than just easy and certainly\nfaster than recovery and so this would\nbe kind of like the five shoes that I\nthink right now make a lot of sense\ntogether as an Adidas running\n[Music]\nlineup now let's wrap up the video by\ntalking about the buying guide and we'll\nalso talk about some Alternatives that\nyou're likely already considering the\nAdidas adios Pro 4 is a lighter and\nfaster shoe I think it's a really great\nblend of its predecessor and also the\nEVO One I feel like it takes really\ngreat aspects of each of the shoes to\nmake a great product that I think Pros\nare going to enjoy but I think that non-\nElites especially are going to really\ngravitate towards it'll be on sale in\nJanuary of 2025 for\n$250 and that's quite a bit of time away\nso let's take a look at some of those\nAlternatives that are available now and\nI'm using air quotes because we're\nhalfway through or more than halfway\nthrough fall Marathon season so while\nthey're technically on the market they\nmay be a little bit difficult to find\nbut in either event let's talk about\nsome of that competition I mean I feel\nlike the first two shoes that I need to\ntalk about are the shoes we've already\nbeen talking about this entire video and\nthat's going to be either the EVO One or\nthe adios Pro 3 these are two shoes that\nare currently available although I'm not\nreally recommending the EVO One and the\nmain reason for that is that it's a $500\nshoe that doesn't really have the\ndurability that I would want for a shoe\nthat I'm going to recommend to you guys\nto spend\n$500 on and I do think that's it's\nprobably the closest thing to the adios\nPro 4 but for most people the\nalternative that I'm really going to be\nrecommending is the adios Pro 3 this is\na shoe that's been available for about 2\nyears at this point at the time this\nvideo was shot and you can find it\nusually for $250 at the full price for\nsome of the latest colors or you might\nbe able to find it at a discount for\nsome of the other colors that are\navailable it's still a really great shoe\nnow that I running the adios Pro 4 the\nadios Pro 3 has lost a little bit of its\nshine but until you run in the adios Pro\n4 if you haven't done it yet the adios\nPro 3 is probably going to be the racing\nshoe from Adidas that I'm going to be\nrecommending to people if you are part\nof that three stripes life but now let's\ntake a look at the one shoe from another\nbrand that I'll talk about today that I\nthink doesn't really feel the same but I\nknow a lot of you guys are going to be\nthinking about and that's from the\nswoosh and this is the alphafly version\n3 currently I think it's fair to say\nthat this is the fastest shoe in the\nworld at least when it comes to Marathon\nbecause this shoe is the shoe that\nKelvin Kipton ran the men's World\nMarathon record in and it's the same\nshoe that Ruth chapen Getti ran the\nwomen's world record marathon in just a\ncouple weeks ago in Chicago in fact both\nof those records were set on the streets\nof the Chicago in this shoe now the\ndifferences between these shoe are\nsubstantial in comparison to the fit of\nthe adios Pro 4 the fit on the alpy 3 is\ngenerous if not almost baggy which is a\nweird thing to say about an alpha 5 3\ncuz the alpha 5 typically every year\nhave been a bit of a toe cruncher this\none the fit is much more accommodating\nthe one thing that I will say though is\nwhile I do love a really good knit\nmaterial and this is really good racing\nknit material the edges of of this shoe\nare very harsh so if you like to wear\nlow socks and you're old like I am uh\nyou're going to have to be careful\nbecause uh anytime it does touch your\nbare skin it's going to make you bleed a\nbit of your old blood but in terms of\nthe real Essences of these shoes let's\ntalk about the midsoles and the midsole\nTechnologies I feel like the Zoom\nairpods that are in the alphafly 3 feel\nvery different in comparison it almost\nfeels a bit clunky and a bit harsh when\nyou're landing on those foot pads it\nkind of reminded me of like when you're\nrunning across a kind of like a plywood\nsubfloor where there's like a bounce to\nit and it's noisy uh those are the kind\nof two things that I felt when I was\nrunning in the alpha 5 3 most recently\nI'm not really sure what the exact right\nword for it is that it's kind of feels\nrickety in in comparison to the\nsmoothness that I'm feeling out of the\nadios Pro 4 but then on the other hand\nlike the noise aside the ritin aside and\nkind of that almost mechanical feeling\nthat I get from the zoom airpods that\nare in here I feel like there's still an\nefficiency to the shoe that can't be\ndenied I feel like it's a really great\nset it and forget it kind of shoe it\nknows how to find what your Marathon\nlevel effort is and it helps you just\nrun in that for mile after mile after\nMile and it's an excellent racing shoe\nit just feels very different than what\nyou're getting in the adios Pro 4 but to\nthe Alpha's credit even though it feels\nlike it's a heavier shoe and the adios\nPro 4 feels like it's a much lighter\nshoe the alha 5 3 only comes in 2/10 of\nan ounce heavier at 7.4 oun so it's also\na very lightweight and efficient shoe so\ndepending on what you like I think\nthat's going to help you decide which\none is the best for you and I think\nthat's something that's going to be a\ntheme for all of the super shoes that\nare reviewing in 2024 into 2025 we're at\na point where it's not just one brand\nhaving one great product that's way\nbetter than everything else many brands\nhave a good race product if not multiple\nreally good race product and which one\nis the best is really going to depend on\nwho's doing the running in them it's\nabout matching the right Runner with the\nright tool so those are my thoughts on\nthe adios Pro 4 let me know in the\ncomments if you any questions about this\nshoe or any of the shoes that I talked\nabout today or better yet stop by the\nlive stream that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run cpub\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking it all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]",

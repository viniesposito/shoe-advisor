  "text": "I've been flying all over the world to\nenjoy racing and the running community\nand now it's my turn to play host and\nwelcome everyone to my home turf so it's\ntime to hop on the L and head to the\nloop this is a runner's weekend at the\nChicago marathon\n[Music]\nyo what's going on it is about 2 o'clock\nin the afternoon on a Thursday race\nweekend here in Chicago I'm currently at\nthe Expo which doesn't make sense\nbecause I'm not running for the first\ntime in a long time but I'm here because\nI'm doing something I've never done at\nChicago and that's talk on a panel in\nthe expo hall I'm going to be doing that\nwith Lindsey hind in just a little bit\nI'm early though so let's take a look\ninside and see what the marathon XO has\nto offer this year\n[Music]\nthe packet pickup area looked pretty\nempty very organized Chicago is always\nvery efficient let's see if I can find\nany\nfriends look at look at this\nguy\n[Music]\nW just stopped by the rabbit Booth\nthey're doing some Screen\nPrinting and basically the main thing I\nwant to do is say hi to everybody make\nsure we're all set for the event\ntomorrow and then also take a quick\nphoto so I can put out a reminder that\nthe event is tomorrow for\neveryone and let's see what else is\n[Music]\naround yes of course my new\n[Music]\nfian it's starting to get a little bit\nbusy in\nhere most of the booths are are kind of\nsmall looks like an has a pretty big\n[Music]\nBooth got a little bit of\ntime very thirsty let's find something\nto drink\n[Music]\nguys it's almost time for me to get up\non\nstage I don't\nsee around\nanywhere I'm sure Lindsay will be here\nsomewhere he's got a little bit of time\nI feel like Lindsay's been on stage all\nday today\nmost people watching this already know\nwho Lindsay Hine is but for those who\ndon't Lindsay has her own successful\nrunning podcast and she and I are part\nof a larger group of personalities who\nare on a different podcast called relay\nthis session was supposed to feature a\ncouple additional relay members and we\nwere going to talk about our favorite\nMarathon memories but flights got\nimpacted coming into Chicago so it's\njust Lindsay and me yo what's going on\nLindsay had never actually interviewed\nme before so we dug deep down into the\nkofuzi origin story now panels at Expose\nare always hard because the Acoustics\nare terrible and people are constantly\ncoming in and out but Lindsay is a great\ninterviewer and a good number of people\nstuck around afterwards there was some\nselfie time and Lindsay and the sound\nguy from the Expo could have just been\nbeing nice but they did say that gayen\nRuff was also on a panel earlier in the\nday and more people got in line for\nselfies with me than they did for him\nit's not a contest but that did put a\nlittle feather in my\n[Music]\ncap that is all the\nSelfies Lindsay left she's going to go\nto her hotel she said but I think there\nis a industry like Social Hour happy\nhour so everyone that's at like the Expo\nexhibiting is going to be doing like\nthere's a party I guess so I've never\nheard of that that before so let's check\nthat\n[Music]\nout the Expo is shedding down the bar is\ngetting set\n[Music]\nup started here in 5 minutes the bar is\nnow open though if you would like to\ngrab a drink before we get started\napparently at the end of the first day\nof the Expo there's a little party for\nall the exhibitors the race director for\nthe Chicago marathon says a few words\nabout how many people came through the\nexpo hall that day and he thanks\neveryone for helping make the Chicago\nMarathon Expo a\nsuccess the charity groups are invited\nto and it was a nice surprise to see\nsome friends there and the baa guy who I\nsee everywhere but I've never met was\nit's also there that's it from the XEL\nand the industry Social\nHour the happy hour now we're going to\nget some dinner\n[Music]\nLindsay had made dinner reservations for\na bunch of us and we went to Robert's\nPizza which I had never been to before\nit's in streeterville locals don't ever\nreally eat in streeterville but the food\nwas good and Peter finally made it into\ntown the Ambiance was delightful and it\nwas good to have a quiet dinner with\nfriends before things got really hectic\ngood morning it is currently a little\nbit after 9:00 a.m. on a Friday here in\nChicago this year my Chicago Marathon\ncoverage is going to be different than\nwhat I normally do because normally I\nrun the race this year I'm going to try\nand cover it more like a journalist\nlet's go pick up my media\n[Music]\ncredentials months ago I had applied for\nmedia credentials I was hoping for a\nstarting Corral and finish line access\nis part of my coverage of the American\nPro women specifically at first Chicago\nmarathon was all confused and kept\nasking what Outlet am I from and I told\nthem I'm just a YouTuber but I cover\nraces and sent them links to some of my\nprevious\n[Music]\nwork eventually they came back and said\nI could have some access although not\nbehind the finish line and I felt like\nthat was good enough at least they\ndidn't say no but when I kept getting\nemails about scheduling for the press\nconference and which athletes would be\nin attendance there I thought that my\nlevel of access included being able to\ngo to the press conference but\napparently that was not the case they\nwere really nice about it but they\nweren't allowing me in all right thank\nyou very\nmuch all right guys so I was not allowed\ninto the press conference I have some\ncredentials but my credentials Aren't\nEnough credential to get into the press\nconference on the plus side I found\nPeter hey also rejected from the press\nconference yeah so I feel a little bit\nless Bad Peter didn't get in also P\nAlvarez who shoots really great stuff\nand is here to shoot for A6 also\ncouldn't get to the press conference so\nI feel like I'm in good company is but\nnow we've got some extra time on the\ncalendar so we're going to go check out\ntracki the tracksmith pop pu has been in\nthe same space for several years now and\nwhile part of me wishes they would try\nsomething different the fact that they\nare choosing tradition over novelty is\njust about the most East Coast thing\nthat this New England brand could do\nit's still one of the best opportunities\nyou'll have to touch and feel so much of\nthe tracksmith catalog in one place at\none time and their Marathon Majors merch\nis always topnotch plus they had\ntracksmith bananas\n[Music]\nall right that's it from the tracksmith\npopup it's always so dark in there it's\nhard to really photograph but they\nalways do such a nice\njob now let's head over to\n[Music]\nbandit in contrast to the tradition of\ntracksmith bandit has reinvented itself\nevery year in Chicago this year's theme\nwas Architects Studio which works well\nfor a city that has had to rebuild\nitself from literal ashes and whose\nArchitects were charged with the Mantra\nmake no small\nplans it took us over an hour to get\ninto the space but the time passed\nquickly I was in line with friends and I\nkept bumping into other people I knew\nthis line for Bandit is super long never\nseen anything like\n[Music]\nthis hey how's it going camera good to\nsee you again man how are you yeah I'm\ndoing good good to see you\n[Music]\nyeah once inside the space delivered on\nthe architect's theme race product was\nflying off the shelves and there was\ncoffee and going back to that\narchitect's Mantra the full quote from\nDaniel Burnham goes like this make no\nsmall plans for they have no magic to\nstir men's blood and probably the eles\nwill not be\nrealized I've always thought that this\nwas a good quote for both Architects and\nRunners left the Bandit popup it was a\nreally long wait but very well done in\nthere they\nalways have such a great takes on what\nmodern retail should look like it's\namazing uh Peter's going to head back to\nthe Expo I don't know what he's doing\nthere but he's got to go back suggested\nhe take a divy bike uh and now\nI think I have enough\ntime to go for a run so I'm going to\nstop on my car change real quick and\nthen hit the L from cuz I haven't done\nthat in a long\ntime before we moved out to the far\nsuburbs a couple years ago I used to run\nthese routes every day and I've been\nback since but for some reason on this\nparticular run I was feeling nostalgic\nthe old shoes that I really love testing\nhere the frustrations of low heart rate\ntraining and the Relentless windiness of\nWinter the memories all came flooding\nback today and for a moment I wondered\nif maybe perhaps the pavement remembered\nme too it didn't feel like it did and\nwhile I was feeling suddenly very lonely\nit was overall good to turn the legs\nover and enjoy the Run\nhalfway into the run about 3 and 1 half\nmiles from\ndowntown sure do\n[Music]\nmiss now I've been thinking about the\npress conference thing all morning and I\nwas kind of sour about it but before any\nanyone gets all mad at Chicago marathon\num I do want to say that they did turn a\nlot of people away from the press\nconference like hoe uh kzy couldn't get\nin there um I think they ultimately let\nhim in but he forgot his like\ncredentials up in his hotel room and\nwhen he didn't have them they wouldn't\nlet him in so I mean they were pretty\nstrict about who they were letting into\nthe press conference um\nbut I'm not sure but I think that when I\nrequested media credentials\nI only requested like start line and\nfinish line access I don't know if I had\nto specifically state that I wanted\naccess to the press conference or\nnot if that's the case and I didn't then\nthat's on me but I'm not sure I don't\nremember\nanyway I thought that the uh ShakeOut\nrun was like kind of far and I thought I\nmight have to move my car but it's\nactually just up the street so I'm going\nto leave my car here and head over\n[Music]\nthe first ShakeOut run that I would be\nhosting for Chicago marathon weekend was\nat industry ALS it's a pretty new spot\nin Chicago and it was gorgeous on the\ninside rabbit was there to support the\nkafui Run club by letting us demo their\nnew Dreamchaser shoe and most\nimportantly they provided a space for us\nall to\n[Music]\nmeet oh\non I love it I love it\nawesome after we put on some new shoes\nand chatted for a bit rabbit Sam\nwelcomed everyone and explained the\nroute and then we were off for a sunset\nrun\nyo all right thank you guys thank\nyou the route took us over to the\nlakefront and over to the Planetarium at\nthe turnaround point we waited for the\nentire group to assemble and then of\ncourse we took a selfie we are a mile\nand a half into the\nRun got beautiful sunset Chicago is\nreally treating us\ntoday fun fact this is where my wife and\nI took our wedding photos about 17 years\nprior we then took the same route back\nto Industry ALS and headed to the\nupstairs bar for some rehydration with a\nspecial rabbit 26.2 Brew there was food\nrabbit raffled off a bunch of prizes and\nthe atmosphere was perfect for a Friday\n[Music]\n[Music]\nnight good morning everybody it is 8:15\nin the morning in Chicago on a\nSaturday the day before the marathon So\ntoday we're going on a ShakeOut run\nlet's go meet in Lincoln Park find\neveryone at as6 and\n[Music]\nFleet for coming pretty much from the\nmoment I got to the a6m Fleet Feet event\non Saturday morning I was sworn for\nselfies this was incredibly flattering\nand I'm always honored to do it it means\nso much to me that on the day before\nyour marathons you all would wait in\nline just to spend a moment with with me\nI love hearing about how far you've come\nto get where you are what your goals are\nfor the race and I'm always happy to\ngive tips for Chicago marathon or for\nyour cheer squad to get around the city\nbut at a certain point after all the A6\ndemo shoes were handed out Fleet feed\nmade sure that I got everyone together\nfor our group photo before we headed out\nfor the run all right welcome\n[Music]\n[Applause]\neverybody there's a lot of people here\nif it's your first Mar thought tomorrow\nraise your\nhand\nawesome a lot of you guys have been\nasking me for one piece of advice and\nthe one thing that I'll tell you is\neverything you need to do tomorrow you\nalready have within you to do tomorrow\nyou're going to be able to do it you've\nalready put in the work you guys are\nready go out there and enjoy those\n[Applause]\n26.2 you guys ready yeah\nyo and then we were off Fleet Fe\nprovided the Pacers to lead out multiple\ngroups and we went North along the\nlakefront what's going on man good to\nsee you how are you thanks for\ncoming it was a bit windy which made the\nwaters choppy and it was like Chicago\nwas saying yesterday was about the\nskyline and to today is about the Great\nLake guys we've hit the turnaround point\nwe got 1.7\nmiles we're going to head back let have\nT-shirts pancakes and\ncelf when we got back to Lincoln Park\nas6 and Fleet Feet provided pre-race\npancakes and syrup my apologies to all\nthe Canadians who attended for the\ncaliber of our maple syrup we do the\nbest we can on this side of the border\nand the shirts that as6 made for the\nkafui Run Club this year were incredible\nas6 has been making kafui run Club\nshirts for the Chicago ShakeOut every\nyear and every year it's one of my\nfavorite things that I get to be a part\nof a couple notes about the t-shirts\nthough I know some of you didn't get a\nshirt even though you had a confirmed\nRSVP and that the distribution setup\nbenefits the fastest Runners I'm aware\nof the issue and I will try to figure\nout something different for next year\nalso I don't know know why the shirts\nsay 2025 I did approve the final\ngraphics and I don't recall there being\nany year on the shirt at all but it's\nalmost 100% certain that I didn't catch\nthe error so that one's on me last thing\nI want to say about the event is thank\nyou to chase Fleming my videographer for\nthe weekend he not only helped me\nprovide footage from this event but he\nalso helped film The Rabbit event the\nnight before and also some key moments\nfrom the marathon itself this entire\nvideo just wouldn't be the same without\nhis contribution and I'll be working\nwith him again in New York so if you see\nhim make sure to say\nhi all right\nguys ran all the miles took all the\nSelfies I did not eat any of the\npancakes though I didn't have time for\nthat but hopefully you guys enjoyed the\nbreakfast now Chase and I we're going to\ngo check out the on\n[Music]\nstore an did team up with a local\nBrewery and run club for a Chicago\npresence this year but I had scheduling\nconflicts for a lot of those events so\ninstead Chase and I went to check out\ntheir new permanent location near Rush\nand Division which is the exact right\nlocation for an on store if you know\nChicago the store was pristine and I\nlove the slide out shoe shelves there\nwere a lot of shoes that I had not ever\nseen before and while some were pretty\nexciting that excitement is tempered by\nthe fact that I often can't tell if if\nan on shoe is a running shoe or just run\ninspired the apparel though was crisp\nand neat on has always excelled in the\napparel and accessories Department\neverything they make is just so\n[Music]\ngood finished checking out the on store\nhas a nice new permanent space there I\nlove the way that they do\nretail I then dropped off chase at his\nhotel think we might be meeting up for\ndinner later we'll see what his schedule\nends up being like but I've got a little\nbit of extra time\ntoday I wasn't sure if I was going to\nmake it but now I'm glad that I am going\nto be able to make it to the Pioneers\n[Music]\nP Pioneers is a blackowned running\napparel brand that Tommy runs first put\nme on to a couple years ago since then\nI've had a chance to meet the founder\nSid Baptista and see the company grow\nwith popups in Boston and New York and\nnow I was excited to see what Sid and\nteam had brought to\n[Music]\nChicago the space looked amazing\nPioneers has recently announced a formal\npartnership with Brooks so there was\nglycerin Max and water bottles\ndecorating the space and the pioneer and\nGRC run Club collab merch looked\nincredible the whole thing was in the\ndrip Collective space I did get a coffee\nwhile I was there I drank it at the\ncounter and it was a welcome moment of\ncalm and an otherwise frenetic weekend\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nall right I had a delicious coffee in\nthere and just sat for a minute kind of\nzoned out on my phone for a little while\nand had a chance to kind of recover\nwhich was much needed the space in there\nis awesome hopefully you had a chance to\ncheck it out you're in\nChicago um man I'm I'm just so happy for\nSid and for years uh to making such\ngreat\nprogress now I just heard from Ali\nFeller she told me she can get me on the\nlist for her live show today which I\nwasn't sure if I'd be able to go or not\ncuz I can never RSVP fast enough to get\na ticket for any of her live shows so\nI'm happy to get on the list it's not\ntill 4: so I've got a little bit of time\nI think I might be able to squeeze in a\nlittle bit of an extra run\nanybody who I'm\nanybody anybody who I'm anybody who I'm\nanybody all right guys just hit the\nthree mile Mark going to turn it around\nhead back get ready for the live\nshow after changing quickly at my car I\ngot to the alley on the Run live show\nabout 30 minutes early and even then the\nline to get in was around the block\nsince I didn't exactly have a ticket to\nthis show though I kind of hid towards\nthe back of the space once I got in and\nwatched as everyone eagerly rushed in to\nget a seat near the\nstage fun fact after I had gotten denied\nat the press conference the day prior I\nhad bumped into alley on my way out of\nthe athlete Hotel I was feeling pretty\nbummed about the situation and Ally was\nnice enough to buy me a coffee to cheer\nme up and while we were talking I had\nmentioned that at least I had got a\nchance to see Emily sis that morning\nwalking back to the hotel after an early\nrun and although I've seen her race many\ntimes I'd never actually had the chance\nto say hello but Emily appeared to be on\nthe phone at the time so I didn't bother\nher for a photo that's when Ally said\nthat I should just come to the live show\nsince Emily Sison was going to be the\nguest so this was a real treat for me\nthanks Ally for the invite\n[Music]\nthat was a lot of fun in there I hate to\nleave early I wanted to save for the\nwhole time thanks Ellie for making sure\nthat I could attend today uh it was\nsuper fun but I have dinner plans as\nwell so we going to hop back in the car\nand pick up Tommy we're going to get\nsome pizza and poly\ncheese Tommy had asked me a while ago if\nwe could go to dinner the Night Before\nthe Race he knows that I know he's vegan\nand as a local I'd know a good\nspot I picked paully G's cuz I like the\npizza there they have a vast menu of\nvegan and vegetarian offerings and\nbecause it was in Wicker Park and not in\nthe loop or streeterville it wouldn't be\nslammed with other marathoners looking\nto carb up we went there with Tommy's\nfriend Dante who was running her first\nChicago on a Nike bib like Tommy was and\nI'd like to think it was a nice low-key\ndinner for the night before a race\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right the athletes are\noff it's time to get into position\n[Music]\nall right guys they are off

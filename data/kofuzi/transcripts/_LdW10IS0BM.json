  "text": "I was skeptical when Puma first told me\nabout their new alphatic TPU super foam\nespecially when they told me that it was\nnot only fast but highly durable and\nwhile the super foam has delivered in\nthe performance Department how is it\nholding up after extensive use let's\ntalk about the fast R2 after 100 miles\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi I'm\na non Elite Runner who reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys all about the Puma\nfast R2 after 100 miles but before I\ngive you my thoughts on this shoe I do\nwant to go over some disclosures this is\na pair of shoes that Puma sent to me for\nthe purpose of review so I did not have\nto pay for these shoes however nobody's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my players or my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the Puma\nfast R2 after 100 miles and let's start\nwith how I've been using the shoe I\ndidn't have a chance to race in this\nshoe unfortunately but I have been using\nit for a lot of race type situations in\nother words I've been using it for my\ntoughest workouts and my most rigorous\nlong runs those long runs that have a\nlot of marathon effort work in them but\nmy absolute favorite way of using this\nshoe is for threshold mile repeats or\nany other types of threshold work where\nyou'd benefit from that really strong\nsense of carbon spring and power that\nI'm getting from each step in this shoe\nbut at the same time there's also a lot\nof cushion in this shoe as well so\nyou're getting the Best of Both Worlds\nwhere you're getting impact absorption\nbut it also still feels like a very fast\nand bounding type of shoe the upper\nfurry has been very comfortable it is a\nbit on the snug side but it hasn't been\ncrunching my toes at all and just about\nthe only thing that I'd warn you guys\nabout is this little point in the back\nof the heel cup here there's a little\nseam that runs along the back of the\nshoe that can be a little bit abrasive\nif you're not wearing a sock that comes\nat least over the top of the shoe\notherwise I've been really enjoying the\nfit on this one it's plenty breathable\nwith this semi-transparent Ultra weave\nmaterial that they've been using and I\nthink just about the only downside that\nI have for this shoe is it's a little\nbit on the heavy side it comes in at a\nstated weight of 240 G or just under 8.5\no with put it pretty much in the middle\nof daily trainer\ncategory now that we talked about how\nI've been using the shoe let's talk\nabout how the shoe has physically been\nholding up now I had big expectations\ncoming into this 100 mile review because\nwhen I talked with Puma about it this\ntime last year when the shoe was first\nintroduced to the public they told me\nthat this new aliphatic TPU foam that\nthey have is not only the lightest\nmaterial that they've ever used and also\nthe springiest material they've ever\nused but it's also the most durable\nsuper foam material that they've ever\nused as well they're telling us that it\ncould get up to 400 km of use or about\n250 useful miles Which is far beyond\nwhat I would normally expect for a shoe\nin this category of Premium race day\nproduct and for me I would say that the\nfoam is still holding up really well I\ndo think that it feels a little bit\ndifferent than it felt right out of the\nbox from a year ago but that's to be\nexpected even the most durable daily\ntraining or even Max cushion shoe Foams\nare going to feel different out of the\nbox than they do at 100 miles but I do\nfeel like this shoe is holding up better\nthan most Ras product holds up after the\ncourse of a year of usage as it took me\nto get to 100 miles in this shoe I'm\nstill feeling a lot of that great impact\nabsorption from the road and I'm still\ngetting a really strong sense of push\noff and decompression of that foam that\nnice pop Sensation that I'm looking for\nnow a lot of that is aided by the carbon\nfiber plate that is very springy in this\nshoe but both the plate and the foam\nhere are part of the same midsole system\nand that whole midsole system is working\nreally well here now I know that\ncreasing of the foam really isn't an\naccurate indicator of how modern super\nFoams are or are not degrading but there\nisn't really a lot of creasing on the\nfoam that I'm seeing on this shoe and\nthe only kind of like foam degradation\nthat I'm really seeing is from the\ncolorization of it now I think that like\nother modern super Foams I don't know\nthat this foam can really take color\nlike Eva for example can take color and\nso it looks like part of the paint layer\nthat's on the shoe is definitely coming\noff but other than that the the foam\nitself is holding up really nicely on\nthe outsole the pumer grip that's here\nis really robust and also doing really\nwell I feel like I've not been babying\nthis shoe at all in fact some of my\nearly runs that I did on this shoe were\non dirt roads or gravel roads that were\nnot the most forgiving and pretty rough\nin terms of nonuniform sizes of rocks\nthat were on the surface and Puma did\nreach out to me and thank me for even\ntrying to test the shoe in those kinds\nof situations as well because a lot of\npeople are concerned about that exposed\ncarbon fiber plate and how a shoe like\nthis that's intended for road racing\ncould handle a variety of different\nsurfaces now I'll say that I probably\nwouldn't use this shoe for a trail race\nbut it's not a shoe that you have to\nreally worry about it breaking or it\nbeing too fragile to take on anything\nexcept for some of the most pristine\nrace like conditions this is a shoe that\nyou can really beat up and that's all\nthat I've done with it in a variety of\ntemperatures in a variety of surfaces\nthe shoe has held up really well and the\nrubber outsole is doing a fantastic job\nof protecting the foam that is here in\nthis shoe even going to the upper I feel\nlike it's holding up well it's\ndefinitely molded a bit to the shape of\nmy foot again that seam in the back is\nkind of starting to fray a little bit\nand I think that's friction between that\nlittle seam and uh my sock as I'm\nrunning in the shoe but it's not at risk\nof becoming undone everything's still\nholding together really well now I don't\nplan on taking this shoe to 250 Mi to\nfully test Puma's claims on the\ndurability and longevity of the shoe but\nbased on how excited I am even in the\nlast month to get back in the shoe to do\nsome tough sessions and workouts I feel\nlike there's still plenty of life left\nin this shoe and it's going to be one of\nthe more durable Premier race product\nshoes that you're going to be able to\nfind on the market\n[Music]\ntoday before we wrap up this video Let's\nzoom out a little bit and see where the\nPuma fast R2 fits within the broader\nPuma lineup now whenever I take a look\nat a running shoe brand as a whole I\nalways like to start with the daily\ntrainer and for Puma that's going to be\nthe velocity Nitro 3 it's got a really\nnice Nitro foam or a nitrogen infused\nsuper critical foam in the midsole that\nmakes for a nice Snappy experience it's\nalso highly durable both in the midsole\nout soole and upper so it can handle\nbeing the shoe that you go to most\nfrequently in your daily training lineup\nand then for your races that's where I\nwould reach for a shoe like the fast R2\nthat's going to sit over here on the far\nend of the speed Spectrum this is the\nshoe that you're going to save for your\nraces and your biggest most tough\nworkout now anything that's kind of in\nbetween what you would use for a daily\ntrainer and what you would use for your\nrace race day I think that's where a\nshoe like the DV8 neure 3 comes in it's\na session shoe or a training companion\nto your race shoes and it's one of the\nbest in its class at doing that as it\ncombines a lot of daily training\nfeatures and a lot of race like features\nnow on a day where you're recovering\nafter a big workout or a big race that's\nwhere a really nice comfy shoe like the\nPuma mag Max comes in it's a very tall\nvery squishy but also a bit bouncy of a\nshoe so it's still a lot of fun even\nthough it's for of those days where you\nprobably feel the least like running on\nthat day it's a great shoe to have and\nthis is a nice Puma running rotation for\n20124 now you might be asking a question\nlike well what about the other carbon\nplated racing shoe that Puma has the DV8\nNitro Elite 3 this is going to be an\neither or situation for the race option\nyou're either going to use the fast R2\nor you're going to use the nitro Elite 3\nthere are two different options\ndepending on what you're looking for in\nyour carbon plate eraser this is a\nlittle bit more of a a fast turnover\nreally powerful clawback sensation\nrather than a really powerful push off\nsensation and that's how I differentiate\nthese too I have been really enjoying\nthis for my fastest intervals and my\ntoughest speedwork sessions although I\nthink overall even though that one is\nmuch lighter I am leaning towards the\nfast R2 as my favorite between the two\nPuma race product options this is a lot\nof shoes four potentially five shoes to\nbe able to sort from from a rotation I\nknow most people don't run like that if\nI were try to reduce it down to three\nshoes the shoe from Puma that I would\neliminate would be the velocity I feel\nlike for me it's a little bit on the\nfirm side and a lot of the daily\ntraining tasks could be shifted over to\nthe deviate Nitro 3 so this could be a\nreally fun three shoe rotation but\nbecause of the durability of the\naliphatic TPU that's available in the\nfast R2 and also in the DV8 Nitro Elite\n3 I think that you can really get away\nwith a very fun and very functional two\nshoe rotation from puma and for that as\nmuch as it pains me to eliminate one of\nmy favorite shoes the DV8 Nitro 3 I\nthink you could really do it with just\ntwo shoes in the Puma lineup right now\nyou could do all of your easy running in\nthe magmax because even though it is big\nand heavy and cushioned it still got a\nlittle bit of Pep to it so you can still\nuse it very easily for all your daily\ntraining miles your recovery miles\neverything you use a daily trainer 4\nthis is going to be a good option\nespecially if you're one of my bigger\ntaller friends and then when it comes to\nanything that needs to go fast you can\nreach for your fast R2 and because it\nhas that durability in that new\naliphatic TPU foam it's going to be able\nto handle all of your workouts in\naddition to your racing and this could\nbe a really fun two shoe\n[Music]\nrotation now let's wrap up the video by\ngoing over the buying guide and we'll\nalso talk about some Alternatives that\nyou might want to consider the Puma fast\nR2 is one of my favorite carbon plated\nRacing shoes and it's going to be a\nreally fun option for you if you like a\npowerful push-off Sensation from a\nquickly decompressing foam and a springy\ncarbon fiber plate but at $260 I feel\nlike it's a touch expensive and maybe\nI'm picking nits here but I feel like it\nshould come down about at least $10 to\nmake up for a little bit of the extra\nweight that you're going to have to\ncarry around to be in this shoe now\nthere is a prior version of The Fast R\nthe fast R1 or just the fast R but it's\na substantially different shoe and it's\nnot really something that I would\nconsider to be a viable alternative so\nlet's take a look at some other brands\nto see what's available as an option to\nalso consider now the first shoe that I\nwant to talk about really doesn't feel\nthe same or similar to the fast R2 but I\nthink it's built for the same type of\nRunner and that's going to be from as6\nand this is the meta speed Sky Paris now\nI feel like even though this is on the\nother end of the weight Spectrum as the\nfast R2 the fast R2 is one of the\nheavier carbon plated shoes you can buy\nand the metas speed Sky Paris is one of\nthe lightest I feel like the way that\nthe plate is positioned on this shoe and\nthen the way that the foam is being\nutilized here it's also trying to\ncapitalize on Runners who really enjoy a\nstrong sense of push off from the forf\nfoot in their Marathon shoe so if you're\nkind of drawn to one you'll be drawn to\nthe other even though they have very\ndifferent Sensations but the metas speed\nSky Paris comes in at $250 price point\nthat I like for premium race product now\nthe next shoe that I'm going to talk\nabout I think feels more similar to the\nfast R2 in terms of the runner who it's\ndesigned for and the way that the shoe\nfeels and that shoe is from Hoka it's\nthe very underrated clo X1 now both of\nthese shoes I think are targeting that\nsame powerful stride and push off\nsensation I think there's a lot of\nsimilarities in the geometry and the way\nthat these shoes are built that they're\ntrying to achieve those goals now with\nthe cell X1 I think you are getting even\nmore cushion and impact absorption from\nthe road although I think that the push\noff sensation is slightly muted compared\nto the fast R2 so there's a little bit\nof give and take there the other thing\nabout the cello X1 which is maybe why\nit's not so underrated and maybe\nproperly rated is that the cello X1 is\neven heavier coming in at almost 9\nounces which puts it in Pegasus plus\nterritory Nova blast 5 territory in\nterms of weight and it comes in at a\nretail price of\n$275 so $25 more expensive than I really\nthink the shoe should be so it's a it's\na very viable and interesting\nalternative but it has a lot of the same\ndrawbacks as the fast R2 does but those\nare my thoughts on the fast R2 and the\ncompetition that's out there let me know\nin the comments down below if you have\nany other questions about this shoe or\nany of the shoes that I talk aled about\ntoday or better yet stop the live stream\nthat I do Mondays and Thursdays over on\nthe kuuu Run Club Channel love to see\nyou guys over there in the chat that's\nall I for today everybody thanks so for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]\noh",

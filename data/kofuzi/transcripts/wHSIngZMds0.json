  "text": "whether you want to call these speedwork\nshoes Tempo trainers or training\ncompanions these are my top five of\n[Music]\n2024 yo what's going on my name is fuzi\nand I'm anly running reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto go over my top five Tempo shoes for\n2024 now this is a category that kind of\nhas a lot of names and also kind of has\na lot of definitions but what I want to\ntalk about here are those shoes that\nkind of fit somewhere in between the\ndaily trainers and your Racing shoes\nthey are built with the durability for\ndaily training but they also have\nfeatures that make them really fun for\nsome really tough workouts and for some\nof you these actually might be the best\ncategory of shoes for to look at to pick\nout your next marathon shoe but before\nwe get into that list let's go over some\ndisclosures nobody is paying me to make\nthis video or to include their shoe on\nthis list and no one's going to get a\nchance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about my top five speedwork shoes\nand let's start with number five this\nFive Spot was actually pretty tough for\nme to fill there was a lot of shoes that\ncould have gone here but ultimately I\nlanded on the Hoka Mack X2 now this is a\nshoe that I didn't personally love but\nI'm putting it in the five spot because\nof the fact that so many of you guys\nhave been running really well in this\nshoe and you're using it exactly like\nhow I think a Tempo trainer should be\nused some of you are using it for your\ndaily training some of you are racing\nmarathons in it and a lot of you guys\nare using it for those days where you\nneed to pick up the pace there is a nice\ncombination of Foams in this shoe that\ndoes make it really suitable for for\nthose faster workouts and it has\nsomething a little bit extra than what\nyou would find in a regular daily\ntraining shoe and so even though it\ndoesn't completely line up with my\npreferences for a Tempo trainer because\nit has been so popular with you guys I'm\nmaking the People's Choice my number\nfive spot shoe for\n2024 now moving to number four is a\nbrand that a lot of you guys haven't\nheard of unless you're super into\nswimming or Triathlon and that's a shoe\ncoming from tier now they are new to the\nperformance running space and they came\nout with a bang in 2024 releasing this\nshoe the valkyrie speedworks and also a\nracing version of it the valkyrie Elite\nI particularly enjoy the valkyrie\nspeedwork because it has a beaded pea\nfoam and a nylon plate I feel like\nthey've done an excellent job with the\nfit of this shoe while also still giving\nit materials that are going to be able\nto withstand a bunch of workouts for\nrunners who really love the Endorphin\nSpeed 3 I feel like this is a shoe that\nyou're also absolutely going to love and\nthat you definitely should try I've been\nenjoying this shoe to wear casually for\ndaily training and also for workouts as\nwell and it's got my number four spot in\nthe speedwork category in 20124 now for\nnumber three is a shoe that kind of\nbreaks the mold a little bit in terms of\nthe definition but it's a shoe that I\ndefinitely reach for for very tough and\nespecially very fast workouts and that\nis the Tumi scent and the reason why\nthis Adidas shoe doesn't really fit in\nthe speedwork category shoe is because I\ndon't really see anyone using this shoe\nas a daily trainer so it doesn't have\nthat double duty rather this is a 5K 10K\nracing shoe and it's very low To The\nGround by 2024 standard but it has a\nhealthy dose of Adidas's Light Strike\nprobe their racing foam and it's got\nenergy rods in there as well to give it\na little bit of extra rigidity so you\ncan reach for it for those 5K races or\nfor those 00 M repeats or threshold mile\nrepeats that you might have on your\ncalendar it's just so much fun to do\nworkouts in and so much fun to race in\nthat it's a shoe that I perennially just\nabsolutely love and struggle to find the\nright category to put it in because I\nguess for me being Road Marathon focused\na 5k 10K racing shoe kind of is out of\nplace but that doesn't mean that I don't\nabsolutely love the tkumi in its 10th\niteration this year it comes in at\nnumber three in the training companion\ncategory now let's go to number two and\nif you've been watching all my videos\nthroughout the year this might be a\nsurprise that it's Fallen to the number\ntwo spot but the two spot goes to socony\nand that's the Endorphin speed 4 this is\na shoe that I've absolutely been loving\nand when I first reviewed it I thought\nthat it had shoe of the Year\ncapabilities because I absolutely love\nwhat they're doing with the power run PB\ntheir beaded peu foam and the nylon\nplate in the shoe they've created a shoe\nthat is lightweight really great and\ncomfortable for easy training but also a\nlot of fun for the peier stuff as well\nso if you got some threshold repeats or\na tempo run where you got long reps\nwhere you're running anywhere around\nMarathon effort or maybe just a little\nbit off of that this shoe is really fun\nto bring along for you I also think it\nlooks great and is very comfortable for\ncasual wear the shoe can pretty much do\nit all and that's why this year it comes\nin at the number two two spot but\nbecause it comes into the new number two\nspot the number one spot has to be a\nreally great shoe and I do think it\nreally is the Puma DV8 Nitro 3 not to be\nconfused with the Nitro Elite 3 the DV8\nNitro 3 is the top shoe in this category\nfor me this year and it was the top shoe\nin the category last year as well and\nthey really didn't Tinker too much with\nan already good thing they're using two\nkinds of nitro Foams in the shoe one of\nthose Foams being a nitrogen injected\npeo foam that is race caliber and it's\ngot a carbon fiber plate in here and the\ncombinations of foam and plate give this\nshoe the ability to go easy but also to\ngo fast really well now if I were to\ncompare the Endorphin speed 4 and the\ndevi8 Nitro 3 together I'd say the\nEndorphin speed 4 does daily training a\nlittle bit better but I think that the\nDV8 Nitro does work outs a lot better\nit's really fun to do fast workouts in\nand I think for a lot of people who\nmight think that traditional carbon\nplated Racers might be a little bit too\naggressive for them and not exactly\nsuiting what they're looking for in\ntheir Marathon Racing shoes and their\nhalf marathon Racing shoes I have been\nrecommending the DVA Nitro 3 as the next\nshoe that they should look at because I\nthink it has all those great quickness\ncapabilities but also has some comfort\nfeatures and durability features built\ninto it as well I think it really\nexemplifies the characteristics that I'm\nlooking for in a training companion or\nspeed workk type of shoe and it's just\nabsolutely delightful to run in whatever\nthe Run might be and that's why the DV8\nNitro 3 takes the top spot as Tempo\ntrainer of the year so those are my five\nspeedwork shoes that I've been loving\ndoing workouts in let me know what\nyou've been doing your tough and fast\nworkouts in put them in the comments\ndown below or better yet stop by the\nlive streams I do Mondays and Thursdays\nover on the kofuzi Run Club Channel love\nto talk to you guys over there in the\nchat that's all for today everybody\nthanks so much for making all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I will see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]",

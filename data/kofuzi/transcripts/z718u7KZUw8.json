  "text": "we are now in the home stretch for my\npreparation for the half marathon in\nHouston and I'll be hitting Peak mileage\nweeks just in time for Christmas so\nlet's pack up the presents and the\ncarbon plated Racers this is a runner\nupdate at week 10\n[Music]\nyo what's going on kafui coming to you\non location from my backyard for the\nthird installment in my training series\nwith Runa who is the sponsor for this\ntraining series now I've been using the\napp to prepare for the half marathon at\nHouston which is definitely different\nthan the Houston half marathon and right\nnow I'm standing in my backyard without\na jacket or even gloves on which means\nthat it's unseasonably warm here in this\npart of the country for this part of the\nyear but I'm going to take that as a\nlucky sign because it has been peak week\nand I've had some really tough workouts\nand the balmy unseasonably warm weather\nhas been really good for me to get those\ntough workouts completed let's see how\nthe workouts have been going starting\nwith week nine Mondays and Wednesdays\nare session days with the way I've set\nup my run a plan and this workout was\ncalled Tempo repeat now I don't know if\nI can call it a weakness but a kind of\nworkout that I particularly dislike is\nlong repetitions at Round threshold pace\nand that's exactly what this was two 2\nand 1/2 Mile reps at\n6:35 I was nervous and my original plan\nwas to try and just hang on to the tail\nend of the paces maybe stay within 10\nseconds per mile of what I was supposed\nto do but I ultimately decided to trust\nmyself and ignore the watch as much as I\ncould I ran to effort not the\nand I was able to come in under the\nprescribed Paces 625 for the first 2 and\n1/2 Mile rep and 631 on average for the\nsecond one and that was a big confidence\nbooster because while it was hard it\nkind of felt like I had to hold back a\nbit it wasn't an allout effort which is\npromising I was looking forward to a\nrecovery run on Tuesday but with 9 and a\nhalf miles on the calendar it kind of\nfelt like a lot I decided to take out\nthe diodora nucleo 2 for a first run for\nthis one diodora told me that this shoe\nwasn't a stability shoe which is\nimportant to me because I have a hard\ntime running in stability shoes but this\nshoe definitely felt a little bit like a\nrecovery shoe for the first several\nmiles but eventually both my body and\nthe shoe loosened up a bit and I was\nable to enjoy the rest of the balmy\nweather on this run\nWednesday was another tough session the\nworkout was called Fast\n842 and as the Reps got shorter the\npaces got faster the real tough thing\nabout this one though was that after 5\n800 met repeats I had to do 10\n400s mentally and physically there was\njust something about that 10 number that\nwas daunting I was trying out the Topo\nCyclone 3 which is a paback mids shoe\nthat is designed for these exact types\nof workouts but I will admit that in my\nmost tired moments I was really missing\nthe carbon fiber plate that this shoe\ndoesn't have I fell short on a bunch of\nthese reps but I definitely got the\nstimulus intended from this workout I\nwas exhausted by the end\nby Thursday I was definitely ready for\nthat recovery run and the easy five on\nthe calendar wasn't exactly easy but it\nwas nice and\nrelaxed and on Friday it was supposed to\nbe a long run day but it had snowed a\nfew inches overnight so I switched my\nFriday long run for the medium run I was\nsupposed to have the next day and I\nheaded for my local trails in veterans\nAcres\n[Music]\nPark or mule racing a trail and Ultra\nrace company that is also based in\nCrystal Lake puts on a couple of events\nin this very Park and it's also where\nthe local high school hosts its home\ncross country races it's also one of the\nplaces in town where I take the kids\nsledding so I've spent a lot of time in\nthis park and it's at its best when it's\nsnowing\n[Music]\nwhile I don't usually have to walk the\nuphills here on this snowy day and on my\ntired legs I did find myself walking\nfrom time to time but otherwise the\nwoods were just absolutely gorgeous and\nI had a fantastic time running the these\n11\n[Music]\nmiles Saturday was the long run day\nthough that I had moved from the day\nprior and it was supposed to be 17.5 mil\neasy I stopped by the lake to see people\nice fishing out there which is\nsurprising because the lake has has been\ngoing back and forth between Frozen and\nmelted over the temperature swings of\nthe past month I also noticed some of my\nfootprints which is always weird for me\nto see when I'm walking or running at a\nvery easy Pace my feet always stick out\nof B funny and you can see how my heels\ndrag a bit this I presume is why some\nshoes have lateral heel bevels\nI was enjoying this run but I did have\nto cut it a bit short I felt fine and I\nhad plenty of fluids and nutrition on me\nI just ran out of time it's easy to\nforget 17.5 Mi easy takes a long while\nto\nrun for my Sunday six I ran at busy\nWoods which runs through a town called\nElk Grove Village there are Elks at busy\nWoods they're kept behind a fenced in\narea and presumably they native to the\nregion busy Woods has a lot of bathrooms\nbut they pretty much are always locked\nand closed there's always a sign saying\nthat they're closed for the season but\nthese are permanently bolted in to the\nbrick wall so I'm not really sure which\nseason they're closed and which season\nthey're open cuz I don't think I've ever\nnever seen them open the loop here is\n7.3 Mi and I only technically needed 6\nmiles for the day but I ran the full\nloop and then some so that I could hit\n70 Mi for the\nweek now I'm not the type of Runner\nthat's going to get really bothered if I\nend a run at like 99 miles I'm not going\nto run a little bit extra just to take\nover to the next full whole mile but if\nthat happens to me in terms of weekly\nmileage like if I'm at like 69.8 miles\non the week I'm definitely going to run\na little bit more to get to that next\nround number so I ended week n with\n70.1 Miles rather than an otherwise\nludicrous\n69.8 Monday was another session day and\nthis workout was called onoff K five\ntimes 1K at 715 per mile and 1K at 615\nper mile so this was basically a 10K at\nwhat would average pretty close to my\n10K\nPB this run was not going to be easy I\ndid bring another shoe to test for this\none the Brooks Hyperion Elite 4 PB which\nbrings piba to their top tier racing\nshoe I was glad to have it for this run\nthe shoe is still a bit firmer than I\npersonally would like but the proof\nseems to be in the pudding I held myself\nback on most of the Reps but let it rip\nfor the last couple where I was able to\nin at PACE or even a little bit faster\n[Music]\n[Music]\non Tuesday we were at my in-laws and I\nhad a 9 and 1/2 Mile easy run I decided\nto go on a route that I hadn't run in a\nwhile and I definitely forgot how long\nthat Loop was for some reason I thought\nit'd be 9 miles and I'd have to run\naround a little bit to get to my mileage\nfor the day but by the Six Mile Mark I\nstill wasn't all that close to home\nwhich made me nervous because I'd only\nbrought one gel and no fluids with me\n[Music]\nthe loop ended up being 11 miles so on\npaper not all that much longer than I\nhad intended but it just felt like I ran\na lot that day plus my daughter wanted\nto go for a run so I accompanied her for\nan additional very easy mile and a half\nWednesday was Christmas morning and we\ndo most of our family Christmas stuff on\nChristmas Eve so I had the morning to\nsqueeze in a workout before the rest of\nthe extended family arrived for more\nChristmas festivities in the afternoon\nRuna with the holiday spirit was feeling\ngenerous so it assigned me 20 times 400\nmet repeats at 540 per mile Pace that's\na pace somewhere between 5K and mile\nrace pace so this was a tough one and\nwhenever I have to do a workout and I'm\nat my in-laws I'll most likely do it on\nthis one mile Loop in D Ville it loops\naround a couple of soccer fields it's\nmostly flat and I don't have to worry\nabout road traffic which typically has\ngiant trucks hauling things or actual\nfarm\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nequipment temps continue to rise on\nThursday and we ended up with some very\ndense fog I picked a route I wouldn't\nhave to to drive to for my 5m easy run\nit's a loop I've done so many times I\ncould almost do it with my eyes closed\nand with the fog that's kind of how it\n[Music]\nfelt I heard a couple of dogs barking\nthe farm I heard them from is one where\nI know the two dogs have an electric\nfence but there was a new third dog he\nwas not subject to an electric fence and\nafter a couple of tense first few\nmoments for me it eventually started\nrunning with me I tried to get it to\nstay or go home but those weren't\ncommands it seemed to know I'm starting\nto wonder if that's actually a thing\nthat dogs ever know so the dog ended up\nrunning with me for 2 miles until I made\nit all the way back home this isn't the\nfirst time something like this has\nhappened to me where a dog runs with me\nfor several miles and usually if it does\nfollow me all the way home I just go\ninside and let the dog figure it out the\ndogs around here all seemed to know how\nto do that but I didn't get the feeling\nthat this dog was from around here I\nsuspected it was visiting family and\nbecause it was so foggy I was worried a\ncar might hit a dog wandering back to\nwhere it came from so I put it in my car\nand drove it back to the farm and then\nwhen I got back home my daughter wanted\nto go for a run too so I had another 2\nmiles to run with my\n[Music]\ndaughter Friday was a big day the name\nof the workout was race prep 15.5 M\ntotal with 2 * 3.7 mil at race Pace\nRunner prescribed 640 per mile and while\nI feel like I can race half marathons\nfaster than that I wasn't going to try\nand be a hero on this day remember how I\nsaid I hate long fast reps well this was\nlike the mother of them all the first\none was so hard the one mile Loop that\nI've done so many workouts on never felt\nso long\n[Music]\nafter the first rep was over there was a\nim merciful 2 and 1/2 mil worth of easy\nrecovery I took a couple of gels and\nthen settled in for the next rep I used\nmy relish Mantra that I've been using\nthis entire training block I tried to\nzone out I tried to focus extra hard on\nmy technique I threw pretty much\neverything that I had at this last rep\nit was tough physically and mentally but\nI was able to come in right at PACE with\nthe first 3.7 mile rep averaging at 637\nper mile and the second 3.7 M rep\naveraging right at\n640 for Saturday we were back home in\nCrystal Lake the weather was wonderfully\nwarm and I initially felt like I should\ntry and run even more because it was so\nnice but 6 miles ended up feeling like\nplenty I was pretty tired\nSunday was another easy run but it was a\nmedium long one at 11 mil the temps were\nquite mild but everything was a bit wet\nit wasn't exactly raining but it wasn't\nnot raining\neither by mile 8 I was soaked and\nstarting to really want the run to be\nover and I probably could have cut the\nRun short with all the extra miles I run\nearlier in the week but I decided I\nwould ride it out for the full 11 and I\nended the week at 72.8 Mi\n[Music]\n[Music]\ntotal so with Peak Week completed it's\ntime to get to some predictions right\nnow I'm currently feeling pretty healthy\nsometimes at the end of a training block\nI can get a little thing with the pads\nof my feet that's not happening right\nnow and other things that can happen to\nme laid into a training block is that my\nankles might start to get really stiff\nthat's another thing that's not\nhappening so I'm feeling pretty healthy\nand I'm feeling pretty fit so what do I\nthink that'll mean let's look at a\ncouple of key sessions one thing that I\nwant to look at is that tempo run from\nweek nine where I had two times 2 and\n1/2 Mile repetitions that one I came in\nat 625 and 631 631 was my race pace for\nlast year's PR that I had at the half\nmarathon at Houston so so that's a good\nsign that I'm able to hit that pace for\nthose longer repetitions and then on\nweek 10 another key session was that\nlong run that had two times 3.7 M\nrepetitions that came in at 637 and 640\nso those are really good workouts for me\nI feel strong and confident about those\nbut those are slower than my race Pace\nwas from last year so maybe that is not\nas positive of an indicator\nnow on the other hand I did have\nbasically what was yaso 800s about\nhalfway through the training block when\nI was down in Austin and I averaged a\npace of about 3 minutes for 800 met\nrepetitions over the 10 reps which\nindicates that I'm pretty fit so that's\na positive indicator that leans me\ntowards thinking I might be in PB\nFitness but then again I've also\nsomewhat recently had two different fem\ntime trials one was a Turkey Trot on a\nvery pre hilly course and then the next\none was uh on the second day of a\ntwo-day back-to-back sessions kind of\nweek and so those times were very good\nI'm proud of them but they weren't\nexactly PB level fast which is something\nthat I would kind of expect to see for\nfive mile time trials late into a\ntraining plan so there's kind of mixed\nsignals all over the board but I think\nthere's one more week of intense\ntraining before Runa starts to put me\ninto a two- we taper and assuming the\ntaper goes well I think that when my\nbody is able to absorb all this work\nthat I've been doing and build upon all\nthe things that we've put together for\nthis training plan I'm\nfeeling pretty optimistic I'm not super\noptimistic about it but I think right\nnow the race plan is going to be to line\nup for 630 per mile pace for the half\nmarathon at Houston if I can hold on to\nthat pace for the entire race that'll be\na little bit of a PB but I think it\ncould very easily go a minute faster or\na minute slower than that if I fall\nanywhere within that range I'll be\npretty happy because that's going to be\na very fast time for me right up there\nwith my fastest half marathon times so\nI'm feeling good about where I am so far\nbut we'll have to see what happens come\na race day in the interim between now\nand then there's going to be a few weeks\nthe content plan is going to be that uh\nfirst I'll put out the Houston Race\nvideo uh which will show kind of like\nwhat's happening in the moment but it\nwon't go over things like how I felt\nabout the kit that I used fueling and\nany other things thoughts that are going\nthrough my head uh that all stuff comes\nin the following video in the race recap\nwhich will be the final installment of\nthis series and then of course in the\nmeantime there will also be regular\nrunning shoe review video so hit the\nSubscribe button if you're interested in\nany of that and if you are interested in\ntrying the run an app for yourself use\ncode kofuzi for two free weeks I get no\nbenefit or penalty whether you use it or\nor not but it's there if you want it",

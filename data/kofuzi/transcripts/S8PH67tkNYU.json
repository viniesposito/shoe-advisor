  "text": "when it comes to running shoes softness\nis a deceptively complex feature and\npreviously Brooks's take on softness for\nme personally always felt uncomfortably\nfirm but this is the new glycerin Max\nwith its new foam and bold design will\nthis be the max cushion Brooks that I've\nalways been wanting it's time to lace up\nthe glycerin Max and take it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non Elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\nallnew Brooks Glycerin Max but before I\ngive you my thoughts on this shoe I do\nwant to go over some disclosures this is\na pair of shoes that Fleet Feet sent to\nme for the purpose of review so I did\nnot have to pay for these shoes however\nnobody's paying me to make this video or\nto include their shoe in this video and\nno one's going to get a chance to\npreview any of my footage or my thoughts\nbefore you guys get a chance to see this\nvideo on YouTube so with that disclosure\nout of the way let's talk about the\nBrooks Glycerin Max and let's start with\nthe specs this is a tall shoe 45 mm of\ntotal stack height in the heel with a 6\nmm drop giving you 39 mm of Stack height\nin the 4 foot and the main story for\nthis shoe at least for me is that\nthey're using an all new foam in this\nshoe Brooks calls this foam DNA tuned\nit's a Nitro based foam which means\nthey're using nitrogen gas is part of\nthe manufacturing process and it's kind\nof a two foam system in a way it seems\nto me like it's all kind of like one\npiece of foam but there are two\ndifferent size cells that they're using\nin the foam itself and by cells there're\nusing little beads of material Source\nmaterial compressing it and heating it\nup to a very high level and then\ninjecting the gas in it and that makes\nbubbles and then they're using larger\ncells or larger bubbles in the heel of\nthe shoe and then smaller bubbles in the\nforefoot and Brooks tells me that the\nreason for that is that the larger cell\nfoam gives them more cushiness more\nsoftness and then the smaller cell foam\nis more tightly compressed and packed\ntogether and so that's going to give you\na little bit more sense of Bounce and I\nthink there's two main things that are\nnotable about this one is that I'm\nexcited when ever Brooks experiments\nwith new Foams they're notoriously a\nlittle bit reluctant or conservative\nwhen it comes to experimenting with\ntheir shoes especially for a storyed\nline from Brooks like the glycerin and\nthat's why I think there's this glycerin\nMax which is an offshoot that lets them\nplay around a little bit more but the\nother thing that's notable about this is\nthat it switches the Paradigm that\nBrooks typically uses in their shoes so\nlike at least in older shoes like the\nshoes that I first started testing in\nBrooks which would have been like the\nBrooks ghost 10 several years years ago\nthey flipped it around where the firmer\nfoam was in the heel and the softer foam\nwas in the forefoot and the idea being\nwhen you come crashing down on that heel\nthey needed that part of the shoe to be\nfirmer so they could better absorb the\nfull force of your foot and body hitting\nthe ground and then inevitably because\nof that 12 mm drop when your foot\nslapped down you needed to have a soft\nmaterial to absorb the impact from that\nHeel To Toe slapping that a 12 mm drop\ncan create for some people like it did\nfor me now it's reversed where the\nsofter foam is in the heel so you have a\nsofter Landing if you are a heel Striker\nand then as you're rolling forward\nyou're bouncing and pushing off of a\nmore responsive foam and that whole\nmotion is aided by what Brooks calls its\nGlide roll rocker geometry in other\nwords the front of the shoe is carved a\nlittle bit so that way it helps you roll\nforward and this large stack height is a\nlittle bit easier for your foot to\nmanage now to protect all this fo Brooks\nhas put a bunch of rubber on the outsole\nit's not full coverage rubber outsole so\nwe're not looking at some of those old\nBrooks ghost 10 uh there is some exposed\nfoam in here to help shed weight and\nmake it easier for this foam to bend and\nsquish uh but also there is plenty of\nrubber where there is rubber on the shoe\nso not only do I think that this foam\nbased on the way they've made it is\ngoing to last a long time I think this\nrubber is also going to give you plenty\nof grip for a long time as well moving\nto the upper I think that the design on\nthis shoe is fantastic and the upper is\nvery comfortable as Brooks uppers always\ntend to be we're using a pretty standard\nmaterial for a Brooks shoe in the upper\nhere uh the tongue I think is pulled\nstraight from uh Brooks ghost uh and\nthere is a decent amount of padding in\nthe back of the heel and into this\nAchilles flare a little bit more padding\nthan I would have liked to have seen uh\nand there's also a lot of structure in\nthis heel cup again more than I would\nhave liked to have seen but something\nthat's pretty common for shoes in this\ncategory of Max cushion shoe and overall\nI do really like the design I also\nreally enjoy this Brooks logo that they\nput on the side of this shoe it's over\nthe top and it definitely adds\nunnecessary weight but I do think it\noverall adds to the aesthetic that makes\nthis probably the best looking Brooks\nshoe that I've ever seen now Brooks\ntells me that this shoe comes in at a\nweight of 10.5 o for their reference\nsize but I am reference size and my size\nn that Brook sent to me came in a little\nbit heavier coming in at 10.8 Oz or 308\nG now that we've talked about what the\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on foot and I got to say\nthe Brooks Glycerin Max is the max\ncushion shoe from Brooks that I've\nalways been waiting for I love the\namount of cushion and softness that I'm\nfeeling in this shoe I'm feeling\nabsolutely pampered every time I put my\nfoot into it the softness here is what I\nthink softness should be every time my\nfoot hits the ground I feel like I'm\ncompressing the foam really nicely it's\nabsorbing the impact of my foot strike\nand then I'm rolling through with that\ngly roll rocker geometry and then the\nfoam is decompressing and giving me a\nnice pleasant amount of Pop as I head\ninto the next step I feel like it's a\nvery modern shoe and a very comfortable\nshoe I feel like they're using\ntechnology to the runner's benefit in it\nit's comfortable it's going to be great\non feet for a long period of time\nwhether you're running a recovery run or\nlooking to set a longdistance PR this is\na very comfortable shoe to be in it's\nalso looks great and very comfortable\nfor all day casual wear the one thing\nthat I wouldn't do in this shoe is take\nit for workouts it is a heavy shoe with\nmy size 9 weighing in over 300 G and\nover 10 o by a hefty margin uh you can\ndo things like uh strides where you're\npicking up the pace for a very short\nbursts of time and the actual speed\nreally isn't the point of strides but\nanything that's longer than strides in\nterms of picking up the pace workouts I\nreally would reach for something else uh\nand and save the Brooks Glycerin Max for\na day where I just want to have a\ncomfortable experience now there is a\nquite wide footprint on this shoe as\nwell and so that's going to help the\nshoe from getting too unstable when your\nfoot hits the ground so without having\ntraditional stability elements the shoe\ndoes have some stability or motion\ncontrol kind of built into it I didn't\nfind this to be a problem and I felt\nlike the shoe was ultimately quite\ncomfortable and it all made sense to me\nbut for those of you who are traditional\nglycerin fans you might find this shoe\nto be a little bit too mushy and a\nlittle bit too wobbly so you might want\nto stay away from something that's this\nsoft I went true to size for my glycerin\nMax and that worked out really well for\nme if you're familiar with Brooks I\nwould go with your normal Brooks sizing\n[Music]\nnow before we wrap up this video let's\ntake a step back and look at the Brooks\nlineup a little bit more generally to\nsee where the glycerin Max fits in and\nright now with Brooks they have pretty\nmuch an entire lineup of Max shoes so\nlet's try and make a lineup using that\nwith the daily trainer we have the ghost\nMax which is the ghost that I've always\nwished that Brooks would make and so\nthat's going to be the kind of\ncenterpiece of a Brooks lineup if you\nlike the Max shoes and then I think for\nworkouts a shoe that you can hop into is\nanother Max shoe and that's the Hyperion\nMax I think that would go over here\nthat's something you could use whever\nyou want to go a little bit faster than\nyou might want to go in your ghost or\nghost Max that's where I reached for the\nHyperion Max the Hyperion being one of\nmy favorite shoes that Brooks had ever\nmade at the time that it first came out\nnow there's a Max version of it a little\nbit more stack height a little bit more\nsoftness to it but still very much a\nspeed oriented shoe not a shoe that I\nwould necessarily reach for for every\nday but for the fast days that's when\nI'd reach for the Hyperion Max and then\nthe glycerin Max fits in on the other\nside of the spectrum over here for those\ndays where you want to be on feet for a\nlong time and as comfortable as possible\nthis is where I would reach for the\nglycerin Max now for racing there is the\nHyperion Elite shoe and technically that\nwould fit over here it has a carbon\nplate in it and it's even lighter the\nupper is absolutely fantastic very\nminimal padding very floppy heel cup the\nkind of things that I want to see when I\nwant to go fast but I don't actually\nlove this shoe and I think that this\nrotation is better served if you just\nleave it at these three shoes use the\nghost Max for every day glycerin Max for\nRecovery days and long runs and then you\nreach for your Hyperion Max for your\nworkouts and for your racing I think\nright now the Hyperion Max is the best\nracing shoe that Brooks makes now\nChicago marathon was earlier this week\nand I did just see it what looked like\nmaybe perhaps just a color update but I\nthink there's a little bit more to that\nstory I don't have any information\nthat's been confirmed yet that I can\nreport on so keep an eye out for\nsomething new from Brooks in the race\ncategory but for now this is the lineup\nthat I would go with and I will note\nthat both the ghost Max and the Hyperion\nMax do have updates so we're on version\ntwo of each of these shoes I have put in\na request to Brooks to see if they would\nsend me a pair of those those are all on\nthe way so stay tuned And subscribe if\nyou want to see updates of those videos\nbut this is the Brooks lineup that I am\nreally excited\n[Music]\nabout now let's wrap up the video by\ntalking about the buying guide and then\nwe'll also go into some Alternatives\nthat you're going to want to consider if\nyou're interested in the glycerin Max\nthe Brooks Glycerin Max is the max\ncushion shoe that I've always been\nwanting for Brooks to make and I hope\nthat shoes like this and the ghost Max\nare signs of shoes to come and not just\none-off experiments that languish in the\nBL labs this is a brand new shoe so\nthere isn't a PRI years version that you\nmight be able to save a couple of bucks\non and I also think that this shoe is\nsubstantially different than the\nexisting glycerin Series so I don't\nreally feel like these are meaningful\nsubstitutes so if you want to get your\nfoot into the new newness from Brooks\nyou're going to be looking at $200 I\nthink that price is a little bit High I\nwish it were lower than that but let's\ntake a look at some of the competition\nto see where that $200 Stacks up the\nfirst shoe I want to talk about I think\nis the shoe that is the closest to the\nglycerin Max and it's also a shoe that I\nvery recently reviewed on the channel\nand that's from Puma it's the mag Max\nanother Max suffix shoe like the\nglycerin Max this is a very tall shoe\nusing Nitro based Foams The Source\nmaterial for the magmax is a little bit\ndifferent and I think that's the main\ndifferentiator between these two shoes\nwell they both look like they could be\nbig cushy comfortable shoes and in many\nrespects they are I do think that the\nmagmax is a little bit bouncier and a\nlittle bit less mushy or in other words\nthe glycerin Max is a little bit more\ncomfortable and a little bit more plush\nbut they're both really great examples\nof the max cushion genre the mag Max\nthough comes in at a $20 discount of 180\nbucks and then the other shoe that I\ndon't think really lines up all that\nwell but I think because of the pricing\nand because of the size of the shoes a\nlot of you guys have been asking me to\ncompare these two so I will and that's\nfrom as6 that's the super Blast 2 these\nare both very tall shoes that look like\nthey're going to be all day low and slow\nCruisers but I actually use these two\nshoes quite differently the giser max is\nan excellent example of Max cushion shoe\nwhere I don't care about Pace but I'm\ntrying to log time on feet and get those\nmiles in in the most comfortable way\npossible the super Blast 2 can be used\nthat way and it's pretty good for that\nbut at $200 I think that's overkill for\nthat task the way I love to use the\nsuper Blast 2 is for something where I\nam going to be on feet for a long time\nbut it's a situation where I'm going to\nwant to go fast for an extended period\nof time now it doesn't have a carbon\nfiber plate so it's not per se a race\nshoe but it does have racing foam in it\nas its main ingredient there's also a\ndaily training foam on the bottom to\nhelp kind of stabilize all this foam and\nkeep it from getting too unstable but\nthis is a shoe where if I have a long\nrun where I'm going to be running a lot\nof marathon pce miles or if I'm going to\nbe doing a workout where the reps are\nvery long this is a really great shoe\nfor for me to be in so it gives me that\ncombination of Max cushion and racing\nshoe kind of sandwiched into one in a\nway that on paper doesn't always Mak\nsense but on foot it just does even then\nI think that $200 is touch high for what\nthe super blast offers but they both\ncome in at the same price and depending\non what you want out of your big shoe I\nthink that's really going to Define\nwhich of these two options you're going\nto pick so those are my thoughts on the\nBrooks Glycerin Max great job Brooks I\nreally love this one let's see more just\nlike it if you have any questions about\nthis shoe or any of the shoes that I\ntalked about today feel free to put them\nin the comments down below or better yet\nstop by the live stream that I do\nMondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi\nRun Club Channel I'd love to talk to you\nguys over there in the chat that's all I\nfor today everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all the way to the end of this\nvideo hopefully you guys are staying\nsafe out there on your runs and I will\nsee you in the next one yo what's going\non\n[Music]\nI",

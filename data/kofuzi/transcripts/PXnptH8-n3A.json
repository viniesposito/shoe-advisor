  "text": "let's continue our look back at the best\nin running for the year these are my top\nfive Marathon Racing shoes of 20124\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys about my\nfavorite Marathon erasing shoes of 2024\nbut before I go into this list I do want\nto go over some disclosures no one's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe on this list and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my footage thoughts before you\nguys get a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the top five\ncarbon plated Racers of 2024 and let's\nstart with number five the Five Spot was\ndifficult there was a lot of shoes that\nI maybe could have put into this slot\nbut based on the things that I\npersonally love to see in carbon plated\nRacing shoes the shoe that I'm putting\nin this Five Spot is from Hoka and\nthat's the C X1 now a lot of people kind\nof discounted this shoe cuz it was a\nlittle bit on the big side a little bit\non the heavy side but the things that I\nsaw in this shoe that I really enjoy are\nthe fact that it's a pea based midsole\nfoam from Hoka but also they put a\ngigantic amount of foam in the for foot\nand they also put a lateral side cutout\nto make it easier to bend the carbon\nfiber plate that's in this shoe all\nthose things put together resulted in\nsomething that felt really good when\nyou're landing on that 4 foot and\ncrushing that foam and then having it\nbounce back with the aid of that carbon\nfiber plate so it it's a really fun and\nspringy experience that I got anytime I\ntook this shoe either for a long run\nwith some Marathon effort miles in it\nthreshold repeats or for anything that\nmight be even a little bit faster than\nthat I enjoyed it for all of those\nthings yes the weight definitely is an\nissue and it would be much higher on the\nlist if they could make that foam\ncompress and decompress a little bit\nmore dynamically and if they could shed\na little bit of weight but as it is the\nHoka cell X1 comes in at number five\nthat means at the number four spot is\nanother shoe that kind of looks a little\nbit unusual and has a large amount of\nfoam in the for foot that's going to be\na a theme that we're going to see\nthroughout this list and number four for\nme is from Puma it's the fast R2 in this\nyear's version of The Fast R they went\nto an aliphatic TPU foam which is\nsomething that I don't think I had\nexperienced prior to this year and I'm\nglad that Puma is using it in the way\nthat they are you're getting a great\namount of cushion and compress ression\nin that foam and then it also snaps back\nreally Lively but it's also durable kind\nof in two ways one it's durable in the\nsense that we all think about durability\nit'll last a lot of miles I have well\nover 100 miles in this shoe and it still\nfeels really fresh but it's also durable\nwith in one long run as well so that\nsense that like the foam is fading as\nyou get deeper and deeper into a long\nrun uh that doesn't happen as quickly\nwith the aliphatic TPU it feels just as\nSnappy at the end of a race as it does\nat the beginning of a race and it's just\nbeen really fun to put in fast efforts\nin this shoe and another big element of\nthat is this exposed carbon fiber plate\nwhich is very rigid and I just have such\na great time bouncing off of the front\nend of the shoe if it were a little bit\nlighter it would be a lot higher on the\nlist but because of the weight which is\nreally the only thing that holds it back\nin my mind this shoe comes in at number\nfour now moving into the three spot is\nis a shoe that has been making the\nheadlines all year long and that is the\nalphafly 3 this shoe not only has the\nmen's World Marathon record but it now\nhas the Women's World Marathon record as\nwell so elast have been able to run in\nthis really quickly and I feel like a\nlot of non Elites have been also able to\nrun well in the shoe the zumex that's in\nthe shoe feels like older original zoomx\nor closer to it and I think that's part\nof why this shoe ends up being so light\nthe only downside that I feel from this\nshoe and I guess there's two one is that\nI feel like the airpods moved in version\n3 a little bit more towards the center\nof the foot and for me in my footstrike\nit just feels like I'm kind of missing\nor Landing over or past the airpod so\nI'm not getting the full benefit of\nstomping on those airpods and then\nbouncing back as they decompress and the\nother thing is the way that the carbon\nfiber plate and the zoom airpods\ninteract at least for me and my non-\nElite foot strike it feels a little bit\nkind of rickety it feels like I'm\nrunning across like a plywood floor in a\nboxing ring and so there's a little bit\nof a uneasiness when I'm running in it\nit doesn't stop me from being able to\nrun really fast and have a lot of fun\nwhen I'm running in the shoe but it is\nsomething that I've noticed and it\ndoesn't quite feel as smooth as some\nother shoes on this list but all those\nlittle complaints aside it is a shoe\nthat a lot of people have been able to\nrun really well in and this year it\ntakes the number three spot moving into\nthe number two spot is a shoe that is\npretty much always on my list ever since\nthe shoe first hit the market market and\nthat's from as6 and it's the meta speed\nSky Paris this year the big change for\nthe metas speed is that the foam went\nfrom FF turbo to FF turbo plus which\nreally means that it went from a nylon\nbased foam to a pea based foam and the\nbig thing that I've noticed is that the\nfoam is a lot softer so when you are\nlanding on the forefoot of this shoe you\nfeel like you're really compressing a\nlot of that foam and it's coming back in\na nice and pleasant way I will say that\nI think that it's a little bit on the\nmushy side not to say that it's a mushy\nshoe but compared to the bounceback that\nI would get that was very quick and\nspringy from last year's version I feel\nlike The Meta speed Sky Paris is a\nlittle bit less springy than I would\nlike I love the compression I just wish\nit would decompress just a with a little\nbit more energy return but those little\ncritiques aside that hasn't stopped me\nfrom reaching for this shoe over and\nover again in fact I think that of all\nthe shoes that I've reviewed in 2024 the\nmost miles I put on any one shoe is with\nthe meta speed Sky Paris cuz I could\nkeep reaching for it again and again\nwhenever I have those really tough\nworkouts that's because I like the plate\nposition in this shoe I really like the\nfoam that they're using in the shoe and\nI love how lightweight it is it's one of\nthe lightest shoes on the market today\nnow moving into number one spot is\nanother shoe from Puma Puma is having a\nfantastic year this year and this is the\nNitro Elite 3 again this is using that\naliphatic TPU foam that I loved in the\nfast R2 but they're doing it in a very\nlightweight package this is also one of\nthe lightest Marathon Racing shoes on\nthe market and they've paired it with a\nvery lightweight and minimal racing\nupper that is very comfortable to wear\nthis like The Meta speed Sky Paris is a\nshoe that I've been reaching for for\nthose biggest workouts that always give\nme a little bit of stress as I'm looking\nat them on the calendar and the Nitro\nl83 have been able to help me hit those\nPaces in those really tough workouts now\nthe geometry of the Nitro Elite 3 is\nvery different than the geometry of the\nmeta speed Sky Paris the Nitro Elite 3\nseems to be designed for the kind of\nRunner who has a really quick turnover\nand that's normally not how I would\ndescribe myself but the shoe still works\nfor me in a really Pleasant and Powerful\nway and that makes me think that this is\na shoe that I could recommend to a wide\nrange of Runners and I think it will\nlikely work for them and because it's so\nlight because it's so much fun to run in\nand because I think that it can work for\na lot of different kinds of Runners\nthat's why the Nitro Elite 3 takes my\ntop spot as best Marathon racing shoe of\n2024 now I do have one additional shoe\nthat I think deserves some honorable\nmention and again it's from Adidas this\nis the adios Pro 4 I had a chance to\nerase the Berlin marathon in this\nearlier in the year but the reason why\nit's not in my 2024 list is because like\nthe evos SL for my daily trainers list\nthis shoe technically doesn't become\nglobally released until 2025 so I'm\ngoing to classify it as a 2025 shoe and\nwe're going to have to wait to see how\nthings shake out in 2025 to see where\nthe adios Pro 4 ends up in the best of\nlists so those are the shoes that I've\nbeen enjoying doing my toughest workouts\nand my Marathon racing in I'd love to\nhear what's been working well for you\nguys put it in the comments down below\nor better yet stop by the live stream\nthat I do Mondays and Thursdays over on\nthe kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to\nsee you guys over there in the chat\nthat's all for today everybody thanks so\nmuch for making it all the way to the\nend of this video hopefully you guys are\nstaying safe out there on your runs and\nI will see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\n[Music]",

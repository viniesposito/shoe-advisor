  "text": "this is the Puma mag Max and it's got a\ndouble tall dose of nitro foam will it\nbe the max cushion Cruiser that the name\nimplies or will this just be another big\nshoe that ends up being a bit too firm\ntime to lace up the mag Max and take it\nfor a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm a non-elite runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\nPuma mag Max but before I give you my\nthoughts on this shoe I do want to go\nover some disclosures this is a pair of\nshoes that Puma sent to me for the\npurpose a review so I didn't have to pay\nfor these shoes however nobody's paying\nme to make this video or to include\ntheir shoe in this video and no one's\ngoing to get a chance to preview any of\nmy footage of my thoughts before you\nguys get a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the Puma mag\nMax and let's start with the specs this\nis a very tall shoe starting out at 46\nmm of stack heite in the heel and\ndropping down to 38 mm of Stack height\nin the 4 foot giving us an 8 mm drop and\nthe only thing as far as I know from\nthis shoe is that there is Nitro foam in\nthis shoe now a lot of times when I\nthink about Nitro Foams I think of it as\nbeing lightweight and fast but I don't\nalways think of it as being soft and so\nseeing this much stack heite of nitro\nfoam initially gave me a lot of concerns\nbut stay tuned for the what's it like\nsection of the video where I can talk\nabout what it's like to actually run in\nthe shoe now protecting all this stack\nheite is Puma grip it's a nice thick\nlayer of rubber on the outsole Puma is\ntending for this shoe to give you 500\nmil or for more of durability so they're\ngoing to need a lot of rubber to protect\nthe midsole foam and that midsole foam\nhas to be a highly durable material\nwhich Nitro foam historically have been\nmoving to the upper we have an\nengineered mesh which is supported by\npower tape there is a very comfortable\nknit tongue which I'm very much enjoying\nand a minimal amount of padding\nrelatively speaking for a shoe of this\nsize and of this type there is a little\nbit of rigidity built into the back of\nthis Heel Cup and the foam definitely\nkind of Scoops up around the back of the\nheel and on the sides of your ankle to\ngive you a little bit of support and\nfurther aiding in that support is the\nvery wide footprint so that way your\nfoot doesn't move around too much\nwhenever it hits the ground now in terms\nof fit I do want to mention something\nspecifically Puma normally sends me my\nusual running shoe size that's a US\nmen's n in this shoe they sent me a 9\nand a half I don't know if that's just\nthe tester sizes they had remaining\nbecause sometimes I get kind of whatever\nthe brands have left to send out to\ntesters or if they thought that this was\nsomething that needed me to size up I\nwill say that the 9 and A2 which is a\nhalf size up from what I normally wear\nwas really comfortable and for most of\nmy testing of this shoe I kind of forgot\nthat I was a half size up so I would say\nif you're the type that sometimes sizes\nup size up on this one now Puma says\nthat this shoe comes in at a stated\nweight of 290 G but that would be for\nthe usmen size 9 the size 9 1/2 that I\nhad came in a little bit heavier at 302\nG and 10.6 6\n[Music]\noz now that we've talked about what this\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on foot I'm absolutely\nloving the Puma magmax and I feel like\nit sets the new standard for what Max\ncushion shoes should be like in 2024 for\na long time we've been getting a lot of\nbigger taller Max cushion shoes but they\nhaven't been getting commensurately soft\nand cushioned the Puma mag Max proves\nthat you can do both of those things get\nbigger get taller get more cushion and\nget a more comfortable experience using\nnew techniques and new Foams now I\nmentioned earlier in the video that\nsometimes Nitro foam gets to be a little\nbit on the firm side I don't think that\nsoftness is Nitro Forte but I'm not sure\nhow they've tweaked the formula of this\nNitro foam or if just adding more Nitro\nfoam like this makes it feel softer\nunderfoot but they're doing a fantastic\njob of balancing and cushioning and\nbounce in this shoe in other words it is\na big soft shoe but it's not mushy\nunderfoot which is something we get a\nlot of times in these Max cushion shoes\nand I usually take that as an acceptable\ntrade-off for a shoe that I just want to\nbe in for a long period of time or just\nwant to take for a really comfy relaxed\nrecovery run but this lets me have kind\nof The Best of Both Worlds where it has\nthat daily trainer feel while still\nhaving that extra level of comfort and\ncushion now I do think that you could\neven pick up the pace and do a couple of\nshort bursts of speed in this like if\nyou had some strides at the end of an\neasy run but I think that even with the\nfoam that's in this shoe uh the size and\nthe weight of the shoe would make it a\nlittle bit cumbersome for anything\nlonger than just a couple of strides\nlike I wouldn't want to take it out for\na workout but if you've got a long slow\ndistance run or just a regular everyday\nrun or recovery run this shoe is going\nto be really fun and comfortable for you\nto put your foot into I started testing\nthis shoe out before I ran the Berlin\nmarathon and I loved it for just regular\neasy run days and then I also tested it\nafter I came back from Berlin and used\nit for a recovery run and it was just\nthe thing that my feet\n[Music]\nneeded now before we wrap up this video\nlet's take a step back and look at where\nthe magmax might fit within a broader\nPuma lineup now whenever I take a look\nat a running shoe brand I always like to\nstart with the daily trainer and from\nPuma that's going to be the velocity\nNitro 3 it also has Nitro foam in here\nbut it's a little bit lower to the\nground so you could use it for a wider\nvariety of paces and kinds of runs it's\nalso built for high levels of durability\nand that's going to be kind of the\nanchor and center point of a puma lineup\nnow when it comes to racing there's two\ndifferent options that Puma has\navailable depending on your preferences\nand the one that I'm going to talk about\ntoday is the devi8 Nitro Elite 3 it's\none of the lightest most Nimble Racing\nshoes on the market it's got an updated\nversion of nitro Elite foam which is\neven more premium type of racing foam\nand it's got a carpon fiber plate that's\ngoing to go right here you might also in\nthe alternative use the Puma fast R2\nwhich is a shoe that I particularly like\nbut it's going to be an either or\nsituation you're either going to use the\nfast R2 or you're going to use the DVA\nNitro Elite 3 and then kind of in\nbetween these two shoes when it comes to\nlike some faster workouts that maybe you\ndon't need to reach for the race day\nshoe but you want something a little bit\nfaster than your daily training option\nthere is the DV8 Nitro 3 not to be\nconfused with the Nitro Elite 3 just the\nNitro non- Elite 3 it's got a little bit\nof daily trainer DNA and a little bit of\nrace DNA in it and it's a really fun\nshoe for logging in a lot of workouts\nand where the mag Max fits in is on the\nother side of the speed Spectrum when\nyou just want to get out there and log\nsome time on feet and just take care of\nyourself a little bit more have a little\nbit of extra cushion and the paces can\nslip a little bit cuz it's that kind of\nrun that's where the ma Max fits in\nreally well and it's a nice comfy way to\nround out this Puma\n[Music]\nlineup now let's wrap up this video by\ntalking about the buying guide and also\nsome Alternatives that I think you\nshould consider the Puma magmax is a\nrefreshing update on the max cushion\ngenre and it's one of the best examples\nI've tested in a very long time this is\nthe first year of the shoe so there\nisn't a prior Year's version that you\nmight be able to save some money at so\n180 is what you're going to be looking\nto spend in order to get in these shoes\nand I always feel like 180 for a Max\ncushion shoe kind of feels like a lot\nbut let's take a look at some of the\ncompetition to see where that price\nStacks up the first shoe that I think\nStacks up really well against the Puma\nmag Max is a shoe that I haven't\nreviewed yet so hit the Subscribe button\nif you want to see this review but it\ncomes from Brooks and it's the glycerin\nMax and I think a lot of similarities\nbetween these two shoes that make them\nline up really well and are both going\nto be the contenders for Max cushion\nshoe of 2024 both of these shoes have a\nNitro foam in them and both of them are\nexceptionally soft while also being\nsurprisingly Nimble and if you haven't\nliked previous Brooks glycerins don't\nworry I haven't been a fan of the\nprevious glycerins either but this\nglycerin Max is excellent you are going\nto pay a price for that Excellence\nthough cuz that shoe comes in at\n$200 and then the other shoe that I want\nto talk about comes in a little bit\nunderneath what the Puma magmax comes in\nat and that's going to be from as6 this\nis the Glide ride Max coming in at\n$170 so $10 cheaper than the mag Max I\nfeel like this is also a really great\nexample of a Max cushion shoe although\nit leans a little bit more on the firm\nstable side than the mag Max or the\nglycerin Max does I'm not saying it's\nnot a very soft shoe it's actually what\nI really wish the Nimbus 26 would have\nbeen if it weren't for the mag Max and\nthe glyer max the Glide ride Max would\nhave been probably my choice for a Max\ncushion shoe of the year so it's\ncertainly a year of Max so if you're a\nbig fan of the max cushion genre 2024 is\ndefinitely your year there is a bumper\ncrop of fantastic options if you have\nany questions about the mag Max or any\nof the shoes that I talked about today\nfeel free to put them in the comments\ndown below or better yet STP by the live\nstream that I do Mondays and Thursdays\nover on the kofuzi Run clip Channel love\nto talk to you guys over there in the\nchat that's all for today everybody\nthanks so much for making all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I'll see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]",

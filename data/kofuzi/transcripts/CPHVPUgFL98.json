  "text": "we are now in the thick of it for my\npreparation for the half marathon at\nHouston and after a week six some people\nwere a little bit concerned that this\nrun up plan just might break me but now\nthat two more weeks have passed let's\nsee how I'm holding up this is a runup\nupdate at week 8\n[Music]\nyo what's going on kzi coming to you on\nlocation from my backyard last time it\nwas cold and snowing and today it is\ncold and snowing but in the interim a\nlot has happened weatherwise you're\ngoing to see that weather is a main\ncharacter for this 8 week update now\neven though the six week update was just\nlast week and one week later you're\nwatching this through the magic of\nediting I'm able to fit in 2 weeks of\ntraining with the Runa app let's see how\nit's been going starting with week s day\none Monday a\nsession Monday week s was a Tempo a\nworkout The Plan called for 2K over\nunders 2K at 720 per mile then 2K at 625\nper mile and then repeat that for a\ntotal of three continuous sets the\ntempts were really cold for this one 22\u00b0\nf with an icy wind and I had a hard time\nstaying in range for the faster portion\nof the first two sets I was in the adios\nPro 4 which is one of my favorite shoes\nright now that I'm currently testing and\nthey were great for this range of paces\nand for the last rep I was able to run\neven faster than what was prescribed and\ntypically I try not to overdo it when it\ncomes to Paces on a training plan you\nrun the pace that prescribed so you get\nthe workout and strain that is intended\nbut since I didn't quite hit the mark\nfor the first two reps I felt like it\nwas okay to try and make it up a bit on\nthe last one and then for apparel I ran\nin the two times U full tights which\naren't the warmest full tights that I\nhave but I have been loving them for\nhard sessions they are very expensive\nand I haven't had them for very long but\nthey are so worth it and have instantly\nbecome one of my fa favorite full\n[Music]\ntights Tuesday was a little bit warmer\nbut still pretty cold for my easy 9 1 12\nmile run I was wor testing another pair\nof shoes that I can't show you and I'm\nsorry about that but I promise that\nthere aren't too many more days like\nthis I ran one of my more usual Loops in\nthe area I start out by the police\nstation and then run over to the river\nand the temps have gotten cold enough\nthat the water is starting to freeze\n[Music]\nover Wednesday was another session day\nthis workout was called a drop set two\nreps each starting at 1K intervals then\n800 M then 600 M then 400 and then 200 M\nand as the Reps get shorter the paces\nget faster I reached for the Evo one for\nthis workout as they are one of the\nlightest and fastest shoes that I have\nright now and they were at about 55 Mi\nof total mileage before this workout and\nyou could see that there is some damage\non the left shoe I think that an energy\nRod is causing a bit of a cavity on the\nbottom of the shoe and that's what's\ncreating this dimple but as far as I can\ntell I don't have a broken rod\n[Music]\nnow I don't have a ton of experience\nrunning very fast intervals so my pacing\nwas a bit all over the place for this\none but on average I think I was right\nwhere I was supposed to be except on the\n200s I was way fast on the 200s it was a\ntough workout but it didn't feel like it\nwas an exceedingly hard workout it felt\nrigorous but\n[Music]\nmanageable Thursday was a recovery run\n5.5 m easy and it was cold 19\u00b0 fhe and\nwindy made it feel downright Arctic by\nthis point in any training block my body\nis starting to hurt kind of all over and\nthis Runa training plan is no different\nI've been pretty not good about keeping\nup with my usual pre-run Mobility\nroutine and I have been skipping pretty\nmuch all of my strength and conditioning\nand Mobility work that Runa has been\nassigning so even though this run was\nsupposed to be a recovery run it\nbasically just felt a little bit\nuncomfortable\nback in week one when I set up my\ntraining plan Runa gave me the option to\nadd in strengthened conditioning and\nMobility work and of course I said yes\nto each of those things even though I\ndon't have the best track record of\nkeeping up with either one of those and\nthat's because for some reason I thought\nthis Runa training plan would be a\nlittle on the easy side so I thought I'd\nhave plenty of time and plenty of energy\nto get all this essenc and Mobility work\ndone that hasn't exactly been the case\nfor me fortunately run it has a feature\nwhere if it notices you skipped or\nmissed a couple of strength and\nconditioning sessions it lets you go\nthrough and Autos skip all the things\nthat you missed so that way you don't\nhave to go through and individually\nclick that you're skipping those\nsections and that's\nconvenient Friday was a long run 16 Mi\nconversational Pace temps again were\npretty cold but I definitely overdressed\nfor this one I had a long sleeve a\njacket a neck gator and a winter cap on\nand after a while I could feel my back\ngetting soaked from sweat so I took off\nthe jacket and put it into my pack I had\nabout a liter of scratch in there but I\ndidn't bring any food for some reason I\nguess I figured it was an easy 16 so I\nshouldn't have to need to eat as long as\nI had enough fluids but I got pretty\nhungry at about the halfway point when I\nturned around I was testing the New\nBalance 1080 version 14 for this run I\ndidn't feel like I needed to worry about\ntaking this shoe out for 16 miles on my\nfirst run in them is I have loved every\n1080 that I've ever run\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nin but I didn't love version 14 it's not\nbad it's just not an improvement over\nversion 13 in my opinion I think new\nbalance is taking the 1080 in a\ndifferent\nway at one point during this run I just\nfelt really tired so I stopped and put\nmy jacket back on and I just stood there\nto catch my breath for a moment it was\nweird 16 Mi easy takes a long time but\nthey don't usually feel all that hard\nbut this felt like a lot for some reason\nI guess this is what happens when you\ntrain specifically for a half\nmarathon the weather got suddenly super\nwarm the next day like 25\u00b0 warmer over a\n24-hour period I think that's maybe a\n13\u00b0 CSUS swing and I ran in a long\nsleeve and a thin vest just in case\nthere was an icy wind but I was\ndefinitely overdressed I probably could\nhave run in just a t-shirt maybe some\ngloves but overall it was a nice easy\nsix on a ball me\n[Music]\nday Sunday was an 11m easy run it was\n51\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 C and compared to what things\nhave been like earlier in the week this\npretty much felt like\nsummer for this run I decided to drive\nover to Al gin which is the next town\nover and then I ran on the Prairie Trail\npretty much all the way back home now I\ncould have run this the other way around\nand saved myself a bunch of driving but\nby doing it this way it's uphill on the\nway out and downhill on the way back and\nI always will prefer to save the\ndownhill for the\n[Music]\nend now week 8 was a D Lo week and it\nwas my second D Lo week so far in this\nprogram and the idea with these is that\nit's kind of like a taper where you\nreduce your mileage but maintain\nintensity and that gives your body a\nchance to absorb all the work that\nyou've been doing before you get back at\nit the following week now at this point\nin the program by week s going into week\neight my body is feeling pretty creaky\nwhich is pretty normal for me and\nanytime I enter into a training program\nonce I get to kind of like the higher\nmileage and higher intensity weeks my\nbody really starts to feel it and so\ngetting up out of a chair takes a little\nbit of extra groaning and moaning as\nthings are a bit stiff and every time I\nwake up in the morning my feet always\nreally hurt for those first few steps of\nthe day so I thought for this D Lo week\nI was going to make extra sure that I\nwas going to do all of the strength and\nconditioning and more importantly the\nmobility work for week\n[Music]\nweek eight Monday is another session day\nand this was short and fast 10 * 400 at\n550 pace and then 10 * 200 at 530 I\nreached for the Puma Nitro Elite 3 for\nthis workout the angle of attack on that\nshoe works really well for when you want\nto turn over quickly and I felt strong\non this one again it wasn't easy rather\nit was pretty rigorous but it felt like\nsomething I could handle temps were\nquite warm again so I ran with the door\nlong sleeve which is one of the airiest\nthinnest long sleeves I have and I felt\nlike this was a good pick for the day I\nwas even warm enough to take off my\ngloves for a few of the 200 met reps and\nI was glad that it was mild for this\nsession trying to do this last week when\nit was colder would have been much more\ndifficult the day after a session like\nthat would normally be an easy run or a\ncomplete rest day for most plans\nespecially on a d week which week eight\nwas supposed to be but instead I had\nsessions 2 days in a row which made not\nall that much sense to me now I've run\ndouble threshold days before so I'm used\nto working on tired legs but there's\nsomething about big workouts on\nconsecutive days that still feels kind\nof wrong well unless your body has the\nresilience of a High School cross\ncountry Runner I do not so this workout\nwas a fem time trial so after a short 1K\nwarm-up Runner had me trying to run 5\nmiles at 620 Pace the day after I had\nrun I bunch of 400s and a bunch of 200s\nnow I feel like this would be a big\nsession even on fresher legs so at the\noutset I decided that if I could just\naverage 635 or 15 seconds slower than\ngoal Pace Runner would still consider\nthat within range but even that was hard\non my tired legs so early on in this\nworkout I tried not to worry about the\npace so much but instead I focused on\nthe things that I've been trying to\nremind myself this entire block first is\nthat I can trust myself to keep pushing\nand know that there will still be\nsomething left to finish out the rep so\nI don't have to back off and the other\nthing that I've been trying to do is\nrelish the painful parts and of course I\ndon't mean that I've been running\nthrough pain like injury pain but I mean\nthat I've been running through pain in\nthe sense that my muscles are yearning\nfor more oxygen and my blood is thirsty\nfor sugar that kind of pain being able\nto persist in that moment means that\nI've been working hard and that the plan\nhas been working and that a lot has gone\nright in order for me to reach that\npoint in the work out where I am faced\nwith the decision of can I keep pushing\nI want to relish that moment I want to\nrelish that decision and that entire\nfeeling and then also be able to say yes\nI do want to keep going this pain point\nis where all the good stuff happens and\nI'm trying to relish staying in these\nmoments\noverall though the average for the 5\nmiles was 643 which was slower than what\nRuna wanted even slower than I thought I\nwould be able to hit on the day but\noverall I was happy I was able to\nsurvive these last two days which were a\ngigantic stimulus that I know is going\nto pay dividends\n[Music]\nlater Wednesday I finally got my day day\noff and for the first time in a long\ntime I enjoyed a planned rest day but\nThursday was an easy 8.5 mile run and a\nlegs and core super set it was super\ncold that day 12\u00b0 f or11 c and I put on\nmy warmest running jacket which is\nactually from a snowboarding apparel\ncompany the Fox River which is that body\nof water that I run by frequently is\nstarting to freeze over pretty hard now\nand that's weird because it doesn't feel\nlike it was all that long ago that this\nspot was full of jet skis and pontoon\n[Music]\nboats that evening I took my daughter to\nrock climbing practice and used that\ntime to get in my strength work first\nthere were these squats that you do on\nyour toes then there were these toe\ntouches that look easy but quickly\nreminded me how much I've been\nneglecting core work over the past\nseveral years then there were these fire\nhydrants which felt pretty nice for my\nhip followed by Hew walks that I think I\nmust be doing wrong because they don't\nfeel like they're doing anything for me\nand then I went through all these\nexercises a second time now at this\npoint the workout shifted over to the\nhip thrust machine the workout called\nfor two sets of the following single leg\nhip thrust which I definitely felt in my\nglutes and then after that were these\nlunge presses there was a lot of reps in\neach set so I picked up the lightest\nkettle bell I could find but even that\nstarted to feel pretty heavy by the end\nof the set and then after that were some\nplanks which again I never do any core\nwork and so these were ridiculously\n[Music]\nhard it was about 14\u00b0 Fahrenheit on that\nFriday or about -10\u00b0 C and as cold as\nthat is I've definitely been\noverdressing for my run so far the past\ncouple weeks so today I had a very thick\nlong sleeve and a vest the long sleeve\nhas a built-in Bala clava in it and\nwhile it makes me look pretty goofy it\nis definitely warm for my head and face\nbut it took a while for my upper body to\nwarm up though and that's the tricky\npart about winter running you're either\ncomfortable at the beginning and Soggy\nand Cold by the end from sweating too\nmuch or you're cold at the beginning and\nthen just a bit less soggy at the end of\nthe run there never seems to be a\nperfect level of layering for winter\nrunning now Marine Hills is one of my\nfavorite places to run in the area I run\nhere A bunch of times but the only\ndownsides are that there's a couple of\nvery hilly parts and at times it can get\npretty windy and also there are Gates\nthat keep the part locked up until 8:00\na.m. so it's hard to get an early start\nfor your long runs here but otherwise\nit's pretty much a perfect 8 and a half\nmile\n[Music]\nLoop Saturday was another rest day and\nschedule wise this worked out one of my\ndaughters had a cheerleading competition\nthat day so we spent most of the day\nsitting in bleachers and by the end of\nit I was really in Need for some\nMobility work and Runa had a yoga\nsession planned for me now I was\ninitially a bit reluctant to film this\nbecause we're still working on building\nout a little home gym in the basement\nbut it's not done yet and the basement\nitself is unfinished and so I was\nworried that it might look a little bit\nunimpressive but then I noticed that the\nyoga session that had been scheduled for\nme that day was filmed in what appeared\nto be a basement or I guess since Runa\nis a British app this would be called a\ndungeon so if a dungeon was good enough\nfor a runner my unfinished basement is\ngood enough for this video now I love\nthe idea of yoga but I don't love actual\nyoga it did get me loosened up pretty\nnicely though and I felt good overall\nafterwards and then Sunday was supposed\nto be an easy 7.5m run but I had to do\nthis after driving for a few hours in\nsome difficult conditions we were\nactually supposed to drive to Grandma's\nhouse in Iowa after the cheerleading\ncompetition the day prior but ice storms\nkept us at home overnight temps had\nrisen quite a bit though so roads were\nclear but now things were very foggy\nSunday was supposed to be a Christmas\ncookie baking day at Grandma's house\nwith all the cousins so while the\nchildren baked with Grandma I went out\nfor my run the paved roads were all very\nclear but portions of the dirt road were\na bit crunchy and some of the less\ntravel Bridges were completely covered\nin ice the cows all seem to be enjoying\nthe foggy morning though and the quick\nrise in temps this week must have made\nconditions favorable for spreading\nfertilizer and I will admit that seeing\nthe farmers spreading literal poop into\nthe air made me feel a bit less bad\nabout the emergency pit stop I had to\nmake earlier in the Run\ncan I stay for a while cuz I don't know\nany\nbetter I should say something clever but\ncan't think\n[Music]\nwhatsoever I was also supposed to do a\nstrength session that day but we had to\ndrive back home that same day from\nGrandma's house so the kids could go to\nschool one last week before the holiday\nbreak so while I wanted to do every\nsingle session this week weather\nconditions left me with about 7 hours of\nTotal driving on Sunday and little time\nleft for\n[Music]\nstrength and I don't care about the\nconsequences I think you know that\ntoo so that's it for week eight of my\ntraining plan for the half marathon at\nHouston I'm feeling good feeling\nconfident most of the time time and I'm\nreally thankful that there's been a\nreduction in my work travel so that I\nhave the time and energy to get in some\nof these accessory sessions that I've\nnormally been either just too tired or\ntoo busy to do stay tuned now for week\n10 update that'll come in the beginning\nof 2025 that gets us really close to\ntaper time for Houston so at that point\nin the week 10 update we'll talk about\nwhat Runner thinks that I'm going to be\nable to run for Houston what I think I'm\ngoing to able to run for Houston and\nwhat the race PL going to be if you want\nto try run out for yourself use code\nkofuzi for two free weeks I don't get\npaid any extra whether you use the code\nor not but it's there if you want\nit slow it down take it easy I just keep\nstaring at my phone",

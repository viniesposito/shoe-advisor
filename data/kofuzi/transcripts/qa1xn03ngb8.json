  "text": "whether you want a bit of extra\nplushness for your recovery run or you\nwant a bit more cushion for a long time\non feet there are situations where the\nmost important thing about a running\nshoe is how comfortable it is for those\ndays I reach for my Max cushion shoes\nand these are my favorites of 2024\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys about my top\nfive favorite Max cushion shoes of 2024\nbut but before I give you my thoughts on\nthese shoes I do want to go over to some\ndisclosures the fifth shoe on this list\nis a shoe that I purchased with my own\nmoney the rest of the shoes were sent to\nme by the manufacturers for the purpose\nof review however regardless of how a\nshoe gets on this list no one's paying\nme to make this video or to put their\nshoe on this list and no one's going to\nget a chance to preview any of my\nfootage or my thoughts before you guys\nget a chance to see this video on\nYouTube so with that disclosure out of\nthe way let's talk about the best Max\ncushion shoes of 2024 and in the number\nfive spot I'm putting in a shoe that\nthere might be other shoes that I\nactually prefer running when it comes to\nMax cushion shoes but I'm going to put\nit in this five SWOT because of what it\nrepresents and that shoe is from New\nBalance it's the Fresh Foam X more\nversion 5 this shoe gets the number five\nspot for me this year because it\nrepresents the best of what's available\nin what I would consider traditional Max\ncushion this is a very tall stack height\nshoe that is a bit on the kind of firm\nside it's not as soft and cushioned as\nit might appear but that all comes in\nhandy because it's still giving you a\ngood amount of stability there's a\nreally nice wide footprint on it there's\nplenty of shoe for your foot to land on\nand that wide footprint prevents the\nshoe from kind of caving in one way or\nthe other and so it kind of provides a\nlittle bit of stability to go with all\nthat foam that's underfoot to provide a\nnice comfortable experience for a long\nperiod on feet the updates to the more\nfor the version 5 this year I think make\nit much more comfortable as a run walk\nshoe or a shoe that you're just going to\nbe in for several hours if you're going\nto be on your feet all day or running a\nlongdistance PR and even though this\nshoe isn't my favorite style of Max\ncushion shoes in 2024 I think it\ndeserves a spot on list cuz it is the\nbest of what 2024 had to offer in terms\nterms of this classic Max cushioning now\nin the number four spot we're going to\nstart to see some more modern\nadaptations some more updated takes on\nwhat Max cushion is and in the fourth\nspot for me is a shoe from a brand that\nhasn't really made it into a lot of my\ntop five lists previously but it's\nmaking it this year with the infinite\nElite this shoe is from Under Armour and\nit uses a foam that Under Armour isn't\ntelling us exactly what's in here but\nit's a beaded foam that reminds me a lot\nof either either older boost kind of\nlike remember the Pure Boost or Pure\nBoost HD days or a little bit more\nrecently than that it kind of reminds me\nof the foam that was in the Triumph 20\nor 21 it kind of has that power run plus\nfeel not power R PB which is a pea based\nuh beaded foam which is more racing\ncaliber but the power and plus which\nkind of had a little bit more of a pace\nversatility at the expense of that top\nend speed and I think that's kind of a\nlot of what we're getting with the Under\nArmour infinite Elite that beaded foam\nthat's in here gives a good amount of\ncushioning but a really nice amount of\nresponsiveness too and there's a lot of\ncomfortable plush padding in the upper\nwhich is kind of a signature of a lot of\nthese Max cushion shoes is that they go\nover the top in terms of padding so\nthere is a lot of heft to this shoe so\nit's not exactly something that I'd want\nto try and run very fast or very long in\nbut for those times where I want to have\na little bit of extra Comfort but still\nwant to have a little bit pep in there\nkind of have a cake and get to eat it\ntoo I feel like the under arour infinite\nis a pretty solid Max cushion shoe and a\nvery promising entry from under arour in\nthe performance running market now let's\nmove to the number three spot and this\nis a shoe that I think has basically\ncome back from the grave it's a shoe\nthat I thought was discontinued but now\nwe're seeing it resurrected as the Glide\nride Max now this is a shoe that was the\nfirst shoe in the A6 lineup to give us a\npre review of what FF blast Max that's\none of the layers of foam that's on this\nshoe and it does it in a pretty familiar\nupper it's very Nimbus likee in the\nupper here but the reason why I prefer\nthe Glide ride Max to the Nimbus and why\nI think the Glide ride Max makes it into\nthe number three spot of the best Max\ncushion shoes of the year is because of\nthe Foams that are in here you're\ngetting a really nice amount of Squish\nthat just feels so good if you've had a\nhard session the day before but the shoe\nalso roll really well so if you do have\na little bit of a longer easy run that\nyou want to be a little extra\ncomfortable on I feel like the Glide\nride Max is going to be an easy decision\nfor me to pick up now moving into the\ntwo spot is a shoe from puma and this\nshoe is brand new for this year in 2024\nand that is the mag Max this is a shoe\nthat is using Nitro Foams in a way that\nI think is very unique and Innovative\ncompared to what I would normally think\nabout nitrogen injected Foams typically\nI find that Nitro Foams can be a little\nbit firm for daily training or recovery\nrunning purposes but the way they've\ntinkered with the formulas on these\nFoams has made this shoe very soft but\nalso still very bouncy it is I think a\nbit on the heavy side and there is a\nvery wide footprint for you to land on\nhere and so I think the width of the\nshoe makes it a little bit harder to\nWrangle for if you wanted to pick up the\npace that combined with the weight makes\nit not really fit in that long run sub\ngenre of the max cushion category but I\nthink it makes for an excellent modern\nMax cushion shoe where you are getting a\nreally great amount of comfort it's a\npleasure to step into on a recovery run\nday but it's got so much bounce that the\nshoe is very eager to run for miles and\nmiles and miles so you don't really feel\nthat traditional penalty that you might\nnormally associate with Max cushion\nshoes it's been a real pleasure to run\nin this one and it I think it rounds out\nwhat has been a fantastic year from top\nto bottom from Puma now for the number\none spot is a shoe that I instantly fell\nin love with the Brooks Glycerin Max\nthis shoe has a very tall stack height\nof Brooks DNA tune foam which again is\nanother way that a brand has taken\nnitrogen injected Foams and tinkered\nwith them in a way that you get some\nsoftness and also peppiness at the same\ntime now the way that Brooks does it is\nwith two different densities of foam and\nthose two Foams work together really\nnicely to again give you a really great\namount of comfort while also giving you\na little bit of Pep now I think that in\nterms of the Comfort versus bounciness I\nthink that the Puma magmax kind of Balan\nthe two things really well so you get a\ngood amount of cushion and a good amount\nof Pep I think with the glycerin Max\nyou're really amping up the cushion and\nyou're losing a little bit on the pep\nbut this is the max cushion category\nafter all and so I feel like in this\ncategory I don't really penalize shoes\nfor being a little bit on the\nunnecessarily heavy side a little bit on\nthe unnecessarily plush side because\nthis is a shoe that I want to be really\ncomfortable in and when it comes to\ncomfort for me the max amount of comfort\nyou can get in the max cushion category\nfor 2024 is from the glycerin Max and\nbecause it's so different from the\ntraditional glycerin I'm really excited\nthat Brooks has found this kind of like\npermission structure to really\nexperiment with Foams and deliver\nexperiences that are different than what\nBrooks typically has to offer so I'm\nvery excited about what the future holds\nfor Brooks based on what the glycerin\nMax is doing and so that's why it takes\nthe number one spot for me those are my\nfavorite Max cushion shoes for 2024 let\nme know what you've been reaching for on\nrecovery run days or for those long slow\ndistance days put them in the comments\ndown below or better yet stop by the\nlive streams that I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run Club\nChannel love to talk to you guys over\nthere in the chat that's all I for today\neverybody thanks so much for making it\nall the way to the end of this video\nhopefully you guys are staying safe out\nthere on your runs and I will see you in\nthe next one yo what's going on\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]",

  "text": "to be very honest I will admit that\nevery time I hear about a new Under\narour Elite athlete signing I really\nwonder what the heck are they going to\ndo all their daily training miles in but\nnow there seems to be a bit of an answer\nthis is the under arour infinite Elite\nand it's time to take it for a run\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\nnew Under arour infinite Elite but\nbefore I give you my thoughts on this\nshoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nunderarm are sent to me for the purpose\nof review so I did not have to pay for\nthese shoes however nobody's paying me\nto make this video or to include their\nshoe in this video no one's going to get\na chance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the Under Armour infinite\nElite and let's start with the specs\nthis is a at least on paper a 36 mm\nstack heite shoe with an 8 mm drop\ngiving us 28 mm of stack heite in the\nforefoot now this is a very big shoe and\nI I get that like sometimes shoes want\nto make the shoe appear even bigger and\ntaller than it actually is or sometimes\nthey just want to create sidew walls for\nyour foot to kind of sit inside and so\nthe foam comes up higher than what your\nheel or the bottom of your foot actually\nsits on but I think with 36 mm as the\nstated stack height for this sh I think\nthey may be just giving us the number of\nthe foam that's in this shoe and then\nthe actual measure sack I think is\neasily going to be way over 40 mm cuz\nthis shoe is very big now the main thing\nthat's in this shoe or the only thing\nthat's in this midsole is under armour's\nnew hover plus midsole foam material now\nUnder Armour isn't disclosing exactly\nwhat the formulation of hover Plus is or\nat least I don't have that information\navailable to me at this time but it is\none of those beaded Foams that to me\nlooks and feels a lot like the power run\nplus that we used to see in the older\nversions of the S Triumph series and\nvery similar at least in appearance uh\nto what we used to see in Adidas back\nwhen they had just regular boost now to\nprotect all this midsole foam Under\nArmor is applying what they're calling\nthin web Rubber outo and there are some\nexposed areas of foam in the shoe to\nhelp keep some weight down but even\nthough it's called thin web there is a\nvery generous and thick application of\nthat outsole material on the shoe\nespecially in some of the higher wear\nareas there is a lot of rubber on the\nbottom of this shoe moving to the upper\nwe have what Under Armor is calling\ntheir intella knit it looks like a knit\nmaterial and it has the word knit in it\nbut it doesn't exactly feel like a knit\nmaterial it's not as stretchy\nsoft or as comfortable as I would\nnormally think of when I'm thinking\nabout a knit material now there is also\na lot of padding and foam on the tongue\nand around the heel cup and onto this\nAchilles flare to help try and make sure\nthat the fit is accommodating to a wide\nvariety of heel shapes and also to make\nit feel a little bit more luxurious and\nthere is a big TPU heel clip to help\nmake the shoe stay stable all these\nthings add up to quite a bit of weight\nUnder Armour lists this shoe coming in\nat a a chart topping 11.8 o for a usmen\nsize 9 I actually weighed mine and mine\ncame in substantially lighter still\nheavy but it came in half an ounce later\nat 11.3 Oz and 320\nG now that we've talked about what the\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on foot and despite the\nheavy weight of this shoe this under\narour infinite Elite is a very promising\nshoe and it gives me some excitement for\nwhat Under Armour may be able to release\nin the future now it was a bit firm for\na daily training shoe for my preferences\nas someone that loves super squishy shoe\nand I didn't exactly love it when I used\nit for cool down miles after a workout\nso it's not exactly a Max cushion shoe\nfor me either although for my bigger\ntaller friends this may be just right\nbut for me this shoe became most\ninteresting when I was picking up the\npace just a little bit every everything\nin that kind of easy to moderate range\nthat's where this foam really started to\nget exciting so if you've got a run with\nsome light past changes in there this\nshoe is a really fun Cruiser now I\nmentioned earlier that it visually\nreminds me of sakon's power run plus and\nit definitely on foot feels a lot like\nsome of those older versions of power\nrun plus and it even kind of reminds me\nof power run PB or at least some of the\nreally early versions of power run PB\nwhen it was a little bit firmer of a\nformulation overall it kind of reminds\nme a lot of Styrofoam but in a good way\neven when I pick it up and touch\nit it kind of has that styrofoam kind of\nfeel to it and while that might not\nsound the most kind of exciting when you\nare putting just a little bit more into\nthe shoe when you're picking up the pace\na little bit I feel like then the\ncompression and decompression works just\nright for me and it gives me a nice\nsense of Rhythm and bounciness that I'm\nreally enjoying for some of those daily\ntraining runs that might have a little\nbit of spice spilt in to them it's\nunfortunate for me though that the shoe\nis quite heavy cuz otherwise I think\nthat this shoe really could give the\nsuper blast or the Invincible a run for\ntheir money now the other area where I\nfeel like this shoe comes uh quite a bit\nshort is in the upper now I love a good\nknit material and I feel like I'm the\nlast Advocate left out there for\nbringing knit materials back into\nrunning shoes I think they're super\ncomfortable I love to wear them I feel\nlike they're great for a running\nperformance product but it's a material\nthat seems to be going away I appreciate\nthat Under Armour is trying to bring it\nback here but this execution just isn't\nit it's not stretchy like it should be\nit's not comfortable like a knit\nmaterial should be or at least when I\nhear the word knit or if you're going to\nput the word knit into a trademarked\nproduct name and I feel like especially\nvisually speaking there's just a a lot\nleft to be desired with the way that\nthis shoe is executed there's just\nsomething about it that's really frumpy\nthat I'm just not enjoying in terms of\nthe visual aesthetic of the upper it it\nfits reasonably well it's overly padded\nand it's a little bit of a sweat sponge\nfrom a visual perspective and from a\nperformance perspective there's a lot\nmore that could have been done to really\nelevate a shoe that's going to be called\ninfinite Elite but if you're old school\nand are the kind of person that says we\ndon't choose a running shoe by color or\nit doesn't matter what a running shoe\nlooks like then I feel like the Under\nArmour infinite Elite is something you\nshould definitely consider because\nalthough it is a little bit heavy it's a\npretty fun shoe to run\n[Music]\nin now this is normally the part of the\nvideo where I like to take a moment to\nstep back and see where the shoe I'm\nreviewing might fit within a broader\nlineup of shoes within a running shoe\nbrand the only difficulty here is that\nUnder Armour hasn't always been the most\nconsistent when it comes to their\ndedication to the performance running\nspace now I've been running in Under\nArmour shoes for years uh remember one\nof my favorite Under Armour shoes that\nthey've ever made was the CGR hover mid\nit was a midrise winter shoe that had a\nknit material that I actually really\nenjoyed it had like the Bluetooth chip\ninside the heel and it connected to map\nmy run so I was an early adopter of\nUnder Armour performance running and I\nreally like those shoes but I just feel\nlike over the years they didn't really\nchange those shoes very much UnderArmour\nrunning shoes kind of always look the\nsame like UnderArmour running shoes so\nI've kind of lost interest in what they\nhad to offer although this under arour\ninfinite Elite definitely is a big step\nin the right direction and I feel like\nif I were to kind of build an\nUnderArmour running shoe rotation with\nthe product that they have now at least\nthe product that I'm aware of that I've\ntested it would kind of basically be\nbuilt around the Under Armor infinite I\nwould use it for my easy runs my\nrecovery runs even my long runs with\nsome Pace changes in it uh this is the\nshoe that I would use for the most of my\ntraining even more so than in another\nBrand's running shoe lineup for their\ndaily trainer just because there just\naren't as many other Under Armour models\nthat I'm as excited about right now and\nthen the only other shoe in the rotation\nthat I would probably put in would be uh\nThe Rao if you wanted to stay within\nunder arour for your race product as\nwell and this is the under armor flow\nvelocity Elite version 2 it has a great\ntrack record Sharon Leti has won the New\nYork Marathon in it came in fourth in\nthe Paris Olympics in it came second in\nthe Boston Marathon in it so the shoe\nhas quite a pedigree uh but it's a shoe\nthat I haven't exactly loved it has\nbiopbs in it which is a little bit\nfirmer than regular packs but I do\nappreciate the attempt at some\neco-friendliness there and it does have\na carbon fiber plate but it also has\nthis bottom layer of super critical foam\nand in the heel there's quite a a bit of\nit and so I feel like this is a fast\nshoe that some people like Sharon loes\nof the world can run fasten but for me\nit's not really a shoe that I love for\nmarathons it's something that I would\ntake for like 5K 10K racing maybe up to\nthe half marathon but as far as like\nwhat's in the Under Armour lineup now\nthese are kind of the two shoes and you\ncan certainly have a really great time\nrunning with a two shoe rotation and for\nUnder Armour this is what it would look\nlook\nlike now let's wrap up the video by\ngoing over the buy and guide and we'll\nalso talk about some Alternatives that\nyou may want to also consider the Under\nArmour infinite Elite is a pretty good\noption for long runs and for daily\ntraining for my high mileage Runners and\nfor my bigger taller friends this might\nbe the perfect level of cushion for you\nfor your daily training needs and I\nthink if you're an athlete coming over\nfrom a different sport or a team sport\nor a ball sport like a lot of under\narour customers are I feel like this is\ngoing to be a really good option for you\nto get into the running community and at\n$160 I think that the price is very fair\nbut let's take a look at some of the\ncompetition to see what that $160 will\nget you now already in this video we've\ntalked quite a bit about the sakon power\nR plus Foams so let's talk about one of\nmy favorite Power R plus shoes from\nsakon and that's the Triumph and I'm\nlooking specifically at versions 20 and\n21 which were I think pretty much the\nsame shoe maybe just a different upper\nor a slightly changed upper version 22\ngot substantially different it got a\ndifferent foam so that's going to be a\nlittle bit different of an experience\nand I think less similar to what you're\ngetting in the infinite Elite now the\npower on plus is also a beaded foam and\nit looks and feels very similar to what\nwe're getting out of the Under Armour\ninfinite elit hover plus mids foam and I\nfeel like those two shoes can be used\nvery similarly both of these shoes are a\nlittle bit firm for my daily training\npreferences and they're kind of built\nlike Max cushion shoes but I feel like\nonce you start moving in them just a\nlittle bit quicker than easy that's when\nthe shoes start to really come to life\nand that's why I feel like the\ncushioning for me feels at its best the\nTriumph 20 and 21 used to retail at the\nsame price as the Under Armour infinite\nElite at $160 but since the Triumph 21\nhas been around for a while you can find\nit still some places for around $120 and\nI feel like that's something you should\ndefinitely consider and then the other\nshoe that I think we should take a look\nat is the shoe that I always compare the\nTriumph against because it's another\nshoe that has beaded Foams as one of the\nfirst shoes to use beaded Foams that's\nfrom Adidas and that's the ultra boost\nthis is the ultra boost 5x and it's got\na different formulation of boost this\ntime it's got light boost in it which is\na lighter formulation of the regular\nboost material that initially made the\nultra boost line so popular now the\nlight boost material as the name implies\nmakes the foam a little bit lighter but\nI also feel like it's got a little bit\nless rebound to it it's a little softer\nand a little bit mushier which for a\nshoe that's called Ultra boost and is\nkind of in that Max cushion category I\nfeel like that's the right move and\nprogress for that shoe so if you want\nsomething that's a little bit more\ncomfortable looks a lot better and a\nlittle bit more cushioned then I would\nsay go with the ultra boost it is going\nto be at a premium though cuz it comes\nin at\n$180 so those are my thoughts on the\nUnder Armour infinite Elite let me know\nin the comments if you have any other\nquestions or better yet stop by the live\nstream that I do over on the kofuzi Run\nClub Channel Mondays and Thursdays I'd\nlove to see you guys over there in the\nchat that's all I for today everybody\nthanks so much for making all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nand I will see you in the next one yo\nwhat's going on\n[Music]\nn\n[Music]",

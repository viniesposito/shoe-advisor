  "text": "John career just ran the fifth fastest\nmarathon time ever on the streets of\nChicago in a meta speed Sky prototype\nbut I think it'll be a while before that\nshoe makes it to the public so in the\nmeantime let's take a look at the\ncurrent metase Sky Paris and see how my\npar is held up after 100 miles\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kafui and\nI'm a non Elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to talk to you guys all about the\nmeta speed Sky Paris after 100 Mil but\nbefore I give my thoughts on this shoe\nand how it's held up over time I do want\nto go over some disclosures this is a\npair of shoes that Asic sent to me for\nthe purpose of review so I didn't have\nto pay for these shoes however no one's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video no\none's going to get a chance to review\nany of my footage or my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the meta\nspeed Sky Paris after 100 miles and\nlet's start with how I've been using\nthese shoes I've been using these shoes\nfor racing fast workouts and my longest\nrun so for racing I raced the London\nmarathon in them earlier this year I\nreally enjoyed them for that race\nalthough I didn't have the best day it's\nnot something that I can blame on the\nshoes and my fastest run was probably my\nmost recent run which was also other\nthan a quick taper session it was the\nshortest run I did in the shoe which was\na total of 11 miles and I had 400 met\nrepeats to run at about I think they\nwere assigned to be about 5k Pace but\nthe paces I was given made them closer\nto maybe a 3K pace for me and the\nlongest run I ever did in them other\nthan the marathon was a 22m long run and\nI felt like for all three of those use\ncases very fast running very long\nrunning and Marathon racing I felt like\nthe as6 meta speed Sky Paris did really\nwell for me I think the magic of this\nshoe is the foam which gives it the\ncushion and also the responsive that I'm\nlooking for in a racing shoe but it also\ngives it an incredible lightness this is\none of the lightest Racing shoes on the\nmarket today and at a time when shoes\nare still getting bigger and bigger and\nhaving more and more foam keeping a shoe\nlightweight is still really a killer\nfeature now I do think that it's a\nlittle bit more cushioned in terms of\nthe foam than the last version of the\nmetas speed Sky Plus was and I think\nthat makes it a little bit less\naggressive of a shoe which can be good\nor bad depending on exactly what type of\nexperience you're looking for in your\nrace shoes and if I had a half marathon\nor a marathon coming up and I had to\npick between the metas speed Sky Paris\nand the metas speed Sky Plus for me in\nmy preferences I think I might go with\nthe meta speed Sky Plus today although\nthat just might be my sentimentality\ncoming through as I've had really good\nsuccessful race days in The Meta speed\nSky Plus\n[Music]\nnext let's take a look at how the shoe\nhas physically been holding up over the\nlast 100 miles uh and first I want to\nsay that this is race product we're\ntalking about here so it's not going to\nhave the same levels of longevity and\ndurability as what a shoe that you're\nusing as your daily trainer and this is\na trade-off that I think that we're all\nwilling to make when it comes to race or\nPinnacle Performance Products that being\nsaid at least visually it looks like the\nfoam on my metas speed Sky Paris has\ntaken quite a beating especially around\nsome of the edges and in some of the\npainted areas of the mid so foam uh it\ndoes look like there are some gashes and\nbits of scraping that are starting to\nhappen which is frankly a little bit\nmore damage than I typically see for me\nand my race shoes at 100 miles just keep\nin mind that a lot of this wear is\npurely cosmetic a lot of these Foams\ncan't really take on color like\nintrinsically so that color has to be\npainted on and I do think that most of\nthe worst looking damage is just the\npaint That's starting to Chip and wear\naway but I could say that the foam\nitself still feels really good it still\nfeels like there's a lot of life left\ninto it still a great amount of cushion\nstill a great amount of bounceback so\nit's compressing and decompressing\nreally well even at 100 Mil in fact I\nhave closer to 120 Mi now on this\nparticular pair of shoes and I do think\nthat I could get another Marathon out of\nthese if I needed to and after that\nafter about 150 160 mil or so of kind of\nusing these as a race shoe I think I\ncould then kind of relegate them or\ndemote them to being a really great\nworkout shoe in my rotation the one\nthing that I will note though is I think\nthat the shoe is getting slightly\nmushier over time and I think that's the\nbiggest difference between the metas\nspeed Sky Paris and the metas speed Sky\nPlus is that the foam is a little bit\nmore compressed\nand maybe similarly or slightly less\ndecompressive there's less push back\nfrom it and I think as the miles have\nbeen wearing on for the meta speed Sky\nParis I feel like it's becoming even\nmore cushioned and bouncing back with\njust a little bit less pep than I at\nleast than I remember from having a\nfresh pair of shoes but my most recent\nworkout was the fastest workout that I\ndid in the shoe and it still felt great\nfor use in workouts so it's not\nsomething that I think is anywhere near\nits end of life\nas far as the rubber on the out soole\ngoes there is a couple of spots where\nit's wearing down a little bit where\nit's becoming smooth and I'm not really\nconcerned about that amount of wear\nthat's something that I would expect to\nsee after 100 Mil in a Rao something\nthat does concern me though is that\nthere is a bit of wear at the\nintersection of the mids Sole and the\nout soole in a couple of spots on the\nshoe there's a point where the foam is\nfraying away from where the edge of that\noutsole is I think a lot of that happens\nbecause of the way that this foam\ncompresses and decompresses so much but\nit is a potential source of Detachment\nand that is something that concerns me\nas far as the upper goes I think it's\nholding up very well it still looks to\nme like a very fresh shoe as far as the\nupper is concerned and it smells\nsurprisingly not bad so I think that the\nupper is fantastic on the metas speed\nSky Paris it's the best upper that ASX\nhas put on their metas speed series\nshoes\nthat being said it still is a little bit\nof a pinky toe Crusher it's not that the\nlast is squeezing these toes as I'm\nrunning in it there's just something\nabout what's happening with my foot\ninside the shoe that these pinky toes\nare still feeling a little bit of\npressure towards the end of every\nworkout or long run that I put into the\n[Music]\nshoe now before we wrap up the video\nLet's Take a moment to talk about the\nas6 brand more generally and see what a\nrotation would look like if you are a\nmeta speed Sky Paris fan now whenever I\nthink about a running shoe rotation or\napproach a running shoe brand I always\nlike to start with the daily trainer and\nFromm as6 the one that I prefer is the\nNova blast and this is the Nova blast 4\nthis is a shoe that is fun bouncy and\ncushion you can do the bulk of your\ndaily training in and it's got the\ndurability to handle the majority of\nyour weekly runs and this is a really\nfun example of a daily trainer and then\nI think that the meta speed Sky Paris\nwould come in as the racing shoe that\nyou're going to be using to pair along\nwith the Nova blast 4 now this could be\na really fun two shoe rotation in and of\nitself but if you want to add a couple\nmore shoes in or just understand how the\nother A6 shoe in the brand fit in let's\ntalk about some more if you want\nsomething that's a little bit more\ncushioned as a daily trainer maybe you\nneed a little bit more cushion and a\nlittle bit more stability than what the\nNova Blast has then I would take a look\nat the Glide ride Max and this is the\nmax cushion shoe in the A6 lineup that I\nhave been really enjoying it's really\ncomfortable it's really cushioned for\ndays where I just want to be really nice\nto my feet this is the shoe that I would\nbe reaching for and then for your speed\nworkouts where it's something where you\nwant something a little bit faster and a\nlittle bit more kind of purpose-built\nthan the Nova blast 4 and it's kind of\ndoit all nature is built and something\nthat maybe isn't quite as important or\nas big of a as you would reach for your\nrace sto I think that I would look at\nthe magic speed 4 from A6 for that\nexperience it has some daily training\nFoams in it like the Nova blast 4 it has\na little core of race foam in it like\nThe Meta speed Sky Paris and it's got a\ncarbon fiber plate so it's got a little\nbit of both worlds built into it and\nthen if you wanted to go real crazy and\nadd a fifth shoe to this rotation I\nwould look at the super Blast 2 this is\none of my favorite shoes that A6 is\nmaking at the moment it's a bunch of FF\nturbo plus that same foam that's in the\nmeta speed Sky Paris uh but it's got\nalso a little bit of daily training foam\nin it as well and I put it on this side\nof the spectrum because I think of this\nshoe as a really great long run workout\nshoe and what by that what I mean is it\ncan do really easy running and kind of\nreally low and slow relaxed stuff kind\nof like the Glide ride maxwood but it's\nalso really great because of the foam at\npicking up the pace so if you've got a\nlong run with a bunch of Marathon miles\nin there something where you got to pick\nup the pace and do a race type effort\nthe extra comfort and cushion of the\nsuper Blast 2 plus its race day Heritage\nmake it a really fun and fantastic\nchoice now there's certainly a lot of\nAlternatives that you can go through in\nthe A6 lineup A6 has a bunch of shoes\njust like a lot of the other very big\nbrands do that you could Sub in and out\nfor the noble blast 4 you could bring in\nthe cumulus for the Glide ride Max you\ncan bring in the Nimbus and actually for\nme one thing that I would change and not\nsomething that I'm recommending but\nsomething that I personally have been\ndoing uh in this spot for your workout\nor session shoe is to actually reach out\nfor the other Marathon racer from A6 and\nthat's the meta speed Edge I think that\nthe difference in the way that this shoe\nturns over and prioritizes snappy\nturnover and quick bounce back from your\nfootstrike make it a really fun shoe for\nmy fastest of workouts so in reality\nwhile the meta speed Sky Paris is my Rao\nI'm also using it for my big workouts my\nmile repeats my longer threshold efforts\nand then for my faster stuff that's more\ntowards VO2 max that's where I\npersonally as someone that is a sky\nperson that's where I have been reaching\nfor the edge cuz I just feel like it's a\ngreat shoe for like 5K 10K efforts for\nme now I'm not recommending that people\ngo out and buy The Meta speed Edge\nspecifically for that but in reality in\nterms of how I use that shoe this is\nwhere has been fitting in for me\n[Music]\nnow let's wrap up the video by talking\nabout the buying guide and we'll also\nlook at some Alternatives that you'll\nlikely want to consider the metas speed\nSky Paris is one of the lightest Racing\nshoes on the market today and it's a\ngreat combination of cushion and speed\nas6 currently has two different sets of\nmarathon Racing shoes in its lineup\nthough the meta speed Sky Paris and The\nMeta speed Edge Paris and I think those\ntwo shoes are targeted at different\ntypes of Runners depending on the way\nthat your foot hits the ground the way\nthat your legs turn over and basically\njust the sensations that you're looking\nto prioritize in your race product and\nif you like what the meta speed Sky\nParis has to offer I think that at $250\nit is a fantastic price now it is going\nto be hard to get and all the shoes that\nI'm about to talk to you guys about are\ngoing to be difficult to get because\nright now we are at the tail end of fall\nMarathon racing season and it's like\nthat scene in Fast and the Furious when\nthey're looking for their stolen engines\nand they're freaking out because it's\nrace Wars next week and when else are\nyou going to be able to get another pair\nof engines this quickly same thing is\ngoing on for race shoes nevertheless\nlet's take a look at the other shoes\nthat are out there that you're going to\nwant to consider once inventory levels\nget back to normal and the first shoe\nthat I want to talk about is one that I\nrecently just spent a lot of time\ntalking about when I did my Adios Pro 4\nreview now I feel like both Nike and the\nother brand that I'm going to talk about\ntoday have two different types of\nmarathon Racing shoes that are each\ntargeted at again a different type of\nRunner so Nike A6 and the third brand\nthat I'll talk about later in the video\nare all kind of doing the same thing\ninstead of making one and only one type\nof race shoe depending on the different\npreferences of Runners they're making\ndifferent types of race Pinnacle product\nwhich I think is an incredibly good\nthing and a sign of how lucky we are as\nRunners to be running today in 2024 now\nI think that the person that likes the\nmeta speed Sky Paris is probably also\ngoing to like the types of Sensations\nthat are going on in the alphafly I feel\nlike it suits the similar type of Runner\nI think there's a great amount of\ncushion in the alphafly 3 and a good\namount of decompression and bounceback I\npersonally don't love the alphafly 3 as\nmuch as prior iterations of the alphafly\nand I think that a lot of that has to do\nwith the changes that they' made to the\nzoom airpods I think the zoom airpods\nare the real Secret Sauce to the\nalphafly series and I think I don't know\nif it's just a visual trick that's\nhappening to me or what but it seems\nlike they've changed changed the\nposition of the zoom airpods in the\nalpha fly 3 moving them further back or\ncloser to the middle of your arch behind\nthe pads of your feet and I feel like\nthey've also made them smaller than they\nused to be in say the alphafly one and I\nfeel like with the alphafly 1 I was\nLanding the pads of my feet right on\nthose zoom airpods and as those toes\nwere starting to push off and I was\ngetting some leverage off of the pads of\nmy feet that's when the zoom airpods\nwere pushing up against them and giving\nme that really wonderful and seemingly\neffortless bounce that you get from\nalphafly I feel like with the change in\nthe position of the airpods moving more\ntowards the arch of the shoe it feels\nlike I'm kind of missing the airpods and\nit's not doing the same thing it's kind\nof like when you're bouncing off a\ntrampoline and like the timing is not\nright and your knees Buckle a little bit\nI'm kind of getting a very micro\nsensation of that in the alphafly 3\nnevertheless if the alphafly 3 depending\non your foot strike and gate works for\nyou I feel like it's a shoe that's going\nto really work well for you and we've\nseen some of the fastest athletes in the\nworld run with great success in this\nshoe and I think the metas speed Sky\nParis is ultimately trying to Target a\nvery similar type of sensation where\nyou're getting that great amount of\ncushion in the forefoot and then popping\noff pushing up against the pads of the\nfeet so I feel like both of these shoes\nare trying to do very similar things\nalthough they're doing it with very\ndifferent types of Technology if you are\nlooking to get into a pair of alphafly 3\nthere is going to be a premium there\nthough because this shoe comes in at\n$285 $5 now the next brand that I want\nto talk about is puma and they're\nanother brand that has two different\ntypes of Rao again targeting two\ndifferent types of Runners and I feel\nlike Puma is also targeting the same two\ntypes of Runners that both Nike and as6\nare targeting and the shoe that I want\nto talk about today is going to be the\nPuma fast R2 I feel like the Puma fast\nR2 gives you a really nice sense of\ncompression when your foot hits the\nground and that carbon fiber plate I\nfeel is very rigid and you get a really\nstrong push-off sensation as your foot\nleaves the ground into your next stride\nI love the sensation that's going on\nwith the combination of the thick carbon\nfiber plate and the aliphatic TPU foam\nit's probably one of my favorite Foams\nthat it's on the market today uh the\nonly downside to this shoe being that\nit's quite a bit heavier so if the\nlightness of the metas speed Sky Paris\nis one of its biggest benefits the\nheaviness of the fast R2 is one of its\nbiggest weaknesses I still think it's a\nreally fun and fast shoe to run in\ndespite the weight but that's something\nyou definitely want to keep in mind and\nagain it's targeting that really big\namount of compression in the forefoot\nwith a really strong toe off sensation\nthat's happening for those big powerful\nstrides even if the speed or frequency\nof your turnover may suffer just a\nlittle bit just like the other two shoes\nthat I've talked about in this review\nnow the fast R2 also comes in a little\nbit more expensive than the meta speed\nSky Paris the Puma fast R2 comes in at\n$260 so $10 more to get into that one\nand then I think the last shoe that I\nwant to talk about is the shoe that I've\ntalked about a little bit already today\nand that's the meta speed Sky plus it's\nthe last version of The Meta speed now\nfrom what I can tell as6 is still\nselling this shoe on its website and I\ndon't think it's just that they have a\nlot of leftover inventory I think that\nit could be a sign of a very maturing\nrace product Market where it's it's not\nthat each shoe is Leaps and Bounds\nbetter than the previous year shoe but\nnow we're going to have different models\nthat again are focusing very small\nsubsets of preferences and so if you do\nstill like the difference in feeling in\nThe Meta speed Sky Plus or if you want\nthe newer version which has a little bit\nmore cushion to it and prioritizes the\ncompression a little bit more than the\ndecompression then the meta speed Sky\nParis is going to be the option for you\nboth of these shoes come in at $250\nthough so it's going to be the same\nprice for either of the two and like I\nsaid when it comes to raising it might\njust be that I had a really good day in\nthese but I think if I were to race\ntoday of these two shoes I'd pick the\nmeta speed Sky Plus so those are my\nthoughts on the metas speed Sky Paris\nafter 100 miles let me know if in the\ncomments if you have any questions about\nthis shoe or any of the shoes that I\ntalked about today or better yet stop\nwith the live stream I do Mondays and\nThursdays over on the kofuzi Run clip\nChannel I'd love to talk to you guys\nover there in the chat that's all I for\ntoday everybody thanks so much for\nmaking all all the way to the end of\nthis video hopefully you guys are\nstaying safe out there on your runs and\nI will see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\n[Music]",

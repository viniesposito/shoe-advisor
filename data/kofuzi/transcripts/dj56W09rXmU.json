  "text": "yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and\nI'm a non- elite Runner who viws running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I want\nto talk to you guys about how much ad R\nA 200,000 subscriber YouTube channel\nmakes in a year now these videos always\nget away from me and get way longer than\nI intend so let's jump right into it\nlet's take a look at my YouTube Studio\nthis is the channel dashboard this is an\ninterface that I look at pretty much on\na daily basis if not multiple times per\nday to kind of keep track of how things\nare going on the channel and to get to\nthe numbers that we want to look at\nlet's go to the analytics section and\nchange my view to 2024 now I am filming\nthis on December 29th to get this video\nready for release at the end of the year\nat the end of 2024 so there's a couple\nof days worth of AD rev that aren't\ngoing to be accounted for in here and a\nlot of this stuff for December is an\nestimate but so far for 2024 YouTube\nstudio is telling me that this channel\nhas had an estimated revenue of $ 59,000\n8651 and that's over the course of 11.4\nmillion views\n$824,000 watch time in hours and an\nincrease of\n35.9 th000 subscribers now there are\nPeaks and valleys based on this in terms\nof how much money I'm making in a single\nday I think the biggest day that I had\nmoneymaking wise was on April 23rd where\nI made\n$476 in one day in terms of Revenue\ncoming in in that 24-hour period and\nthat was a day where I had just posted\nmy video from the London Marathon which\nis a race that I've been training for uh\nit wasn't a great race for me that day\nuh so there was a little bit of drama in\nthat video and the week prior was the\nBoston Marathon and that video I think\nwas already up as well so I kind of had\ntwo big videos that were both out at the\nsame time which contributed to that and\na lot of these other spikes are\ngenerally around either big SHO releases\nor other big racing events that I\nintended throughout the year uh if we\nscroll down through here we could see\nwhich were the top videos in the period\nthe number one viewed video that I had\nin 2024 was for the novast 4 after 100\nmiles which that is a long-term update\nvideo I already made a novablast 4 video\nprior to that um and at the beginning of\nthe year the long-term update came out\nand that came out with a 196,000 views\nover the course of the Year second place\nalso another as6 shoe the A6 Nimbus 26\nand in third place another update video\nthe new balance Rebel version 4 with\n162,000 views and so the number one and\nthree spots are really surprising to me\nbecause I always feel like that there\nisn't as lot of momentum around the 100\nmile update review video for those of\nyou that are unfamiliar with the channel\nwhen I review a shoe I'll run in it a\nfew times get to about 20 to 30 miles in\na shoe before I do a video uh sometimes\nmore sometimes less uh and that's kind\nof like the main hit that I get from\nreviewing a new shoe that's when people\nare excited about it it's when the shoe\nis newer I'll keep running in the shoe\nto see if things change and how things\ndevelop over time and get to about 100\nmiles and that's usually when I kind of\nend my testing period with the shoe uh\nand I'll post an update video I try to\ndo those a little bit more succinctly\nbecause it's a follow-up I've already\ndone a primary review on it uh and there\nisn't as much interest or at least feels\nlike it but to see that two of my top\nperforming videos or update videos is a\nreal surprise and then another surprise\nthat I see here is that my number sixth\nmost viewed video is a watch video and\nnow this is a big comparison video Coral\nSpace 3 versus a Garmin an Apple Watch a\npolar Pace Pro so this was another like\na big wide multiat review that took kind\nof a lot of time but I generally haven't\nbeen focusing it on a lot of watch or\ndevice reviews because it feels like\nthose are a lot of work and don't get a\nlot of views back from it but this one\ndid bring in 144,000 views and that's a\npretty Successful video for me so maybe\nI need to rethink that strategy I do\nhave a bunch of watches that I've been\ntesting lately and I haven't reviewed\nyet so I think that means that I should\nprobably do another kind of multiat big\ncomparison review video I just got to\nsit down and actually film it after\ngoing through all of my testing so let's\ndig deeper into some of these other sub\nuh menus in this analytics section to\ngive a little bit more context in terms\nof what this running Channel gives so\nnow in terms of published content I have\nbeen doing both shorts and YouTube\nvideos my shorts strategy is really just\ntake the reals that I'm making on\nInstagram and then post the same one on\nuh YouTube shorts I've never been a huge\nfan of making YouTube shorts and I don't\nreally love making short form videos I'm\nmore of a long form guy um but I felt\nlike I have to have some sort of present\nin YouTube shorts so I'm trying I'm\nseeing a little bit of traction and\ngrowth from it uh but it still feels\nlike it's more trouble than it's worth\nuh this year I uploaded 143 shorts and I\ndid 101 videos and those are long form\nvideos whether it's a shoe review an\nupdate shoe review video or uh I also do\nRun Travel Vlogs where I'm going to a\nrace or going to running event uh and so\nthat's where those 101 videos are coming\nfrom um in terms of how viewers are\nfinding me this is a product review\nchannel so like search and optimization\nis pretty important but it's not the\nmost important way that viewers are\nfinding me at this point in my YouTube\ncareer uh the browse features on YouTube\nare the main way I think that's\nscrolling through kind of like your\nhomepage is how people are finding me or\nother browsing mechanisms whether it's\nlike you shown a kind of like a panel of\nvideos at the end of watching a\ndifferent video and you can select which\none you want to watch next I think that\nalso counts as browse uh 32.6% of My\nViews are coming in from browse and\n31.6 are coming in from YouTube search\nand those are the two main ways that\npeople find me let's compare that to\n2023 where um much more of it came from\nbrowse and even less of it came from\nYouTube search which is interesting\nbecause this year I've spent even less\ntime worrying about tags to put into\ndescriptions or uh making sure that\nthere's hashtags or accounts that are\ntagged or anything like that but I have\nbeen trying to spend less time worrying\nabout like making sure that everything\nis optimized and just kind of naming\nthings the way that I would name them if\nI were to do a search for these things\nlet's go to audience which uh always\nsurprises me every year um gain 35.9\nth000 subscribers this year which is\nactually a a big decrease from last year\nit's a 27% decrease compared to the\namount of subscribers I gained last year\nI think big part of that is that uh I\nthink reviewed fewer shoes this year I\ndid a lot of work travel traveling to\nevents uh traveling to cover races uh\nand those always just take up a lot of\nmy time and make it harder for me to\nreview more shoes so I think that if I\nhad reviewed more shoes uh I probably\nwould have gained more subscribers at\nthis point and it's been this way for a\ncouple of years now I'm not too\nconcerned about getting new subscribers\nI kind of like the number of people that\nare here the community feels manageable\nto me the community feels uh intimate\nand welcoming and supportive but it has\nbeen down quite a bit and I do think\nit's because there has been less uh shoe\nreview videos and I do feel like I need\nto review a lot more shoes uh in 2025 so\nthat's something that I want to be\nfocusing on not just because of the fact\nthat it affects subscriber growth that's\nactually one of the last reasons why I'd\nbe increasing the number of shoe reviews\nuh it's just that this is a running shoe\nreview Channel and you kind of have to\nremember uh what people are coming here\nfor and then the last thing from this\nsubmenu that I want to go over is the\nage and gender and I always find this\nvery surprising uh I don't really feel\nlike I'm making a very male oriented\nChannel yet uh this number has been\ngoing up every single year this year I'm\nat 91.4% male viewership uh with 8.6%\nfemale viewership uh at least based on\nthe ways that are identifiable from the\nway that you are or aren't logged in on\nYouTube uh it's very different than what\nI experience on Instagram and also even\nmore so different than what I experience\nin in-person events in terms of people\nthat are coming to meetups group runs\nthat I do uh there it does not feel like\nit's 91% male to 9% female at all so\nthat number is always a big surprise for\nme I've had various theories as to why\nthis is over the years but ultimately\nthe figure is what the figure is it's\n91% male on the channel as far as\nYouTube and Google are concerned uh with\nthe the vast majority of those people\nbeing in either the 25 to 34 year old\ncategory or the 35 to 44y Old category\nall right uh last submenu that we'll go\nover is the revenue section and I think\nthere's a couple of interesting things\ngoing on in here we saw what were my top\nperforming videos earlier in terms of\nviews now let's talk about what the top\nperforming videos were in terms of\nRevenue or ad rev that comes in um and\nthe number one was the Sak endorphin\nspeed 4 which was one of my favorite\nshoes of the year uh it didn't end up\nbeing my shoe of the year but I thought\nit had shoe of the Year potential that\nended up being my highest revenue\ngenerating video of the year that video\nalone generating\n$1,248 which is quite a bit of a\nsurprise it's a great shoe uh but the\nviews weren't really there they didn't\njump out at me as being like an\nexceptionally High performing video so\nthe fact that the revenue is high on\nthat is a little bit of a surprise and\nthen the other surprise for me is that\nthe there's three videos in the top five\nad rev generating videos that are not\nshoe review videos so uh I mentioned\nthat I do Run Travel uh or run Vlog type\nof videos I call them Runners weekend\nthat's the name of that series the\nsecond highest revenue generating video\nthat I have was from my visit to the\nBoston Marathon I didn't run it uh in\n20124 uh but I went to go and put on\nsome Live inperson Events uh and I went\nto go watch watch the race itself and\njust kind of show what it's like to go\nas a super fan uh to attend a big world\nmajor Marathon that ended up bringing in\n$1,000 in Revenue in the net net I think\nthat in terms of the adrev versus what\nthe expenses were on that trip uh the\nexpenses were way more than $1,000 but\nthat is something where I am doing\nin-person events where I do charge\nappearance fees and so there's different\nmath that makes that work out I'm pretty\nsure I'd have to talk to my agent about\nthat but I'm pretty sure that I ended up\npositive on the Boston trip and then\nnumber four was the marathon trials so\nthe there was a marathon that was run in\nOrlando for the top American men and\nwomen to see who would go to the\nOlympics I went to go and spectate that\nrace chase the athletes around the\ncourse and try and film them doing their\nthings and being excellent uh and that\nbrought in\n$940 and then the fifth highest\nperforming was the London Marathon video\ncoming in at\n$928 now there was two London Marathon\nvideos that I made one was from the race\nitself and we kind of talked about that\nearlier on that high Revenue day that I\nhad this runnner weekend video is a\nvideo that I make later on talking about\nall the things that I did while I was\ntraveling the places I stayed the people\nI saw the things that I ate all that's\nkind of in that travel and running video\ntogether and that Runners weekend video\nfrom London rounds out the top five\nRevenue performances for 2024 now\nthere's a button down here there you\ncould see more and one of the things\nthings that I was trying to do is figure\nout what was my worst performing video\nof 2024 but it only goes up to 50 videos\nnow I only made 100 in one video so uh I\nwas hoping that maybe there's like an\narrow to click to next and maybe I could\nsort by lowest amount of Revenue that\nwasn't available but uh you can export\nyour top 500 videos throughout the\nentire channel for the period of 2024\nand when I did that uh I it gives you a\nseparate spreadsheet I open it up in a\nGoogle sheet and it looks like to me my\nworst performing video of 2024 was from\nabout a year ago January 12th it was my\nreview of the insta 360 Ace Pro uh that\nvideo brought in\n$557 which puts me way upside down on\nthe cost of that camera cuz I think it\nwas a $250 maybe a $300 camera something\nin that territory so uh that one\ndefinitely is a flop which makes sense I\ndidn't love the camera and so uh I'm not\na person that likes to go negative on\nthe internet uh and I think that my\nviewers don't like it when I go negative\non the internet so that's a video that I\nthink just didn't do well so uh that's\npretty much it from what I had planned\nto go over from uh all of my statistics\non this 200,000 YouTube subscriber\nchannel uh let me know in the comments\nif you have any other questions that you\nwant me to follow up on in terms of how\nthings work or any other metrics that\nare going on in the YouTube channel I'm\nhappy to share them with you you guys uh\nthis is a video that I've been making\nfor 7 years now I'll post links to all\nthe other ones that you could see uh\ndown in the description uh below so you\ncould check those out uh if you are near\none of those Milestone numbers uh to see\nwhere your channel Stacks up thanks\neverybody for making it all the way to\nthe end of this video hopefully you guys\nare staying safe out there on your runs\nor whatever it is that you're doing and\nI will see you in 2025",

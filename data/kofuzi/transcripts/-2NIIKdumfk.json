on display and I was able to\nget a look at the unique carbon plate\nthere was a food truck outside the spot\nand so many friends to catch up with\n[Music]\ninside and then afterwards Drew and

through a quick warm-up we got the\ngroup photo and then\n[Music]\noff a lot of congestion with the end of\nthe dash to the Finish 5K going on on\nand kind of intersecting with our route\nhere but now that we're in the park\nspreading out a little bit it's a\nbeautiful morning the r\n[Music]\ncomfortable the halfway point was at the\nreservoir and we stopped there to make\nsure we had everyone we took another\ngroup photo and then we headed back to\nthe Run of space\n[Music]\nwe are back to some of the\ncongestion by the Finish\nLine almost done almost back are you are\nyou in a red yes oh sorry yeah no no no\nF there's so much congestion here you\nknow so oh my you can keep going I we're\nalmost done we're just a little bit down\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right just finished getting some\nbreakfast with Chase and Drew now Drew\nand I are going to head back further\nsouth and go check out the coffee Club\npodcast is this the\nway I don't know if this is Del way you\nhave half\naway Drew did take us the right way and\nthe subway got us to the on popup pretty\nquick but we still got to the podcast a\nfew minutes late so it was already a\npacked house when we arrived I've been\nlistening to the coffee Club podcast for\na while it was good to be able to see a\nlive taping they had trivia Q&A from the\naudience and even a little bit of\nheckling of the OAC rookies it was a fun\nshow all I long to say to you oh\ndownstairs there was a bit of running\nshoe history from on which is the kind\nof thing that I always love to nerd out\non and then a chance to watch the\nShoemaker robot and even try on a demo\n[Music]\npair yeah you make me so\nnervous yeah say it's\ntrue tight and\ntwisted that's what you\ndo my hands sh\n[Applause]\nit\n[Music]\nCL all right that's it for the on store\nthat was pretty amazing that robot's\ncool I welcome our robot overlords as\nlong as they make good\nshoes now we're going to head over to\nBandit\nI think a lot of people forget that\nBandit is still a very young apparel\nbrand I have been to every New York\nMarathon popup they've done and that\ntradition only goes back to 2022 want to\nwelcome you guys to our uh first popup\nthey've come a long way in that amount\nof time and this year they're releasing\na collab collection with a major running\nshoe brand and personally I love the R\nherana theme\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nrace day morning started early for me\nwith a wake up time of about 4:30 a.m. I\ndid a big a digging to find out which\nhotel is the athlete hotel and I wanted\nto try and get some Paparazzi style\nfootage of the athletes as they boarded\ntheir buses to Staten Island but like in\nChicago and in Boston the athlete hotel\nis also a hotel for a lot of marathon\nparticipants so it's a pretty busy\natmosphere in the morning people I know\nboth personally and professionally kind\nof all over the place the athletes\nthough seem to be in really good spirits\nmost of them seemed chipper despite the\nearly hour but they were just very\n[Music]\nrelaxed after the athletes left I had a\ncouple hours to put together a pre-race\nreel and then I met Drew for\n[Music]\nbreakfast okay we've got off the train\nwe got a little bit of time before the\nathletes get in here let's get into\nposition we started the morning in\nBrooklyn as we always do and this is my\nfavorite spot to watch the race as it's\nearly enough that all the pros are still\nbunched up together but it's also\nrelatively less crowded so I can do my\nthing running along with the athletes to\nfilm them I put together a separate race\nvideo that is more of a contemporaneous\naccount of everything that happened that\nday so here what I'll do is I'll give\nyou a bit more of the behind the scenes\nnow with the way that the race waves are\nstaggered we always see the women first\nand then the proen but in between there\nis the MasterCard secret wave my friend\nAshley was in that wave as was feno who\nis getting his six star while running in\na tuxedo of all things and then there\nwas Alexi p who is another perennial\nrunner in this\nwave after we saw the men Drew and I had\nto hustle to catch the train last year\nwe got super Lucky by connecting to the\nexpress six train that took us up to see\nthe runners at Mile 19 with just a\nmoment to spare this year though we were\ntrying to get to 59th and see the pros\nright after Queensboro Bridge at Mile 16\nwe knew the women would be far too fast\nfor us to see them there but we thought\nwe might have a chance for the men but\nthe train took longer than we expected\nand the men were already gone before we\nwere out of the subway fortunately we\nhad Chase on the team to grab footage\nfor us at a couple of spots along the\ncourse he saw the pros coming up first\nab and then again in the park near the\nend of the race meanwhile Jew and I had\nto run across Manhattan and then\nnavigate through security and the paths\nof Central Park to get to the bleachers\nof the East\ngrandstand there we had really good\naccess to see the athletes as they came\nto the finish and because most people\nwho buy East grandstand tickets do so to\nsee their friends and family finish the\nrace and not to see the pros there was\nample space there there's also a private\nset of porta potties there too which Jew\nand I took advantage of after seeing the\npros come in and before we headed back\nout on the course to find our\n[Music]\nfriends now there's a special magic to\nthe New York Marathon the first is that\neven though this race is gigantic and\nthis year's race would end up being the\nlargest Marathon ever you can usually\nfind your friends just a couple of weeks\nago I had loaded up a bunch of friends\ninto my tracker for the Chicago marathon\nand I somehow ended up missing almost\nall of them in New York though you'll\nend up finding everyone you were looking\nfor and you'll also run into people you\ndidn't even know were racing like my\nfriend Nicholas who is one of the\nfounders of Chicago run crew 3 Run 2 and\neven though you don't plan it you'll\nalso find Friends Along the course that\nare always cheering like Hela who I\nfirst met a few years ago while we were\neach cheering for friends along the\ncourse of the New York Marathon at Mile\n8 in Brooklin Pro tip though cheering\nfor the New York Marathon is an\nendurance event unto itself make sure\nyou eat Drew and I usually stop by this\nShake Shack that is on the course and as\nwe're eating if we see that one of our\nfriends is about to come through on the\ntracker one of us stays in the\nrestaurant with the food while the other\ngoes out to cheer and we take turns this\nyear I was able to find Chloe who is a\nrunner who lives in the next town over\nfrom me out in the suburbs of Chicago we\nnever actually met in person but we each\nnotice that we sometimes have some\nfamiliar looking backgrounds in our\nrunning videos and that's how we started\nconnecting this was Chloe's first\nmarathon and she did such a good job\nwhile also raising a bunch of money for\ncharity\nthe last bit of magic that New York\noffers is the final finishers even\nthough Aid stations may have to shut\ndown and the slowest Racers may have to\nmove to the sidewalks as roads Rea in to\ncar traffic the Finish Line itself waits\nfor every Runner to complete the mission\nmore than 10 hours after the last wave\nstarts in Staten Island there are still\nRunners crossing the line in Central\nPark and the New York Marathon keeps the\ncameras rolling the lights are still on\nand crowds line up to give these final\nfinishers a proper\nwelcome Ted metalis the race director\nwho is there to welcome the first\nfinisher of the race he also welcomes\nthe last finisher as they crossed the\nline\ntoo this year that last finisher was\nSuper Mario a 74-year-old Italian man\nwho finished his\n35th New York Marathon\nTed gave me a hug as I finished my\nmarathon in Berlin and completed my six\nstars a couple months ago so I can tell\nyou when I see Ted hug someone else at\nthe end of the race that Ted gives out\nthe best hugs and let me tell you\nanother New York Marathon Secret inside\nthe pouch that Ted wears is a packet of\nwet whips and as Super Mario was getting\nphotograph\nand about to be interviewed for TV Ted\nmade sure to First wipe the sweaty crust\nfrom Mario's mouth so he would look his\nbest in his television\ninterviews at a time where maybe your\nfaith in the goodness of people may be a\nbit\nrattled know that the people you see\nhere are good people\nknow that empathy still does\nexist thank you New York for this\nreminder we need it now more than\n[Music]\never you\nyou\n[Music]",

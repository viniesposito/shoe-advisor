  "text": "[Music]\nthe mo version 4 was my top Max cushion\nshoe back in 2022 and I guess it was so\ngood that New Balance didn't think it\nneeded updating for almost two full\nyears so was it worth the wait let's\nlace up the more version 5 and take it\nfor a\n[Music]\nrun heart beats going\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm a non Elite Runner who reviews\nrunning shoes here on YouTube and today\nI want to tell you guys all about the\nNew Balance Fresh Foam X more version 5\nbut before I give you my thoughts on\nthis shoe I do want to go over some\ndisclosures this is a pair of shoes that\nI bought myself nobody's paying me to\nmake this video or to include their shoe\nin this video and no one's going to get\na chance to preview any of my footage or\nmy thoughts before you guys get a chance\nto see this video on YouTube so with\nthat disclosure out of the way let's\ntalk about the more version five and\nlet's start with the specs this is a\nvery tall shoe starting out at 44 mm of\nstacky in the heel with a 4 mm drop\ngiving us 40 mm of fresh foam X in the\nforefoot of the shoe and that's the only\nthing that's in the shoe just that Fresh\nFoam X goodness now the big thing that I\nnoticed with version 5 to version four\nis that there is a major Aesthetics\nchange the version five is basically\ngetting a design update to match the\nsame design language as the rest of the\nfresh FX line so if you've seen the\nchanges to the 1080 version 14 uh you'll\nsee that there are a lot of similarities\nto the more version 5 but it's not just\na cosmetic change there's a couple of\nreally big hints that newbounds drops in\nthe way that they talk about this shoe\nfor one thing when we look to the\noutsole of the shoe there is a bottomup\noutsole for additional 4ot stiffness and\nthe other thing that they've done is\nthat they've changed the rocker profile\nof the shoe so when you're looking at\nthese two shoes the way that these two\nshoes curl up as your foot moves through\nthe gate cycle is very different in the\nmo version 5 than in the mo version 4 so\nthose are going to be two very\nsignificant differences that are going\nto end up making a very big impact later\non when I talk about what the shoes\nactually like to run in my US men's size\n9 came in at a weigh measurement of 318\nG or 11.2 Oz\n[Music]\nnow that we've talked about what the\nshoe is like on paper let's talk about\nwhat it's like on the road the more\nversion 5 is a very good Max cushion\nshoe the fit of the upper is true to\nsize it's not too baggy it's not super\nwide I feel like it's just right and the\nmaterials that they've chosen for this\nshoe are very comfortable especially if\nyou're putting this shoe on on a\nrecovery day or after a tough workout\nthe upholstery work on this shoe is\nexcellent and I think it's a great\nexample of how you can have a very\ncomfortable and luxurious feeling shoe\nwithout resorting to a bunch of excess\nfluffy padding that is only going to end\nup being a sweat sponge in some of those\nwarmer months so I feel like the fit on\nthe upper is exactly what I want which\nis also something that I could say about\nthe mo version 4 the fit of the mo\nversion 4 and the fit of the mo version\n5 are excellent fits but when it comes\nto the actual running in the shoe as a\nmore version 4 Super Fan I find that\nlike the mo version 5 a little bit less\nthe shoe feels like it's a little bit\nfirmer and a little bit more stable and\nthat's something that we saw in a lot of\nshoes across 2024 so it's not a surprise\nthat this is what happened to the mo\nversion 5 but overall The Sensation that\nI'm left with is that this is a shoe\nthat seems to be more intended for\nhigh-intensity walking than it is for\nhigh mileage running and there's nothing\nagainst a walking in a running shoe or\neven having a shoe that is really well\nsuited for run Walkers uh but it's just\nvery different than the experience that\nI felt in the mo version 4 and I really\nam kind of caught off guard I wasn't\nexpecting such a drastic change between\none and the other now the most common\nquestion that I got when it came to the\nmore version 4 was how is this shoe for\nwalking which indicates to me that a big\nportion of the at least more version 4\ncurious audience was not only is it good\nfor running but is it going to be a\ncomfortable shoe cuz it looks nice and\nbig and comfy is it going to be good for\nstanding in all day or for long periods\nof walking or if walking is your primary\nmode of outdoor activity and the thing\nthat I would say the most is because of\nthe aggressive rocker that was on the\nfront end of this shoe I really enjoyed\nit for running but I didn't like it as\nmuch for walking because I felt like\nthat transition felt a little bit\nawkward at the walking pace where as at\nthe running pace it was just right for\nbeing able to move this large amount of\nfoam now the change that they've made to\nthe rocker geometry which New Balance\ntold us about in all the documentation\nand this additional 4 foot stiffness\nthat they talk about is intended to make\nit less aggressive which then flips the\nscript on the more version 5 which makes\nit much more comfortable if you've got\nto be on your feet all day or if you're\nusing this for run walk or just walk but\nfor running I felt like it made the shoe\na little bit harder to Wrangle all this\nmidsole foam that was here so for me it\nfelt a little bit less exciting it felt\na little bit less like the more version\n4 that I fell in love with and it made\nit feel more like kind of traditional\nMax cushion shoes at the end of the day\nI'm not mad at New Balance or the more\nfor changing in the way it did I think\nthat this way the more version 5 is\ngoing to have much broader Commercial\nAppeal it's just not going to appeal as\nmuch to me\nnow before we wrap up this video let's\ntake a moment to zoom out and see where\nthe more version 5 fits within the\nbroader New Balance lineup and to\nunderstand New Balance you have to\nunderstand that they have two different\ntypes of foam they have fresh foam X\nwhich is what we've been talking about\nwith the more version 5 and they have\nfuel cell two different types of foam\nthat are intended to give two different\ntypes of experiences fuel cell is\nsupposed to give you speed rebound and\nresponsiveness and the Fresh Foam X is\nsupposed to give you softness and\ncomfort but let's take a look more\nclosely at the Fresh Foam X shoes\nbecause I think that's going to be more\nimportant in the discussion of the more\nversion 5 now within the Fresh Foam X\nshoes and there are a lot of fresh foam\nX shoes there are kind of three main\nshoes that I want to talk about there's\nthe 880 the 1080 and the more version 5\nnow the 880 has always been kind of the\ndaily training shoe and I think as you\ngo along this direction C on this\nspectrum you're getting more and more\ncushion and comfort the 1080 used to\nkind of be the max cushion shoe in this\nlineup now is until the more came to be\nand ever since the more existed in the\nlineup the 1080 has been shifting ever\nso slightly more towards the daily\ntraining side so there aren't clear cut\noffs as to when it's a daily trainer and\nwhen it's a Max cushion shoe it's all\nkind of a spectrum based on how much\ncomfort and how much cushion you want\nunderfoot these days as far as the Fresh\nFoam X daily trainers are concerned I'm\nreally loving the 1080 as the daily\ntrainer and the more version 5 as the\nmax cushion shoe now there is one\nadditional wrinkle because this year New\nBalance also introduced The Fresh Foam X\nBOS or BOS I've never really been sure\nhow to pronounce this shoe now while I\npersonally had some difficulty running\nin this shoe it gave me a little bit of\nof foot pain which is a weird thing that\nhappens to me once every like 30 to 50\nshoes certain shoes just disagree with\nwith my foot but this has been a really\ninteresting higher cushion shoe than the\n1080 which I really think is kind of an\neither or with the more version five I\nthink if you like traditional Max\ncushion shoes think shoes like the Bondi\nfrom Hoka then I think that the more\nversion 5 is going to be the max cushion\nshoe for you but if you like something\nthat's a little bit bouncier a little\nbit more kind of in my mind modern and\nfun then I feel like the BOS is kind of\nlike the runnner version of the more\nversion 5 and that's kind of how I\nunderstand the the Fresh Foam X shoes\nnow let's bring in also the fuel cell\nfoam shoes and in the interest of\nbrevity I'm not going to go through each\none of these individually but there are\nalso fuel cell foam shoes that kind of\ncover a lot of the same bases as the\nFresh Foam X shoes but keeping in mind\nthat fuel cell is a little bit more of\nkind of a performance oriented product\nthat's where the racing product from New\nBalance is going to sit so if we take\nthese shoes both the fuel cell and the\nfreshx and kind of Shuffle the deck and\nkind of mix everything together to make\nthe best five shoe rotation that you can\nhere's kind of how I would put that\ntogether in the daily training spot I\nwould pick Rebel version 4 in my opinion\nthis is one of the best daily trainers\nthat you can buy right now it's fun it's\nlightweight it's Snappy it can do fast\nstuff it can also go long distances as\nwell this would be the center piece of\nthe rotation and you can either put the\n1080 in that position or the 880 in that\nposition the all can kind of be\ninterchanged depending on the experience\nthat you are looking for now as far as\nrace product go then I would go to the\nSC Elite version 4 this is their\nMarathon racing shoe in the lineup and I\nthink kind of in between these two shoes\nis the SC Pacer version 2 now this could\nalso be the marathon racer for some\npeople and I really feel like this year\nnewbounds tried to make this an\nalternative Marathon racer a lot of\nBrands now have two different\nexperiences for your their marathon Race\nproduct but for me this one just felt a\nlot firmer than I would like for\nMarathon distance and I'd kind of put it\nhere as a workout session shoe for\nsomething that I'm going to try to go a\nlittle bit faster than Marathon workouts\nmight normally entail and I feel like\nthis is more of like a 5k 10K racer now\nas far as the max cushion goes that's\nwhere I think you can bring in a shoe\nlike the mo version 5 or if it works for\nyou I think the BOS is a lot more fun of\nan experience so because this is a more\nversion 5 video I'll leave the more\nversion 5 in this position even though\npersonally if it did work for me I would\ngo with the BOS and then you've got the\nSC Trainer version 3 which kind of fits\non the end over here in that new\ngeneration of long run shoes where\nthey're very comfortable but also still\nvery peppy and performance oriented and\nfor a lot of people this like long run\nshoe category is where a lot of people\nmight be picking out their Marathon\nRacers if traditional carbon plated\nRacers aren't working for them so this\nwould be like the five shoe lineup that\nI would pick from New Balance but if\nwe're going to trim this down to three\nshoes then I think the shoes that I\nwould eliminate from this discussion\nwould be the pacer version 2 and the SC\nTrainer version three the rebel version\n4 would be your daily trainer and your\nworkout shoe the more version 5 would be\nyour time on feet and Recovery run shoe\nand then for your toughest workouts and\nfor your Marathon racing you'd go with\nthe SC Elite version 4 and then if we're\ngoing to drill that back even further to\njust a shoe rotation then I think you\ncould have a lot of fun with just the\nrebel version 4 and the SC Elite version\n[Music]\n4 now let's wrap up the video by going\nover the buying guide and we'll also\ndiscuss some of the Alternatives that\nyou'll likely want to consider the more\nversion 5 is a classic Max cushion\nrunning shoe with a healthy dose of both\ncomfort and stability it's going to be a\ngreat shoe for those looking to set time\non feet PBS as well as those looking for\na really good RunWalk or pure walking\nexperience this shoe has been out for a\nlittle while but it's still selling for\nthe retail price of\n$155 and I think for the amount of shoe\nand the kind of shoe that you're getting\nhere I feel like that's a pretty good\nprice but if you are looking for the\nmore runnable of the two options I would\nlook at last year's more version 4 and\nyou can find it at discount in some\nselect sizes there's not a lot left\nremaining but you might be able to find\nit at a discount in your size at\n$110 but there's also competition from\nother brands that you're going to want\nto consider and let's take a look at\nthose the first one that I think we\nreally need to take a look at because I\nfeel like it's the barometer against\nwhich all kind of classic Max cushion\nshoes are mentioned is from Hoka and\nthat's the Bondi this is the Bondi 8 and\nI feel like this is a very mature shoe\nit's not going to be changing a ton year\nover-ear you're going to be getting a\npretty consistent experience and that\nexperience is something that's really\ngreat for people who are on their feet\nall day and want something comfortable\npeople that want a RunWalk shoe or\npeople that want to set time on feet PBS\nand want something that provides both\ncomfort and stability and that's a lot\nof the same ways that I would explain\nthe more version 5 now I feel like the\nBondi is kind of the most old-fashioned\nof the max cushion shoes if we can kind\nof talk about them that way so I think\nthere's a little bit more firmness and a\nlittle bit more stability in that shoe\nso depending on what you want the Bondi\nmight be the better choice but even\namongst these two shoes for people\nlooking squarely at this type of shoe I\nthink that the more version 5 is still a\nbit more comfy and a bit more fun now\nthe Bondi retails at 165 but it's been\nout for a little while and you might be\nable to find it at about a 20% discount\nat 132 bucks and then the last two that\nI think we should talk about kind of\nsits in the middle between I guess the\nmodernity of the more version 5 and the\nBondi 8 and that's from toppo and this\nis the atmos now when I reviewed the\natmos I kind of felt like this is what\nthe Bondi should be looking to in terms\nof staying true to what a Bondi is but\nalso being able to take advantage of\nsome modern techniques and materials\nthat can go into shoe construction and\nso a lot of the things that I've been\nsaying about the mo and that I've been\nsaying about the Bondi apply to the\natmos as well but I feel like it's kind\nof like a step elevated from the Bondi 8\nin terms of being a little bit more fun\nto run in and a a little bit peppier and\nthe Topo Atmos comes in at 160 so a\nlittle bit more expensive than the more\nversion 5 but kind of splits the\ndifference between what you're getting\nin the Bondi 8 and what you're getting\nin the more version 5 so we've got kind\nof three flavors of classic Max cushion\nshoes here for you to choose from if you\nhave any other questions about the mo\nversion 5 or any other shoes that I\ntalked about today feel free to put them\nin the comments down below or better yet\nstop of the live stream that I do\nMondays and Thursdays over on the kofuzi\nRun Club Channel love to see you guys\nover over there in the chat that's all\nit for today everybody thanks so much\nfor making it all the way to the end of\nthis video hopefully you guys are\nstaying safe out there on your runs and\nI will see you in the next one yo what's\ngoing on\n[Music]",

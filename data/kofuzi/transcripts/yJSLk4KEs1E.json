  "text": "at age 45 I've been starting to think\nthat my PR days are behind me but I'm\nnow six weeks into my latest training\nblock getting ready for the half\nmarathon at Houston let's talk about how\nthings are\n[Music]\ngoing yo what's going on kofuzi here\ncoming to you on location from my\nbackyard starting a new series here and\nI thought we'd do something a little bit\ndifferent get away from the basement and\nmy two different sets that I have down\nthere so I thought I'd do this outside\nit is very cold getting colder and it\njust started snowing so this may be a\nreally bad idea but first things first I\nthink I should clarify that the event\nthat I am training for is at the Houston\nMarathon in January there's also a half\nmarathon that gets run at the same time\nso that's the event that I am running\nand this is an event that I ran before\nI've actually run both the full and the\nhalf ran the full in 2020 and then I ran\nthe half last year for a little bit of a\nPB\n1257 it was a long overdue to update\nthat PB but I was happy to notch that uh\nbut I did it in an annoying time CU it's\na\n1257 had I run 8 seconds faster I would\nbe A4 guy and that sounds just so much\nfaster than 125 I normally don't get to\nbothered with what my PBS are and\nmanaging little seconds like that but\nwhen it's that close it ends up being\nsomething that I've been thinking about\nfor the entire year now for that last\nbuild I was pretty much self-coached and\ndoing kind of the normal things that I\nnormally do for a marathon uh because I\ndon't really know how to trade myself\nfor a half marathon I did have a Little\nHelp from Sage giving me some pointers\non some workouts ahead of that half and\nthat was really helpful but this time I\nthought I would try using using the Runa\napp they are the sponsor for this series\nso let's take a look at what the\ntraining has been like so far and let's\nstart with week\nfive Mondays and Wednesdays are usually\nsession days but week five was the week\nI would be in Austin for the running\nevent so I rearranged my training in the\napp so that I could have a rest day that\ncoincided with my travel day and then\nTuesday was an easy run and I was going\nto be running with Tommy runs that\nmorning but to hit my mileage goal for\nthe day I needed to tack on a few miles\nbeforehand so I had to get up even\nearlier and run in the dark but the\nmiles went quickly the sunrise was\ngorgeous and then I was able to meet up\nwith Tommy now Tommy normally runs his\neasy runs faster than I do but this was\nhis first run since running the New York\nMarathon a couple weeks prior so that\nwas a bit of an equalizer and we had a\nfantastic run that morning\n[Music]\nthe next day Wednesday was a session day\nand it was a pretty big one at that 10 *\n800 with just 90 seconds of recovery\nthis is basically a yaso 800 a workout\nthat I typically do at the end of a\nmarathon training block when I'm super\nfit so I was a bit intimidated to find\nit here in the middle of a half marathon\ncycle just to up my things and go just\nto be free just want to Zone just to\nflow just to hang with the G sometime\nchill my the good news was that I was\nable to run in a secret prototype racing\nshoe from one of the shoe brands I was\nin town for the running event the bad\nnews is that I can't show it to you or\ntell you about it but I can say I think\nthat the shoe was really good and I\naveraged 3 minutes per 800 M repetition\nwhich means that the last 5 weeks of ARA\nhas put me in the equivalent of 3-hour\nmarathon Fitness and with how much I\nbeen struggling with running and work\ntravel over the last year I really never\nthought I'd be able to say I was near\nsub3 Marathon Fitness\n[Music]\nagain you know when\nthe Thursday was supposed to be an easy\n5 1 half miles but at the last minute I\nwas invited to help promote the A6\ntorches Taco run so I went to that event\nwith Drew whitcom and it was a really\ngood turnout a lot of friends were there\nbut the Run was a bit short in terms of\nwhat I needed for the day at about 3\nmiles so I thought about adding a couple\nmiles to fulfill my quota but the\nrunning event is always exhausting so I\nleft good enough alone and then on\nFriday I was supposed to run an easy 6\nbut this would end up being the first\nrunning session that I skipped with this\nRuna training block the night before was\nthe running event after party which is\ntypically a very fun but very long night\nSaturday I was back at home and back at\nit with an 11 Mile easy run and I feel\nlike I still had no voice after being at\nTR all week and I felt like I was on the\nverge of coming down with something but\nat least my legs felt good and I enjoyed\nthe\nrun and then on Sunday to wind up the\nweek I had my long run workout now this\nwas supposed to be a race simulator\nbased on the paces that Runa thinks that\nI can race a half marathon at right now\nand yaso 800s decides Runa thinks that I\nam in 640 per mile half marathon\nshape here we\ngo once\nagain one thing to keep in mind is that\nRuna started over in UK and Europe so I\nthink the training plans are written in\nkilometers and then converted over to\nmiles so a lot of times warm-ups will be\n6 or 1.2 M long or 1 to2 km and today's\nworkout was 3.7 M or 6K at 640 per mile\nand then 3.1 M or 5K at 640 per mile and\nthen there was an easy 2.5 miles or 4K\neach for warmup recovery and cool down\nfor total of about 14 Mi I was expecting\nto struggle and it was certainly hard\nbut I was able to hit the paces for\nthese longer intervals I've been really\nfocusing on keeping my foot on the gas\neven when I start to feel tired or\npanicked and I've been trying to remind\nmyself that I can keep holding on to the\neffort and the pace and just trust that\nI will still have more left in the tank\nto finish out the rest of the rep in a\nway it's been a leap of\nfaith so when I finish this run with the\nwork intervals at faster than G\nand after the successful yaso 800s\nearlier in the week I was starting to\nbelieve that this run app was actually\ngetting me into a level of really good\n[Music]\nFitness better check\n[Music]\nfor better Che the next week was the\nweek of Thanksgiving and because of how\nI rearranged last week I had to do a\nlittle bit of of rearranging for this\nweek also I wanted to do a Turkey Trot\nwith my daughter so that had to factor\ninto the rescheduling as well so Monday\nwhich is normally a session day was just\nan easy 7 miles and I can't show you any\nfootage of my shoes on this day either\nbecause I am we're testing a different\npair of shoes and there's an NDA I don't\nnormally like to running shoes that\naren't at least almost nearly production\nalready I'm only one person on this\nchannel and I can only run so many miles\nin a year so I like to kind of save my\nmiles for shoes that I'm actually going\nto review so I don't know why I agreed\nto do this wear\n[Music]\ntesting Tuesday we were at my in-laws in\nIowa for Thanksgiving and the workout\nwas\nk200 run a kilometer at 610 per mile and\nthen tack on an additional 200 at 530\nper mile so basically it was a 1200 met\nrepeats with a fast and then even faster\nPace in there the rest was just 90\nseconds and then repeat for a total of\neight reps this workout was really tough\nI brought the on cloud broom strike\nlight spray as I enjoy that shoe for\nvery fast work but even those shoes\ncouldn't help me hit these Paces I would\nconsider 610 for mile to be in between\n5K and 10K pace for me right now and\nthen having to speed up after a\nkilometer of that into a 200 M rep at\nessentially mile race space was so hard\nand so just when I thought I was getting\nthe hang of the Runa system it felt like\nthe rug was getting pulled out from\nunder me\n[Music]\nagain now back when I started this runup\nplan it led me select which race I Was\npreparing for it asked me what my level\nof experience was I don't consider\nmyself Elite but it's what I chose based\non Rena's definitions and it asked me\nfor a recent race result I just run\nBerlin Marathon about a month prior it\nasked me how many days per week I like\nto run every day please and it asked me\nwhat my long runs were like right now\nand from there it gave me a 13we\ntraining plan it was 13 weeks until the\nhalf marathon at Houston at the time and\nfrom day one the runup workouts have\nbeen very\ntough even the first day of the plan\nweek one day one was humbling it was a\nlong Tempo with paces that didn't seem\nall that intimidating on paper but I\nfelt like I had to give a race level\nallout effort on that day and I still\ndidn't hit the paces and it didn't get\neasier\n[Music]\n[Music]\nSo eventually at week four Runa did make\nan adjustment I Got a notification in\nthe app and after accepting the request\nfor changes it adjusted all my session\npaces and and once it did that\neverything was suddenly much more\nmanageable so much so that I thought\nthat maybe the app had\novercorrected but that K2 200's workout\ndefinitely put me back in my place this\nrun app was not going to cuddle\n[Music]\nme Wednesday was an easy run in the more\nversion 5 I had been so looking forward\nto running in a big mushy maxion shoe\nafter the K2 200s but the more version 5\ndidn't exactly deliver on what I was\nhoping for now it was exceptionally cold\non that day so I tried to keep that in\nmind as I was collecting my thoughts on\nthis shoe but this run wasn't as recover\nfull as I was hoping it would have\n[Music]\nbeen now Thursday was supposed to be an\ninterval session but it was also\nThanksgiving morning there was a Turkey\nTrot somewhat nearby that my daughter\nwanted to try the event is a very hilly\n2 and 1/2 Mile Loop and my daughter\ndecided she would race the one laap Loop\nwhile I raced the two they gave out\nturkeys as a prize to the winner of each\nage group and based on prior year\nresults it looked like my daughter and I\neach had a very small but nonzero chance\nof winning the tempts were super cold it\nwas the coldest my daughter has ever run\nin and we lined up a little bit off the\nstarting line as there were a lot of\nyoung fast Runners at this event my goal\nwas to make sure that she got out of the\nshoot safely before I took off but after\nabout half a mile I could still hear my\ndaughter Breathing heavily behind me at\nabout 610 pace and this was a bit too\nfast for each of us so I told her to\nslow down right as we took the first\ngiant downhill now I have really no idea\nhow to Pace a 5m race and I especially\ndon't know how to Pace a 5m race with\nthis kind of elevation change in it but\nI just went with the flow and it ended\nup with a 6-minute first mile the Second\nMile was all uphill but at least it was\ngradual and then we hit the really big\nhill it was over a 100 ft of gain in\nabout a third of a mile and I heavily\ndebated power hiking my arms were numb\nFrozen and burning at the same time then\nwe finally hit the crest and roll down\nto the starting line to end lap one and\nfor the second lap I was now able to see\nwho who I was actually racing against\nthere were a couple of guys around me my\nage and mostly children and I took the\nbig downhill a bit easier this time then\non the uphill Second Mile I pushed a bit\nharder than I did the first time and on\nthe last giant uphill I saw a guy about\nmy age and started to track him down I\nmanaged to pass him as we crested the\ntop and yelled at him to come with me to\nthe Finish but he wasn't able to keep up\nand I crossed the line\n[Music]\ninstantly I felt like I had paced myself\nincorrectly because I was tired at the\nFinish but not race tired does that make\nsense and then when I found my daughter\nwe looked up the results she had come in\nthird in her age group and I came in\nsecond there was another guy a guy I\ndidn't see who finished about 30 seconds\nahead of me but even though we didn't\nwin any turkey we had fun some people\neven recognized me at the event which is\nnot something I typically experience\nwhen I go to Iowa but no one asked me if\nI could run fast in my shoes so that was\na\nbummer Friday my father-in-law needed to\nbring his truck into Uncle David who is\na mechanic a couple Towns over it was\nsuper cold so I offered to take the\ntruck in for my father-in-law and I went\nfor a run while I waited for the truck\nto get serviced it was a nice easy run\nbut it was so cold\nI've technically run in colder\nconditions before but I didn't pack\nclothes for this level of cold it was\n16\u00b0 F with a feels likee temp of zero\nthat's about -7\u00b0 C my face\nfroze conditions would not improve much\nfor the following day in fact it was\npretty much the same except now it was\nwindy and also I had to do a workout\ntoday's long run was 7 1/2 M easy and\nthen 7 1/2 M at 720 Pace my face got so\ncold running into the headwind that I\ndecided to break up the easy and start\nthe work portion of the long run early\ninto the headwind for a bit before I\nturned\n[Music]\naround this was one of those runs where\nI worry that my Apple watch is going to\ndie from the cold and it did and I\nwouldn't have a way to call my wife to\ncome pick me up if I needed to help but\nfortunately running a couple miles hard\ninto the headwind warmed me up a little\nand then I was able to turn around and\nwarm up a little bit more the wind\nwasn't biting at my face anymore and I\nwas able to finish the workout again the\npaces didn't seem all that intimidating\non paper but this workout was hard but\nat least today I was able to hit the\npaces the next morning we were back in\nIllinois and and the tempts weren't much\ndifferent I had 12 easy miles to run so\nI headed over to busy Woods each Loop of\nthe park is a bit more than 7 m so I ran\nabout 1 and 1/2\nlaps busy Woods is typically a very\nwindy place even on days when it's not\neven windy but luckily today this was\none of those rare days when the winds\nweren't all that bad\n[Music]\nso that brings us up to date on the last\nsix weeks with the Runa app I really\ndidn't think that this training plan\nwould be so difficult I don't know why\nbut I just thought that it would be\neasier yet despite all the challenges\nthat this training plan has thrown my\nway I've been able to so far stay\nhealthy and I feel like I'm getting\nreally fit hit the Subscribe button so\nyou can get updates for the next\ninstallment of this series at after week\neight where I'm going to talk about\nstrength training Mobility work and\ndload weeks and if you want to try\nrunner for yourself you can use the code\nkofuzi in the app I don't get paid any\nextra if you do or don't but it's there\nif you want it\n[Music]",

  "text": "if there is a preseason in the running\nshoe world it's the running event it's a\nrunning brand convention that showcases\nwhat's coming up in the next year and\neveryone looks like they've got a shot\nat winning it's also a pretty great time\nto catch up with some friends and\ncolleagues so let's hop on a plane and\nhead to Austin this is a runner's\nweekend at the running event 2024\n[Music]\nyo what's going on just made it to the\nAirbnb in Austin this is the same place\nthat I stayed last year a kafui run Club\nmember owns this Airbnb so I love to be\nable to throw some business her and her\nfamily's way it's going to be a busy\nwork week so even though it's been a\nreally long travel day and I'm exhausted\nI just want to go get some dinner but\nfirst we got to go meet up with Tommy\nand Caitlyn who is the head organizer of\nthis entire running event\n[Music]\nshow Tommy was staying at the main TR\nHotel the Hilton and I didn't film any\nof the two main meetings we had one was\nwith the TR organizers as Tommy and I\nwere going to be doing a social media\ntakeover of the TR IG account the next\nday and then Tommy and I met separately\nbecause we were doing a seminar on\nsocial media for running stores also the\nfollowing day afterwards Tommy and I got\ntacos at the hotel restaurant a\nproductive efficient and quiet way to\nstart TR\n[Music]\n2024 good morning it's a little bit\nbefore 6:00 a.m. here is in Austin on a\nTuesday my watch tells me I got 4 hours\nof sleep last night although it feels\nlike I got a lot less a lot of tossing\nand turning last night bed was perfectly\nfine I just think I had a little bit too\nmuch coffee too late in the day\nyesterday and I just couldn't fall\nasleep got another busy day today first\nthing I got to do is I'm going to try to\nget in a little bit of extra mileage in\nbefore I meet Tommy for a run\n[Music]\nit was definitely a bit discouraging\nwhen I woke up and it was so dark to get\ngoing for this run but now that I'm on\nladyb bird there are so many other\nRunners out here it's really quite nice\nto see\n[Music]\nall right got in a little bit more than\n5 miles let's go find\nTommy on the run this is Tommy's first\nrun since finishing six marathons in one\nyear\n[Music]\nthat is the trail cleanup that I really\nwanted to do today because last year\nthey had an option for you could pick up\ntrash while you're\njogging but there was also a kaying\noption and I was too afraid I'd fall in\nthe water last year to do it this year I\nbrought special clothes to do it so I\nwas going to get him the kayak but I\nforgot that we had to film all this\nstuff now so I'm going to have to skip\nout on this year maybe another time\n[Music]\nTommy runs Tommy kzi say your own name\nfirst hold on I want to get this\nactually\ny ready hold\non oh God that's all in the\nmic I'm going to need a new microphone\nnow I didn't realize it was going to be\nthat aggressive all right ready I think\nI don't have Burgers I got Burgers\nyou're dad you're\ngood yo what's going on it is a kofuzi\nTommy runs takeover of the TR social\nmedia account yep\nyep yo what's going on it is a kofuzi\nTommy runs take over the TR social today\nis the first so it took us a few takes\nbut Tommy and I got what we needed on\nthe bridge and then we ran back to our\nhotels to get ready for our our next\nthing that we had to do for the ti\nsocial takeover but nothing is\nstraightforward at TI everywhere you go\nyou'll run into some friends morning how\nare you hi good morning\nYouTube how are you you doing great

soon\n[Music]\nquiet a quick shower and a quick bite to\neat later I was back with Tommy at the\nconvention hall our mission was to find\npeople to interview about why they were\nexcited to be at TR all right we're here\nat TR what is your name my name is\nAmanda and who are you with Melora and\nwhat is your most what are you looking\nforward to the most here I'm looking\nyeah I'm looking forward to having\ngenuine real authentic conversations\nwith uh like-minded people but really\nfocusing on having authentic\nconversations surrounding like diversity\nsustainability amplifying marginalized\nvoices and giving them the platform that\nthey deserve to have year round I'm\nexcited about all those things I love\nthat let's go let's do it what's up guys\num first off let me know what who what\nyour names are who you're here with and\nwhat you're excited about here at TR\nsweet uh I'm Joe H I'm Kevin ginan we're\nhere we have an agency called footstep\ncreative and we're just here we've been\nbuilding in kind of stealth mode the\nlast like two years so we're just trying\nto get in front of brands people in the\nindustry and yeah what's your name\nCarlos who are you with we are media\nfrom Spain we're Road running review all\nright and what are you excited about for\nTR this week we're waiting for a lot of\nshoes lot good stuff new carbon plates\nnew people of Pham so\n[Music]\nexcited we had some time before our\nseminar so Tommy and I got some coffee\nthen we went to the keynote session\nwhich featured lunch and then it was\ntime for us to give our talk on social\nmedia for running retail now even though\nTommy and I did this talk last year I\nwas still pretty nervous the session was\nwas really well attended the last time\nand we had a lot of return attendees as\nwell as a number of media colleagues and\nfriends so I felt like expectations were\nhigh but overall I think it went well\nTommy did great we had a lot of good\nquestions from the audience and I got a\nchance to really emphasize one of my\ncore philosophies of the past couple\nyears which is that running Brands\nrunning retail and running media can\nwork together in alignment in win winwin\nscenarios and in the past those groups\nweren't always exactly on the same team\nI just don't think it has to be that way\nand I'm trying to change\n[Music]\nthat all right just finished the session\nI think it went well I feel like I\ntalked too much but uh we had some good\nquestions at the end so that was good uh\nnow I'm going to meet up with running\nWarehouse we're going to film something\nfun for YouTube I was going to walk over\nthere by myself but the guys are all\nhere checking in so I'm just going to\nhop in an Uber with them and we'll head\nover do something\nfun earlier in the year in Boston Connor\nfrom running Warehouse took the believe\nin the Run crew up to the Charles to\ncheck out what real Runners were\nactually wearing for their daily runs\nand now it was my turn to do some shoe\nspotting along ladyb bird Lake in Austin\nthe whole thing was a bit overproduced\nwith three cameramen and four cameras\nbut it was a nice way to actually spend\nsome time chatting about shoes with a\nfriend and I think the video we made is\ngoing to be pretty good head on over to\nthe running Warehouse YouTube channel\nAnd subscribe to see when that video\ndrops finished shooting sneaker spotting\nwith running Warehouse that was a lot of\nfun we saw a lot of shoes a really wide\nvariety and ran into a bunch of friends\nso a really fun time to G out over shoes\nand reconnect with some\npeople now I'm going to head back over\nto the convention center the hotel\nacross the street is where the Hoka\nreception is so let's go check that\n[Music]\nout this was a lively and Loud affair\nwith drinks food and a lot of people we\ngot to see some displays of some\nupcoming shoes I caught up with some\nfriends and then it was time for me to\nhead to my next spot for the evening TR\nis a lot like graduation weekend\neveryone has a lunch in or a gathering\nthat you're invited to so you got to\nkeep moving in order to see everybody\nand my next stop was the as6 event I had\na workout scheduled for the next morning\nso it was a bunch of hinin 0.0 for me\nbut it was nevertheless really good to\nconnect with everyone\n[Music]\ngood morning it is a little bit before\n7:00 a.m. on a Wednesday here in Austin\ndidn't have too late a night last night\nI got home uh about 9:30 and then I was\nasleep by about 11: I think so I'm\nfeeling pretty good about that had a\nmuch better night's sleep and that's a\ngood thing cuz today I've got a big\nsession on Deck but I have a little bit\nof surprise help for this workout one of\nthe things that can kind of happen at\nthe running event is you might have a\nchance encounter get a chance to run in\nan upcoming development or secret shoe\nso I ran into someone last night and\nthat person asked if I was going to go\nfor a run today I said I have some\nintervals on deck and they said that\nwould be perfect for a upcoming\nprototype shoe that they'd love to get\nsome early non-elite Runner feedback on\nthey have some pros who have run in it\nand they want to know what non- Elites\nmight think about it so I said I have\nsome 800 m on deck and they gave me a\npair of shoes to run in now I can't show\nyou the shoes I can't photograph the\nshoes can't really tell you much about\nthe shoes either but I'm really looking\nforward to it it should be fun so\napologize that uh I can't show them to\nyou but uh I'm pretty excited about it\n[Music]\nfinished the\nworkout that was hard but this shoe is\namazing I still do have a lot of notes\ncan't wait to tell you about it don't\nknow when that would be for now I'm\ngoing to finish this cool down and then\nget ready to head with the exhibit hall\n[Music]\nFlor all showered up let's get ready to\nhead over to the running event I got a\nday jam-packed full of appointments with\nall of the running shoe brands my plan\nof attack for today is to do all the\nshoe brands on Wednesday and then the\napparel and Nutri brands on Thursday\nfirst thing before I do any of that\nthough is I got to get some coffee and\nsome\n[Music]\nsnacks yo if you could bring back one\nshoe what would it be oh I'm so excited\nabout the new stuff and need something\nold give me something old uh I'm going\nto go with the original Nike epic react\nuh or no the lunar lunar the lunar epic\nis my favorite the high top with the\nstretchy knit upper and then uh I would\ngo for a run with\nkzi energy levels are already high\neveryone's here everyone's excited\nthings are shiny and new can't wait\nfirst appointment is with\ndiodora diodora is an Italian running\nshoe brand that has recently rededicated\nitself to Performance running and\nthey've only recently started reaching\nout to me to review their shoes so for\nour meeting I was happy to be able to\nspeak with the product people to get an\nintroduction to the entire lineup\ndiodora also has a 100 steps philosophy\nto their shoe design their design\nprototyping and run testing departments\nall sit within 100 steps from each other\nin their headquarters in Northern Italy\nallowing for quick feedback with little\nLost in\n[Music]\nTranslation that's going to be it from\ndeodora it's good to get a complete\nrundown of the lineup from them well not\na complete but uh everything except the\nstability shoes and now let's go see k\nrun I've never talked to them before so\nthat should be interesting let's see\nwhat they\ngot kiun is a te cathlon brand and if\nyou don't know what T cathlon is it's\nkind of like a Trader Joe's but for\nsports equipment they sell a bit of\neverything but all the brands are\ninhouse and they're pretty good but\nvalue oriented so Ki and trying to stand\nout sep separately as a performance\nrunning brand it's kind of like if that\nTrader Joe's frozen pizza you like we're\ntrying to compete in an actual pizza\nmaking competition but also in a lot of\nways Ki Run's challenges are kind of the\nsame as the challenges that Sketcher\nperformance faces in relations to its\nparent Sketchers we spent some time\ntalking about the shoes at kiun and\nabout how they could try and make their\ndebut into the US market given the\nchallenges that they might be facing and\nit'll be interesting to see what they\nget up to in the next few\nyears 11:00 I'm supposed to be somewhere\nI don't know\nwhere okay so my next appointment was at\nBrooks and they always show up big for\nTR for 2025 they're tweaking their Foams\nagain DNA tune is going to be an update\nto their super critical Foams where\nthey're using dual density Source\ncompounds that when placed under\npressure and heat and then injected with\nnitrogen gas in other words super\ncritical IED it results in Foams that\nhave firm sidewalls and squish G centers\nit's a format that we've seen Puma use\nto great success with their forever run\nand I look forward to seeing it in the\nglycerin I'm also really excited for DNA\ngold which is Brooks's long awaited\nentry into the Pea midsole Market the\nHyperion Max will hopefully be getting\nthe true max treatment with the use of\npartial DNA gold next year and we will\nalso see an all DNA gold shoe from\nBrooks later in\n2025 and finally I'm particularly\nintrigued by this update to the the\nghost Max it looks like it's getting\ntreatment similar to what we've seen in\nthe glycerin Max and I hope this shoe is\nas fun to run in as it looks that's it\nfrom the Brooks Booth a lot of exciting\nchanges coming very happy with what I'm\nseeing there all the things that I\nwanted to happen to Two Shoes\nspecifically Hyperion Max and Hyperion\nElite 5 are happening I don't think I\ncould tell you very much more about\nhyper5 but we did hear a lot about it\nand it's you're going to be surprised\ngoing be surprised uh now I have a\nlittle bit of time before our next\nappointment so let's get something to\neat my plan originally was to try and\navoid eating food at Teri because the\nconcessions are always pretty\ndisappointing for vegetarians I did have\nan empanada and a bean taco in my bag\nthat I had picked up in the morning from\nthe convenience store but since I did\nhave some bonus time in my schedule I\nthought I'd give concessions another try\nI got some kind of chicken noodle dish\nminus chicken and while I appreciate\neveryone who worked very hard to make\nthis dish tasty I did not enjoy it\nfinished with lunch actually had to eat\nlunch today that was nice now let's\ncheck out what these guys are\nto for those who can't make it in person\nto tr there is a live stream of the show\nhosted by my friends at PR project this\nis the second year that Aaron Tommy and\nGary were hosts for this two-day live\nshow and this year this set was a much\nmore chill living room Vibe with video\nproduction and streaming hosted by flow\ntrack\nTommy hello how's it how's PR project\ngoing PR project is going really well TR\nlive is is uh is is popping we had a lot\nof great guests and we covered some\nreally cool things and talked about a\nlot of the Innovation that's happening\nin the industry as a whole uh Gary\ncrushed it Aaron crushed it and and big\nshout out to the guests all right two\nquestions two what are those these are\nthe on cloud monster I mean Cloud Surfer\n2 nice I like the color blocking on that\nyeah all right second question yeah if\nyou could bring back any one running\nshoe what would it be oh man oh oh oh\num that's a really good question oh I I\nbring back the first uh Nike Infinity\nall right react I like that a lot I like\nthat a lot\nthanks my next appointment was with\nAdidas now a few years ago there was an\nissue with me filming some shoes that\nthey had put on display in their booth\nand on their mannequins and since then\nAdidas has switched up how they present\nat TR now they have a facade to their\nBooth but all discussions happened\nbehind closed doors and to make my life\neasier I pretty much consider everything\nwe talked about back there to be under\nembargo and besides anything that is\nreally interesting will end up on my\ndesk later when the time comes and I can\nactually run in it so I'm not in a hurry\nto post about stuff that's coming later\nalthough because I am a reference size I\ndid get to try on a lot of stuff and I\nwill say that 2025 is going to be a good\nyear for\nAdidas just got done with a lengthy\nmeeting with Adidas it was really good\nvery excited for what's to come can't\ntell you about any of that quite yet\nnext let's go visit some friends at Muno\nI think they've been up to some stuff\n[Music]\nmauno is a Japanese brand that has been\nstruggling with how to modernize without\nalienating their legacy fan base there\nis a very clear road map on exactly how\nto do this laid out by some of their\ncompatriot competition and this year\nmauno seems to finally be taking that to\nheart with their mystery shoe lineup for\nTR mauno unveiled a series of four\nmystery shoes that are intended to both\nmove the company forward while also\nre-energizing the base mystery shoe 01\nhowever pequs my interest the most as it\ndoesn't have a wave plate plus it's got\na knitted upper and a super squishy foam\nit's all the things I like so I'm really\nlooking forward to testing this\n[Music]\none just finished at\nluno I like it when Brands modernize and\nI feel like that's what's happening with\nthe zuno very interested to see what's\ngoing on with the secret shoe 0102 03\nand 04\ngetting very\ntired but still have to continue to more\nappointments next let's go to under\narour I don't recall if under arour has\nbeen to tr before but it's the first\ntime that I can remember visiting them\nI've reviewed a couple of their shoes\nrecently but it was good to get a walk\nthrough on the rest of their running\nshoe lineup\nthey also showed me this double boa\nspeed Len collab the velocity Elite 3\nProto that Sharon ly wore in New York\nand I got to meet Sharon L and wey kotti\nI had seen Sharon speak at an Under\nArmour event in New York earlier in the\nmonth but it was good to actually get a\nchance to introduce myself and I've also\nseen Wy win the usatf 5K championships a\ncouple of times in New York so it was\ngreat to finally meet her too so I\nintroduce myself as a Mike and then as\nI'm leaving Sharon goes to way and goes\nthis is kofuzi he has a really good\nmakes really good running content and\nthen waynie was like oh I've seen that\nbefore so that was really flattering and\nmaybe she has maybe she hasn't but I'm\ngoing to take it as a win and look at\nthis guy good to see you man how are you\nup I'm doing great Hoka had a lot to\ndiscuss at TR the Clifton and the Bondi\nwill be getting updates this year and\nthe impression that I got is that these\nmodels will more Target the RunWalk\nconsumer and this seems to be an\nindustry wide Trend where the Legacy\nfranchises are designed to be intra\npoints for those who are curious about\nthe brand or for those Runners who don't\nlike their running shoes changing all\nthat much these core franchise models\nwill become Dependable year-over-year\nexperiences for the shoe NS who want\nsomething a bit more modern Hoka has\nupdates for you too the clo X1 2.0 not\nthe clo X2 but the clo X1 2.0 gets a\nmajor redesign the cutout will flip from\nthe lateral to the medial side for\nsmoother superation I'm told the shoe\nwill lighten up quite a bit and Hoka was\nalso proud to announce that the laces\nwill be changing on this shoe which I've\ngone on record multiple times saying\nthat the laces on the original C X1 were\njust fine the Mach X will also get an\nupdate but it's just an upper update\nthis year with an aes's flare which\nmakes it less distinguished visually\nfrom the regular Mack but it should\nresolve the issue that many of you had\nwhere the back of the shoe bit into your\nAchilles hey it's m what's up everyone\nif you could bring back one shoe from\nhistory what would it be that's a great\nquestion okay if I could bring back one\nshoe from history I think it's going to\nbe the Reebok float ride energy 3 it's\nonly a couple years old but I I really\nthought that was a solid daily trainer\nit was Priced Right and it was just a it\nwas a good shoe a few years ago Sketcher\nperformance kicked me out of their booth\nat TR and I haven't been back since but\nthis year they actually requested a\nmeeting now they didn't want me filming\nanything unless they could approve it\nprior to publication so I ended up just\nnot filming anything but they did let me\ntry on a shoe and run on it in a\ntreadmill and it was pretty\nfun on was very selective in what they\nshowed me which I appreciated I prefer\nthe new cloudtech phase shoes and that's\npretty much all they showed me for next\nyear there will be three major updates\nthe cloud Surfer will get a bit less\nmushy in the midsole but a bit more\npuffy in the upper the cloud Surfer next\nwill be a speedier cloud Surfer\nexperience and the cloud Eclipse will\ncease to exist and will instead become\nthe cloud Surfer Max it will lose a\ntorsion plate that I thought was pretty\nuseless anyway the arrangement of the\ncloudtech phase changes significantly\nand I think most importantly for many of\nyou they are putting tiny little ridges\nin the clouds so that it shouldn't\nsqueak they also showed me the cloud\nboom Max which is another one of those\nattempts at a carbon plated shoe for the\nmasses a race day shoe for middle and\nback of the pack personally I think\nevery other Brand's attempt at this kind\nof shoe has been either patronizing and\noverpriced or underwhelming and dull and\nwhile this one is going to be expensive\nalthough not that expensive for an on\nshoe the way that they explained the\ndesign and construction of the shoe\ndidn't feel like it was gatekeeping to\nme so I'm not mad at this one at least\nnot for now\nStephen you know what question I'm going\nto ask I do if you're going to bring\nback one shoe from any time in history\nwhat would it be oh anytime in history\noh does have to be like the last year\nlike do you have a favorite old shoe oh\nyeah from any time that you can think of\nand you wish you could bring it back\nshoe that instantly popped into my mind\nwas the Hoka Nepali okay I loved the\nNepali so lightweight it was like a\ncheap shoe I could throw on my feet and\ngo run tons of miles in I Lov that ship\n[Music]\nfor the past couple of years A6 has\nfocused on one main shoe only at TR and\nthis year it was the Nimbus 27 it gets a\npretty mild update and will remain a\npretty comfy shoe I did get a chance to\nrun in the shoe the following morning\nand I can say that it feels a bit\nsmoother than the Nimbus 26 which felt a\nbit clunky to me so I appreciate the\nsmall\n[Music]\nchange next up is my faite Underdog\ntoppo I reviewed the Cyclone 2 a while\nback so I'm excited to try the upper\nupdate for the Cyclone 3 and I'm also\nexcited to delve further into the Topo\nlineup with a shoe I haven't tried\nbefore the Phantom 4 and it's updated\nzip\n[Music]\nfoam okay that is the last meeting I\nhave for today now it's happy hour time\npretty much like every other booth has a\nlittle bit of a spread and a little bit\nof like viations to celebrate the end of\nday\none I am going to try and find the TAA\nhappy hour cuz I told them I'll stop\nup back in college I used to live in the\ntea mush flipflops I bought pair after\npair after pair and after college it\nalways felt like a real Miss to me that\ntea didn't quite catch the recovery\nslide wave so this year I accepted the\nrequest to stop by forh hour with the\nhopes that I would find a way to fall in\nlove with tea again and while the hiking\nwater sports and running sandals don't\nreally resonate with me I am quite\nliking some of the winter and casual\nwear boots that tea is\n[Music]\nmaking Megan if you could bring back one\nshoe from history what would it be oh\nman I loved the Hoka elvon it was the\nbest shoe sort of responsive little bit\nclunky sometimes but it was just a\nconsistent good shoe and then it just\ndisappeared if you could bring back one\nshoe which would it be okay I'm going to\ngo to the 808s 1981 air Mariah my\nMarathon PR shoe if you could bring back\none shoe what would it be the mauno\nElixir I think I know what the answer is\nbut if you could bring back one shoe\ninto production what would it be it\nwould be the Nike alphafly one mow here\nif you could bring back one shoe what\nwould it be tart Edge as T Edge Hoka\nplease if there are any size 10 and a\nhalf samples still in the back room I\nwill pay for them Evo Speedo it is in my\nopinion not just the greatest Trail shoe\nof all time but I'll run on the road or\nthe treadmill whatever in that shoe so\nsend it my way the Nike Lunar Glide I\nwore that thing all the time every\nsingle day I don't know if it's the best\nrunning shoe but it just meant so much\nto me in like high school or middle\nschore or whatever it was please bring\nit back Sketchers Go Run speed Trail\nhyper sorry you brought back a Sketchers\nyeah I know I love the throwback waffle\nRacers the ogs I think there's something\nabout that is just like very pure\nhonest and um just kind of like very\nmuch of the time so I would bring those\nback\n[Music]\nthe next morning started early at 7:00\na.m. for a group run at torches tacos\nthe local as6 Tech rep Chris Anton who\nput together the group run I did in\nAustin over the summer was The\nMastermind behind this Noel blast\ntorches collab we took a huge group\nphoto and then we were off and\n[Music]\nrunning hey coming out good to see you\nnice and early we're just hicking over\nthe street here look at this\n[Music]\na lot of people were demoing the Nova\nblast 5 but I was in the new Nimbus 27\nDrew was there as was Taylor Thomas\nJarrett and Robbie the air was a bit\nchilly but it was a refreshing way to\nwake up after a long day and a long\n[Music]\nnight\nJ cameras around we got to run\ncome on it let's go let's go let's go\nlet's go back at torches there was a\nfree t-shirt free tacos and some\ngiveaways and little would I know that\nthis would be the only real meal I would\neat for the next 12 or so\n[Music]\nhours all\nright getting a start on day two\nI guess we already started the day with\nthe run but the start of the day for me\nat the running event first meeting is\nwith\nrabbit day one of TR was all about shoes\nday two was all about apparel and\nnutrition in the main thing I talked\nabout with rabbit was plans for more\ncollab merch for the kafui Run club we\nalso talked about some updates coming to\nthe Dreamchaser shoe my friend Greg iara\nwas also at the rabbit booth and he was\ndesigning a skateboard to be raffled on\noff at the end of TI in addition to\npromoting his itahar designs rabbit\n[Music]\nkit so the last two meetings that I had\nI went to the booths usually what I do\nis I have a meeting that I get set up\nwith somebody and then I go to the booth\nat the time I'm supposed to be there and\nI kind of just wait if I don't know who\nthat person is\nalready usually that person spots me and\nwe have the\nmeeting what happens frequently with the\napparel\nBrands is that someone like usually a PR\nCompany gets hired to help the brands\nfill their calendars um during these two\ndays and a lot of times the apparel\nBrands I don't know if the pr person\ndoesn't come on site or what but the\nlast two meetings that I had I went\nthere stood in the\nbooth\nwaited and then just left cuz no one was\nlike talking to me so that's okay I\ndon't hold it against anyone but I don't\nmind missing or not having meetings\ngetting things cleared off my calendar\nthat's also not nice but\nit's weird when it happens twice in a\nrow my next stop was at tracksmith they\nbrought their coffee truck to TI and\ntheir new racing shoe it uses a similar\nconcept as the Elliot Runner with a\nthick peba midsole insert but it's tuned\nfor racing and has an upper to\nmatch after track smid I stopped by the\nscratch Booth they're coming out with a\nbunch of new flavors for chews bars and\ndrinks they sent me home with a bunch of\nsamples that I've already had a chance\nto try on the live stream there's some\nflavors that I don't exactly love but\nthe flavors I do like I really\n[Music]\ndo CLA is a French Canadian brand that\nmost people know for their hats but I\nbeen loving their apparel for years now\nthey haven't been to TI in a while and\nit was good to see them here again their\napparel always has clean lines it's\nwellmade and as you'd expect from French\nCanadians they're excellent with cool\nand cold weather performance\n[Music]\napparel my last schedule meeting was\nwith goo they've recently become a\nmember of 1% for the planet which is a\ngroup of companies that pledges to\ndonate 1% % of revenues to charitable\ncauses they sent me home with a bunch of\nflavors of their liquid energy and Fruit\nChews and I'll say that their chews\ntaste the most like just regular gummies\nthan any other brand very\n[Music]\ntasty at this point I was done with\nmeetings but had a bit of time left to\nwander the hall this was Bandit's first\nyear at Terry so I stopped by to say hi\nI also stopped by the Wahoo Booth to\ncheck out their new treadmill that I am\nabsolutely obsessed with and then I was\njust Milling around the Puma Booth when\nof my friends Drew Ashley and Amanda\nBrooks came by for an appointment and so\nI joined in one of my recent favorite\nPuma surprises has been the forever run\nwhich happens to also be a favorite\namongst Puma's pro athletes but because\nthis will be getting a significant\nupdate in the more stability direction\nit'll be interesting to see how it's\nreceived\nthe other shoe that we talked about was\nthe deviate Elite Trail the Nitro Elite\nfoam firms up just a bit and the carbon\nplate softens a bit to better suit it\nfor running through the\n[Music]\nwoods all right guys I am\nout of\nenergy I got no steam left I'm going to\nhead back over to diodora see if I can\nget a\ncoffee ah I should probably just go but\nI'm too tired to even\nleave you\n[Music]\nlike hi I'm here today with Mike Co AKA\nkafui and we're a little low energy\nwe've been spending a lot of time on the\nfloor at the running event that's right\nso this is going to be kind of more of a\nmellow conversation Mike and I were\nsitting here and we were discussing how\nwe felt about the majors adding Sydney\nand how they reward you for running the\nevent and just kind of thought maybe we\nshould um bring this to you in a short\nform very low energy conversation yeah\nyeah low energy podcast I feel like\nthat's what it's going to be called\nyes the the co with the low Co with the\nlow Co with the low yeah I mean I think\nthat I think it's great that there's a\nseventh I think it's great it's on the\nother side of the world so people over\nthere W have to keep coming to the\nUnited States I think it's weird that\nit's like it's a major but it's not\nthey'll still have to come to the United\nStates if they want do six but I'm like\nif we like say like yeah if you wanted\nto do all seven but\nlike before it was like if you lived in\nsay Japan or Asia you had to come to the\nUS three times for Majors you know cuz\nit would been hard to get to Tokyo\nalready you know and so now there's just\nmore opportunties to have this caliber\nof race on that side of the world so\nthat's good so we've been really\nfortunate we've gotten a lot of\nopportunities to run these\nmarathons but you can't help but think\nall right if you have a\nsix-star and you're paying your way to\ngo to all of\nthem it's quite expensive it's very\nexpensive yeah so there is kind of an\nentry to barrier you got to have the\nmoney for travel MH and that includes\nhotels flights food when you're there\ntime off to time off exactly so adding a\nseven do you think that's a good idea or\ndo you think it would be kind of cool to\nhave like two sides of the world have\nlike they could have their six we could\nhave our six and then if you wanted to\nget all 12 you could\ntravel that's interesting cuz then would\nyou take Tokyo out of our six and add\nanother six another one for us I think\nyou would I think that you would go\nahead and kind of do Western Hemisphere\nEastern Hemisphere and then if you want\nto get cuz it's going to they're going\nto bump it up to nine uhhuh so we're\nalmost at 12 anyway okay I mean they'll\ndo three more you know it's going to\nkeep going now you might as well be 12\nright but do like cuz then you could you\ncould get six stars on the Western\nHemisphere you can get six stars on the\nEastern Hemisphere and then if you want\nto be a megalomaniac you could do 12\nStars\nyeah yeah that's an interesting idea I\nlike that because it it makes it so the\ntravel is not so honorous so that's\ninteresting but I also feel like my\nfavorite one was Tokyo mine too and if\nthere were like a western hemisphere six\nI definitely would never have gone to\nTokyo I also think that that was your\nbest kit for any major you looked sharp\nin that one I like the light green like\nyou look strong you ran that one pretty\nwell too that was a strong marath R wow\nokay that's also maybe why it was your\nfavorite I liked it do it because there\nwas out and backs and so running a\nslower Pace than someone like you uhhuh\nI got to see you several times going\nback and forth so I really enjoyed that\npart of it but we were talking about you\nhave a six-star medal and everybody's\nfamiliar that's almost iconic at this\npoint yeah Sydney comes along you're\nthinking oh they're going to make a\nsevenstar medal they're not I know yeah\nhow do you feel about that I feel like\nit's I get the reasoning if they're\ngoing to add two more in relatively\nquick\nsuccession\num but I also feel like if you don't get\na new medal when you complete all seven\nis it are they all really Majors not all\nmajors are created equal it feels like\nyou know and so that's where I feel like\nthey should have make a sevenstar medal\nthey should make an eight star medal and\nthey should make a Nine Star medal or\nwait till all three races are ready at\nthe same time and make a nine I agree\nwith that like like it's almost like if\nyou're going to you know you they're\ntalking about adding Shanghai and what\nwas Cape Town so Shanghai Cape Town and\nSydney why not just add the three and\njust be like let's do it Nine Star metal\nyeah I mean I think the hard thing is\nthey have to help all those cities ramp\nup right they have to make sure that\nthey can handle twice as many more like\nRunners as they currently handle um and\nthat's not something you can just ly\ndoing one year and that's why there's a\nprocess right but I feel like run all of\nthem through the process at the same\ntime you know like instead of doing one\ncity at a time like I'm going to say\nsomething\ncontroversial it just seems like a lot\nif you've got to do nine now like that's\na lot of money like it's already really\nexpensive to do the six-star mhm now you\ndon't have to do all the majors in the\nworld but you know people are going to\nwant to it's kind of like a Pokemon\nthing collect them all collect them all\nand how are you going to sit there and\njust go ahead and add three more\nmarathons and let's just talk Financial\nif you just say Okay each Marathon entry\nfee around $200 right so that's the\nleast expensive thing yeah travel you're\nprobably talking to get to each one now\nat least 5 grand mhm right wouldn't you\nsay cuz it's you're going to be paying\n$500 a night for your hotel right and\nairfare and all that stuff meals all\nthat so if you add three let's just\nlet's be conservative and say it's 5,000\nper per Marathon per person you may have\nto bring a family member so you don't\nyou know get into trouble you're talking\nright there\n$15,000 to collect three more marathons\ny it's expensive for sure it's not a\ncheap sport when you're doing\nmarathoning like this isn't it funny\nwhen you get started you're like ah it's\na chose need a pair of anymore not\nanymore but I think that the reason why\nI'm not like necessarily offended by the\nnine uh or even 12 if we got to 12 is\nthe idea that like\nyou know there's friends of ours who did\nall six in one\nyear I feel like when you make it N9 or\nyou make it 12 then you're really\ntalking about something that is a real\nlifelong Pursuit and so the\nthe the metal at the end becomes more\nthan just like yeah I went and did these\nsix races it's like no I've dedicated\nmyself to a lifetime of running and this\nis the kind of crowning achievement\noverall so what year did you do your\nfirst major cuz you probably didn't\nstart at the level you are now right\nwhat year was your first major 2017 and\nwhat was it Chicago Hometown uhhuh was\nit easier to get was that part of the\nreason you did it was it was a HomeTown\nMarathon yeah yeah did you have any like\naspirations to run all sixs at that time\nno no I just wanted to run Chicago a\nbunch of times that's you know it is fun\nin your home City to watch like kind of\nlike the explosion that like Chicago's\nthe first one I did and to see an entire\ncity transformed into running I thought\nall the marathons from then on out were\ngoing to be kind of like that and\nthere's plenty of marathons where you go\nand the city doesn't even know what\nmarathon's going on exactly like you're\nhaving dinner and they're like oh what\nare you here for yeah the what oh\nthere's a race tomorrow oh okay man\ntraffic going to be bad you know all\nright well Mike they're closing up the\nuh running event we've pretty much\nclosed it out I'm sure you've been busy\nyou're going to have tons of content to\nshare with your fans uh was there\nanything that you thought you was like\nthe most exciting thing here I get that\nquestion a lot for everyone the answer\nI've been giving them is the answer I\nusually give every year I'm really\nexcited about Brooks this year oh really\nmhm I have to say the addition of\npeba we to talk about that that we talk\nabout that right yeah oh wait cuz I\nalready published a video on it the four\nPB yeah okay and the PB gold the DNA\ngold yeah DNA gold okay yeah so they're\ncoming out with the racer this spring\nthat's going to have it's the same as\nthe four but it's going to have packs in\nit Y which you may or may not if you\nhaven't watched believe in the Run know\nthat it was a little thorn in my side\nand it took took to this point to get it\nnot he was disappointed\nyeah and you may have been grounded but\nthat's coming out and then a entirely\nnew racer is coming out in the fall um\nyou can check it out\nuh I'm sure Mike you'll have videos on\nit uh I thought that was in embargo for\na little while I didn't film it oh they\nlet us they let us do it so if you don't\nwant to watch it on my channel go over\nto believe in the run and see it over\nthere see it yeah um but yeah their\nproduct is\ngetting I'd say they they kind of got\ninto a boring rut and we're starting to\nsee some excitement come out of there\nwhich is to me important for their brand\nand they're doing it in a way that still\nis true to their existing customer but\nthey're bringing in new people which I\nthink is a great thing to do yeah I have\nto say you didn't ask but I have to say\nI was really impressed with the way that\nsatisfy is growing the brand and how\nthey're kind of creating\nthis dress to run brand and it it's has\nperformance it works it works on the\ntrails not just fashion but it certainly\nis it's like a style or a vibe that is\njust kind of\nelevating the entire sport I think\nyou're going to see some of the things\nare doing trickle into Brands because\nthey're going to have to provide that\nlevel of of beautiful product into their\nline I I mean I didn't get the chance to\ngo to the satisfy Booth but I appreciate\nwhat they're doing in terms of like\nrunning clothes can be very functional\nbut they can also be a really great way\nif you want to express yourself with\nwhat you're wearing when you run there's\nan option for you and again I think\nthat's important and we can't really\ntalk about\nspecifics but they've done a lot of shoe\ncollabs with Poca and norta and some\nother shoe brands they're finally coming\nout with their own shoe okay and it's\nit's beautiful um very thoughtful um I\nthink you're going to dig it all right\ncool I can't wait all right that's it\nfrom the running event with the slow Co\nlow energy show oh man thanks everybody\nI like that slow Co energy show or low\nenergy show yeah there we go thanks\nhouse\nall right guys I think that's going to\nbe it from TR I've seen all the brands\nwent to all the meetings sampled all the\nsamples now I'm going to head out by the\nway for me if I could bring back one\nshoe it would be the gakuo turbo that\nthing was\n[Music]\ngorgeous now of course TR doesn't and\njust because the showroom floor is\nclosed there was a happy hour at flow\ntracks headquarters just down the street\nand then there was the Brooks Afterparty\nwith y'all Out Boy I don't have a ton of\nfootage from either of these events for\na few reasons first I don't love filming\npeople when it's socializing time and\nwe're off the clock second I was\nexhausted and didn't feel like filming\nand third I just wanted to enjoy time\nwith my friends for what might be the\nlast time in a long time this trip was\nmy last trip of an incredibly busy\ntravel year and going forward I'll be\nrethinking where I spend my time in the\nRunning World I've had so many great\nmemories but if I want to make room for\nnew experiences I know it means I will\nhave to let go of some old ones in this\nentire TR I've been quietly and\nsometimes not so quietly letting people\nknow that I might not be back again next\nyear and while that might be very\ndifficult ult and counterintuitive for\nsomeone who reviews shoes for a living\ntoo I at least know that this conference\nthat I have enjoyed so thoroughly the\npast several years is in good hands\n[Music]\nw\n[Music]",

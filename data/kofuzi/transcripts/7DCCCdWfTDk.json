  "text": "this is the cloud boom strike LS the\nupper is made by a machine that sprays\non the upper cures it with UV light and\nthen inkjet prints on the color the\nentire process takes only 3 minutes and\nto see it in person is\nremarkable but is this a shoe you can\nactually run in it's time to pull on the\ncloud boom strike LS and take it for a\nrun\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nyo what's going on my name is kzi and\nI'm an non Elite Runner reviews running\nshoes here on YouTube and today I'm\ntalking to you guys all about the on\ncloud booom strike LS but before I give\nyou my thoughts on this isso I do want\nto go over some disclosures this is a\npair of shoes that on sent to me for the\npurpose over review so I did not have to\npay for these shoes however nobody's\npaying me to make this video or to\ninclude their shoe in this video and no\none's going to get a chance to preview\nany of my footage or my thoughts before\nyou guys get a chance to see this video\non YouTube so with that disclosure out\nof the way let's talk about the on cloud\nboom strike light spray and let's start\nwith the specs we got 40 mm of sack\nheite in the heel with a 5 mm drop\ngiving us 35 mm of stack heite in the 4\nfoot and in this shoe as far as the\nmidsole goes there's two components\nthere's helon HF that's on super foam it\nis a biobased PBX material that uses at\nleast 40% biobased materials I believe\nit is the same compound that we see in\nthe nonl spray version of the cloud boom\nstrike now something to keep in mind\nabout these two shoes is that other than\nthe differences in the upper there are\nsome significant differences in the\nmidsoles of these shoes even though they\ndo share a Midol foam compound one of\nthe things that you'll know if you look\nat them kind of carefully is that there\nare four clouds or those holes in the\nmidsole that an is known for in the\ncloud boom strike LS and there's only\nthree in the midsole of the cloud boom\nstrike and the other thing to keep in\nmind is that these clouds are in a\ndifferent position both vertically in\nthe stack of the shoe and forward to\nback in terms of position of the shoe\nthe clouds in the cloud boom strike are\nin the heel there's three of them here\nand they're below the main portion of\nfoam that runs the length of the shoe in\nthe cloud boom strike LS we have four\nclouds that run along the side of the\nshoe they don't go all the way through\nlike a lot of clouds do in different on\nshoes but they're also kind of in the\nmiddle layer of the shoe here which is\nsomething that I had wished that the\nregular on cloud boob strike had done\nbecause those clouds although they seem\nkind of decorative they actually do have\na significant impact in the way that the\nfoam deflects and deforms something that\nis similar though I believe between both\nof those shoes is that they have a\ncarbon fiber speedboard now speedboard\nis kind of like a carbon fiber plate but\non uses them in a wide variety of a lot\nof their shoes and they're not always\nmade out of carbon when an is talking\nabout speed boards but the cloud boom\nstrike and for the cloud boom strike LS\nthose speed boards are made out of\ncarbon now on the outsole of the shoe we\nhave a pretty standard array of rubber\nthat we see in a lot of racing shoes\nwe've kind of got like the front third\nof the shoe covered basically where\nyou're going to be pushing off from and\nthen we have got two little patches of\nrubber along the heel now on the inside\nof the shoe there is no strobo board\nthere's no insole in fact we have a\nsetup that I think is pretty similar to\nwhat we saw in their Cloud boom strike\nwhere they have like a kind of a drop in\ninsole SL midsole chunk that they put in\nthe shoe and at least when I asked them\nabout the regular Cloud boom strike on\nsays that they do this so that they can\nremove the Strobel board and remove the\nneed for a separate insole you're\nstanding directly on that biobased PBX\nnow I I'm not brave enough to try and\nremove the insole from the cloud boom\nstrike LS with the way it's constructed\nI feel like it's an integral part of the\nshoe It's seems more than just glued\ndown and now the the main story about\nthis shoe is the upper I had a chance to\ngo to New York for the popup that they\nhad set up there for the New York\nMarathon and see the machine in action\nuh I will say that it looks pretty much\nexactly like what the promo videos for\nlight spray machine looks like online on\nhas put together a really cool video\nthat only takes 3 minutes to watch from\nbeginning to end about how this compound\nis sprayed onto the shoe very much in a\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs kind\nof way uh cured and then painted and\nthen kind of they go through the steps\nit's not like you do all the spraying\nall the curing and then all the painting\nit kind of goes back and forth steps at\na time depending on what needs to be\ndone with the shoe uh but still\nnevertheless it's a really fast and\nfascinating process the one thing that\nI'll say is when I watch the videos that\nan puts together it kind of looks like\nyou could see the stream of the\nsubstrate being applied to the shoe no\nmatter how close I looked at it and the\nlighting wasn't perfect for trying to\ndepict this I couldn't see that spray it\njust kind of looked like a sprayon wet\nmaterial was being applied to the shoe\nand then as you kind of like stepped\nback and like figuratively zoomed out\nyou could see that like material was\nbeing added onto it and then every once\nin a while they had to like run it under\na brush to kind of smooth everything\nthat had been sprayed onto the shoe then\nthey would cure it and then they would\nadd some more and then do a little bit\nof painting and kind of repeat all those\nprocesses until you were all done and\nthe result is a very lightweight\nmaterial that I believe is made out of\nTPU I'm still waiting for confirmation\nfrom on I'll update either in the\ndescription or in a comment below if I\never get a follow-up confirmation on\nthat but based on some of the stickers\nand labels that they had to put inside\nthis shoe to prepare it for mass\nproduction and for sale uh I believe\nthat the upper is made out of TPU and uh\ndespite what you might think it's\nactually pretty robust I mean you can\nreally kind of Yank on it quite a bit\nand it will stretch a little and the way\nthat they told me to try this on when I\nhad a chance to try it on in New York\nwas to kind of like stretch it a bit and\nbe aggressive with it so that way you\ncan open up the the opening by the ankle\nto get your foot inside and then kind of\nuse your fingers as shoehorns to let\nyour foot get inside and then once your\nfoot's in it it all kind of like goes\nback and morphs back into its original\nposition and and some of the sensations\nthat I'll say that I feel is that it\nfeels a lot less snug than I thought I\nwould it's certainly snug because\nthere's no laces on this thing uh but I\nreally thought that it was going to\nCrunch and almost like vacuum seal in\nall my toes I didn't get that at all but\nI am getting like pressure across like\nthe widest part of my foot I feel like\nit's um if I could use my hand as an\nexample if these are the pads of my feet\nlike right here at the ends of the pads\nof my feet that's where I feel a little\nbit of tension and I feel some tightness\non the shoe but otherwise it's really\ncomfortable and it doesn't really feel\nlike it's all that different at all\nwhich is kind of what I want out of a\nlot of technology I don't want it to\nreally feel all that different I just\nwant it to work and this upper\ndefinitely works for me the other thing\nthat I was worried about is that kind of\nlike this Edge uh looks kind of\nUnfinished and based on a lot of kind of\nknit shoes which is the closest thing\nthat I was kind of mentally comparing it\nto anytime there are these unfinished\nedges and this goes high it's kind of\nlike a midtop uh I was worried that this\nwas going to cut into my skin and I\ndidn't have any problems with that at\nall my low cut socks didn't always come\nup over the edge of the light spray\nmaterial and even though there was a lot\nof rubbing against my ankle none of it\never caused any irritation uh much less\nany chafing so that was a real surprise\nas far as the upper goes and then when\nyou're touching the inside of it it's\nreally smooth almost creepy smooth kind\nof like a synthetic leather fake skin\nkind of texture on the inside it's it's\nreally quite amazing now altogether an\nsays that this shoe comes in at 170 G\nand that is just incredibly light but\nthe size of shoe that they're using for\nthat 170 G figure is an 8.5 in US men's\nwhich is smaller than a reference size I\ndo happen to be reference size and a US\nmen's size 9 for me in this pair of\nshoes on my scales came in at 188 G\nwhich is still incredibly light cuz it's\na me near 6.6 o making it one of the\nlightest shoes on the market\n[Music]\ntoday now that we've talked about what\nthis Sho is like on paper let's talk\nabout what it's like on the road I'm\nreally enjoying the tweaks to the\nmidsole experience that we have in the\ncloud boom strike LS I feel like there's\nmore cushion and softness in this shoe\nbut it's still exception Al good at fast\nrunning when I'm running V2 max type\nefforts or faster getting all the way up\nto mile race Pace I feel like there is\nan incredible smoothness to the entire\nexperience almost as if the shoe itself\nis carving the asphalt that I'm running\nalong and it just really works well for\nwhen I want to be as powerful and as\nquick of a turnover as my legs will\nallow me to produce but then when I dial\nit back to some of the more intended\neffort levels of the shoe when I'm\nrunning threshold level or towards\nMarathon effort Pace uh and I'm landing\na little bit more in the midfoot I feel\na little bit more of the kind of\nTechnology of the shoe I'm feeling the\nclouds a little bit more because I'm\nlanding more midfoot and I'm feeling a\nlittle bit more of the interaction I\nguess there's more time for my body to\nsense the interaction between the foam\nand the carbon fiber plate and and how\nall those things are interacting with my\nstride and my pushup and I feel like\nit's all working in a really nice and\nPowerful way now on Marathon shoes have\na tendency for me to be a little bit\nfirmer than I'd like and I still think\nthat that applies to this Shue here and\nI guess to kind of translate the\nexperience into something that I think a\nlot of you will have tried before is I\nthink that kind of what I'm feeling in\nthe cloud boom strike LS reminds me a\nlot of like the adios Pro one like the\nLight Strike Pro that was in that shoe\num that was a little bit on the firm\nside but ultimately had a good amount of\ncushion and had a really great amount of\npop and give you a really powerful push\noff and stride sensation I feel like I'm\ngetting a lot of those similar kinds of\nfeelings in the on cloud boom strike\nlight spray and I I know that a lot of\nyou guys have probably come here wanting\nto hear all about this upper and and\nhave me go into Exquisite detail about\nlike how this is different from a\ntraditional running experience but I\nthink it's like running in a a shoe that\nhas a really good knit or otherwise\nminimal upper but it's doing it in a way\nthat's extremely lightweight there's no\nlike potential problems that I'm really\nforeseeing with this so far it fit\nreally well for me I took it on a really\ntight turns and tangents and I didn't\nfeel like I was sliding around I feel\nlike a lot of the concerns that people\nhave with knit uppers are kind of being\nrecycled and reased for this shoe but\nthe material is both strong and flexible\nit's both stretchy but also retains its\nshape at at the the same time I'm not\nreally sure chemically scientifically\nhow all those things can go together but\nthey all seem to be going together\nreally well in this shoe I will be\nkeeping an eye on for a longterm usage\nuh if the upper is going to stretch and\nmold to my foot and kind of the\nbarometer that I'll be comparing it\nagainst is not whether it stretches even\na little bit or not but does it stretch\nmore than say a traditional racing upper\ndoes it stretch or deform more than a\nknit upper and how much of that\ndeformation is happening relative to the\nlife expectancy of this midsole foam so\nI don't need this upper to last like 300\nmiles like I would for a daily training\nupper I just need it to be able to last\nas long as the racing foam is going to\nbe good and that's something that I'll\ndefinitely be keeping an eye on but for\nthose of you that are still like really\nconcerned about like how fragile uh this\nmaterial might be just know that they\nare putting this into some racing Spike\nprototypes so they feel like it's strong\nenough to handle the even greater\npressures and forces that would have\nfrom track athletes so I feel like that\ngives you a good indication of how\nresilient and strong that on thinks that\nthese materials are and I'm tending to\nagree with them at least in my testing\nof this shoe so far I'm not that\nconcerned about the longevity of this\nupper\n[Music]\nnow before we wrap up the video let's\ntake a moment and step back and see\nwhere the cloud bam strike LS fits\nwithin the broader on lineup especially\nnow that they have multiple marathon\nRace product and then I'll also kind of\ntalk about some of the daily training\nproduct that I especially like coming\nfrom on now on has a lot of different\ntypes of shoes that are for different\ntypes of experiences of the ones that I\ntend to like are the ones that use their\nnew shape of clouds the cloud Tech phase\nuh clouds again are these holes that onp\nputs into their shoes and the cloud teac\nphase are the ones that are not as\nrounded they're more kind of triangular\nand the shape tends to change depending\non where in the shoe that they are and I\nthink a really great example of this\ntechnology working well or this approach\nworking well is in the cloud Surfer I\nthink it's a really nice spongy comfy\ndaily trainer that's really comfortable\nfor easy miles and even a lot of\nrecovery miles as well and then the\nother shoe that I would look to would be\nthe oncloud Clips this is a little bit\ntaller of the shoe and it can be used as\na recovery shoe and I like using it for\nthat but I also feel like it works\nreally well as kind of a good long run\nshoe something that has some uptempo\nmiles in it maybe you're getting up to\nmarathon pace and maybe you've got some\neasy miles and a couple of pace changes\nbetween easy and marathon and I feel\nlike this shoe is really great for that\nand again it's using that on cloud Tech\nphase the new kind of cloud from on and\nthese would kind of be my daily training\nthe two two shoes that I would use in\nthe on lineup rotation and then for\nanything faster than what these shoes\ncould really give me or if I had a\nreally long workout uh a long run with a\nlot of marathon miles in it and a lot of\npace changes in it then that's when I'm\ngoing to reach for the race product and\nwe'll put these aside for now because\nhere's where I think it gets a little\nbit complicated now on currently has\nthree different shoes in the lineup uh\nthat are all considered Marathon product\nand I've asked on about it and none of\nthese are going to be replacing each\nother I think they're all going to\ncoexist in the on lineup at the same\ntime going forward for how much for more\nforward I'm not really sure on didn't\nreally say but at least for now these\nare all going to exist in the product\nlineup at the same time and the first\none that I'll talk about is the one that\nkind of came out first and this is the\ncloud boom Echo 3 now the cloud boom\nEcho used to be the only plate carbon\nplated race shoe in the lineup and this\nis where I feel like you know on says\nthat it's a marathon shoe but I really\nfeel like it's a 5k 10K racer it's a\nmuch lower stack heite it's a much\nfirmer experience um and it's a very\nSnappy type of shoe it doesn't have the\nkind of like compression decompression\nthat I'm looking for in something that\nI'm going to be running in for about 3\nhours at a time I think an explained it\nas a shoe that's really designed for\npeople that want to run really fast and\nhave a lot of ground feel which I think\nis a nice way of saying it's firm and\nthen there is the cloud boom strike\nwhich came out uh shortly after that in\nthe year uh a lot of people thought that\nthis is the same shoe that Helen o was\nracing in but it's it turns out it's\nquite different and the the light spray\nis really the the shoe that's closest to\nwhat she's been racing in but this is a\nshoe that I feel like kind of adds some\nstack height adds some softness to the\nexperience as well I think the plate\nposition gets tweaked a little bit in\nthis shoe too uh but you're feeling a\nlot more of kind of like super Foams uh\nin the cloud boom strike and then I\nthink like the softest and I think most\nforgiving and I think also the most\nexciting at the same time shoot of the\nthree is the cloud boom strike LS again\nit's got the four clouds higher up in\nthe stack so it's closer to your foot uh\nbut also I feel like the combination of\nthe the featherweight upper and also the\nmidsole which feels like it might be a\nlittle bit lighter and aier of a midsole\nif you ask me um makes for just a really\nfantastic experience and so these are\nkind of three different but coexisting\noptions that are available for people\nthat really want to race in on shoes I\ndefinitely have a favorite in here but\ndepending on kind of the level of\nfirmness or ground feel that you're\nlooking for in your race product there\nis an option for you at\n[Music]\non now let's wrap up the video by going\nover the the buying guide and we'll also\ntalk about some Alternatives that you'll\nwant to consider if you're interested in\nthe cloud boom strike LS I think that\nthe on cloud boom strike LS is the best\nMarathon shoe that on has ever made it's\nfast it's incredibly lightweight it's\nflexible I hope that on continues in\nthis direction of making Marathon shoes\nthat are more runnable to a wider array\nof both Elite and non- Elite Runners but\nfor now at a retail price of $3 $30 for\nthe cloud boom strike Ls I'm not sure\nthat this is a shoe that I'm going to be\nable to recommend to anyone except for\nthe most Avid shoe nerds and the most\nfervent shoe collectors let's take a\nlook at some other shoes that are on the\nmarketplace right now that you might\nwant to consider instead so the first\nthing that I will take a look at is\nanother shoe that I think is definitely\na little bit too expensive but it's the\nclosest experience that you're going to\nbe able to get and that's the shoe that\nwe've already talked about quite a bit\ntoday that's the on cloud boom strike\nand remember this isn't just a\ndifference in uppers there is a\ndifference in midsole design across both\nof these shoes that I think makes a\npretty big difference I think that for\nthose of you who like a little bit less\ncushion but a little bit more\nresponsiveness out of your race day\nshoes I feel like this is the shoe that\nyou're actually going to really prefer\nuh but for me I feel like it's on that\nborderline of like I think I could take\nit for the marathon distance but I'm not\nsure I definitely personally would\nprefer the light spray version of this\nshoe that being said the upper here is\nreally comfortable it's still really\nlightweight it does come in at almost an\nounce heavier though because it's using\ntraditional racing upper materials but I\nfeel like you're getting a lot of\nsimilar experiences and this shoe comes\nin at a I guess it's a more reasonable\n$280 now the other shoe that I think we\nshould take a look at is a lot more\nreasonably priced and that's from Adidas\nand that's the adios Pro 3 and I\nspecifically I'm going to highlight the\nthree and not the four which will be\ncoming out later in 2025 uh and the\nreason why I specifically want to talk\nabout the 3es because I feel like this\nversion of a Light Strike Pro is a foam\nthat feels more similar to the foam\nthat's in the on cloud boom strike light\nspray and I feel like there is a\nresponsi to it it's definitely feels\nfast and you're getting a lot of bounce\nback from the foam uh and I feel like\nthere's a little bit of firmness to it\nas well it's not uncomfortable it's not\nhard by any means uh but it's a little\nbit more firm than it would be say\ncushioned and so there is a little bit\nless of the compression but there's a\nreally quick and satisfying\ndecompression that comes with both of\nthese shoes now the adios Pro 3 is even\nheavier still compared to the cloud boom\nstrike LS and the cloud boom strike but\nit is readily available it's pretty easy\nto buy even right now and it comes in at\na retail of\n$250 so $80 cheaper than the light spray\nso those are my thoughts on the OD Cloud\nboom strike LS it's definitely a shoe I\nlike more than I thought I would and I\ndo think it is the best Marathon shoe\nthat an has put out hopefully this is a\ntechnology that can become a little bit\nmore affordable and a little bit more\nproducible so that way they can make it\nin inventory numbers where more of you\ncan try this out uh I don't think it's a\nmusthave technology but it is certainly\nvery interesting to try and for you sho\nnerds out there you're going to want to\nat least find a place to be able to try\nit on and get a chance to experience it\nhopefully you'll get a chance to do just\nthat if you have any other questions\nabout the cloud boom strike LS or any of\nthe shoes that I talked about today feel\nfree to put them in the comments down\nbelow or better yet stop by the live\nstream I do Mondays and Thursdays over\non the kfoi Run Club Channel I'd love to\ntalk to you guys over there in the chat\nthat's all I have for today everybody\nthanks so much for making it all the way\nto the end of this video hopefully you\nguys are staying safe out there on your\nruns and I will see you in the next one\nyo what's going on\n[Music]",

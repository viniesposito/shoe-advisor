  "text": "over the past few weeks I've been\ngetting so many messages and comments\nasking if I was going to be testing out\nthe new Muno Neo Vista there's been so\nmuch hype for this shoe Muno went on a\nmassive promotion drive my social media\nfeeds been bulging with people promoting\nthis shoe I checked it out and\neverything sounds really exciting an all\nnew shoe a really radical design the new\nbooty upper and a new foam to go with it\nas well is this the value super trainer\nwe've all been looking for well stay\ntuned because we got all that and more\ncoming up with my full review of the\nMuna Neo Vista before we start out just\nwant to say I bought this shoe 100% with\nmy own money to give you that completely\nhonest impartial unbiased review if you\nlike this kind of content please drop us\na like leave your comments down below\nand subscribe to the channel if you\nhaven't already and of course check out\nmy own website BP parks.com where we've\ngot the best running hats and Technical\ngear to help you with your running right\non with the video now as I said at the\nstart of the video this is an all new\nshoe from Mao it's not replacing\nanything and I think the look are really\npolarizing from what I can tell what do\nyou think about the looks of this shoe\nyou a lover or a hater for me I really\nlike it well let's start out chatting\nabout all of the facts and figures so\nthe purpose of a shoe like this this is\na premium daily shoe really good long\nrun shoe for those Marathon paste long\nruns that high stack Max cushion shoe to\nreally look after your legs on those\nlonger runs and some similar examples\nhere something like the Hoka macx the\nBoston series of shoes more the more\nrecent Boston series of shoes or\nsomething like the Nike Zoom fly 5 this\nshoe sent me back\n\u00a350 here in the UK stack out of the back\n45 mil 8 mm drop overall 3155 G or 11.1\nOz it's a neutral shoe it has this\nseamless knit upper with a tongue\nintegrated into it like a booty type\nconstruction so it really hugs your foot\nprobably the most famous shoe like this\nis something like the Nike Tempo next\nperent in terms of the midsole oh I\nreally like the midsole in this shoe but\nthis is mauno super smooth speed assist\nenergy NXT midso foam this is an EVA\nfoam which is normally quite basic as\nFoams go and some people have been\nworried about that but they've injected\nsome nitrogen here they've got to hold\ntheir special process and it really\nbrings this shoe to life one of the best\nEva Foams that I've ever run in there is\na nylon plate in this shoe which is a\nlittle bit more forgiving a lot less\nstiff than a carbon plate shoe really\nsuited for that daily trainer type\naspect I've got mizuno's own rubberhead\non the out soole and as you can see\nthere's this massive cutaway along the\nbottom of the shoe which has probably\nbeen done to save weight more than\nanything there are no different widths\navailable which is a little bit\nfrustrating but in terms of width it was\nreally good for me this booty\nconstruction really means there's a lot\nof space to get your feet in there so\nyou should be absolutely fine as you got\nseverely wide feet and it wasn't true to\nsize for me I actually couldn't get my\nsize so I ordered half a size down and\nthat was perfect so it probably is about\ntrue size to half a size down if if\nyou're at all unsure go half a size down\nand finally there are two different\ncolorway options there's the blue for\nthe men's and the white colorway option\nfor the women right let's get stuck into\nmy likes my first like with the shoe is\nthis upper really good lock down snug\nfit the upper really does hug to your\nfoot like a sock as you'd expect I\nsuppose and I was worried about some\npotential overheating issues because\nthis upper is quite thick but for me in\nthe UK it was absolutely fine no hot\nspots blisters rubbing or any sort of\ndiscomfort like that really good lock\ndown at the back of the shoe as well\nwith the ankle is very soft here at the\nback but just held the foot really\nnicely through the whole foot strike so\nyeah upper really fantastic super\ncomfortable right from the off and it\nwas just an absolute joy to run in my\nsecond like with this shoe is it super\nsmooth across the surfaces really great\ncruising long run shoe it really shines\nat that easy steady marathon pace half\nmarathon pace that's where this shoe is\nbest used I didn't really notice the\nplate through the stride yeah you can\ntell it's there just about but it's\nreally there just to help assist with\nthe stability more than anything rather\nthan speed which is all due just the\nhuge amount of foam we've got in this\nmidsole so you really need to add that\nplate in just to give it that solid\nstructure yes the shoe is a little bit\non the heavier side of things again just\nfor a sheer amount of foam in here but\nit really does cruise along really\nnicely just a fantastic cruisy long run\nmarathon training or Marathon racing\nshoe and then finally the value of the\nshoe for in the UK \u00a350 for everything\nthis is delivering is really quite\nexceptional in my opinion for the plated\ntraining shoe sort of Market of course\nyou can get shoes way cheaper or way\nmore expensive for this type of shoe\nthis is definitely on the very cheaper\nend and one of the best ones out there\nat the moment as well I was really\nworried they're going to be cutting some\ncost by using this Evo instead of a p PX\nPham which you get in some of the more\nElite models out there but the midsole\nfeels so bouncy So Soft but it's just\nthe right amount of cushioning to really\nbring a smile to your face and the right\namount of energy to get your long runs\ndone moving on to my dislikes the first\none in just really sharp Corners it's\njust by using this kind of booty type\nupper there is a little bit of sideways\nmovement but for those marathon training\nlong runs when you're just going a\nstraight line you'll be absolutely fine\nand again with this big big bit missing\nin the bottom just a little bit of\ninstability there very very minor thing\nyou might notice that you might not but\nI really wanted to bring that up the\nsecond dislike with the shoe is it is\njust a little bit chunky and it's a\nlittle bit too soft for those faster\npacing runs if you're going to do some K\nreps some 5K races 10K races things like\nthat it's not going to be a super allout\nfar shoe it is actually quite\nlightweight for the sh size and volume\nthat this shoe is a lot of people don't\nlike these big clunky shoes which this\none definitely is but there's still a\nlot of bulk here there's a lot of mass\nunderneath your foot but yeah it really\ndoes deliver a really nice fantastic\nenjoyable ride for those as I say half\nmarathon Marathon easy tight Pace runs\nso if you wanton a firm ride with lots\nof ground feeling this is really one to\navoid in a similar vein it's just a\nlittle bit too chunky for those 5K 10K\nraces and that sort of training yes I\nreally think it's a really good solid\ndaily shoe but it's not perfect the\nshoe's far more suited for long distance\ncruisy Pace half marathon Marathon easy\nPace yeah you could even go for a\nrecovery jog in it as well it does take\na lot of these boxes but it's that\nmiddle sweet spot where this shoe really\nshines also a really good option for\nsomeone that feels like the flagship\ncarbon Racers a little bit too expensive\nthey're not quite sort of supportive\nenough not providing enough Comfort this\nshoe is really comfortable and again\nit's a really good option to have a look\nat I say the perfect person for a shoe\nlike this is someone that wants some\nreally good value wants a shoe they can\ndo all of their marathon training in\npotentially do their marathon race in as\nwell doesn't want to get too involved by\nbuilding big shoe rotations yes you can\nput this in a rotation get something\nfaster get something slower either end\nit will look after you really well there\nI say this is a really good one sh\noption for people maybe in their first\nsecond third sort of marathon with an\nallout Comfort shoe and following on\nfrom that this shoe was exceptionally\ncomfortable if you want to see my best\ncomfortable shoes then check out that\nvideo that's coming up next here that's\nit guys let me know your thoughts on the\nnew M let me know down in the comments\nhow I catch up there keep working hard\nguys keeping get it done and we'll see\nyou very soon in the next one",

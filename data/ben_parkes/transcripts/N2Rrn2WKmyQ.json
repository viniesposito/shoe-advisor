  "text": "this is the Adidas Evo SL inspired by\nthe record-breaking Ultra lightweight\nFlagship racing shoe the pro Evo 1 which\ncost an eye watering\n\u00a3450 they look pretty much identical\nthey've both got the same foam in them\nthe same stack height and the same drop\nas well except this one here cost an\namazing\n130\nA320 saving it exists as a more\naffordable daily and racing option and\nthere's been a lot of hype around this\nshoe I'm sure you've seen it that's\nprobably why you're watching this video\nwith Adidas launching this shoe via a\nballot a few months back and now it's\nfinally on General sale we're going to\nsee what all the fuss is about but as\nalways I bought this shoe 100% with my\nown money to give you that a completely\nunbiased unsponsored unfiltered review\nThanks so much to everybody that\nsubscribes to the channel likes the\nvideos share the videos as well and\ncheck out my website Ben parks com we've\ngot the most amazing running hats and\nTechnical gear and five-star rated\ntraining plans to help you on your\njourney right let's get stuck in\nstarting out with the facts and figures\nthe purpose of the Adidas Evo SL this is\na lightweight daily shoe for Speed work\nthreshold sessions and racing I'd say up\nto a half marathon some people have\ndefinitely run a marathon issue I think\nwith my legs I'd rather have something a\nlittle bit more plated in there to get a\nlittle bit more assistance but you\nprobably could run a marathon it if you\nreally wanted to price-wise this set me\nback\n\u00a330 it was \u20ac150\n50 Australia and Canada we're not sure\nwhen it's coming out in those countries\nyet stack cut at the back 39 mm stack 32\nmil stack at the front and a 7 mm of\ncourse drop overall weightwise this is\nincredibly lightweight just\n267 G for me in my UK size 12 it is a\nneutral shoe and with the upper of the\nshoe we have this wov mesh it's\nincredibly lightweight a little bit\nfragile potentially we'll come on to\nthat a little bit later on the midsole\nof this shoe that's where all the fuss\nis about we have a complete fulllength\nmidsole here of Adidas's light strip Pro\ntheir most premium foam that you get in\ntheir 200 plus Super Shoes and that's\nwhat everybody is raving about at this\nprice point of \u00a3 130 you just don't see\nthings like that there is no plate in\nthis shoe or any carbon rods or anything\nlike that there is a very small plastic\nshank in the middle of the shoe which is\njust there to help that stability given\nthe amount of foam in the shoe but as\nfar as I'm concerned that's not doing\nanything to Aid your speed or Aid your\nperformance or help you run faster it's\npurely there for that stability then\noutso wise we've got Adidas's\nContinental grip on the bottom of the\nshoe their sort of winter version here\nthe rubber at the back of Che is a\nslightly different compound but yeah so\nfar I've been running it in UK winter\nand it's pretty good it's definitely on\nthe thin side it might not really\nlasting that long it's not as good as\nsay the grip that you get on the Boston\nwe'll chat on that a little bit later on\nbut it's okay there are no different\nwidths available added shoes are\ngenerally on the narrow side but these\nshoes actually very accommodating a lot\nmore accommodating than you might expect\nfrom an adash shoe people with very\nnarrow or very wide feet probably\nwouldn't give this a Miss but if you're\nin that nice middle ground you're going\nto be absolutely fine in the shoe there\nare different men's and women's version\navailable it was true to size for me\nright let's have a chat all about these\nlikes and see how good this shoe really\nis my first like with this shoe is just\nthe sheer Simplicity that it offers it's\nsimple it's fast it's lightweight and\nit's fun I mean what a great combination\nthat is being so lightweight with this\nsuper foam that you've got here as well\nit's a very very fast shoe for that non\nplated or nonassisted type of ride it's\na great daily option and a great\ntraining shoe for those people that\ndon't want to be using plates or don't\nwant using plates too much in their\ntraining the Mido here is just fantastic\nthe light strip Pro foam is just one of\nthe best out there without a doubt it's\nbouncy and it's responsive it's just\nlike that puppy that always wants to go\nout and play it's always saying run\nfaster run faster moving on I want to\nhave a quick chat about the value that\nthis shoe is offering to get that 100%\nLight Strike Pro which this is that that\n100% peber it's not a watered down\nversion of their super foam this is the\nproper full blend that you're going to\nget on those high-end performance shoes\nand this foam is also renowned for its\ndurability as well it lasts a long time\nyou're going to get a lot of Mars out of\nthis shoe the out soole I find is\nworking pretty well as well as I just\nmentioned it's certainly on the thin\nside it is such a lightweight shoe so\nthey have had to cut down you can't put\na thick out soole here that's going to\nhave the most amazing winter grip\nbecause then it's just going to add to\nthe weight so know the limitations of\nthis shoe but it's definitely one of the\nlightest shoes I've ever run in and I\nthink this package for\n\u00a3130 is absolutely fantastic moving on I\nwant to have a chat about the extreme\nversatility of the shoe I'm not sure\nyou'd want to run a marathon I know\nplenty of people have for me I'm going\nto pick up something with a big carbon\nplate in there if you want to you\ndefinitely could do but where I think\nthis shoe really shines in those\nslightly shorter distances those 5Ks\n10ks and half marathons I've taken this\nshoe up to 3 minutes a kpace as you can\nsee on the screen now not for very long\nat the moment but just doing some faster\none minute reps there and then jogs\nright down to 5 minutes 30 a and it\nfeels really comfortable at both speeds\nthe upper is really breathable as well\nmaybe a little bit too breathable\npotentially you want to make sure you've\ngot your winter socks on at this time of\nyear in this shoe and then my fourth and\nfinal like is just that fantastic\ncushioning and the energy return and\nfantastic cushioning that that this\nlight stripe Pro is offering this shoe\nis fast it looks fast it feels fast and\nit is fast as well with this big rocker\nthat you have at the front of the shoe\ncombined with this foam and that\nlightweight nature of it it's a shoe\nthat it really is happiest at speed\ncovering the ground really quite\nsmoothly it's such a Smooth Operator\nthis shoe and this is where this shoe\nreally comes alive for me I know I just\nsaid it's really versatile you can jog\nin it you can run easy in it but it's\nreally best once you start to pick up\nthe pace those tempos those thresholds\nthat's where this shoe really starts to\nshine I think most people would want to\nuse this as that daily sort of training\nshoe for Speed sessions potentially some\nlog run sessions in there when you want\nto be running pretty fast right let's\nwhip through those dislikes starting out\nwhen I have a chat about the laces and\nthe tongue the tongue is just a little\nbit on the short side if you want to do\nsome heel lock lacing you can just about\nbut it's really not going to work out\nvery well and it also so does move\naround it would have been nice to just\nadd a little bit of material to make\nthat tongue a gusseted tongue it would\nhave just held it in place so much\nbetter the it just moves around and it's\nsimply Too Short the laces on this shoe\nagain they try to make them as\nlightweight and skinny as possible they\njust feel really cheaply B they just\nlike the kind of laces you get in like a\n10B sort of shoe in Primark or something\nabsolutely nothing special at all and\nthen moving on to this whole like draw\nthing and this hype thing these micro\nlimited releases all to increase that\nhype the big social media Buzz all that\nsort of playing on that fomo youve got\nto get in now or you're going to miss\nout and then people do miss out and the\nnext drop comes in a little bit bigger\nand then that all sells out but is it\nworth that hype well it's a nice shoe\nI've really enjoyed running it but the\nhype is absolutely crazy and of course\nsome people are going to feel a little\nbit disappointed I think a lot of people\nare going into this thinking this is the\nbest shoe of all time it's a good shoot\nit's just a running shoot though and\nthen finally my fourth dislike with the\nshoe it's just a little nitpicky sort of\nthing about the upper it really doesn't\ngive the best lock down compared to some\nof the other offerings out there again\nknow what you're getting into with this\nshoe it's a very lightweight type of\nshoe there's not a lot of material up\nhere in the upper if you're going to be\ndoing some sharp Corners you're going to\nbe racing at Park run and things like\nthat you might find your foot is just\nsort of rolling across to the side a\nlittle bit other options around like the\nSL2 or the Boston they're a lot more\nsort of durable a lot more chunky keep a\nlittle bit heavier little bit more to\nthem your foot is definitely being held\nin place a lot better with those shoes\nso let's have a little chat about those\nshoes now so I think a lot of people are\npotentially in the market for this but\nthey might be thinking should I save\neven more money and get the SL2 or spend\na bit more money and get the Boston\nlet's have a chat about those two now so\nthe SL2 20 cheaper than this shoe again\nfantastic value really all three of\nthese shoes offer a fantastic value it's\n20 G heavier but again still pretty\nlight weight weight has a small layer of\nthe premium foam the foam you're seeing\nin this shoe here but it's sandwiched\nbetween two layers of far more Durable\nfoam so again should be very hard\nwearing and Lasting a little bit longer\nyou're not getting the Continental outs\nsoole and you're also slightly lower\nstack height there as well as we've just\ndiscussed the lockdown on the SL2 just\nholds your foot in place a lot better\nbut the evos is a lot more responsive\nfar better energy return you're getting\nin the shoe and that much more\naggressive rocker at the front of the\nshoe as well really a lot smoother ride\nto run in I'd view the SL2 is a great\ndaily Workhorse to do everything in\npretty well it's just going to last and\nit's going to put up with good weather\nbad weather you just abuse it and get a\nlot of good value out of it the Evo SL\nhere a great value shoe if you want to\ngo fast and feel fast but it's probably\nnot the kind of shoe you're going to\nreaching for every single day out there\nyou're going to want to partner it up\nwith something like the SL2 potentially\nand then have a quick chat about the\nBoston \u00a310 more expensive quite a bit\nheavier than the shoe although again\npretty good Weight Wise 318 G for me in\nmy UK size 12 again you've got two\ndifferent types of foam in that shoe the\nLight Strike Pro and the 2.0 EVA foam\nagain just for some durability with that\none plus now you're getting those energy\nrods in there as well for a much more\nassisted ride and a really very\nhardwearing very grippy Continental\nrubber outso with that shoe the Boston\nis going to be a little bit better at\nthose long distances it's a lot more\ndurable should be a lot lot longer\nlasting as well very dependable shoe\noverall right let's have a chat about my\nconclusions and my final thoughts does\nit live up to the hype well the hype was\nabsolutely insane let's be honest I\ndon't think anything could live up to\nthat amount of hype but it's a good shoe\nno doubt about it it's a good solid shoe\ndefinitely a lot better than some of the\nstuff we've seen this year would I\nrecommend it very much so but be aware\nof those limitations it's a lightweight\nshoe it's got a lot of stuff stripped\nout of it but you can have a lot of fun\nin here the phone will look after you\nreally well and it will really bring a\nsmile to your face when you start to\npick up the speed but you'll probably\ngoing to want to ideally pair it with\nsomething a little bit more durable as a\ndaily option alongside it and then just\nput this one when you just want to go\nout and have some fun your legs are\nfeeling fresh or you've got a really\ngood speed session or a long run session\nor whatever type of session to do but\nthat's where I'll be using the shoe when\nI want to have some fun and run fast in\nit so if you want to check out my full\nAdidas SL2 review check out that video\nout here if you want to check out my\nbest shoes of 2024 video check that\nvideo up down here and that'll be up in\na couple of days so it might be blank at\nthe moment but it will be there in a few\ndays time that's it guys let me know\nyour thoughts on this shoe what do you\nthink about it what do you think about\nthe hype are you getting it have you got\nit are you going to be running it I'd\nreally love to catch up on your thoughts\ndown in the comments that's it guys keep\non working hard keep done I'll see you\nvery soon in the next one",

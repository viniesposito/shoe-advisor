  "text": "the most anticipated shoe of the year is\nfinally here the aex super blast version\n2 the original super blast burst onto\nthe scene last year and almost\nimmediately became one of my absolute\nfavorite alltime training shoes and when\nI'm not out running testing other shoes\nthis was the shoe I'd reach for about\n90% of the time clocking it over 3,000\nkm in a few different versions of\nversion one with two big updates to\nversion two with the out soole and the\nupper hereit I was really worried that\naex might be messing this one up so is\nthis new model going to live up to my\nvery high expectations or am I going to\nbe scaring eBay to try and find some\npairs of version one and as always I\nbought this shoe 100% with my money to\ngive you that completely honest\nimpartial unbiased review right let's\nget stuck into all of the changes\nbetween the version one and version two\nthe price of the Superglass 2 is a\nlittle bit more expensive here in the UK\nnow costing \u00a3200 most markets around the\nworld it's pretty much the same we have\ngot an updated midsole this big chunk\nthrough the middle here which now uses\nthe FF turbo the same as the updated\nmetas speed sky and Edge asex is most\npremium responsive foam that they offer\nout there and then we've got a thin\nlayer along the bottom of here of asx's\nFF blast plus which is what they use for\na little bit more durability and also\nsort of stabilizing the shoe we've got\nan updated outsole much welcome updated\nouto this is new aex grip rubber on the\nbottom here a little bit more grippy\nhere in the wet weather we'll come on to\nchat about that a little bit later on\nthe review and also you can't get any\nstones and Pebbles and little\nhitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe\nhere which I you get all the time on\nversion one when you'd run on sort of\nmore grally areas they filled in all of\nthose holes in slightly different design\nand pattern on version two and then\nfinally we've got a different updated\nupper to the shoe here which is now this\none piece woven engineered mesh so it's\na little bit more stretchy and just has\na little bit more movement with the shoe\nversus version one right let's get stuck\ninto the facts and figures this is is\nyour long distance mileage monster for\ncrushing those long runs out there and\nit's also one of the very best\nnon-plated racing shoes perfect for like\n10K half marathons marathons and also\nUltra marathons if they're going to be\non the road as well is very much a road\nshoe although you could do have a little\nbit of light trail with this great aex\ngrip on the bottom here price-wise this\nsent me back \u00a3200 here in the UK around\nabout \u20ac220 $200 around about $320\nAustralian dollars stack Heights we've\ngot 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm\ndrop overall and it's basically the same\nweight as the outgoing model for me this\nis coming at 288 G that's really really\nquite light for sure of this size this\nis in my particular size UK 11 A2 here\nthe old version was 290 so basically\nexactly the same it is a neutral shoe\nthe upper as I've just said is this\nlovely engineered mesh upper which Asic\nsay is going to improve the air flow\nthrough the shoe midso we've got the FF\nTurbo plus through the middle here and\nthen the FF blast plus Eco along the\nbottom of the shoe there there is\nfamously no carbon plate in the shoe and\nthe outsole Now features this aex grip\nwhich is these yellow sections here and\naex also put this on some of their trail\nshoes as well so it's very tacky very\nsticky a lce sort of slow density rubber\nto try and improve on asx's usually\nquite poor wet weather performance there\nare no different wits available at\nlaunch but it's pretty good here on the\nwitth side there's also this one\nFlagship color at launch which is asx's\nParis colorway personally I absolutely\nlove this let me know what your thoughts\nare down in the comments asex say that\nthis is to do with Paris called the city\nof lights and we've got sunset and\nsunrise colors here and finally this\nwasn't true to size I actually ordered a\nsize 12 my usual size and a size 11 and\n1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version\none and I've stuck with that in version\ntwo basically i' just say go half a size\ndown from your regular size or go\nexactly the same size you had in version\none if you had that shoe if you could\nlike and share this video and let us\nknow down in the comments your thoughts\non the superl 2 that be great and please\ncheck out my website benp parks.com\nwe've got training plans the best\nrunning hats in the world some technical\ngear and Casual gear to keep you going\nthrough your training right let's get\nstuck into the likes my first like here\nis they didn't mess it up come on I get\nso worried when you have your absolute\nfavorite shoe out there and a\nmanufacturer releases a new one and\nyou're like please don't mess it up\nplease don't make it really heavy bulky\nuse different materials they have used\ndifferent materials but all the updates\nin the shoe have worked really well the\nupper is just a little bit more\nbreathable the key area such as the\nankle lock down absolutely fantastic no\nslipping no blisses no hot spots nice\ngusseted tongue here just gives the\nperfect right amount of padding so your\nfoot stays nicely locked down yes I was\na bit worried my foot might move around\na little bit at the front of the shoe\nwith this woven mesh upper but it just\nstays perfectly in place so no problems\nthere and also finally thank you to ax\nfor not increasing the weight actually\nfor me brought it down very very so\nslightly super lightweight shoe it is\nabsolutely amazing how a shoe can be\nthis light and it just feels so much fun\nto run in my second like with the shoe\nis this updated midsole foam it's just\never so slightly more Poppy and\nresponsive but really very very similar\nif you're a fan of version one you're\ngoing to love this updated foam in\nversion two It just strikes that perfect\nbalance in a shoe that can just have\nthat sudden turn with speed of course\nthere's plenty of faster dedicated 5K\nand 10K shoes with plates and things\nlike that there but that's not what this\nshoe is all about this shoe is perfect\nfor crunching those long distance\nmarathon training runs or marathon races\nas well if you don't want to be using a\ncarbon plate and really if you don't\nwant to have a carbon plate in your shoe\nthere really is nothing faster out there\nthan the aex super blast version 2 and\nthen finally my third like with the shoe\nis this updated outsole the super blast\nwas okay in the wet it really wasn't\nthat great but the new aex grip they put\non the bottom of the shoe here just\nmeans all of that worry has gone away\nwhen I have running it in the wet it's\njust gripped super fantastically and you\nreally can feel the difference even\nwalking around the house the you one it\njust feels different it's lot more tacky\nwhen aex had all their problems with\ntheir grip with their wet weather grip\nin like the Nova Blast 2 and three it\nreally wasn't very good this you don't\nhave to worry about it at all fantastic\nupdate aex well done finally got a shoe\nthat you can trust in the wet weather\nand also you can just take this out on\nsome light Trails as well and it will\nhandle those absolutely fine some fire\nroads and things like that you'll be\ngood to go here moving on to the\ndislikes this is really hard to be\nhonest my first dislike isn't really\neven about the shoe it's just about all\nthe supply issues that you have with the\nsuperlast and I don't know why aexs are\nlike this the shoe sells out so quickly\npretty much sold out on launch day all\naround the world maybe it's all just\nmarketing I don't know there's nothing\nin this shoe that you can't get on all\nof the other ax shoes the materials are\nall available but they really seem to\nlimit Supply I can only assume I don't\nknow why that is but this shoe will be\nselling out very very quickly if you can\nget a pair you want to get a pair don't\ndilly dally just go and get that order\nin and also the shoe was meant to launch\non Friday just gone on the aex website\nhere in the UK they didn't even launch\nbecause I think they had supply issues\nthemselves and they delayed their launch\nagain I don't know that's just what I\nsuspect even assets can't get it right I\ngot my player from sport shoes got up at\n5:30 in the morning to try and secure a\npair which I managed to do so very very\nhappy with that got the 11 and a half\nand 12 come in and now yeah need to send\nthe 12's back cuz I just a bit worried\nabout the sizing but we're all good the\nsecond sort of dislike I've got with a\nshoe yeah it is a little bit on the\nexpensive side it's so hard to be\ntalking about a 200 shoe and saying this\nis great it is a fantastic shoe but also\nwhat you're getting with that 200 L is a\nsuper durable shoe as well I'd always\nget at least 1,000 k out of my version\none the updated outsol in the shoe\nshould be even better so it should be\ngetting a little bit more mileage out of\nthis but it does last a long time I\ncan't wait to bring a full whizbang pop\nreview once I've done my thks in the\nshoe will slot it into a review\nsomewhere down the line and speaking of\ncost maybe you're better off at going\nfor something like the Nova blast 4 for\nexample \u00a365 less that's a big chunk of\ncash and really the Nova blast is a\nsuperb allaround shoe the super blast it\nis slightly quicker without a doubt it's\njust a little bit more responsive less\nbouncy foam you get here and it is\nbetter suited for your long runs just a\nbit firmer bit lighter and just a bit\nSmo smoother through the footstrike\noverall but I'd say stick with the Nova\nblast if you're just looking for\nsomething that you can do all of your\nruns pretty well and you're not doing\ntoo many long runs it's a shoe that's\nI'd say around about 90% as fast and\nreally will suit the vast majority of\npeople unless you're looking for the\nabsolute Crema creme or if you're very\nfortunate to have the budget and you\nwant to get both of them then you could\nuse you all your sort of regular daily\ntraining in the Nova blast and then use\nthis for your marathon training long\nruns and maybe even a marathon racing\nshoe at the weekend moving on the Neo\nVista hit the scene a few weeks ago I\ngave it a rave review it was fantastic\n\u00a350 cheaper and it really is a bit of a\nshoe at the moment has a nylon plate in\nit so slightly different feel very\ndifferent ride going through the shoe\nit's bouncier and it's softer and it\ndoes soak up those easy Mars a little\nbit better the super blast picks up the\npace a little bit better and it does\nhave a firmer ride both these shoes\nsupremely comfortable I could personally\nchoose this type of upper rather than\nthe booty upper just get a better lock\ndown in this one and with the near Vista\nit's just a little less stable around\nthe corners where this is absolutely\nRock Solid and the super blast will\nprobably last a little bit longer with\nthis better out soole with the shoe\nthere as well so I really think you're\ngetting about the same sort of value yes\nthe super blast is a little bit more\nexpensive but it will last a lot longer\nI think in my opinion then finally\nsomething like the Nike Invincible\nversion 3 around about 20 cheaper here\nthe Invincible is a lot bouncier it's\nroomier it's heavier it's perfect for\nthose easy recovery runs but again a\nshoe manufacturers using their Flagship\nfoam without putting that carbon plate\nin the shoe the super blast is just much\nsmoo through the stride a lot firmer\nmuch more Nimble and lightweight and\njust better at a more wider range of\nspeeds where something like the\nInvincible it's really is just your sort\nof steady marathon pace really steady\nmarathon pace and easing recovery run\nsort of shoe so let's bring this all\ntogether what do I think of the\nsuperlast well it's a fantastic shoe\nwithout a doubt it is definitely going\ninto my rotation\nI'm going to finish my miles I've got\nabout 300 miles left in my last pair of\nversion one so I'm not going to use this\nstraight away it's not a revolutionary\nupdate get subscribed and see if this\nshoe will be making into my top three\nshoes of the year which we normally\nlaunch around about December time if you\nare interested in other asset shoes\nwe've got a complete assets comparison\nguide again completely unsponsored B all\nthe asset shoes with I money check that\nout that is up here coming up next let\nme know if you've got any questions down\nin the comments about the super blast\nI'll catch up and answer all of those\ndown there keep it working hard guys\nkeep done I'm have to get some more\nmarathon training done we see you very\nsoon in the next one",

  "text": "over the last few years the aex nov last\nhas really established itself as one of\nthe best daily trainers on the market so\nmuch so that this is now one of the most\nhighly anticipated launches of the year\nlast year I found myself recommending\nthe version 4 time and time again for it\nsimple no fuss Approach at a really good\nprice point as well so will aex continue\nthis winning streak with this version 5\nor will version 4 be the best one to\nstick with I managed to buy this very\npair at the Valencia Marathon Expo a few\ndays before the official launch event so\nsome good time to put this through its\npaces and see what it's like and of\ncourse I bought this 100% with my own\nmoney as we do here with all the shoe\nreviews on the channel to give you that\ncompletely honest unbiased unsponsored\nreview thank you so much to everyone who\nlikes comments and subscribes to the\nchannel and checks out my website benp\nparks.com you can find awesome running\ngear running hats and those five star\nrated training plans right let's get\nstuck in the review of the aex overl\nversion starting out with all of the\ndifferences between this and the\noutgoing model so with version 5 we now\nhave a new midsole foam this is asx's FF\nblast Max version 4 was the FF blast\nplus Eco it's now a little bit softer\nthan the outgoing model and also a\nlittle bit of a lighter foam as well aex\nhave also updated the upper to the shoe\nwith this new engineered jackard mesh\nupper pretty breathable we'll come on to\nthose points later on and also on the\nbottom of the shoe we've got the same\nout so material as the outgoing version\njust an updated pattern an updated\nplacement of those rubber pads on the\nbottom of the shoe Weight Wise with the\nshoe pretty much the same as the outgo\nmodel some people have got a pair\nslightly lighter some people slightly\nheavier when I weighed it it was 2 G\nheavier but basically exactly the same\nthe stack and the drop again identical\nand the price they've kept that a really\ngood price point here from aex at\n135 so let's move on to all of the facts\nand figures so the purpose of the\nnovablast version 5 this is your premium\ndaily trainer a shoe that can do all\ndifferent types of runs at a kind of\nthat 7 to 8 out of 10 not perfect at any\nbut you just go out there with a nice\none shoe rotation it will do them all\npretty well it's certainly possible to\nuse this for some longer runs as well\nprice-wise this shoe sent me back\n\u20ac150 because I ought it in Spain but in\nthe UK it's \u00a3135 $140 $240 Australian\ndollars Canadian dollars is not out in\nCanada at the time of filming stack code\nat the back of the SHO\n41.5 mm with an 8 mm drop overall Weight\nWise as I said pretty much identical 302\nG for me in my UK size 11 1/2 on this\nparticular shoe really quite nice and\nlight there in terms of that neutral\nstability this is a neutral shoe the\nupper we've got this technical jackard\nmesh upper midsole the FF blast Max\nthere's no plate in this shoe but it's\nreasonably stiff and on the outside of\nthe shoe we've got asx's aha low density\nrubber here which is not great we'll\ncome on to that in the dislikes later on\nthere are no different widths available\nthere are different men's and women's\nversion as well with lots of different\ncolorways we'll put them up on the\nscreen now I can't even remember how\nmany they are but there's quite a lot at\nofficial launch let me know what your\nfavorite one is down in the comments and\nthis wasn't true to size for me I did go\nhalf a size down the same size I get in\nthe super blast the same size I got in\nversion four of the shoe right let's\nhave a chat about all of them likes and\nthere's quite a few my first like with\nthe shoe is super stable smooth ride\nit's bouncy and it's cushioned as well\nit just looks after your legs really\nwell on those long runs a really true\nversatile do it all daily trainer I\nreally like the rocker at the front of\nthe shoe it just is so smooth through\nthat foot strike it wants you to pick up\nthe pace a little bit but this is happy\njust cruising along that easy Pace\neating up those mares yes the foam is a\nlittle bit softer we'll come on to that\nbut it's responsive enough if you want\nto pick up the pace you are going to be\nable to my second like the sheer value\nthat this shoe is offering in my opinion\nthis is the best shoe in this price\nsegment \u00a31 135 is really good aset could\nhave definitely put that up by5 or10 and\nI think people would have still bought\nit so kudos to them for keeping version\n5 at that price point just really well\nput together shoe really good build\nquality and yes \u00a325 cheaper than sort of\nNike equivalent shoe with the p plus so\nexceptional value at this price point\nthird like with the shoe Comfort the fit\nand the lock down is very similar to\nversion four we've got a new lacing\nsystem two different types of lacing up\nthe front here we've got a partially\ngusseted tongue as well that stays in\nplace really nicely that's not moving\naround at all it certainly feels a\nlittle bit wider than the outgoing well\nit is a little bit wider than the\noutgoing model but I've had no issues\nwith any heel slipping any hot spots any\nblisters or anything like that there's\nreally no need to use the lock down\nlacing but if you want to these laces\nare more than long enough to do that\nthere's a good amount of breathability\nin the new upper as well got a good air\nflow through here as I'm testing this\nthis is the middle of the winter in the\nUK we're not worried about overheating\nbut if you are in a warmer climate I\nthink you're going to get some good air\nflow through in this upper and at the\nback of the shoe the heel just the right\namount of softness the right amount of\npadding that you're going to want in a\ndaily shoe my fourth like with this shoe\nis the amount of cushion you're getting\nversus the weight now one of the big\npopular shoes of the year the super\nblast people can't believe how light it\nis for the amount of Stack height the\namount of cushioning you're getting in\nthat shoe this is very very similar this\nis a lot softer than the super blast\ndefinitely not a competitor or a\nplacement for the super blast or\nanything like that but just the amount\nof cushioning you're getting with a shoe\nfor the weight of the shoe as well is\nreally quite fantastic it is lightweight\nit also feels lightweight for me a shoe\naround that 300 grams is what I really\nlike to look for the super blast does\nthat fantastically well this is just a\nlittle bit heavier than that but still\nreally nice and light and my fifth like\nwith the shoe it's just the versatility\nthat it offers it's very easy to run in\njust no fuss at all give me absolutely\nno issues it just gets on and does the\njob no matter what's on the plan or what\ndistance you need to go out and do you\nhappily take this from anywhere from a 2\nor 3K jog all the way up to 30 40K long\nrun this is going to lock after your\nlegs really well you can use it for some\nspeed sessions some threshold sessions\nsome Park runs of course there's better\noptions out there but if you rock up to\nthe sessions you got this on your feet\nit's not a bad thing and you just get\nyour run down absolutely fine but as\nalways here on the channel we will talk\nabout those dislikes with the shoe so\nlet's come on to those now the first\ndislike with the shoe and it really\nunfortunately carries on I actually\nthink it's a little bit worse even than\nthe version 4 model is the wet weather\ngrip with aex I don't know what's going\non with the shoe it's something that\neverybody knows about surely they know\nabout they've kept the same rubber it's\na slightly different pattern on the\nbottom of the shoe but this is really\nquite slippy I've taken it out a few\ntimes in the evenings around which it's\na bit wet a bit of moisture on the floor\nabout 8 9:00 at night and you're just\nsliding around all over the place I'm\nnot going to be running in this shoe in\nthe wet weather this for me is going to\nbe something I'm only going to use in a\nnice dry environment hopefully the TR\nversion which is their trail version of\nthe shoe which is normally a really good\nwinter running option will be along soon\nthere's no talk about that at the moment\neverything's identical the upper the mid\nsole it's just a different bottom of the\nshoe and it's a really good winter\nrunning option but for me this the grip\nis just surprisingly bad for how good\nthe rest of the shoe is just another\ncouple of things to have a chat about\nthey're just observations there might be\nlikes they might be disliked I'm not\nsure which Camp they fit into you let me\nknow how they affect you but the first\nthing to have a chat about is the foam\nthis is certainly a lot softer than the\noutgoing model but it's got a good\namount of response and a good amount of\nBounce in here as well you do get used\nto it quite quickly so if you enjoyed\nthe slightly firmer ride of version 4\nthen that's probably going to be one to\nstick with if you are looking for a\nlittle bit more of a softer ride that's\ngoing to absorb the impact a little bit\nbetter but still give you that\nresponsiveness and that Poppin that\nbounciness then this is going to be a\nreally welcome upgrade for you my other\nlittle observation here is the width\nwith the shoe the fit is going to be a\nlot better for wider footed Runners it's\ndefinitely on the wide side now they're\nnot releasing this as far wear in a wide\noption but if you have a particularly\nnarrow foot this might be too wide for\nyou and it might be one to avoid so\nlet's move on to my conclusions and\nfinal thoughts do I recommend this shoe\nI really do I've enjoyed putting some\nearly Mars in this shoe yes I probably\nlike the slightly firmer ride of version\n4 and I would say if you really like\nthat then go and buy another version 4\nbut more than happy with the slightly\nsofter ride that this one's giving is it\nworth the upgrade well probably\npersonally no because I like that's like\nthat slightly fair right but I would\nstill recommend it for the vast majority\nof people so who should buy the Nova\nblast version 5 someone looking for a\ngreat onoe option this is why this shoe\nabsolutely sings someone doesn't want to\nspend hundreds of pounds buying a big\nshoe rotation that's what one shoe\nwithout breaking the bank to do it all\nreally well and that's why I've always\nfind myself recommending the Nova blast\ncuz it just ticks that box so well for\nme it's the best shoe on the market\ncurrently offering that so will I be\nkeeping this shoe well I think 100% yes\nI don't always want to put the mileage\non my super brass 2 and this shoe is\njust perfect for those shorter those\nmedium type runs it's got enough pop in\nit for suddenly fanasy picking up the\npace doing a bit more of a fart Leck run\nwhen I'm out there doing some faster\nsurges this has got me covered so let me\nknow your thoughts on the ASX no last\nversion 5 down in the comments what do\nyou think about it are you getting it\nare you interested in it have you tried\nit help out the community and let every\nknow your thoughts we have got the\nAdidas Evo SL coming in very soon we\nhave some comparison videos with that\nthe novablast 5 and also the super Blast\n2 they're going to be over on the second\nChannel very soon and the full added as\nevsl review will be dropping here in a\nfew days so get subscribed to that\nthanks very much everybody please check\nout my website benp parks.com and keep\non working hard keep on getting it done\nand I'll see you very soon in the next\none",

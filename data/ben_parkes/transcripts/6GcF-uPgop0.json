people\nalways ask when we come and do these\nraces how did you get in I actually ran\na qualifying time if you can run under\n245 in a marathon then you get a\nguaranteed entry like a fast runner\nentry into Berlin around 243 I think in\nLondon not this year but the year before\nand I could use that to get a entry into\nthis race so you just enter it's\nguaranteed you pay your money to get in\nand it's quite cool if you're a fast\nrunner you get right up at the front so\njust behind the elites and like the\nfirst sort of Corral a so you get a\nreally good start as well right let's go\nget a number German English uh English\nis easier English okay perfect they\nprint the numbers on the day it comes\nout comes out the little printers just\nhere starting number for tomorrow

some pants\nI want to see that just got my saw\nshorts I have been chatting to saw about\npotentially making some shorts because\nso many of you guys want these shorts\nwith the logo on and they are fantastic\nhopefully we'll do something with that\nin the new year and then a spare battery\ncuz you don't want the camera to run out\nduring the race and the body Glide uh\nwhich we use to the start line and I\nthink that's everything anything else to\nchat about Sarah don't think so\nhere we\n[Music]\ngo all right good morning every we're\nhere at the start it's about 8:00 in the\nmorning what a

the\nnext 30\n[Music]\nall guys time for the first C\ndown going more than 160\ntoday 40 minutes\nin never easy\n[Music]\ntoday all right guys\nhalfway 122 just said 122 and you're not\ngoing to\nlie the last 5K felt pretty tough so\nmight not been enough mileage of my\ntraining but not particularly looking\nforward to the second half now this is\nfeeling far too tough what I thought it\nwould be this stage but it we see going\nto grind it out and get it done come\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\non take two of the Legends with\nvolunteers out here today making the\nburlin marathon happen so many thousands\nof people that come together to get\npeople around this course and that's me3\n30k absolutely heading the W big St\nthere's really no substitute for mileage\nsort of 780k a week is not enough for\nnow just need to get myself to the\nFinish\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nkeep pushing\nback all right guys we're coming up to a\npark run today 5K today and yeah it's\nbeen a fun race but incredibly tough\nrace far harder than I was hoping for\nunfortunately but we never give up we\nalways got it done you's got to have the\nlows if you have the highs at the end of\nthe day we're out here running a\nmarathon and that should never be taken\nfor granted I'm very lucky to do what I\ndo going to push the last five for you\nguys get\n[Music]\nhere we go\nguys running through the

going very well\nSarah 3% battery with 85% uploaded so\nalways working hard wher we are we got\nto catch our flight about 10:00 this\nevening feeling a lot better now like my\nbody feels absolutely fine it just did\nnot have the fitness but I have tried a\nlot of new things in my training a lot\nof lower mileage but still getting a lot\nof intensity and a lot of gym work in\nthere and quite clearly today it just\nspectac has not worked I'm trying to see\nthe positive side of things so yeah no\nno real worries just going to go back to\nmy my regular wear training now for the\nleadup to Valencia which I'm really\nexcited for and going to get more of\nthose 130 140k weeks I think my biggest\nweek recently has been about\n75k and that's probably good for a sub\nthree hour marathon which is what I did\ntoday so I can't really complain I just\nwanted to try something different and\nyeah I don't have like a load of stack\nof natural Talent I'm just a regular guy\nand I can't supplement that high mileage\nwith anything else other than high\nmileage so that's what we going back for\nreally excited for that be back in the\ngym doing loads of strength work as well\nwell next time you see us we're heading\noff to Australia to come and meet a load\nof you amazing people out there and of\ncourse a quick shout out to Philly who\nran a 225 another YouTuber give her a\nfollow

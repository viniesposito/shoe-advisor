  "text": "2024 has been a really strong year for\nrunning shoes I've Loved buying and\ntesting the latest offerings from all of\nthe big Brands and I've seen some really\ngreat shoes that have really surprised\nme with what they were offering the bar\ngets higher and higher each year and the\nability to stand out gets that little\nbit harder well today I've got my top\nthree shoes that have really surprised\nme and overd delivered on what I was\nexpecting them to do and of course as\nalways here on the channel I've got a\ncouple of other options that I was\nreally pumped up and really excited for\ntheir latest updates and then were just\na bit of a let down so definitely worth\navoiding as with everything we do here\non the channel I bought all of these\nshoes 100% with my own money to give you\nthat completely honest and biased review\nif you're watching this video in the\nfirst few days then it will be our Black\nFriday weekend we're having a big Black\nFriday sale a sale we like to do every\nyear we're offering a huge 20% off\neverything sitewide all our running hats\nour technical gear our long sleeves our\ncasual gear our hoodies and our fstar\nrated training plans so if you fanc\ntreating yourself bf20 at checkout will\nget you 20% off thank you so much to\neveryone that supports the channel and\nallowing us to buy these shoes test\nthese shoes and give you those\ncompletely honest and partial reviews it\nmeans so much to myself and Sarah right\nlet's start out with a couple of the bad\nones the first one being the Nike\nPegasus version 41 41 years to hopefully\nget this right but it's still not quite\nthere I super pumped what I heard this\nnew version was coming out with an\nupdated foone a better upper and I\nthought finally Nike going to release a\ndaily shoe that is going to be a\nfantastic running shoe that we can\nrecommend but sadly it really did fall\nshort as I say this is Nike's classic\ndaily trainer at what they deem is more\nof that affordable price point stack out\nof the back 37 mil 10 mm drop overall\nthey whacked up the price unfortunately\nas well now costing \u00a31 130 definitely\nnot that entrylevel budget sh anymore\nbut in that sort of Middle Ground here\nwith some really stiff competition\nWeight Wise a little bit on the chunky\nside 340 7 G mesh this engineered mesh\nupper which to be fair was actually not\ntoo bad the updated midso which is\nreally what I was hoping to get a little\nbit of Zoom X in here would have been\nnice but no it was just the react X\nmidsole keeping those airpods in there\nthe ride is still pretty harsh and firm\nwhat is really good is the outsole\nreally good waffle outsole very\nhardwearing and it was true to scis of\nme and it was really good to see they\noffered it in a wide fit as well now\nthere's no doubt about it the react X\nfoam update here was a a lot better than\nversion 40 we've got a bit of extra\nstack in this shoe as well it's a\nslightly softer ride but it's still\npretty harsh out there upper really\nreally good good lock down really good\nComfort shoe nice wide toe box and a\nstable ride with the shoe as well and as\nI just mentioned fantastic durability\nwith this shoe but kind of where this\nreally fell short for me was just that\nbig price hike there just much better\ncompetitors out there at this price the\nNova blast the Mac Nike's very own Vero\na much better running shoe and only a\nsmidge more in price here and they're\njust far better running shoes overall\nbetter Foams far more responsive this is\njust really quite slow these airpods in\nthis foam is just doing just very little\nwork for me and I'd much rather be out\nthere in one of those other offerings\njust minimal energy return not much\nbounce with this one and it just has\nthat feeling of feeling quite dead\nunderfoot for me it quickly became a gym\nand Casual shoe only and I spent a lot\nof time in casually really comfortable\ngoing to the gym walking around town\nwhatever traveling around really good\nshoe for that sort of thing and of\ncourse you can go for a running if you\nhave to but it's definitely not the one\nI would be picking it's going to be\nreally interesting to see what happens\nnext year with the shoe can Nike really\ncall this a running shoe anymore the\nvomero that Nike offer is just so much\nbetter yes it's a little bit more\nexpensive it's a real sleeper of the\nrange V get version 18 here on the\nchannel hopefully come around about\nJanuary time in for a review so get\nsubscribed for that but that's where\nI'll be putting money for a Nike daily\nshoe the Pegasus plus is a little bit\nmore expensive yes it has that full\nzoomx midso which is really good also\nfantastic Comfort option and I sure I'd\nrecommend it has that good ground feel\nthat you get with this but it's got that\nresponsiveness and that Popp so again a\nmuch better option but I fully admit\nNike can't really win with a shoe I\ndon't know what Nike's bestselling shoe\nis but it could well be this one so many\npeople just want a Dependable shoe they\ncan work casually go to the gym go to\nthe shops do a couple of runs in a\nweekend and it would be fine and they're\nnot that worried about how far fast they\ngo and it does that but in 2024 for me\nthis just does not cut it as a running\nshoe anymore and definitely not since\nthe price T at least when it was around\nabout100 you can say well it's really\nnot too bad at that price point but now\nit's up here go verom Mero go M go Nova\nblast in this price range or if you\nreally do want to get this then just\nknow that it has its drawbacks with it's\nrunning you can't really pick up the\npace you certain want to be racing it\nthe thought of racing a marathon\nsomething like this would be absolutely\ncrazy but yeah good looking shoe for the\ngym and that occasional runin if you\nreally want to you can get it done I've\njust purchased the gortex version of\nthis Sarah's just kindly passed to me\nyou give me the wrong side I like to\nhold it here we'll hold it that way\naround the gortex version which I'm not\nexpecting much from but yeah it could be\na good winter daily training shoe some\nreally good Nike storm tread on the\nbottom there right coming in from the\nside the next one here which is a lovely\nlightweight shoe and I really wanted to\nlike this this is the Hoka ringcon\nversion 4 I was a big fan of the first\nthree versions of Hoka ringcon again a\nreally good budget offering in one two\nand three something I'd really like to\nrecommend to people getting into the\nsport or someone that wanted that\nuptempo lightweight trainer to do some\nsessions in a ringcom was a really good\nbet at a fantastic price point but for\nme version 4 just has not delivered a\nspectacular fail when you're comparing\nit to the earlier three versions how\nhooker really Market the ringcon it's\njust that entry level beginner daily\ntrainer or for more of an advanced\nRunner that's going to build a big\nrotation or something something you can\ncan definitely do a lot of speed working\nand things like that shorter distances\n5Ks 10ks and half marathons at most\nstack cut at the back 33 mil with a 5 mm\ndrop set me back around about 100\u00a3 110\nfor this super lightweight that is one\nthing that's definitely going for this\nshoe just 280 G for me in my UK size 12\nwe've got this jackard mesh upper here\nreally not too bad but not too great\nwe'll come on to that in a bit the\nmidsole with this shoe this is really\nwhere it's starting to let the side down\nthis injection molded Eva mids sole yeah\nit's hard to get an exciting midsole\ndefinitely at this price point but\nunfortunately it has a real dead feeling\nout soole it kind of doesn't really have\na rubber out soole it's this purple\nsection at the bottom of shoe here it's\njust this mix of this rubberized Eva\nblend sizing was Dreadful in the shoe\ndefinitely it runs very very small go at\nleast half a size up I think I'd\nprobably go a whole size up in the shoe\nit comes in much shorter than my other\nhookah shoes and other brands as well so\nas I said I was really excited when\nversion for was coming out that wallet\nfriendly price it was a shoe I'd always\nfind myself recommending to other people\nanyone getting into the sport or just\nsomeone looking for that lightweight\nSpeedy simple shoe without a plate just\nwanted that more traditional ride and\nthat's what it offered that lightweight\nengaging ride decent size toe box at the\nfront of the shoe as well and it meant\nyou could run longer in the shoe and it\nhad a good sort of that spacious upper\nunfortunately that's kind of all gone\nwith version 4 so where does version 4\nfall short for me well the foam is now\nvery stiff and very firm as well the\nsizing as I say just way off you need at\nleast to go half a size up maybe even a\nfull size and the fit is definitely a\nlot narrower than version 3 and it's\nreally on the narrow side hooker shoes\ntend to be a little bit on the narrow\nside and there's just not enough room in\nthe tow box here there's just not enough\nheight in the toe box there's not enough\nwidth in the toe box it's just a very\nnarrow fit I know this shoe came in\nsmall even if it was exactly the right\nsize and I had gone half a size or full\nsize I still just feel this is a very\ncompact space so getting some heel slip\nin the shoe the lock down just is just\nnot great as standard you can actually\njust slide them off completely easily\nwhen they are well I could and I tied\nthem up quite tight and you can just\ntake them straight off whenever I do get\nsome heel sh with a shoe I'd always try\nthat heel lock lacing that you can do if\nyou see me doing on the screen here just\nto get a much better lock down but the\ntongue is just so weirdly short on this\nshoe that you can't really you can just\nabout do it it did cure the heel slip so\nit does work but I say the tongue is\njust so short the ring con has never\nbeen a shoe that has been now for\ndurability they've never had a rubber\nout so on here they get rid of it to\nmake it nice and lightweight and I do\nappreciate that it's really good to have\nthat nice lightweight feel but just know\nwith something like this you're not\ngoing to get very good durability which\nI think a lot of beginner Runners and\npeople at this sort of price point\nthey're just looking for that good value\nfor money just unfortunately don't\nexpect this to last very long but it's\nnot all bad there are a couple of good\nthings with this shoe to have a chat\nabout it is lightweight and when you get\nup to speed as you can see here here I'm\nrunning around about 320 A K Pace it\ndoes feel really nice and smooth some\npeople are going to like that extra\nstiffness and firmness and it does\nreally work at speed but just other\nPaces easy Pace recovery Pace slower\nPace running it's just a bit clunky just\na bit wearing just a bit grating just\nwith How firm it is but when you really\nwant to engage it and pick up the speed\nit actually is quite Pleasant to run in\ndare I say so who could this type of\nshoe work for as say if you're an\nexperienced Runner you're building up a\nbig shoe rotation this could work it's a\nnice Tempo shoe it's light and it's\nsmooth at speed but as an entry level\nall round shoe it's really really misses\nthe mark for me if you want to stick in\nthe hoker range you much better looking\nat the Mac which is so much better at\nall Paces much better out soole so much\nmore comfortable or even the Clifton\nwhich isn't the best shoe in the world\nbut it's got fantastic durability with\nthat shoe as well there are much better\noptions if you only got around1 to spend\ntry and get a Mac or a Clifton on\ndiscount or something like that that's\ngoing to serve you much better but I'm\nnot just criticizing it because the\nprice point it's cheap and H have to\nhave some cheap materials at this price\npoint because Adidas delivered an\nabsolutely stunning shoe this year when\nthey bought out the SL2 it was so good\nwhen I had it earlier in this year just\nthat classic daily trainer from Adidas\nmuch more of affordable price point than\nthe Boston 36 mil stack height 9 mm drop\noverall I think I paid just High 90s for\nthis shoe against an RP of around about\n110 super lightweight 287 G for me and\nreally enjoyed picking up the Pace in\nthe shoe because of that lightweightness\nlovely engineered mesh upper pretty\nbreathable there as well midso this is\nwhere the shoe really starts to come\nalive you got a lovely layer of the\nLight Strike Pro Adidas's premium foam\nhere for that responsiveness that\nbounciness that Popp and it's sandwiched\ntogether between two layers of the Light\nStrike 2.0 for added durability to make\nsure it lasts outs soole we haven't got\nAdidas's famous Continental grip here\nbut you've just got Adidas's standard\nrubber out soole and it was pretty damn\ngood good and very good at this price\npoint sizing rise it did run a little\nbit small as well if you're un sure go\nthat half a size up for me my UK size 12\nit was just about okay but I'd really\nRec going half a size up so what I was\ngenuinely so surprised about this shoe\nis I sort of get the impression a lot of\nManufacturers just don't really care\nabout their entry level shoes anymore\nthey just want every spending as much as\npossible going for that mid-range that \u00a3\n150 for that doit all type of running\nshoe but Adidas s of ripped up the rule\nbook there and they gave us really \u00a3150\nver of value for \u00a3100 in my opinion\nAdidas are really quite renowned for\ndelivering some good value out there and\nthis one is an absolute Blinder the\nversion before this the SL1 was just\nwhat you'd expect for an entry-level\nrunning shoe hard foam cheap materials\nand just a bit boring and Bland so I\nreally was not expecting much when we\ngot the SL2 in but it was a huge\nImprovement pretty much exactly the same\nat Price Point as well and when I was\ntesting the shoe and running along in it\nI just had to keep reframing my\nreference point of I bought this shoe\nfor less than 100 00 that's absolutely\ncrazy so the standout features of this\nshoe that layer of that all premium foam\nin here at this price point just does\nnot happen usually Foams in this price\npoint are so dull and unresponsive but\nwhat added us have done with sandwiching\nit together between that Durable foam\nand then that Poppy foam in the middle\nit's just a combination that works so\nwell and the fact they've managed to do\nall that and still really decrease the\nweight of the shoe now for me at 287 G\nagain really surprising but really good\nto see as well also what I was really\nsurprised about was just how good that\nadded ass grip was oh it would be nice\nto see the content of grip you can't\nhave everything for \u00a398 just in the\ncornering felt really nice and I could\nreally trust it and also the versatility\nof this shoe you can do everything in\nthis shoe I'd happily race in this shoe\nI'd have to use some reps in the shoe\nI'd have to use some thresholds some\ntempos some easy runs some recovery runs\nit will do it all pretty well I\npersonally wouldn't want to run a\nmarathon I'd rather have some plates in\nthere and spend a little bit more money\nand have a shoe that's going to look\nafter my legs a little bit better and be\na little bit more responsive in those\nvery long runs but yeah you really can't\ngo wrong I really think for a lot of\npeople this is a really good daily shoe\nwithout breaking the bank yes if you\nwant to spend a bit more and have the\ntech and some of the things like the\nBoston has then yeah no problem doing\nthat at all but if you're just looking\nfor that daily non nonsense shoe this is\nwhere the SL2 comes in so who is the SL2\nbest for well someone looking for that\nbudget friendly shoe they can wear on\ntheir shorish runs in their training 5K\n10ks half marathons training for those\ndistances racing those distances you'll\nbe absolutely fine if you got a\nparticularly wider foot it's probably\ngoing to be one to avoid right we're\nback to hoker they did provide a really\ngood shoe this year so we better get\nstuck into that now it's the skywood X\nwe got the skywood X in earlier on this\nyear and I really was not expecting much\nversus the ringcon for example when I\nsuper hyped for it because the version\nbefore have been really good and that\nwas a bit of a let down this one the\nshoe that came before the Bondi X it now\ngot renamed to Skyward X was so bad one\nof the worst shoes I've ever reviewed\nhere on the channel this thing came in\nand absolutely delivered a fantastic\nshoe really enjoyed running it really\nsurprised with how good it is and I've\njust kept going out in it for those easy\nthose recovery runs or those long runs\nwhen I just want to look after my legs\nso this set me back\n\u00a3185 so yeah a little bit on the\nexpensive side the purpose of shoe like\nthis long runs easy runs and Recovery\nruns stack kite an absolute whopping 48\nmm stack kite 5 mm drop overall the high\nstack height shoe I've ever reviewed\nhere on the channel Weight Wise yeah\nit's a big shoe no doubt 378 G for me in\nmy UK size 12 the upper of the shoe\nwe've got this flat knit sort of a bit\nof a sock likee upper at the front\npretty breathable not too bad midso wise\nwe've got this Jewel layer of peba and\nEva Eva for that durability peba for\nthat responsiveness that Poppin that\nbounciness there's a lot of bounciness\nin this shoe outsole wise these yellow\npads here on the bottom of the shoe that\nhigh abasan Rubber outsole and it's it's\nwearing pretty good so far I'm up to\nabout 80 mil in this shoe 0 very happy\nmiles I must say and the sizing was true\nto size for me so why was this shoe a\nbig surprise well I say it replaced the\nBondi X which was just a really bad shoe\nin my opinion one of my personal worst\nthe bonday X was such a weird\ncombination of out ofd Foams with a\ncarbon plate on a shoe that was just\nrenowned for very very easy days really\nhad some bad heel slipping issues as\nwell and he just felt really dead and so\nreally no purpose for anyone and then in\ncomes the Skyward X this whole new\ncomplete redesign with the shoe massive\nstack kite which is absolutely crazy and\ndespite the waking bulk it's really fun\nto run in it's also super soft and plush\nas well there's a lot of travel in the\nfoam here thank goodness they put that\ncarbon plate in there that's not really\nfor allout Speed it's adding a lot of\nstability in the shoe which is\ndefinitely what it needs with this\namount of foam and it otherwise you'd\njust be wallowing all over the place so\njust a combination that holds it all\ntogether really quite well and this shoe\nis supremely comfortable as well had\nabsolutely no issues in this shoe\ndefinitely been using it for my second\nrun of the day or some like a Monday\nshoe when I've had a Sunday long run and\nwhen I go on a Monday and just look\nafter my legs this is the shoe I've been\nreaching for legs feeling like they're\nrecovering as they're going along with\nall of that foam absorbing the impact\njust looking after them really really\nwell so who is the Hocus skyex best for\nit's definitely great for heavier\nRunners anyone that's worried about\nbottoming out foam and things like that\nyou're really not going to do that in\ntheir shoe good for those slower runs\nanyone wanting to run a very long way at\na nice casual easy run pace and just\nwants that super comfortable soft shoe\nto look after their legs for a very long\ntime I really think there's not much\nbetter out there at the moment than the\nsky deex massively surprised me bought a\nsmile to my face and really delivered\nand finally here on the list we have the\nNike zoomfly 6 another really surprising\nshoe replacing the zoomfly 5 which I\nreally did not rate zoomly 6 came out\nand I was like oh do I have to but this\nhas been an absolute Joy I've just put\nmy 100 M review up of this shoe and yeah\ngave it a lot of High Praise as well so\nthe purpose of the zoomfly 6 this is\nyour everyday race shoe a training shoe\nto their top end racer like the training\nversion of the alphafly for Speed runs\nfor long runs you do some sessions your\nTempo your thresholds you can even go\nfor an easy jog in it it's not the best\nshoe for that easy and Recovery jog it's\nreally one you want to put on your feet\nto go fast to get your workouts done in\nand you can rock up on race day and have\na really good time as well stack cut at\nthe back 42 mil and an 8 mm drop overall\nprice-wise \u00a3 1555 pretty damn good Nike\noffering some good value here weightwise\n322 G not heavy but not light either\njust sort of nicely in the middle upper\nwe've got this two layer wov mesh upper\nmidsole wise we've got a zoom X layer of\nmidsole which is exactly the same foam\nthey put in their high-end ratio shoes\nthe VAP flies and the outfly that layer\nof zoomx Mile for that responsive that\nPopp then a carbon plate and then an Eva\nlayer underneath that again Eva for that\ndurability and the carbon plate in there\nwhich you can't feel too much but it's\ndefinitely providing a lot of Popp as\nyou run along outso wise again really\ngood a nice solid layer of waffle here\nwhich I really appreciate they could\nhave definitely skimped on this and made\nthe shoe a bit lighter but this is a\ntraining shoe it's not all about that\nlightweightness with your training\nfantastic grip really good durability\nafter 100 miles in their shoe and the\nsizing was true to size for me so why\nwas this a big surprise but I say the\nzoomfly 5 was just a bit of a flop shoe\nfor me and I'm guessing for Nike as well\nbecause I didn't see any positive\nreviews really about it maybe one or two\npeople it kind of worked for some\nheavier Runners out there because there\nwasn't much choice but it was just so\ndead I had a lot of foam in it and I had\na carbon plate in it but incredibly\nheavy as well I really feel like they\nlistened to a lot of the feedback with\nwhat people are wanting on a shoe like\nthis they've got rid of that hard D\nrecycled foam and replaced it with a\nhuge slab of the Nike's premium zoomx\nand the Eva for that training durability\nas well made it 10% lighter so I was\nreally surprised when I unboxed this\nshoe despite not thinking it was the\nprettiest shoe in the world I was really\nexcited to get on my feet and it really\ndelivered the standout features for me\nreally good value \u00a3 155 for a shoe this\ngood is fantastic to have that premium\nfoam and the carbon plate at at this\nprice point is pretty rare and then when\nyou compare it to something like the\nPegasus plus which is even more\nexpensive this without that carbon plate\nit really is that training shoe for the\ntype of people want a bit more ground\ncontact feel and don't want that plated\nride in there but again it's a lot more\nexpensive than this this is why this is\ndelivering so much value for me\nspeed-wise incredibly fast I've been\nwearing this for most of my interval\nsessions and my long run sessions I've\nreally been surprised at the pace I'm\ngetting versus the effort that I'm\nputting in of course the alphafly is\ngoing to be a little bit faster but I\ndon't feel like oh I wish I was out here\nmy Ally because I'm saving a lot of\nmoney by not wearing out the alha Flies\nbut this shoe's just been super\ncomfortable as well I'd happily run a\nmarathon in this shoe and you don't want\nto spend the big money on those V flies\nAl flies you can happily get a marathon\ndone in their shoe in comfort knowing\nthat you've got something that's just\n90% as good as something like the vfly\nairly and save that 100 plus pounds so\nwho is the Doom fly 6 best for anyone\nlooking for that durable comfortable\nshoe they can wear for their speed work\nthose longer runs and also races when\nthey don't want to break the bank with\nsomething like the super shoes that we\ndo see nowadays or if you do have a pair\nof those Super Shoes and you don't want\nto wear them out too much in your\ntraining this is a great trainer option\nyou can save those very best ones for\nrace day so that's my list of my most\nsurprising shoes of 2024 the good and\nthe bad let me know your ones down in\nthe comments below we've got our\ncomplete biggest best shoes of the

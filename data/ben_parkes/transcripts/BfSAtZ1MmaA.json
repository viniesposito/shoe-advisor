  "text": "hello everybody and welcome back to the\nchannel and welcome to Boston I'm here\nfor the\n128th Boston Marathon in a couple of\ndays I am beyond excited potentially\nhopefully I'm sure we will be completing\nmy fifth ever major on Monday my first\nBoston the nerves and the excitement are\nbuilding so so much just absolutely\npumped we taking part in this legendary\nrace one of the most famous running\nraces anywhere in the world here we've\ngot a actionpack video for you coming up\ntoday we're going to be going to the\nExpo talking about my kit got a big\nShakeOut run to go to and of course all\nmy goals and expectations for the race\nbut for now it's Saturday morning I've\njust keyed in a 10k run into my watch\nand we heading out for a little ShakeOut\njog we got here quite late last night\nI'm a little bit jetlagged but overall\nsuper excited for this and thank you\nguys you make this all possible for me\nto come and run races like this but\nthank you so much we'll catch up out on\nthe Run\n[Music]\nthat is the Run done 10K 44 minutes a\nlittle bit faster we did have a few GPS\nissues with all the to building TR here\nso probably more like 45 minutes let's\nuh have a quick shower and get up to the\nExpo really enjoyed that what a lovely\nplace to\n[Music]\nrun right guys here we go we made it\ndown to the Expo super excited we pick\nit right now I've been treat me of this\nfor so many years taking my running\nseriously for I don't know about 10\nyears or so and yeah I've run quite a\nfew big qes over the years but it's\nnever really panned out to actually get\nhere and come and pick up my number and\nrun the race I just get my phone out and\njust see what number I am we are\n1,8 right oh we're right here let's go\nhave a look hi afternoon how you doing\ngood here's your runner's bag thank you\nall right congratulations for your first\nmarathon thanks very much thank you\nthank you\n[Music]\njust heading through all the merch area\nnow at the moment it's just absolutely\ncrazy uh but a little bit overpriced for\nus the jackets are\n$120 oh we don't want to go in the\ncheckout we're not buying a thing if you\ndon't know about Boston to get into the\nmarathon I I actually don't even know\nwhat race are you to get in but you have\nto run qualifying time so about four\nfths about sort of 80% of the field will\nhave run that qualifying time to get\ninto the race for people in like 18 to\n35 men you've got to run a sub three\nhour and then go a little bit faster\nthan that as well because it's just the\nfastest around about 30 35,000 people\nthat do the race that actually sort of\nget in and uh yeah the other sort of\nfifth of people are all sorts of like\nsponsor places or people doing\nInternational tour operating places that\nsort of things so you don't have to\ntechnically run the bigy\nbut Myers you kind of should do really\nkind of it's what it's all about running\nyour BQ and coming here to\n[Music]\ncelebrate Sarah now you're on this side\nof me you can speak into the microphone\nhow excited are you for the London\nMarathon exp spr next weekend yes I'm\nvery\nexcited I know that doesn't sound like I\nam but I am excited you've got the\ncontrast of me and Sarah but uh yeah\nwe'll be at London Marathon Expo next\nweekend uh we've got a stand there so be\nweek next whole week Wednesday Thursday\nFriday

really\nlooking forward to it and uh yeah can't\nwait to see you guys there\n[Music]\nso on this massive board behind me is\nthe list of six star finishes I'll\nhopefully be joining them soon um if I\nfinish Boston I don't to keep saying\nthat I'm sure we'll finish Boston on\nMonday but uh you never know with me\nlet's be honest um then I'll only have\nTokyo to do which we may try and do next\nyear I have got in touch with a couple\nof the travel companies I've tried to\nget in so many times just one of those\nthings it's all a bit complicated I\ndon't really know but I am hopefully\ngoing to be trying my ab\nto get into Tokyo Marathon next year so\nwe can finish it off and get my six star\nfinish probably before it goes to Seven\nStars um and then we'll have to go to\nSydney to finish that one off everyone\ngetting their norm tech legs done\ngetting nice and recovered before Monday\nit's keeps see so weird to say the RAC\nis on Monday but yeah Patriots Day

we're\njust going to head out up the road here\nso you might see behind me because that\nis the Finish Line Of The B marathon\nwhere we will be on uh Monday so yeah\nreally excited for that anyway

any\nof those in the UK they're not coming to\nthe UK anyway but uh as a car fanatic\nprobably one of my biggest Hobbies it's\nuh quite nice to see my first cyber\n[Music]\nTru right walking back through the\nFinish Line what is going to be on the\nclock when we cross that well I don't\nknow I have I get my excuses out the way\nfirst but I had about 5 weeks off\nrunning in February with a hamstring\nlike strain which was really rubbish so\nI haven't really done any workouts this\nyear my mileage has been all right but\nright here right now apart from Rolling\nmy ankle a bit this morning on this\nmorning's run um we're kind of okay so\nI'll take anything on a sub 250 will be\na really good run I'm here just to have\na laugh make a good video experience\nHeartbreak Hill and just experience the\nmass magic of the race all my big\ntraining will be focused on Valencia at\nthe end of the year just want to have an\namazing experience out there so yeah sub\n250 Happy Days with that I'll set off a\nlittle bit faster and just see see how\nwe go but I've really got no idea to be\nhonest cuz I haven't been done any\nproper long workouts my longest run so\nfar this year is about 25k so yeah we'll\n[Music]\n[Music]\nsee so we're going to go and grab some\nlunch and we'll see you in the morning\nfor the ShakeOut run really looking\nforward to that but yeah need to get\nsome uh good fuel inside those Newton\nHills Heartbreak Hill I'm not going to\nget up that alone so we need to get some\ngood fuel into these legs for the next\ncouple of days so I hope you follow\nenjoyed

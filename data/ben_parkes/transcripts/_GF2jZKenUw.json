  "text": "this is the Nike zoomfly version 6\nNike's latest hybrid training and racing\nshoe there's so much hype around the\nshoe with some bold claims about the\nsubstantial improvements versus the\noutgoing version 5 version 5 was a flop\nfor so many Runners overweight bulky and\nslow and Nike have really been losing\nthe ground in this super trainer segment\nwith other brands really upping their\ngame recently but in comes the zoomfly\nversion 6 at a competitive price big\nupdates and a bold redesign as well so\nis it a return to form for zoomfly or\nare Nike going to miss the Mark again\nwell I'm really excited to bring you\nthis video now before we start I bought\nthis shoe 100% with my own money as we\ndo with everything here on the channel\nto give you my completely unbiased and\nhonest review thank you so much to\neveryone that likes and shares our\nvideos and also check out my website\nbenp parks.com where you can find\nawesome training plans new technical\nte's the best running hats anywhere in\nthe world to help with your running\nthousands of five-star reviews and we\nShi to all around the world feel free to\nuse code youtube1 for 10% off your order\nright let's get started with the Nike\nZoom Flight version 6 going through all\nthe differences between this and the\noutgoing version 5 we'll put up what the\nversion 5 looks like up on the screen\nnow as you can see there's been some big\ndesign changes here version 5 had that\nrecycled Zoom X foam and an Eva blend in\nthere but now we've got a ful length\nslab of Nike's Flagship Zoom X foam with\nan EVA foam underneath it a really nice\nupdate we've got a completely redesign\nupper to the shoe here as well it's now\n10% lighter the version 5 was so\noverweight it really was quite a heavy\nshoe and we've now also got a slightly\nhigher stack height a little bit more\nfoam underneath the shoe to increase\nthat puppiness that responsiveness but\nit's also unfortunately 10 SS more\nexpensive right let's get stuck into all\nof the facts and figures so the purpose\nof a shoe like this this is your\neveryday race shoe there a Shoe that is\ndesigned to get your key Training\nworkouts in and also that one that you\ncan rock up to a race and feel like\nyou've got a really good shoe on the\nbottom of your feet pricewise this shoe\nsent me back\n\u00a355 ordering off the Nike website here\nin the UK 42 mm tack height so just\nabove that legal limit not that that\nworries the vast majority of Runners\nthey've got an 8 mm drop overall Weight\nWise this is coming for me at 322 G in\nmy UK size 12 the zoomfly 5 was 359 G\nper meter 37 G decrease around about 10%\nlighter the upper of the shoe we've got\ntwo layers of a woven mesh really hugs\nthe top of the foot really nicely it's\npartly gusseted and the tongue is\nstitched slightly into the upper but it\nreally does hold in place really quite\nnicely ly midsole wise on top here we've\ngot a layer of Nike's Zoom X Flagship\npeber based midsole stupidly not where\nit says zoomx where it says zoomx on the\nshoe that is where we have Nike's sro2\nEVA foam which is a lot more hardwearing\na lot more durable not quite as bouncy\nand Poppy so we got the poppy\nresponsiveness in the zoomx on the top\nand then that durability with the EVA\nfoam on the bottom there a really nice\nmix of the two we've got Nike's carbon\nfiber fly plate sandwich between those\ntwo Foams outsole wise we've got a\nrubber waffle type outsole here a big\nchunk of rubber at the front of the shoe\nhere and also two sections at the back\nof the shoe there for the heel Strikers\nreally great for some winter grip there\nare no different widths available at the\nmoment but there's a surprising amount\nof width in this shoe so if you are a\nrunner with slightly wider feet you\ndon't need to worry about this one there\nare different men's and women's versions\navailable personally I quite like this\nblack colorway and really nice pairing\nit with my all new longsleeve technical\nrunning tea available on Ben parks.com\nperfect for that autum and winter\ntraining as I said feel free to use code\nYouTube 10 I went for the exactly the\nsame size as I've going in for the\nalphafly and also the Pegasus turbo and\nthe regular Pegasus all fitting very\nvery similarly right let's get stck into\nall of my likes my first like with this\nshoe it has a brilliant comfort and\nspeed ratio the heel counter at the back\nof the shoe it's got a good amount of\npadding for that really nice lockdown no\nissues at all with any slippage no\nblisters no hot spots the foot felt\nreally secure and there's no need for\nany heel lock lacing or anything like\nthat the plate that you get in the Zoom\nFlight isn't super stiff like the plate\nyou get in the vapor or the Ally the\nzoomly is a lot softer and a lot\nbouncier but not quite all out as fast\nand stiff as you get in the VAP and the\nalphafly the plate gives a lot of\nstability with the shoe but also a good\namount of speed in there as well I've\nbeen really surprised at the relative\neffort levels versus the pace I'm\ngetting out of the shoe it's just going\na lot faster than the effort I'm putting\nin so I've been really pleasantly\nsurprised and also think with the\nComfort levels that this shoe is\ndelivering it's also going to be a\nreally good option for those long runs\npicking up the pace marathon pace blocks\nsome easy Pace blocks or just a shoe\nthat you can wear for a very long time\nduring your marathon training coming on\nto my second Point here I did allude to\nit a little bit in the first one but\nit's just a surprisingly quick shoe the\nweight decrease here has been\nsignificant and it's very much welcomed\nit's always a big tick in my book the\nweight feels now right for this type of\nshoe The Rocker gives a lovely feeling\nthrough the footstrike and leads to a\nsuper smooth turnover as well here and I\nactually found myself looking forward to\nthe next rep some of these reps I'm\ndoing on the screen these were around\nabout 3 mid 325 km pace so quite fast\nreps here and I was like bring on the\nnext one I've really been enjoying\npicking up the pace in the shoe the\nmidsole mashup is really responsive and\nyou can cruise for a long time whatever\nPace you want to go at you can just dial\nit in and the shoe just goes out there\nand it gets it done my final like with\nthe shoe is the value not only the price\nbut it appears to be very wellb built it\ndoesn't necessarily look like the best\nquality shoe in the world but so far it\nlooks really durable really feel like\nit's been put together very well I'm\njust not sure I love the upper material\nhere but it works well it just doesn't\nlook quite right to me but it's\nperforming really quite nicely it may\nget a little bit hot in the summer but\nhow we are here in the winter the air\nflow through is actually quite nice\ncarbon plates at this price point are\nreally quite hard to find but at this\nsort of price point Nike have delivered\na really competitively priced shoe and\nit's 1010 cheaper than the Pegasus plus\nand that doesn't have a plate and for\nthe vast majority of people they're\ngoing to get a lot more value out of\nthis cheaper zoomfly version 6 it's a\nlot more versatile pick up the paast a\nlittle bit better it's going to look\nafter your legs a little bit better as\nwell and all right it's a lot faster\nshoe but it's not all smiles here as\nalways on the channel a couple of\ndislikes to take you through here the\nfirst one being in typical Nike sort of\nstyle it's a little bit noisy a lot of\nyou have commented on my Instagram when\nI put some shorter form content up about\nthe shoe so far it's just something to\nnote this waffle outsole grip is really\ngood when I've been testing it out in\nslightly wet conditions with some some\nleaves and things around to have\nabsolutely no issues with any sort of\nslippage or anything like that so a\ngreat winter training option but just to\nnote it is a little bit on the noisy\nside it's not very necessarily Slappy at\nall just a little bit loud and my second\ndislike with this shoe again it hasn't\nreally affected me but the rear\nstability of the shoe might put off some\nheel Strikers if you are striking at the\nback of the shoe it's just going to be a\nlittle bit unstable through the foot\nstrike again I'm a midfoot striker so\nit's been absolutely fine for me but\nmaybe something to consider right let's\nbring this all together with some\nconclusions and my final thoughts do I\nrecommend the Nike Zoom 5 version 6 very\nmuch so it's been a really good update\nso well done from Nike finally\ndelivering a shoe that's nice and\nlightweight it's responsive it's\naffordable and it's comfortable as well\nand it'll be really good for a lot of\nRunners so is it worth the upgrade a\nmillion times yes this is light and day\nbetter than the outgoing model still if\nyou really like the outgoing model\nyou're like should I buy this it's all\nquite different I really think you would\none thing that was quite good on the\noutgoing model is it was particularly\ngood Sho for some heavier Runners\nthere's a lot of protection Beneath Your\nFeet here you've still got that here but\nit's just a nice lighter weight package\nbut it's not going to bottom out so it's\ngoing to be a really good option if you\nwere someone that liked the version 5\nand it can also Cruise along at that\nTempo that nice steady Pace as well so\nwho should be buying a shoe like this\nanyone really looking for that Do-it all\nshoe with a car carbon plate that wants\nand also longlasting highly durable race\nshoe that doesn't want to go out there\ncompletely breaking the bank I think a\nlot of people will get some serious\nvalue out of a shoe like this people\nmight think of themselves as maybe more\nof a mid Packer running isn't their\nentire life they don't want to spend\n\u00a3280 buying an alphafly only then have\nto pair it with another shoe before they\nknow it they're spending \u00a3500 thinking\nthis running sport is really not as\ncheap as it could be they could get\nsomething like this it's not going to\nhave that all out performance of an\nalpha fly or vapor fly but it's going to\ndo pretty damn well and at this price\npoint this could be a really good one\ndoit all shoe that can really pick up\nthe pace next week we've got a video\ncoming up all about the best race day\nshoes for regular Runners and I'm sure\nthis is going to fit you in there so get\nsubscribed for that that is coming up\nvery soon so check out this video up\nhere for our full 2024 Nike lineup and\ncheck out this video down here if you\nwant to see the full review of the\nPegasus plus thanks so much guys for\nfollowing along let me know your\nthoughts Down Below on this shoe will\nyou be getting it and what do you think\nabout it if you have been running it so\nfar that's it keep on working hard keep\non get done we'll see you very soon in\nthe next one",

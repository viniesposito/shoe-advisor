  "text": "if you are a heavier Runner with a\nlarger build you're going to need\nsomething on your feet that has the\nright balance of cushioning something\nsoft enough to be comfortable but firm\nenough to support your body through each\nfoot strike with hundreds of running\nshoes on the market it can be really\ntough to know what's going to work for\nyou but we've sifted through all the\noptions here to help steer you in the\nright direction going back a number of\nyears I used to be quite a heavy guy so\nI know how frustrating it is to have\nshoes that wear out really quickly and\nnot feel well supported in your running\nso some of this has come from my own\npersonal experience as well as extensive\nresearch and also speaking to a few of\nmy friends that work in running retail\nspeaking with Runners just like you\nevery day to see what they're\nrecommending heavy Runners should be\nputting on their feet I just want to say\nnothing in this video at all is\nsponsored in any way and also I've\nbought and tested and run in all of\nthese shoes and bought them 100% with my\nmoney to give you that completely\nimpartial honest review right let's get\nstuck into the best daily shoe options\nthat's coming up now if you are looking\nfor one shoe to do it all something to\ndo your easy runs in your long runs your\nspeed sessions and a few races as well\nthen we've got a few options here we're\nlooking for a foam in these shoes that's\njust a little bit more on the firmer\nside something that's not going to\ncompress and bottom out too much and\nalso a little bit of extra rubber on the\nouto to protect that foam and also\nincrease the durability with just some\nmore forces going through the shoe with\nevery foot strike so my first shoe I'd\nrecommend having a look at here is the\nsocony Triumph version 21 a really\nfantastic all round super versatile shoe\na really nice wide toe box as well then\nyou've got a thick slab of durable and\ncomfortable midsole foam in the shoe in\nterms of some negatives it might not be\nsuitable if you do have some narrow feet\nand there is only one width available on\nthe slightly cheaper side we've got the\nhoker Clifton 9 a fantastic daily\ndurable shoe it does come in two widths\navailable super comfortable and really a\nvery dependable daily shoe the regular\nversion is a little bit on the narrow\nside so if you do have wider feet make\nsure you go for that extra width option\nand my last shoe in the daily section is\nthe aex super blast a little bit more\nexpensive but you're getting a fantastic\nrunning shoe for your money here super\nversatile really maintains its structure\nthrough that heavy load and it's just\ngot a nice big surface area on the\nbottom the shoe which will keep it nice\nand stable yes very big stack height in\nthis shoe but you can pick up the page\nwith ease that turn of speed is really\nfantastic and super comfortable over\nthose long distances as well suitable\nfor everyone doing some long marathon\ntraining runs and you could definitely\nrace in the shoe as well in terms of the\ndownside yes it's a little bit more on\nthe expensive side and also the shoe\nonly comes in one width but there is a\ngood amount of wiggle room at the front\nof the shoe a good wide toe box there as\nwell right moving on we've got a couple\nmore daily options to chat about and\nthese are really good supportive or\nstability Run shoes if you can get into\na running store definitely try and do\nthat there'll be more than likely some\nreally good people that can give you\nsome good advice on shoes but me take\nthis list in say what have you got here\nI've heard these shoes are good if you\ncan get into a running store running\nthese on a treadmill and then they're\ngoing to be able to tell you if you do\nneed a neutral shoe or you do need a\nstability sh in general about 80% of the\npopulation has a neutral shoe 20% need a\nstability shoe I will link to a little\nguide down below if you can't make it\ninto a running store just to see whether\nyou might need a stability shoe but\nanyway let's have a chat about my best\noptions here the first one is the aex\ngel Cayo one of the most classic\nsupportive shoes of all time we're here\nat version 30 they had a good time to\nget it right what I really like about\nthis shoe that ax guidance system that\n4D guidance system really impressive\nstability really going to help keep that\nfoot supported through the whole\nfootstrike also comes in three different\nwidths your regular wide and extra wide\nas well super breathable upper in the\nshoe very thick and durable outsold as\nwell moving on to the Brooks Adrenaline\nGTS 23 four different widths available\nin the shoe here a slightly more firmer\nride it does soften up a little bit over\ntime you got Brooks's guide rail\nstability system in this shoe it's not\ntoo intrusive they a really good option\nA little top tip here if you do run more\nthan about three times a week then\nreally try to rotate between more than\none pair of different shoes the foam in\nour shoes needs a little bit of extra\ntime to decompress especially for\nheavier Runners they going be putting a\nbit more Force through that foam so if\nyou can allow at least sort of 20 24 to\n48 hours between runs to let that foam\njust breathe and return back to normal\nthat is really good cycling between two\ndifferent pairs of shoes will last a lot\nlonger than buying one shoe and then\nanother shoe after that moving on we're\ngoing to have a chat about the best easy\nrecovery Max comfort shoes the TP of\nshoes to really look after your legs\nlook after your body making sure they're\nabsorbing that impact to try and keep\nyou as injury free for as long as\npossible being a heavier Runner you\nmight assume that the more foam you have\nunder your feet the better however a lot\nof these Mac stack shoes that you can\nsee on the market these days have very\nsoft Foams and the problem with that is\nthey can be quite unstable for people\nwith a higher body weight and those\nFoams can sort of collapse and lead to a\nlot of instability as well that can lead\nto some higher chances of getting\ninjured so coming up I've got some\nreally good options that have a really\ngood balance of everything that is going\nto be really suited for heavier Runners\nstarting out we've got the Brooks\nGlycerin currently on version 21 it's\nsoft but it's not too soft again you've\ngot two different widths available here\nand also a stability option as well if\nyou do want a little bit of extra\nstability in your shoe it's got a very\nvery tacky but highly durable outso and\nso so comfortable to run in the only\ndownside of the shoe is not great at\npicking up the pace this is very much an\neasy recovery run shoe option here\nprobably one of my favorite shoes of\nthis year and last year as well the aex\nJoe Nimbus currently on 26 the pros of\nthis shoe it comes in three different\nwidths standard wide and extra wide it's\nso so comfortable it just one in my\nrecent video all about the most\ncomfortable shoes we'll link to that one\nup there it's also got a super durable\noutsole to the shoe very breathable and\nsuper soft upper to keep that Comfort\nmaximized a really large surface area\nunderneath the shoe as well so very very\nstable the foam in the shoe again it is\nquite soft but not too soft you're not\ngoing to bottom out that foam as you run\nalong and also a good amount of Stack\nheight in this shoe in terms of the\nnegatives it is a little bit on the\nexpensive side version 25 go and find\nthat one the updates are very very\nminimal and there's also not much energy\nreturn again the shoes in this section\nare just those recovery Run shoes so\nyou're going to need something for your\nfaster runs and your races to put it\ninto your rotation as well and then\nfinally in the recovery easy Run shoes\nsection we've got the Hoka Bondi version\n8 this comes in three different widths\nstandard wide and extra wide what I\nreally like about the shoe super\nbreathable super comfortable you can\nwear it for a long amount of time on\nyour feet you can run Ultras in a shoe\nso many Ultra runners use this type of\nshoe and it's also good for people that\ndo a lot of walking as well people that\nspending a lot of time on their feet\nmaybe you're working in retail in health\ncare something like that we up on your\nfeet a long time this is a really good\noption to look at in terms of what's not\nso good it is a little bit on the\nnarrower side as these shoes go and it\nhas also got quite a small toe box as\nwell so make sure you do Speck it in\nthat wide or extra wide if you have some\nwider feet and also the outso isn't\ngoing to be the best if you're a super\nheavy Runner there's a little bit of\nexposed foam on the bottom but for a lot\nof people it's going to be absolutely\nfine right the final section here let's\nhave a chat about the best plated shoes\nthat could be used for a lot of your\nfaster running and your racing they just\nshoes with plates and to help us run a\nlittle bit faster the main thing to\nconsider here when we're talking about\nshoes for heavier Runners is that Super\nShoes have one problem is they're\ngenerally not the most stable shoes out\nthere the super Foams tend to be very\nsoft and they don't last very long even\nfor slightly lighter people as well and\nthey often are quite narrow fitted so\nall the shoes I've here should cover\nthose bases and be the best for the\nheavier Runner out there starting out\nwe're going to have a chat about the\nNike zoomfly version five it's not a\nsuper shoe per se but a really good\noption for your long runs and your long\ndistance races and you can pick up the\npace in the shoe really well cuz it has\ngot that carbon plate in it it's got a\nsuper thick durable outsole and you'll\nbe Runing on a massive trunk of Nikes\nwell it's a bit of Zex in the middle\nthere Flagship foam with a carrier foam\naround it but a really nice responsive\nride as well and I'd say on the whole\nlist of shoes here this is definitely\ngoing to be the one that's going to last\nthe longest the most durable and in\nterms of the negatives with this shoe it\nis a little bit on the heavy so a little\nbit of a chunky ride with this shoe and\nthere's also only one width available\nnext on the list is a shoe I've recently\nbeen running in and absolutely loving it\nwas another star in my most comfortable\nshoe video recently which is the New\nBalance SC Trainer I would say this is\nthe most comfortable plated shoe that\nI've ever worn it's super lightweight\nsoft but again not too soft this is\ngoing to be a really good shoe to do\nsome of your speed workouts or as an\nultra comfortable race day shoe again\nnice durable outsole to the shoe very\nstable at cornering and a good amount of\nspace in the toebox for that footplay in\nterms of negatives yeah it's just not\nthe most Poppy the most responsive out\nthere but you are sacrificing a little\nbit of that to get a super comfortable\nride in the shoe and then finally what\nmost people said was the fastest best\nRAC day plated shoe for heavier Runners\nis the Nike alphafly version two or\npotentially version three as well which\nhas a slightly different ride what I\nreally like about the shoe is it's got\nthis super wide very stable platform in\nthe front and it's also just so fast\nreally with the massive Zoom Air Pods at\nthe front of the shoe the carbon plate\nrunning through it Nike's flash Chi Zoom\nX foam in the shoe it is super super\nquick also really encourage you to land\nnicely on the midfoot through your foot\nstrike really helping your leg turn over\nas as well but it does run a little bit\non the narrow side especially through\nthe midfoot so if you have a slightly\nwider foot through the midfoot then\ncheck out version 3 which is the most\ncurrent version out at the moment a lot\nmore space in that shoe but it's just\nnot quite as stable as version one and\nversion two there's also one thing to\nconsider especially with some slightly\nheavier Runners is these airpods at the\nfront have been known to pop and burst\nduring races I've never had it happen to\nme during a race but I have had it\nhappen in a very old battered pair of\ntraining shoes a couple of times it kind\nof depends the type of mileage you're\nputting into the shoe but something to\nbe aware of so I'm sure there's a few\nother options out there these are\ndefinitely ones that I would\nwholeheartedly recommend you go and\ncheck out let us know down in the\ncomments what are your favorite shoes\nhelp out the community as you've heard\nme mention quite a lot today I had a\nvery recent video all about those\ncomfortable showes of all time so maybe\ngo and check that one out next that's\ncoming up right guys keep on working\nhard keep on done and we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

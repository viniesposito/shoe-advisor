  "text": "a lot of us were never taught how to run\nwe just run and that's fine but\nsometimes as we start to increase our\nmileage we can start to pick up little\naches and pains and injuries due to bad\nhabits in our running form well the good\nnews is a few simple tweaks can make a\nhuge difference if we learn to run more\nefficiently it will ultimately make us a\nfaster runner and who wouldn't want that\nbut also less prone to injuries as well\nthere's no one size that fits all with\nrunning form everyone is unique\ndifferent body types different strengths\nand weaknesses that will affect how we\nrun my running form itself isn't perfect\nbut it's something I've worked on so\nmuch over the years to now I'm quite\nproud of it but I'm still making\nimprovements So today we're going\nthrough the technique Basics and some\nthings that you can do on your next run\nto help improve your running form the\nfirst thing we're talking about is\nCadence Cadence quite simply is the\nnumber of steps you take per minute most\nexperienced run outs will have a Cadence\nsome where between 170 and 190 now newer\nRunners will often have a Cadence much\nlower than this around about 150 to 160\nso if that's you you'll most likely\nbenefit by trying to increase it by\nraising our Cadence our feet will be in\ncontact with the ground for less of a\nTime there'll be less impact coming back\nthrough our body causing those injuries\nnow most modern watches most garments\nmost choruses most polar whatever you're\nusing you will be able to record and see\nthis data in your app of choice and you\ndefinitely can in straa depending on\nwhich one you're using so if you're\nunsure then check that out in the app\nand just go on a nice steady run and see\nwhat kind of figure you are running at\nso how are we going to go about trying\nto improve it and raise it up the first\nthing is using a metronome app back in\nthe day I had to clip one onto my\nshoulder and listen to it as it Beed\naway it was kind of I think it was a\nmusician's metronome you can still get\nthose if you want to but most modern\nways of doing this you're going to get a\nmetronome app on your phone and you can\nset that at the beats a minute and run\nalong in time with the beat as it's\nclicking away like that you can also set\na metronome on most modern Garmin\nwatches as well and just run along to\nthe beat that your watch is making and\non top of that you can also add a data\nfield to your watch as well and see in\nlive real time the Cadence that you're\nrunning at and then again you can try\nand focus on that with your metronome\napp and just make sure you're running at\nthe Target Cadence that you're going for\na couple of other options here the first\none if you are a Spotify customer then\nspottify I have some dedicated playlist\nat different beats a minute 165 170 180\nEtc just put that in the search bar up\nat the top and then listen to some music\nas you run along that has been set to\nthat exact metronomic beat the last\nthing I want to chat about here is\nstrides now strides is quite simply 20\nsecond burst of speed it's really hard\nto run these with bad running form but\nit also gets us to increase our Cadence\nup to a high level as well this just\ngets your body used to moving more\nefficiently over the ground and turning\nyour legs over a little bit quicker\nwhich you then can translate into your\nregular speed running as well and they\nalso help to get us a little bit\nstronger so there's so many bonuses by\nputting some strides in I'd recommend\nputting these after your easy run during\nthe week at some point just once a week\nit will really help improve your running\nform and your strength as well then a\nfinal little tip here if you are running\naround about 150 beats a minute say\nyou're more of a beginner Runner don't\ntry and jump all the way up to 180 it\nwill be too much on your body just try\nand Chip Away with this over time I say\nrecommend about five beats a minute\nchunks at any one time right let's move\non to chat about posture now as we run\nas our foot hits the ground we want to\nmake sure our head shoulders hips and\nfeet are all stacked up in a nice\nstraight line with a forward lean that's\ncoming from the ankles and not from the\nwaist this allows us to benefit from\nGravity that will help to propel us\nforward as we run we want to be running\nwith nice relaxed shoulders not not all\nhunched over like that I really also\nlike this analogy which I learned from\nmy running form coach Shane benzy we'll\nlink to his details down below which is\nimagine you're running with some crisps\nor some potato chips if you're a\ndifferent part of the world in the UK in\nyour hands and you don't want to crush\nthem you want nice relaxed hands we\ndon't want to run with loads of tension\nin your hands there you just want to be\nprotecting those crisps we also want to\nmake sure our arms are not crossing the\ncenter line as we run so imagine running\nsay towards the camera almost like I am\nhere with with a nice line drawn through\nthe body we want to make sure our arms\nare not crossing over like this which we\ndo see quite a lot of people doing we\njust don't want to be losing loads of\nexcess energy wasting loads of energy\nmoving our trunk and our torso around\nlike this save energy and use that to\npropel yourself forwards instead so how\nare we going to go about improving our\nposture well the first thing I'd\nrecommend and I did this so much when I\nstarted running is to make sure you\nstand up tall and fall forwards into\nyour run and don't worry it is going to\nmake sense start standing up straight\nand then stop and start a few times\nstart your run just by falling into your\nrun just lean from the ankles into your\nrun and start running this gets the body\nused to being in that nice forward lean\nposition no need to do this on\nabsolutely every run you're going on but\nmaybe just when you're trying to improve\nyour running form once or twice a week\nwill be really good just stop start\nmaybe four or five times just as you get\ngoing now another way to visualize this\nI see a lot of these onewheel scooters\naround London and again they Lean\nForward forward to go forwards as\nthey're slowing down they lean back\nthat's the same sort of visualization\nthat we want when we're starting running\nleaning from the ankles lean forwards\ninto it and then you can start running\nwe also want to be checking in with our\nrunning form cues as well things we want\nto think about as we're running have we\ngot a nice high head position our eyes\nlooking forward to the Horizon nice\nrelaxed shoulders running tall and again\njust think about these things eyes up\nrelax shoulders Amma running tall again\nmost modern garments allow you to set\ndifferent alerts for this customer\nalerts that come up on your watch just\nto check in eyes up relax shoulders\nrunning tool just think about that as\nyou're running along and then finally we\nwant to work improving our core strength\nlike I said earlier we don't want to be\nwasting loads of energy here how can we\nimprove our core just very basic things\ndead bugs Bridges planks side planks\nstronger core means we'll hold that\nupright position for longer so many\npeople's form collapses towards the end\nof races the end of half marathons and\nmarathons especially everything is\ngetting very tired and fatigue the\nstronger our core the better running\nform we're going to be having towards\nthe end of our race the better we're\ngoing to be running overall right next\nup we're talking foot placement and\nLanding so with our foot placement where\ndo we want to be landing well ideally\nunderneath our Center of mass as we've\njust talked about in our posture there\nwe're going to make sure everything is\nnicely in a line and we don't want to be\nover striding out in front of us as this\nwill be creating that breaking force\nwhich is what we really don't want to be\ndoing there's been so much debate about\nheel striking specifically over the\nyears if it's something we want to be\navoiding where should our foot be\nlanding should I 4ot strike midfoot\nstrike or heel strike myself I'm a\nmidfoot striker I believe that's the\nbest way to move but it really doesn't\nmatter as much as we used to think it\ndid as long as we're Landing nicely\nunderneath our Center of mass some Elite\nRunners Charlotte pgy one of the UK's\nbest ever marathon runners runs with a\nheel strike but what brings all Elite\nRunners together is I say they're\nLanding nicely underneath that Center of\nmass now I would say if you want to\nchange the way you move if you are a\nhill Striker you want to become a bit\nmore of a midfoot striker then it's\nsomething I really would urge people not\nto concentrate on too much because a lot\nof the time it can cause people to\novercompensate and end up running on\nyour tiptoes which really isn't a good\nway to be landing so there's lots of\nthings we can do to help this transition\nnaturally if you do want to be running\nwith more of that midfoot Landing first\nthing I'd say here is to shorten your\nstride a little bit and increase our\nCadence this will naturally lead to our\nfoot Landing nicely underneath our\nCenter of mass again something I used to\ndo loads when I started running is to\npractice some barefoot running on a\ngrass on a grass on the grass or\npotentially if you live in a more\nCoastal area on the beach a nice Sandy\narea now why I find this really\nfascinating is because a lot of people\nwill run along with a heel strike take\nthe shoes off run on a nice soft surface\nthey will then naturally be running with\nmore of a midfoot strike because they\ndon't have that huge lump of foam and\nshoe underneath them to protect them\nfrom Landing in this really sort of very\nnatural way if you're not used to this\nthis can put quite a bit of strain on\nthose lower leg muscles so only do this\nfor some short bursts just running at\nyour natural easy running pace maybe\nsomething like 4 by 30 seconds just to\npractice this again we can do this at\nthe beginning of a run at the end of a\nrun finish in a nice grassy area this\nalso helps to increase our propri\nreception the amount of feedback we're\ngetting from the ground up into the body\ninto the brain as well again modern\nrunning shoes running in these massive\nfoam things on our feet we just don't\nreally know what's going on out that\nthere and our brain doesn't really like\nit two other little things that we can\nadd in here as well Hill reps now\nbelieve me Hill reps are such a good\nthing to be putting into our R not only\ndoes it build a lot of strength it\npromotes a faster Cadence but it also\nreally helps encourage Landing\nunderneath that Center of mass as well\nit's quite hard to run up a hill over\nstriding so again put these in your\nroutine maybe once every couple of weeks\ndo some Hill reps doesn't have to be\nmuch just something four five 6 by 60\nseconds up the hill and a nice slow jog\nback down and then finally drills\npracticing these movement patterns of\nrunning and correct Landing some high\nknees some butt kicks simple stuff that\nwe can put into our weekly routine\npotentially do these before one of your\nspeed sessions now we've talked quite a\nlot in this video All About Cadence if\nyou want to learn a little bit more\ndetail about Cadence I'll link to my\ndedicated video All About Cadence up\nthere so go and check that video out\nnext that's it guys keep on working hard\nkeep on down and I'm sure you become a\nbch better faster stronger happier\nRunner overall with all of these tips\nthat's it guys we'll see you in the next\none h",

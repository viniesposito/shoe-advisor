  "text": "is it possible to run faster with less\neffort well yes it's something Elite and\npro level Runners have mastered and the\ngood news is that you can as well so\nwhat's their secret how can we run\nsmoother faster run longer and make our\nruns just overall feel a lot easier but\nstick around because we've got all that\ncoming up and by the end of this video\nyou'll know exactly what you should be\ndoing the first thing we can be working\non is improving our running form if we\ncan improve our running form and move\nmore efficiently we'll get from point A\nto point B using a lot less energy more\nadvanced Runners often look so relaxed\nas if they're just gliding along so how\nhave they worked at achieving this well\nI've got five ways here that will really\nhelp you the first one being is\nimproving our Cadence now running with a\nhigher Cadence will really reduce the\namount of force coming up through your\nlegs beginner Runners are usually\nrunning around about 150 to 160 and will\ngreatly benefit from inred inreasing\ntheir Cadence a little bit more up to\nthe 170s 180s sort of Mark the simplest\nway of starting out on your Cadence\njourney is by using a metronome you can\nthen set the Cadence you want and it\nwill Tap Away in the background as you\nrun along and you can time your strides\nmonitor it and then have a look after\nyou're on as well on Garmin or on choros\nagain whichever app you're using and\nthen you can monitor that over time and\ngradually start to increase it don't go\nfrom big chunks just gradually work at\nincreasing it we've got a video all\nabout how how to improve your cence I'll\nlink to that up here and at the end of\nthe video and down below we will also\nwant to be improving our body position\nand leaning from the ankles a forward\nlean is how advanced runners use gravity\nto help propel them forwards the best\nway you can practice doing this is by\nstopping your runs and then just leaning\ninto it in my early days of running I\nused to do this all the time just for\nthe first like 500 me of a run just\nconstantly stopping and starting just\nleaning forward and starting running\nlike that your body will naturally go\ninto that nice forward lean and then you\ncan just relax stop and do it again and\njust repeating this all the time will\nreally help you don't to do this on all\nof your runs but maybe just a couple of\nyour easy runs throughout the week just\nto practice also we want to really be\nworking on our core muscles doing things\nlike Bridges and planks will help build\nthat strong core that we need to support\nall of our upper body as it rotates and\nit keeps our arm strings in check\nbecause all of this if you haven't got a\nstrong core all this going on is just\nwasted energy we also want to make sure\nour feet are landing nicely underneath\nour Center of mass the foot strike\ndoesn't matter as much a midfoot strike\nheel strike 4ft strike is not as\nimportant what is important is making\nsure it lands nicely underneath our\nCenter of mass this will be the best\nplace for our body to efficiently absorb\nthe impact and to maximize that energy\nreturn to Spring Forward quite often\npeople will overstride and overreach\nyou're just constantly creating that\nbreaking force every time you run which\nis just a complete waste of energy you\ndon't be applying the brakes bring that\nback and we'll be able to move across\nthe ground in a far far more efficient\nway I've got two other simple things we\ncan doing to improve our form the first\none is strides long-term viewers of the\nchannel know I talk about this all the\ntime they're absolutely fantastic quite\nsimply 20 seconds of really fast running\n90 to 95% effort here with about a 20 to\n30 second very relaxed chilled recovery\nbetween each stride I'd really recommend\nfour to six strides put these maybe\nafter one of your easy runs during the\nweek you can even do them during one of\nyour easy runs as well it's very hard to\nrun this fast with bad running forms it\nreally helps train the brain to get\nourselves moving in a far more efficient\nway the final one being Hill reps now\nhear me out cuz Hill reps are really\nreally good yes of course they're hard\nwork but they really help promote a\nreally good foot placement again nicely\nunder that Center of mass and really\nhelps improve our strength as well they\nget you really strong and moving in a\nnice way strength training something\nI've personally been doing a hell of a\nlot this year and I'm really starting to\nsee the massive benefits in my own\nrunning as well the stronger that our\nmuscles are the more Force we can put\nthrough them and therefore run further\nwithout tiring out quite as quickly now\nthis doesn't have to mean lifting huge\nweights it can simply be doing some\nbasic exercises at home without the need\nfor any equipment just things like doing\nsome squat lunges calf raises all really\ngood for that leg strength and then\nthings like planks and bridges as well\nwill really help to improve our core\nwhich as we talked about earlier really\ngood for supporting that upper body so\nI'd recommend picking a few of these\ndifferent exercises and putting together\na little circuit for around about 20\nminutes is a really good starting point\nfour exercises 1 minute for each\nexercise four to five rounds of this\nwith just a minute rest between each\nround I'd always recommend tagging these\nonto your easy run days and make sure\nyou keep your rest days as complete rest\nthat's when our body's adapting\nabsorbing everything we're throwing\nabout it so you need to keep your rest\ndays as rest days add the strength work\nto those easy run days we also do have a\nstrength guide which integrates into all\nof our training plans which you can see\non our website whatever distance you're\ntraining for check out benp parks.com\nand add on that strength training option\nif you want a complete guide on how to\nintegrate this with your training\nthirdly is all about improving our\nrunning Fitness and this may seem like a\nreally obvious one the fitter we get the\nfaster we'll get running at the same\nsort of effort level but how do we work\nat improving our running Fitness well\nquite simply this is by doing some speed\nsessions during the week couple of\nreally good ones 4 to 6times 3 minutes\nat around about our 5K Pace with a\n2minute walking recovery 3 to four reps\nof 5 minutes around about our 10K Pace\nwith a 2-minute walk recovery or perhaps\ntry a pyramid session is 1 2 3 4 3 2 1\nthese numbers represent minutes of\nrunning fast around about our 5 to 10K\npace for these with a 90c walking\nrecovery between the Reps now doing\nsessions like this will really help\nimprove that V2 Max improve our running\nFitness overall but it also does add a\nlot of stress to the body so it's really\nimportant for the rest of the week to be\ndoing a lot of our easy miles and at\nleast making sure we're having one maybe\ntwo full rest days during the week now\nwarming up before you head out on your\nrun is so important especially as we get\na little bit older and another way to\ndefinitely make those early stages of\nthat run feel a hell of a lot easier so\nmake sure you're taking that 5 to 10\nminutes to warm up properly before\nyou're heading out the door mobilizing\nour joints with some dynamic stretches\nwe've got a really good follow along\nvideo I'll link to that up here and down\nbelow as well and then easing into that\nrun really nice and gradually that first\ncouple of Cs should be nice and relax a\nlot slower than what we want to be doing\nfor our whole run and once you're up to\nspeed you'll feel far more relaxed and\nusing a lot less effort another thing\nthat can make running feel really hard\nis when you haven't fueled or hydrated\nproperly beforehand now a lot of people\nwhen they start out running either eat\nfar too much just before they head out\nand they're going to feel very sluggish\nand slow or they don't have enough and\nthen they're going to feel very sort of\nweak and risk the chance of getting\ndehydrated so I'd really recommend is\nhaving a small snack or something around\nabout 30 minutes to 1 hour before\nheading out and also avoiding the\nhottest parts of the day as well you can\nbe running at exactly the the same Pace\nthat you'd used be running at but your\nbody is going to be having to put a lot\nmore effort into keeping you at the pace\nthat you want to be running at so make\nsure you're heading out in the mornings\nor in the evenings make sure you're\ngetting nicely hydrated with some good\nfuel on board before you head out as\nwell and then you'll be using a lot less\neffort running at the pace you want to\nbe running at now I wasn't sure whether\nto put this one in the video so let me\nknow your thoughts down below all about\nSuper Shoes these carbon plated Super\nShoes that burst on the scene around\nabout sort of 6 seven years ago and now\npretty much every Pro so many amateur\nRunners are going out and spending vast\namounts of money on these shoes in the\nhope that they can be using less energy\nto run from point A to point B in all\nthese shoes they have these carbon\nplates that run throughout the whole\nlength of the shoe or some of them they\nhave Nyon plates and these plates help\nto propel us forward with each stride\nand then they have this huge chunk of\nfoam in there as well to help protect\nthe legs from that impact so our muscles\nwill be fatiguing a little bit L Nike's\nfamous 4% shoes I had my orange ones\nI'll put those up on the screen now\nclaim to improve Times by as much as\nthat 4% so for a 4-Hour marathoner they\ncan be looking at a 10minute Improvement\ngoing to 3our 50 so why wouldn't you\nwant that free speed will you\nautomatically just run faster by just\nputting on a pair of these shoes well it\nall depends in reality a lot of these\nbenefits are far more prominent in\nFaster runners in a lot of the studies\nthey Define faster Runners by any anyone\nrunning 4 hours or less for the marathon\nbut anyone can see these small\nimprovements by wearing a super shoe\ncompared to their regular shoe without a\ndoubt so why wouldn't we go about\nwearing a super shoe every day well they\ndo have their downsizes they're very\nvery expensive for a start they're\nuncomfortable they tend to not last very\nlong and they're also not very versatile\nthey really are only good at races and\nduring our speed sessions as well and\nthe body can come a little bit too\nreliant on technology and we can\nactually lose strength or not gain as\nmuch strength as we could by running in\nsome more regular shoes we'll link to an\ninteresting article down below about why\ndoing all of your runs in Super Shoes\nreally is not the best idea but without\na doubt for the vast majority of people\ndoing our races in these new fangled\nSuper Shoes amazing things you've got\nthe cash to do it and you can afford to\ndo it they are going to make a\ndifference to our running time by\nliterally doing as this video says\nmoving from point A to point B using\nless energy let me know down in the\ncomments have super shoes made a big\ndifference to you I'd love to know but\nwith all of this for me the biggest\nimprovements can be made by correcting\nour running form which is where I'd\npersonally recommend that you spend a\nlot of our efforts that is going to give\nyou some really good longterm gains in\nrunning hopefully also decrease that\nchance of picking up injuries as well so\nlet me know how you get on with all of\nthese tips if you've got some other ones\nlet me know down in the comments and\nhelp out the running Community got two\ndifferent videos coming up next one all\nabout improving our Cadence and one all\nabout mental tricks to help you get out\nthere and run a little bit longer as\nwell so check those out keep on working\nhard guys keep done we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

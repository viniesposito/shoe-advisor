  "text": "I purchased the alphafly 3 back at the\nstart of the year and I've put many\nhundreds of training miles and also a\ncouple of races through the shoe as well\nso I thought it was time to sit down and\ngive you my completely unbiased thoughts\non the shoe and to see how well they are\nholding up after all of those Mars I've\ndone 200 training and racing Mars in\nthis prototype colorway here and I've\nalso done one marathon in Berlin in this\nshoe here we're going to be answering\nthose all important questions today how\nlong are these shoes holding up what the\nphone feeling like after 200 miles and\ncan the Everyday Athlete really benefit\nfrom a shoe like this or is it just for\nthose Elites because as you'll have seen\nthe world records for the women's and\nthe men's Marathon are now being broken\nin Chicago with the alphafly version 3\nright let's get stuck in the review\nfirst thing we're going to chat about\nthe differences between the alphafly 3\nand the alphafly version 2 so when Nike\nlaunched alphafly version 3 it came with\na completely new redesign there was a\nbig weight decrease as well for me it\nwas 30 G lighter in my UK size 12 the\narch on the inside is a lot less\npronounced version two people are\ngetting some big hot spot issues in here\nand some soreness on that inside of the\narch that is a lot lot better now and\nnow you've got this lovely continuous\nmidsole which just makes it so much\nsmoother through the foot strike and\nyou've got a little bit of a wider\ncarbon plate for some extra stability in\nthere as well well let's get stuck into\nall of the facts and figures so the\npurpose of a shoe like the alphafly\nversion 3 this is a road racing Super\nShoe that marathon and half marathon\nCruiser is where this shoe absolutely\nshines price-wise this shoe sent me back\na staggering\n\u00a3285 we'll put it up with the other\ncurrencies up on the screen now stack\ncut at the back 40 mm right at that\nlegal limit we've got 8 mm drop over all\nthis is coming in for me at 269 G for me\nin my UK size 12 so nice and light\nthat's what we like to see this is a\nneutral shoe and it has this lovely\natomknit upper super breathable get some\nfantastic air flow in that as you start\nto pick up the pace midso we're talking\nNike's Flagship zoomx midso with two Air\nZoom Pods at the bottom of the shoe here\nto give you that extra propulsion we've\ngot a ful length carbon plate running\nthroughout the shoe with the outsole of\nthe shoe we've got a lot of rubber up at\nthe front here to give you some really\ngood grip mainly for your Forefront and\nmidfoot Strikers rear foot Strikers\ngoing to be a little less grip there's\nnothing there at the back of the shoe\njust some very small rubber units here\nthere are no different widths available\nthere are men's and women's different\nfits and this shoe was true to size for\nme right let's get stuck into my likes\nmy first like with the Ally is the super\nsmooth ride with this updated midsole\nyou're getting a lovely buttery smooth\ntransition through the foot strike there\nit's a lot less Slappy than version one\nand two because cuz it had that sort of\nbit missing in the center of the shoe\nthere the lightweightness of this shoe\nyou really notice that as well when\nyou're going from version two to version\nthree if you're a heel Striker this is\ngoing to be a lot smoother through that\nwhole foot strike compared to version\none and version two my second like with\nthe shoe is just so comfortable at all\nPaces previous version of the alphafly\nthey were just so clumpy at those slower\nPaces when you're warming up and easy\npace and now this is comfortable at all\nPaces this new breathable upper is\nfantastic that sock like feel really\ngood lockdown in the shoe as well I've\nhad no issues with any blisters hot\nspots anything uncomfortable even at the\nback end of the marathons when I've been\nracing the shoe absolutely comfortable\nfrom right from the start the middle and\nall the way to the end previously I've\nalways reverted back to vaporfly version\n3 cuz it was just way more comfortable\nbut with this update here this is now a\nlittle bit faster than vaporfly for me\nand with that Comfort aspect of as well\nit's the one I've been reaching for for\nmy races my third like with this shoe is\nthe surprising that what I've called\nthis video is the surprising truth the\ndurability has been really good this\nshoe has now done 200 miles in it a lot\nof training miles getting ready for\nBerlin and then I raised Melbourne in\nthe shoe I did actually get a new pair\nfor Berlin cuz I was like oh they say it\nwasn't going to last very long I better\nget a new pair but I actually went\nfaster in Melbourne with my old slightly\nmore bashed up pair that a lot of\nManufacturers would say has passed its\nbetter days but for me I had a fantastic\nrun in Melbourne it really has held up\nreally really well I like a lot of\npeople get frustrated by manufacturers\nsaying these Super Shoes are only going\nto last 100 miles of perfect running and\nthen after that you need to Trop and\nchange them in reality I really don't\nthink that's true if you're an elite\nathlete you've got unlimited amount of\nshoes to choose from Yes it probably is\ngoing to make that like .05 little bit\nof\ndifference right guys out here on the\nten path got a speed session to 7 by 3\nminutes getting ready for Valencia on my\nleft foot I've got my 200 mile pair of\nAl 3es on my right the Nearly New Pair\njust done at 26 miles of Berlin marathon\nand that just want to see how they feel\nhow they compare how that Popp that\nspringiness that bounce and see what\nit's like between the two shoes have\nthey lost it are they now dead do they\nneed to be retired I don't think so I\nthink they still feel fantastic but\ngoing to go through these three minute\nreps here and see how they feel going to\nbe doing these around 10K to half\nmarathon pace\n[Music]\nit's really hard to tell the difference\nthere is a slight difference the good\nthe newer pair feel a little bit more\nstable the airpods just have a little\nbit more life left in them they haven't\nbeen compressed and crunch quite as much\nas's the pair on the left but really\nvery very marginal I think most people\ncould easy Run 3 to 400 training and\nracing mares in their shoe absolutely\nfine wear wise on the bottom of the shoe\nI've just got a little bit of wear on\nthe outso here where I land and then I\nsort of roll inwards through the foot\nstrike there it's a little bit worn down\nat the front here but what's important\nwith these shoes is how the foam feels\nhow that's holding up and I really feel\nthere's so much life left in this shoe\nand we carry on getting ready for\nValencia by doing a lot of training Mars\nin their shoe it's far from done and\nthen my fourth like with this shoe is\njust how stable this shoe is for a\nmaximum stack height shoe that super\nwide carbon fiber plate you've got in\ntheir shoe just feel really confident\nwhen I'm cornering and things like that\nwhen I was in a couple of these races we\nhad to do some 180 turn backs I just\nfelt super confident going to that\ndidn't really enter my mind that I might\nroll an ankle or something like that\nwhich you can sometimes get with these\nMax stack height shoes the grip is much\nimproved on this shoe I haven't run in\nthe rain in this shoe yet been very\nlucky mainly training in the summer but\nwhen you go through some Aid stations\nand things like that where there's water\nbottles and stuff all over the road when\nI was going through that the grip felt\nsuper good when the roads did get a\nlittle bit wet but as always on the\nchannel here I want to give you that\ncompletely honest review so there are a\nfew dis likes and let's get stuck into\nthose now the first dislike with the\nshoe is it still just a little bit noisy\nnowhere near as Slappy as the older\nshoes I'll put up a little bit of\nfootage now this is Midway through the\nMelborne marathon in a really quiet\nsection and you can just hear how loud\nthis shoe is when you run along for some\npeople they don't like the amount of\nnoise that these shoes can make not as\nbad as the old one but it's still a bit\nnoisy my second dislike is it's still a\nlittle bit on the narrow side through\nthe midf foot it's been absolutely fine\nfor me I did have a few issues with the\nearlier shoes and it's much improved\nthrough the midot Section here but it's\nstill just a little bit on the narrow\nside and you do notice that and then\nobviously price has to come into it in\nthe UK this is nearly \u00a3300 but with how\nwell the shoe is holding up as I say\nyou're getting some good value here and\nI think if you spent some time on some\nlights like Vinted or Ebay you could\nprobably pick up a used pair for not a\nlot of money and have many happy\ntraining miles in this if a pair's only\ndone 100 miles or something you can pick\nthat up and it's going to feel\nabsolutely fantastic so what about a\nrotation what can I pair this up with\nwell if you want to stick with an Nike\nrange something like the Vero 17 or the\nPegasus Plus for your everyday runs and\nthen use this shoe here for your key\nworkouts and races if you got a bit more\ncash to spend you want a three shoe\nrotation it's a bit of a debate whether\nto get something like the vaporfly 3\nwhich is a little bit lighter a little\nbit snappier and it could be a good\noption for some faster speed work at\nthose 5K and 10K page that's when I'd\nprobably like to whip out the vapor 53\nif I was doing a 5k or 10k race it's\njust a little bit as I say a little bit\nlighter and snappier type of shoe there\nbe still really good in this but this is\nreally that marathon and half marathon\nCruiser is where this shoe absolutely\nshines or potentially you could dial up\nyour recovery runs with something like\nthe Invincible version 4 is launching\nvery soon I'm kind of checking the Nike\nwebsite every day for when it's dropping\nso get subscribed to that we'll get it\nin and we'll give you that review right\nconclusions and Final thoughts obviously\nI've really enjoyed running this shoe\nit's been fantastic but who is this shoe\nfor and I think because this shoe is so\nsmooth so comfortable but not overly\naggressive it really does mean a more\nintermediate Runner can benefit from a\nshoe like this so many carbon shoes out\nthere are so stiff and so firm you have\nto have that like Elite level leg\nstrength to get the most out of the shoe\nbut for me that hasn't being the case\nhere I feel a lot of people can benefit\nfrom a shoe like this there's no Bild\nbig Breakin period and it's really going\nto be popular with a lot of marathon\nrunners regardless of their ability so\nis it recommended definitely I recommend\nyou check out my full Nike lineup video\nwe link to that video which is going to\nbe up here next if you want to check out\nmy whole Melborne Marathon video that\nvideo is down here where I use this very\nshoe to run in so that's it guys I'm off\nto get some more training miles done let\nme know your thoughts on the alphafly\nversion 3 keep on working hard keep done\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

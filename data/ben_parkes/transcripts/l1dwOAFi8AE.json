  "text": "an ultramarathon is any run or any race\nlonger than a marathon so anything\nlonger than 26.2 mil and today we're\ngoing to be covering everything\nultramarathon how to get into it what\ntype of ultramarathon you might like to\ndo what kit you might need some good\nfirsttime events plus we'll also have a\nlook at what the training looks like and\nI promise you it's probably not as hard\nas you might think it will be so stay\ntuned for that now over the last few\nyears I've run some 50ks some 50 MERS\nand a handful of 100 MERS as well and\ntoday I want to show you that ultr\nrunning really can be for everyone now\nyou might well think that running an\nultramarathon is surely one of the\nhardest things that you can do in\nrunning and while yes there are lots of\nreally tough races out there but there's\nalso a general Vibe around Ultras that\nthey're a lot more relaxed than running\na road Marathon for example and some\nUltras can take you some incredible\nbeautiful parts of the world and that's\none of the reasons why ultr running is\nin such a big boom in recent years there\nare so many different distances surfaces\nformats there's so much variety so I\nguarantee there'll be something in here\nfor you now the standard distances in\nUltras tend to be 50k 5050 MERS 100K 100\nm 200 MERS and anything up to around\nabout 250 mil for the most part we'll\ncome on to some longer races a little\nbit later on the video and I should say\nif these are on Trails they'll be a\nroundabout this sort of figure nobody's\nmeasuring these courses out on Trails so\nstarting out with 50k this will\nobviously take you a little bit longer\nthan a marathon moving up to 50 m mil\nand 100ks you're talking around about\nsort of 10 to 15 hours to complete\nsomething like this you're not going to\nbe running consistently through this\nwhole distance for a lot of people there\nmight well be some walking brakes some\nwalking up some of the hills moving on\nto 100 mile distance for most people\nyou're talking around about 20 to 30\nhours to finish 100 mile probably no\nsleep you'll be running through a whole\nnight and then moving up to the 200 250\nM distance this really is not for\nbeginners but I thought you might like\nto know a little bit about it here with\ntalking for three plus days sleep\nbecomes a big factor in these sort of\nraces getting that sleep and then\ngetting back up and running as well now\none of the very biggest road Ultras in\nthe world is a race called comrades\nwhere myself and my partner Sarah who's\nfilming this will be traveling to very\nshortly it's around about 90 km every\nyear the distances do change slightly\ncomr is quite a hilly run you either go\nup or down and lots of undulations along\nthe way but for a lot of people they\nmight like to start out with something\nflatter now in the UK we have a lot of\ncanal races Gran Union Canal R 135 Mi\nrunning from Birmingham all the way down\nto London races along the temp's path\nyou can then be influenced with\ntemperature as well some very hot races\nsomething like spartathlon 153 Mi\nthrough the heat of Greece in the summer\nor something like bad water 135 Mi\nthrough California's death valley or\nmaybe someone that prefers running in\nthe cold something like Ark of attrition\nhere in the UK in the depths of Winter\nthe spine race they got lots of\ndifferent distances but tapping out\naround about 20 60 Mi and then winter\nDowns 200 M here in the UK as well and\nthen moving on to some slightly\ndifferent races track races the 400 met\nAthletics track a fantastic mental\nchallenge now these going to be the time\n6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours even\nlonger up to about 6 days we hear some\nof these events are going on for now and\nit's simply how far you can run in that\ntime or they might Simply Be\ndistance-based things so again your 50ks\nyour 100 miles going around the track as\nwell really races here in the UK\nsomething like Crawley 24 the self\nTranscendence 24hour in battery moving\non to a new type of running which we've\nseen in the last few years called the\nbackyard Ultra started by Lazarus Lake\nGary Cantrell the guy that started uh\nBarkley name that and this is simply\nrunning a\n4167 mile loop on the hour every hour\nand it's the last man standing now we\ndon't know how long this race could last\nthe record at the moment is 450 miles or\n4 and a half days you can then do Ultras\nin the mountains some big races things\nlike UTMB Hard Rock T western states or\nmaybe you want to look at something like\ndoing an fkt a fastest known time not an\norganized race check out the fkt website\nmaybe a big challenge in your local area\nwhere you want to be the local Legend as\nstra would say but you could be the fkt\nholder for something like that and then\nyou might like to look at something like\nstage races the big ones here Marathon\ndesabla MDS dragons back K wrath Ultra\nthere's a set amount of distance you\ncover each day and then the clock stops\nat the end of each day and it's your\ncumulative time over a period so a lot\nof these may be around about a week of\nrunning and the winner will be the\nperson with the least amount of time\nrunning and then finally the longest\ncertified foot race in the world\n3,100 miles the self Transcendence in\nQueens New York at the moment the male\nrecord of 40 days of running to cover\nthat 3,100 Mi the female record 45 days\nthere were just six finishes last it\nwhen the race happened just an iconic\nrace go and read all about it some\nfantastic documentaries we'll link to\nthose down below most of these races\nwill have Aid stations where you have a\nchance to refuel with nutrition and\nliquids that the race is giving out some\nof the races will also allow outside\nassistance from your crew these are\npeople that you'll know and they'll\nfollow you around and can stop off at\ndesignated checkpoints for them and be\nable to give you assistance so again hot\nfood change of clothes some drinks as\nwell and the sun races will also allow\nwhat's known as Paces particularly\npopular in the United States and you can\nhave a buddy that will run with you help\nkeep your pace make sure your spirits\nare high motivation high and just for\nsome instances in some more remote\nlocations it's a good safety thing to\nhave out there as well one of the\nbiggest things with running Ultras is\nyou've got to find your why people\nreally need to find out why they want to\nbe doing this it's not a natural thing\nfor the brain to be out there running\nthese tremendous distances simply\nchallenging yourself pushing yourself\nmentally and physically further than you\never thought you could do they really\nare good fun as well and that can be a\nwhy a lot of people might be escaping\nsomething escaping a dull job a bad\nrelationship we've all been there over\nthe years and it can simply bring a lot\nof joy to your life a lot of purpose\nalternatively just want to go out and\nexplore see some new parts of the world\nsimply escaping for me I just love the\nSolitude of being out there for hours on\nend running through some beautiful\nscenery just a sense of Peace and\nFreedom phones and stuff are away you're\njust out there you and the trails with a\nsingle thing to do it's a really\namazing experience when you're out there\nsome people do get a little bit\ndisillusioned with Road running all the\npaces the splits setting PBS the speed\nsessions and things you've got to do and\na lot of that does go out the window\nwith ultra so some people can find a\nreally new love of running by running\nlong and giving themselves slightly\ndifferent challenges and also some older\nRunners do turn to Ultras maybe they\ncan't be hitting those PBS they want\nanymore so if you've decided when I get\nout there and run an ultra what are some\ngood races to have a look at we're\nstarting out in the south of the UK here\none of mine my girlfriend's favorite\nCenturion running offer anything from\n50k the 50k 100 Hills where we\nvolunteered at last year it's a really\ngood very beginner focused Ultra event\nso we'll link to Centurian running down\nbelow threshold races like race of the\nking race of the stones race of the\ntower I've done two of them myself but\nthey really are very welcoming they\noffer very generous cut offs you can\nwalk a lot of these races as well so you\ndon't need to worry about being timed\nout and things like that and they all\noffer some of those amazing a stations\nout there are very proud of their 9 %\nfinisher rate so really most people will\nget round some other organizers to have\na look at things like serpent Trail SVP\nwhich I think stands for Star Valley\nparth I'm not sure 50k and 100K GB\nUltras and also Ultra X if you want to\ngo a little bit longer if you want to\ntravel a little bit further field from\nthe UK have a look at the list of UTMB\nraces that they now have all over the\nworld they normally pretty much always\noffer races anything from about 20K\nnormally up to 100 bars plus and if you\nwant to look at some slightly longer\nraces as well then have a look at the\nworld Trail majors and new setup they\noffering some really amazing experiences\nall around the world we'll link to all\nof these down below please let us know\ndown in the comments what are your\nfavorite beginner friendly races maybe\nin your country you've got some\nfantastic things help out the community\nand let everybody know now of course\nwhen you start training and racing a lot\nof these Ultras you're going to need\nsome basic kit to get you going so\nstarting out with the fundamentals\nyou're going to need to get yourself a\nrunning pack because you're going to be\nrunning a lot longer than you would be\nduring a marathon you need to have a way\nof carrying some supplies with you some\nnutrition some water some extra clothing\nand some safety kit as well so you have\nto be a little bit more self-sufficient\nyou're also going to want to get\nyourself a really good quality\nwaterproof jacket something that has\ntape seams just because when we out\nthere for a long period of time the\nweather can turn especially if we're out\nin the mountains you're also going to\nwant to get yourself a head torch most\nraces that are over 50 Mi are likely to\ninvolve running during some periods of\nDarkness especially if they're going to\nbe winter races you're also going to\nwant to find yourself some trail shoes\nsomething that's going to be a little\nbit more grippy a lot of Ultras will be\non Trails or off-road and you're really\ngoing to benefit more from having that\nextra grip but also a more sturdy and\nharder wearing shoe they going able to\nwithstand a lot more abuse then also\nsome basic safety kit out there so a\nfirst day kit a foil blanket a means of\nnavigating around for most people that's\nsimply on their watch and of course a\nfully charged mobile phone now of course\nall of this kit doesn't come cheap\nthere's an organization here in the UK\nput them up on the screen now link to\nthem down below that help some\nindividuals that are less able to afford\na lot of this kit to be able to get into\nthe sport so if that applies to you then\nas I say We'll link to them down below\ngo and check them out so in very simple\nterms what does the training look like\nfor an ultra well for a standard 50 to\n100K race the type of thing you would\nfind here in the UK you're talking\naround about 15 to 16 weeks of training\nthe same length as a standard marathon\ntraining block basically if you want to\ncheck out our training plans for these\nwe'll link to them down below the main\ndifference between marathon training and\ntraining for Ultras like this you want\nto really try and get in something\ncalled backto back long runs so lot of\npeople this might be on the weekend of a\nlong run Saturday and then a long run\nSunday getting used to running on tired\nlegs fatiguing them on Saturday and then\ngetting out and running them again on\nSunday to give them even more of a\npunishment strength work is so important\nhere you might be able to get by with\njust doing some basic stuff at home but\nideally want to be getting into the gym\nand lifting some weights and building\nthat strength that you're going to need\nto power yourself up the mountains down\nthe mountains and really run strong at\nthe back end of a race another top tip\nis really try and train on as similar\nterrain to your goal race as possible if\nyou're going to be doing Arc attrition\non the coast path try and get down and\nrun on the coast paath if you're doing\nsome canal running run on the canals if\nyou're going to be racing in the\nmountains try and spend some time in the\nmountains getting used to What It's Like\non the exact terrain of your goal race\nand also with the training a lot of very\neasy low heart rate relax zone two\nconversational Pace running building a\nreally big base strong cardio system\nthat is going to allow you to run a very\nlong way without burning out nutrition\nis so important with ultr running we\nneed to be fueling our body throughout\nthe race to be able to run strong all\nthe way through it so we also need to be\ntraining our gut trying new things\nexperimenting with all the weird and\nwonderful types of race nutrition you\ncan get out there and that has to form a\nbig part of the training so when you get\nto race day you've got your nutrition\nplan sorted and you know your body's\ngoing to respond and be well to it and\nnot give you any gut issues so moving on\nto our livite nutrition section here as\nI've just said ultra running is not so\nmuch about running it's all about eating\nand consuming calories as we go along\nnow you may think that sounds like a\nperfect wonderful day out there but so\nmany people become unstuck in this area\ngetting GI issues being sick because\nthey haven't consumed enough calories or\nthe right calories that their body wants\nif you can't keep your food down you\ncan't fuel yourself and you can't\ncontinue and you'll be tapping that dnf\nbutton unfortunately it's as simple as\nthat now there are lots of different\nways you can fuel your runs and keep\nyour energy levels topped up some\nRunners like to stick to your standard\nSports Nutrition so your gels your carbs\nthings like Tailwind or like Morton\nother people like to have sort of like\nreal foods things like sandwiches crisps\nnuts fruit things like that that some a\nstations might be giving out as they go\nround but as I've said it's for you to\nfind the right strategy for you a lot of\nRunners will come into an a station get\nas much stuff as they can and then leave\nthat a station while walking maybe up a\nhill or something like that and then\nkeep on consuming calories and getting\nthat down as they parir on through the\nrace if you can keep the sickness and\nthe digestive issues at Bay and able to\nkeep yourself fueling you have a much\nbetter chance of getting to the finish\nso if you got your training done your\nnutrition done the final big crucial\nthing with Ultras is all about what's\nbetween the ears the mindset ultr\nrunning is around about in my opinion\naround about 90% in the head and about\n10% in the body the physical aspect of\nit dnfs us usually occur because the\nhead has given up far far earlier than\nthe body has things do get tough weather\ncan get bad aches pains blisters\nsickness the distance remaining and you\nlook down watch and it still says 140k\nto go it can be very overwhelming and\nyou start questioning your why so make\nsure you work out your why before you\neven get out there one of the very\ntoughest races that I've ever done when\nI had to push my body and mind further\nthan it had ever gone before Was a Race\nI did in Cape Town 100 km and if you\nwant to watch that that video is coming\nup here keep on working hard guys keep\ndone let let us know how you get on in\nyour Ultra training and racing that's it\nwe see you in the next one",

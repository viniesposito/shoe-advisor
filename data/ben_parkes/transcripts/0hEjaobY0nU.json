  "text": "running a half marathon is an amazing\nachievement for any Runner and what's\neven better well running a half marathon\nfaster than you have ever done before\nwell stay tuned because by the end of\nthis video you'll know exactly what to\ndo to get you that PB we'll go through\neverything what time you should be\naiming for all the sessions that help me\nrun a 67 minute half marathon and how to\nPace the race itself and what I'd also\nrecommend for fueling and hydration\nalong the way but first let's get stuck\ninto the training so how long should you\ngive yourself to train well it's one of\nthe big reasons why I personally love\nthe Half Marathon distance it doesn't\nquite take over your life the way that\nmarathon training does ideally you want\nto allow yourself 12 weeks of training\nthat's how long all of our training\nplans are and you can check those out on\nthe website all our beginner plans for\nthe half marathon are completely free to\ndownload we'll link to all of those down\nbelow I'll also put some good fun and\nfast half marathon races up on the\nscreen now that I've done before and\nalways let us know down in the comments\nsome great half marathon races that\nyou've run to help out the running\ncommunity so people know where those\nfast courses are so what's a realistic\ntime to be aiming for well this\nobviously varies wildly from person to\nperson and your running experience as\nwell for newer Runners out there you're\nlikely going to be able to achieve some\nreally big improvements in those early\nstages 5 10 even 20 minute PBS are\npossible but for more experience Runners\npeople running a little bit longer those\nprogressions do obviously cut a little\nbit shorter as you get a little bit\ncloser to your limit so it might be a\nminute or even just a few seconds but\nthey all count we want to get that\nlittle bit faster if you've never run a\nhalf marathon before then how do we know\nwhat we're capable of well this is a\nRough Guide if you want to run sub 2\nhours you're going to want to be around\nabout sub 60 for your 10K a sub 145 half\nsub 50 for a 10K a sub 1302 sub 43 for a\n10K once you hit those 10K times you're\nready to begin that training Journey to\nhit those half marathon goals and what\nwould our weekly mileage look like for\nsimilar goals well someone that's trying\nto break 2 hours we're looking around 3\nto four runs a week up to around 32\nmiles or 50k of training per week sub\n145 four to five runs a week now up to\naround about 40 Mi or 64k of training\nper week and sub 130 5 to six runs per\nweek up to around about 54 miles of\ntraining 87K per week now I should say\nwith those distance figures they all up\ntwo the figures I've given there going\nto going to be in the peak week of\ntraining with around about 2 weeks to go\nfor the half marathon we're going to\nbuild up have some recovery weeks build\nup have recovery build up and those Peak\nweeks are going to be around about those\nsort of distances see how that feels\nwith you and all that will give you a\nbit of an idea of what you are going to\nbe capable of in a half marathon one of\nthe biggest keys to get faster over the\nHalf Marathon distance and let's face it\nall running distances are doing speed\nsessions during the week in order to run\nthat fastest half we need to get the\nbody used to training faster than the\ngold pace and we do this with speed\nworkouts and interval sessions more\nexperienced Runners will probably want\nto be setting aside two runs a week for\ndoing these speed sessions we'll touch\non that a little bit later on now I've\ngot some really good example sessions\nthat you can try here the first one is a\nprogression run something like 10K in\ntotal distance 3K easy 3K at your half\nmarathon pace 2K at your 10K pace and\nthen 2K cool down afterwards really good\nto get the legs strong for when we're\npushing at the end of a half marathon or\nhow about a mixed Paces Run after round\nabout 10 to 15 minutes of warming up 4X\n1K at your 10K Pace your so current 10K\nPace going straight into 4X 400 m at\nyour 5K Pace taking 2 minutes little\nrecovery walking between each of those\nreps then a 5 to 10 minute cool down and\nthen thirdly one of my favorite sessions\nis gold Pace reps this is 3x 8 at your\nhalf marathon goal Pace with a 2minute\nwalking recovery between each one with\nall of these sessions make sure you do a\ngood warm up and warm down afterwards\nideally trying to get a few little\ndrills in there some proper Dynamic\nstretching before you get into those\nreally fast sections now if you're a\nlittle bit unsure with these type of\nsessions maybe get in touch with your\nlocal running club quite often they will\nbe putting on these type of sessions at\nleast once a week and also you don't\nhave to be running these at a track at\nall just find somewhere flat fast and\ntraffic free and that will be perfect\nconditions to get your runs done now as\nI touched on at the start of this\nsection if you are a fairly experienced\nRunner you may want to add a second\nspeed session during your week\ntraditionally the Tuesday is session\nwill be when you're running reps a lot\nfaster than your goal pace so something\nlike 400s 800s something like that then\nthe second session of the week is going\nto be around about that goal Pace there\nsomething like a tempo run or a\nprogression one where you're building\ninto that goal Pace it will just push\nthat Fitness up even more another big\npart of your training that you want to\nbe getting into your week is running\nstrides now these are bursts of around\nabout 20 seconds of fast running around\nabout 90% effort so not quite all out\nrunning for the bus territory but just a\nlittle bit slower than that and I really\nrecommend putting these at the end of\none of your easy runs during the week if\nyou're new to strides do something like\nthree to four reps of this more\nexperienced Runners up to around about\nsix reps just with a super relaxed easy\njog or just walking between each reps\ntake about 20 to 30 seconds just get\nyour heart rate back down and why we\nwant to be doing things like this it's\nhelping recruit some of those fast\ntwitch muscle fibers to help put in that\nstrong Sprint at the end of the race it\nalso helps really improve our running\neconomy and our running form as well\nit's quite hard to run with poor running\nform when we're running that fast so\nmoving on long runs and easy runs the\nrest of your week should ideally include\na good solid long run and also some easy\nmileage in there as well now a lot of\npeople come to me and say well why can't\nI just do speed sessions and run super\nfast every day well these sessions put a\nlot of stress on our body and that's why\neasy running comes in if we did speed\nsession every day we would just overload\nourselves and pick up some injuries so\nthat's why we do easy runs to recover\nfrom those sessions and it still helps\nbuild that cardiovascular fitness\nrunning nice and easy to help build up\nthat volume safely and build that\nendurance in the heart the body and the\nlungs that we're going to need over the\nHalf Half Marathon distance so how long\nshould our long runs be well for a sub\n2hour training we're talking around\nabout anywhere between 6 and 13 miles\nfor the long run this will again\nprogress as the training goes on so\nearly weeks about 6 miles later on\naround about 13 mil sub 145 we're\ntalking around about between 8 and 14\nmiles sub 130 we're talk anywhere from\n10 to 16 miles as the plan progresses\nthen for the more advanced Runners\nyou're going to want to add some gold\npaace blocks into these long runs as\nwell we want to be putting some blocks\nin here every other week all of our\ntraining plans are set out exactly like\nthis so of course check out VP parks.com\nif you're a little bit unsure you just\nwant to download a guide and follow it\nalong thousands of five star reviews\ngoing check them out we're really proud\nof these plans we produce so we going to\nbe adding some segments at that goal\nPace during our long run about 2 to 3K\nat our go Pace then back to easy then\nback to go Pace then back to easy again\nwe're just getting our body used to\nworking hard towards the end of those\nlong runs really really important I'd\nalso recommend if you can do some of\nyour long runs at the the same time of\nday as your goal race starts so if it's\n8:00 in the morning 8:30 9:00 in the\nmorning have a look when your goal race\nis and do some of your long runs at the\nsame time this gets the body used to\nworking at this time of day and you can\nalso practice your pre-race routine with\nyour breakfast for me as long the CH\nviewers of the channel know that's going\nto be a couple of bagels some peanut\nbutter and jam or jelly for our American\nfriends over the other side of the pond\nand I'm going to have this around about\n2 hours to 990 minutes before the run so\nmy body is nicely fueled ready to go and\nwhen I'm out on the run I'm going to be\npracticing my fueling strategy as well\nwith my gels taking some liquid out\nthere to say nice and hydrated these\nlong runs are a fantastic opportunity\nthe real dress rehearsal for the big day\nyou turn up on the big day there's going\nto be no big surprises in a similar vein\nwe want to be practicing our shoe\nchoices as well on our long runs what's\ngoing to be the most comfortable shoe\nfor the duration of the race that we're\ngoing for are those super lightweight\ncarbon Racing shoes going to be the best\noption will they lead potentially lead\nto some blisters and things like that\nfor me Comfort always wins in these\nthings if you want to get some really\ngood comfortable shoe Choice ideas check\nout this video up here and we'll link to\nit down below another crucial part of\nany half marathon training plan is\ngetting our strength working at least\nonce a week it's especially important\nfor training at these longer distances\nwhere we really need that strength at\nthe back end of a race if you're someone\nthat might have blown up in a race this\ncould be the key to get you that nice\nsolid finish and run strong towards the\nend as a minimum I'd add some strength\ntraining at the end of one of your easy\nruns during the week we've got a\nstrength training add-on that you can\nadd to the half marathon training plans\non the website give you three different\nroutines that you can do at home without\nany equipment at all they all include\nthose basic exercises things like squats\nlunges Bridges and planks as well we'll\nput some other ideas up on the screen\nnow and really try to keep those rest\ndays as fully rest days because that's\nwhen our body is recovering and making\nthose adaptations to become that faster\nstronger Runner that we want so keep\nyour rest as relaxed as you possibly can\nbut add some strength work after an easy\nRunner a little bit later on in the day\nnow you've done all your training race\nday is here and you don't want to go out\nand blow it all within the first 2K as\nunfortunately I've seen so many people\ndoing but not people that subscribe to\nthe Ben Park YouTube channel so whack\nthat subscribe button down below and\nfollow along for lots of great training\ntips for me there's two different ways\nthat you can Pace a half marathon either\nstart a little bit slower than your goal\npace and then speed up as the Run goes\non now this does require a lot of\npatience and control to go out nice and\nrelaxed and just roll into it some of\nour older Runners and I'm getting nearly\nat that sort of stage of my career now\nreally sort of favor this option because\nit does take a little bit longer to get\nwarmed up than it did when you were\nyounger so really good one for some of\nour older Runners out there\nalternatively and what what I usually\ntry and do here is set off simply at my\ngo pace and stick to it with nice even\nsplits throughout the race and then for\nthat last K give it a good kick down at\nthe end now getting this even pacing is\nquite easyish to do if the course is\nnice and flat and level and there's no\nHills in it so do some research on the\ncourse that you're doing how many sharp\nturns are there how many Hills are there\nthings like that there's some nasty\nlittle Hills towards the end of the race\nthat you might need to hold some energy\nback before it's another crucial way of\nrunning that fast off to do that course\npreparation ask some friends about it\nmaybe potentially go and cycle the\ncourse before if it's a local one could\nyou go and run it over a couple of your\nlong runs and just see what it's like\nget a feel for what that course is going\nto be like for me when I'm doing my race\nI simply use lap Pace on my watch and my\nwatch ticks over with every kilometer\nand I'm just looking at that lap pace\nfor just that particular kilometer that\nI'm running in at that moment so if I'm\ntrying to run say uh5 half marathon I'm\njust trying to make sure that's set\nnicely at 330 a k pace as I go on just a\nlittle bit under that sort of gold Pace\nCU some races and GP ches are never that\naccurate so always try and run just a\nlittle bit ahead of my goal pace for\nwhat my watch is saying potentially a\nlot of races there will be Paces as well\nso you can get stuck in to a pacing\ngroup if you're not sure reach out to\nthe race and see if they've got a pacing\ngroup this takes away a lot of that\nextra mental work that you're having to\ngo through to keep nicely on Pace now\nlet's have a chat about Fuel and\nhydration during the race now for me I\nalways recommend taking a gel around\nabout every 30 to 40 minutes during\npretty much any running I'm doing really\nand every half marathon I've done I've\nnormally taken two to three gels with me\nand I take one on the start line and\nI've got two for the race obviously\ndepends how long you going be running\nfor with how many gels you need for some\npeople it be three some people it might\nbe four gels over the course of the race\nnow in terms of hydration it's highly\nlikely they're going to have some stuff\nout on the course that you can get as\nyou go round but of course check how\nmany water stations or maybe energy\ndrink stations they're going to have out\nthere don't try anything new on race day\nis the old average so if you haven't had\nthe energy drink they're giving out if\nyou haven't had the energy gels they're\ngiving out it's probably not a good time\nto test what they're going to be like\nhave a look what gels they're giving out\nif you want to use them get some ordered\nin and test them in your training and\nthen you can use them on the race day\nabsolutely fine I always say to Simply\ndrink to thirst I'm thirsty I get some\nwater down as I go around for me I just\nlike to have a little little and often\nfor a lot of races that I do there only\none every other water station I'm just\ngoing to go in get some down if it's hot\none over the head something like that\njust to keep myself nice and cool don't\nfeel you need to like chug a load of\nbottles and again like a lot of things\ndo what you would normally do in your\ntraining perfect that routine if it is a\nlittle bit hotter out there potentially\nget some electrolytes in before you go\naround as well running a half marathon\nflast out is really really difficult but\nbelieve me it feels amazing when you can\njump and across the line with that big\nsmile on the face knowing you've given\nit your all and you've achieved your K\nif you need some more training on the\nHalf Marathon distance then check out\nthe plans on benp parks.com if you're\ninterested in running a 130 half then\ncheck out this video up here next if you\nwant to see my pre pre-race routine then\ncheck out this video down here keep on\nworking hard guys keep on done we see\nyou very soon in the next one",

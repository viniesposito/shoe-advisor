  "text": "running is simple right just lace up\nyour shoes and go but as easy as it\nseems there are some classic mistakes\nthat can turn your runs into struggles\nstruggles into problems and problems\nmeans you're not going to be enjoying a\nrunning as much as you deserve so today\nwe're breaking down the most common\nrunning slip-ups from doing too much too\nsoon to not hydrating and fueling your\nruns properly I'm going to be showing\nyou exactly how to avoid them to run\nsmarter stay injury free and enjoy your\nrunning even more right let's get\nstraight into this starting out we're\ngoing to be chatting about not fueling\nand hydrating your runs properly this\nwill become increasingly important as\nour runs get longer for everybody out\nthere training for half marathons and\nmarathons and potentially longer than\nthat for your longer runs you want to be\ntaking some sort of fuel throughout the\nrun to keep your energy source topped up\nand running strong till the end so if\nyou're going out for 60 minutes or more\nthen consider taking some gels or an\nalternative fuel whatever suits you you\nshould be taking around about 30 G worth\nof carbohydrates taking this around\nabout every 35 to 45 minutes and this is\nreally why most people struggle on their\nlong runs because they don't fuel early\nenough they wait till they get tired you\ngot to top up these stores early and\noften also make sure you're starting out\nthe Run feeling fueled and hydrated\nbeforehand this of course depends on the\ntime of day for me it's always that\nclassic bagel and then I'm going to be\nrunning about an hour after that\nnutrition and hydration is so much about\ntrial and error what works for for\nsomeone might not necessarily work for\nsomebody else so experiment a lot try\nwith lots of different things and then\ncome race dat it will all click because\nyou know exactly what you should be\ndoing next up I want to have a quick\nchat about running with poor form few of\nus were ever really taught how to run\nand consequently we pick up a lot of bad\nhabits that are hard to unte but there\nare a few basic things we can do to\nconcentrate on improving our form\ngetting ourselves covering the ground in\na more efficient way starting out make\nsure we're not over striding this is\nwhen you land with your foot out in\nfront of you and this is going to create\na breaking force and put a lot of strain\non your joints as well we want to be\nfocused having that foot Landing nicely\nunderneath our Center of mass underneath\nour body which is when we're going to be\nable to absorb that impact nicely and\nthen spring off with the next stride\nwith our posture we want to make sure we\nhave a slight forward lean from the\nankles not from the waist this will\nreally help you to get that correct foot\nplacement that we've just talked about\nabout and then finally our Cadence this\nis the number of steps we take per\nminute as we run newer Runners typically\nhave quite a low Cadence maybe 150 160\nsteps a minute there are lots of ways we\ncan increase this that's all for a\nseparate video we'll link to our Cadence\nvideo up here and down below moving on I\nwant to have a quick chat about strength\ntraining yes it's a bit boring but it's\nso important especially for older\nRunners getting that right balance can\nbe quite hard getting worried you don't\nwant to overdo your strength training\nbecause that might impact your running\nyou're going to get even more achy\nmuscles in those early days of strength\ntraining your body's not going to be\nused to it so you may get some achy\nmuscles you may have to dial down your\nrunning a little bit as your body adapts\nand becomes stronger and then we can\nstart to build the running back in I'd\nreally recommend in those early days\njust one strength session a week will\nhave a really positive impact on your\nrunning it doesn't have to be long or\nsuper intense you can simply do this at\nhome with just some basic exercises like\nsome squats some bridges some planks\nsome lunges and some Cal races you can\neven do a lot of these on the run as\nwell just stop for 10 or 15 minutes and\ndo these when you're out on the run I\nlike to do these always on my easy run\nday so I do an easy run in the morning\nand then my strength training in the\nafternoon as I believe it's really\nimportant to keep those rest days as for\nrest days next up don't do too much too\nsoon now you might be new to running or\ncoming back after an injy sometimes it's\ndifficult to know exactly what you're\ncapable of and it's easy to get carried\naway with maybe running too far too fast\nor too frequently as well or potentially\na combination of all three injuries can\nstart cropping up which forces us to\nhave time off no one wants to be doing\nthat when the golden rule of running is\ntrying to achieve that consistency and\nthat's what's going to make us a better\nfaster stronger happier Runner overall\nnow you may have heard of the 10% Ru\nwhich basically says don't increase your\nweekly volume by more more than 10% per\nweek while this can work for a lot of\nrunners in that middle band from We're\nexperienced Runners they're going to\nramp up far too quickly and for some\nnewer beginner Runners it's not going to\nbe challenging enough so it's all about\nusing that 10% rule as a rough guide and\njust adapting it for where you are in\nyour training and of course it doesn't\ntake into account intensity that we're\nbuilding into our weeks as well so I'd\nreally recommend as you're starting to\nbuild things up in your training just\nchange one thing at a time time\nfrequency or intensity don't go adding\nloads more time to your runs doing more\nruns and doing them faster as well\nthat's going to lead to some injury just\nchange one thing maybe per week and\nbuild it up gradually like that I'd\nreally recommend take recovery weeks as\nwell to let our body adapt that doesn't\nmean of course we can't go for a run\nthis is going to be a week every 3 to\nfour weeks there's going to be less\nvolume during this week and there's\ngoing to be less intensity during the\nweek as well allowing our body time to\nrecover I'd really recommend always\nfollowing a your training plan which we\nhave on the website link down below at\nbenp parks.com all our beginner plans\nare completely free to download it's\ngoing and check those out there's links\nto marathon training plans half\nmarathons 5Ks 10ks Ultra plans all on\nthere with thousands of fstar reviews\nfrom loads of Runners all around the\nworld that have been using our plans for\nyears and achieve some great results and\nthen finally in this section simply\nlistening to your body your body is the\nbest indicator for how well you are\nadapting to your training if you are\nfeeling more tired than normal then rest\nup if you got particularly achy muscles\nthen rest up if your mojo is just a\nlittle bit low lacking is some\nmotivation then rest up which leads us\nreally nicely on to the next common\nmistake which is ignoring pain when our\nbody is telling us that something isn't\nquite right we're so often taught to\npush through pain no pain no gain\nmentality and it's most likely going to\nlead to an injury and some time off from\nrunning if you are getting some pains be\nflexible with your training consider\nyour training plan as a Rough Guide but\ndon't worry if you have to miss a few\nruns here and there just to allow your\nbody to fix that pain that it's\nexperiencing flexibility is so important\nover the long term as we're trying to\nachieve that consistency definitely seek\nsome professional advice if you can\nafford to of course that's not going to\nbe available for everybody but getting\nsome professional advice from a physio\nor even a sports massage therapist and\nthen you will know exactly what to do to\nfix that pain and get it out of your\nlife and get back running stronger so\nmany running injuries can be fixed by\nsimply resting icing heat treatment\nstretching massaging and doing strength\nwork as well so a lot of the time it's\nnot something to be particularly worried\nabout or scared of but get that\nprofessional advice if you can afford to\nif you can't then I always recommend\nchecking out people like Bob and Brad\nhere on YouTube they've got an excellent\nChannel but you've just got to make sure\nyou're 100% sure with that self\ndiagnosis and just build that into your\nstrength routine to get that injury gone\nnext up is an alltime classic everybody\ndoes this I think when they start\nrunning myself included running too fast\npeople head out the door and absolutely\ntear it down the road running far too\nfast and before they know it they've got\ntheir hands on knees thinking this\nrunning lck is really quite difficult it\nputs so much extra stress on our body\ntraining this way and it's really not\nthe best way of running fast in the long\nterm with our running either what I\nalways like to do with my running is\naround about 80% of my training a week\nwill be at a low heart rate a\nconversational Pace Zone 2 heart rate\nzone 2 training however you want to\nphrase it the kind of training at that\nintensity as you're running along you\ncould have a chat with a friend as you\ngo and then the 20% of the week we're\ntalking about some more structured\ntraining some intervals some faster Pac\nrunning some thresholds things like that\nand again a lot of people can be guilty\nof running these too fast as well going\nout to smash their K reps as fast as\nthey can this again can lead to\novertraining as well so if you're really\nunsure about how fast you should be\nrunning download one of our completely\nfree pacing guides and it would just\ngive you an idea of how fast to run your\neasy runs at how fast to run your\nintervals at it's going to be a really\ngood guide that you can take in your\ntraining so why this is so important\nit's going to allow us to build up our\nmileage safely build that endurance\nbuild our cardiovascular system without\noverly straining our body right put your\nhands up if you're guilty of not warming\nup before your runs I am definitely\nguilty of this when I was running in my\n20s I was and then what once you get\ninto your 30s and now into my 40s you\njust can't get away with it warming up\nproperly and getting the body ready for\nrunning especially in the colder months\nas we're experiencing now again it will\nreally help reduce that risk of picking\nup injuries you're most likely to inj\nyourself by pulling a muscle of\nstraining a muscle in those first few\nminutes of a run I know a lot of us are\nparticularly time poor these days but it\nreally does take just 5 minutes of doing\nsome dynamic stretches so things like\nleg swings opening and closing the gate\nsome hamstring stretches are really\ngoing to help you Ease Into The Run\nwe'll link to our complete follow along\nalong warm-up video up here and down\nbelow and then finally I just say ease\ninto your run as well it's a very slow\njog for that first K on my run today my\nfirst opening K was just over 5 minutes\nbut my overall average for the Run was 4\nminutes 26 okay just treat that opening\nK as very gentle very relaxed as you get\ngoing and then you can speed up and warm\nup to the average pace that you want to\ndo for the whole run another one I've\nbeen guilty I've been guilty of a lot of\ndays today it's basically not resting\nenough rest days really are part of our\noverall training this is when we're\ngoing to be making those all important\nadaptations and our muscles can rebuild\nafter the tough training sessions we've\nbeen putting them through in my own\ntraining I always treat rest days as\nfull rest days no cross training no\nstrength training definitely no running\nhow many rest days is going to depend on\nthe individual for me it's always once\nper week now it used to be once every\nabout 12 or 13 days but as we get a\nlittle bit older we need a little bit\nmore rest in our routine when to put\nthese in during the week point it's\nusually a good idea after a hard session\nafter a long run and then also when you\nare having that little bit of chill time\nrelaxing and resting you can be doing\nthat in your rest day sweater or rest\nday te which you can pick out from my\nwebsite benp parks.com we ship all\naround the world and feel free to use\ncode youtube1 for 10% off your order\nnext up we just want to touch on\noveranalyzing everything we're doing\ngetting bogged down in all that we're\ncollecting on our devices there's so\nmany different running gadgets these\ndays analyzing everything we're doing\nheart rate monitors lact tape monitors\nfoot pods there's so much data that can\nbe analyzed and of course it can be\nincredibly useful in improving our\nrunning but equally it can be damaging\nand demoralizing at certain times as\nwell remember with our running progress\nis not linear and it does take time as\nwell you'll always have good days and\nbad days as part of your training and\nthese can't always necessarily be\nexplained we're complex human beings\nthere are so many other factors that can\naffect our running nutrition life\nstresses are mood I always say it's\ncompletely fine to turn these features\noff use them when you feel comfortable\nusing them if your garment is telling\nyou you're unproductive just a few days\nbefore your goal race maybe your heart\nrate is a bit elevated maybe you're a\nbit stressed about everything and then\nit goes and tells you you're\nunproductive it's really not going to\nput you in a very good head space when\nin fact you could be in the form of your\nlife you're just a little bit stressed\nabout about the travel and everything\nthat's going on out there our gadgets\nare only as good as the data that we're\nfeeding into them and we don't always\nknow it's that accurate either so it's\nall about knowing the relationship you\nhave with these gadgets and devices\nthey're not always correct they're not\nalways right they can be but just take\neverything with a bit of a pinch of salt\nand see how do you feel inside and that\nis the most important thing right our\nlast one now is especially important in\n2024 is simply comparing yourself to\nothers or other people on social media\nof course it's really good to follow\npeople for inspiration and ideas\npotentially for your own training but\ntry not to compare your training to\ntheirs how fast they're going where\nthey're running who they're running with\nremember everyone's on their own Journey\neveryone's got different life stresses\nin their life different experience\nlevels you really will never see that\nfull picture on social media apps like\nstraa can be really great for tracking\nyour own progress but it's really\nimportant to keep that ego in check St\ntrying to impress your mates to keep\nyour easy runs nice and easy and of\ncourse as with any social media it's\ncompletely fine to take a break I've had\nto a few times over the years where my\nmental health has not been in a good\nplace to be on social media contrary to\nwhat everybody says the runs really do\nstill count if they aren't on straa or\nyou can just keep them private and go\nback on straa when you feel ready to go\nout there and share your running Journey\nagain there's so much to think about\nhere have I missed any what running\nmistakes have you made over the years\nand how have you overcome them let me\nknow down in the comments and help out\nthe running Community as well please\ncheck out my website benp parks.com and\nfeel free to use that code you 10 for\n10% off anything you fancy there and it\nreally helps to support the channel and\nsupport everything we do that's it guys\nlots of love keep on working hard keep\ndone we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

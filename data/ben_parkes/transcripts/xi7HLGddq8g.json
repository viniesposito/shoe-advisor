  "text": "the Nike Pegasus has always been a firm\nfavorite of long Runners for such a long\ntime but over the last four years as\nrunning shoe technology has advanced so\nquickly that Pegasus has really started\nto lag behind its competitors big fans\nof the historic Nike Pegasus have been\ncrying out for updates especially to the\noutdated midsole and Nike have finally\ngiven us that in the shoe but not\nwithout a considerable hike in price so\nNike now finally caught up and produced\na 10 out of 10 daily trainer and if so\nis it going to be worth that extra hike\nin price so I'm three runs in to the\nPegasus 41 now thought what better time\nto put my thoughts down on paper and\nbring you this video right let's start\nout chatting about all of the\ndifferences between this version 41 and\nthe outgoing version 40 but before we do\nof course as I do with all the reviews\non the channel I bought this shoe 100%\nwith my own money to give you that\ncompletely impartial 100% honest review\nas I would always do so thank you to\neverybody liking commenting and sharing\nthis video it really helps support the\nchannel and allows us to keep on doing\nthat all right let's talk about the\nchanges the first one is this updated\nmesh upper it's now a slightly lighter\nweight and a little bit more breathable\nas well little bit more cushioning\naround the ankle and through the tongue\nas well a really nice update the second\none the all important one with this\nupdate Nike's new react X foam which now\nruns the whole length of the shoe we\nwere stuck with Nike's very outdated\nreact foam in versions 37 to 40 so a\nfantastic update there we've got an\nextra 4 mm stack height in the shoe and\nit's now \u00a315 more expensive here in the\nUK right let's get stuck into all of the\nfacts and figures so purpose of the shoe\nlike this this is your daily trainer\nsuitable for all different types of runs\nI'd say up to around about the Half\nMarathon distance in terms of price I\nshowed out 130 of my hard-earned British\npounds 10 mm drop here with a 37 mil\nstack at the back of the shoe giving a\n27 mil stack at the front of the shoe in\nterms of Weight Wise I measured this\nexactly the same as my outgo model 347 G\nfor me in my UK size 12 it's a neutral\nshoe and it has this lovely engineered\nmesh upper as I say really nice and\nbreathable getting good air flow through\nthere as well the midsole as we've just\ndiscussed now ful length react X foam\nhere and Nike have kept their two Air\nZoom units just g a little bit of extra\nbounciness in the shoe one at the front\nof the shoe and one at the back of the\nshoe there's no carbon plate in this\nshoe and it has this lovely waffle outs\nsoole rubber in this shoe lovely and\ngrippy and super super durable as well\nthere's no different width options\navailable certainly not at launch anyway\nmaybe that will come in time terms of\ncolorways we've got two at launch in the\nUK USA you're very lucky you got six to\nchoose from and as a side note you can\nget this in the Nikes by you choose your\nown colorway options and that is now\n155 here in the UK and this was true to\nsize for me right let's get stck into\nthe likes right we've got three likes to\nget through my first one is this updated\nreact X phone it is so much more\nimproved from the outgoing version Nike\nsay it's 13% more responsive and it's\nalso helped to reduce Nike's carbon Foo\nPit by 43% when producing the mid Sal of\nthis shoe yes it's just a lot more\nspringy lot more responsive with those\nAir Zoom pods in there as well and\nfinally a Nike P shoe has got a bit more\nlife about it it's a little bit more fun\nto run in it's a little bit more\nengaging to run in and you don't feel\nlike you're running around with two big\nblocks of lead on your feet my second\nlike with the shoe is the allaround\nComfort fantastic amount of padding in\nthe tongue and the ankle getting a\nreally good lock down fit in the shoe\nand a nice even amount of pressure all\nover the front of the foot here really\nlike what they've done with this lacing\nlock down system here it works really\nwell if you're someone that likes to\nheal lace lock I didn't get any sort of\nankle stip in this shoe but if you do\nthe laces are long enough for that if\nyou are someone that runs in some hotter\nclimates I would worry a little bit\nabout some potential overheating this\nshoe but for me in the UK even in the\nsummer here it's been absolutely fine\nand my third like with the shoe is this\nwider toe box combined with this waffle\noutsole provides a really solid nice\nplatform your feet have got a lot of\nspace in the front of the shoe here\nreally good footplay and really good\nsupport as you run along now of course\nI'd love to see Nike offer this shoe in\na wider option but for me I do have\nquite narrow feet but they had plenty of\nspace up the front here and I know this\nshoe will last a long time Pegasus is\nalways due this hasn't changed this will\nbe good for 5 600 miles and I've also\nspent quite a lot of time in the gym\nwith this shoe as well and he's got\nreally good stability that wider\nplatform with that outsole really good\nstability for doing weights and I've\nreally enjoyed it using the shoe for\nthat stability and you can really feel\nthat in cornering but let's move on to\nchat about the dislikes my first one\nhere is this really is not a far shoe if\nyou're looking for something to do some\nspeed workor some races this really is\nnot the one to be going for this shoe\nreally is built for all around comfort\nand all all around durability as well\nthere really are a lot better options\nout there if you're looking for that\nallout speed shoe we'll come on to that\nlater and the second disc like with the\nshoe is it's had a pretty significant\nprice hike and it now takes it from that\nsort of lower range more Budgy shoe I\nhate to say1 shoe was a budget is shoe\nbut in today's modern world that kind of\nis takes it from that up until that mid\ntier shoes and it's now really competing\nwith the Max 6 is with the Nova blast of\nthis world and it's just a lot better\ncom competition around at this price\npoint Nike always had that thing with\nthe Pegasus it always really undercut\neverybody and it's now really slap bang\nin the middle of a super competitive\ndaily shoe market right so let's bring\nthis all together my conclusion who is\nthis shoe for do I recommend it is it\ngoing into my rotation well if you're\nthe type of Runner that runs maybe two\nto three times a week wears the same\nshoe at the gym maybe play some other\nsports in your shoes as well travel in\nit go shopping in it then this is a\nreally good solid 7 out of 10 for all of\nthose different options if you like the\nprevious versions you're going to like\nthis one as well it's a perfectly fine\nokay shoe to get your basic runs done in\nis it worth going to buy the discounted\noutgoing version 40 or this one I'd\nreally say try and find this one if you\nwant to buy the Pegasus this one is a\nmassive step up on that outgoing version\n40 the new foam is so much more fun and\nengaging to run in and it really is just\nthat classic Pegasus do- it- all type\nshoe it's a perfectly fine okay\nacceptable shoe to run in but if you're\nlooking for a more of a dead ated\nrunning shoe you're a bit more serious\nRunner out there the Nike Zone Vero 17\nis a lot livelier it's a lot faster and\nit's a lot more engaging ride with that\nshoe because it's got Nike's zoomx in\nthere built into the midsole which is\njust a lot more fun and reactive to run\nin and it has all the durability of the\nPegasus line as well and then look at\nsome other brands Hoka Max 6 ax Nova\nblast now these are at the same sort of\nprice point as the shoes we've got to\ntalk about them in this debate they've\ngot far superior Foams in there compared\nto the react X much lighter much more\nresponsive and a lot more cushioning in\nthe shoe as well and personally that's\nwhere I'd be choosing to spend my money\nif I just had around that\n13540 to spend on a shoe I really do\nfeel Nike can't win with the Pegasus\nline it's got millions of big fans all\nover the world that will not want this\nrecipe to change they've tweaked the\nphone for the better no doubt but it's\nstill the same fundamental shoe perfect\nfor that beginner novice or casual\nRunner or the more advanced Runner\nthat's looking to get away from all the\nMac stack height shoes out there and\njust wants a little bit more feel at 27\nmil that's now quite a minimal shoe out\nthere as crazy that is and it's really\nquite nice be able to feel that ground a\nlittle bit more of an old school ride\nyes I'll be keeping the shoe without a\ndoubt I've really enjoyed using at the\ngym just casually out and about as well\nbut for me I'm super excited about the\nsupposed upcoming I'm sure it is coming\nNike Pegasus turbo when we're going to\nget a lot more zoom X foam in here f\ncross that is coming soon and when Nike\nwill hopefully finally deliver a\nfantastic allaround daily shoe which is\nso badly missing from their lineup at\nthe moment to rival or potentially\nbetter the likes of the as6 NOA blast\nand the hoker Clifton and the hoker Max\n6 as well and of course I'll be getting\nthat shoe as soon as it drops I'm so\nexcited for it the most exciting shoe\nI've got this year or maybe the super\nBlast 2 I don't know so that's it guys\nlet me know your thoughts down in the\ncomments are you going to be getting the\nversion 41 what do you think about it\nwhat do you think about this crazy\ncolorway I love this I've love wearing\nit casually I've love running it videos\ncoming up next you can check out the\nhoko Max 6 review up here or down here\nyou can check out my aex Nova blast 4\nreview keep on working hard guys keep my\ndone let me know your thoughts down\nbelow and we'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

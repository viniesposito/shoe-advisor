  "text": "a lot of people get into running because\nit's assumed it's a relatively cheap\nsport compared to others all you really\nneed is a pair of shoes right well like\nwith most Hobbies the more you get into\nit the more money it seems to drain out\nof you it's so easy to be influenced\ninto thinking we need the most expensive\nrunning shoes the latest tech but most\nof the time it really isn't necessary\nrunning on a budget doesn't mean we have\nto sacrifice our running experience So\ntoday we're going to be exploring loads\nof affordable options to show that\nrunning can be accessible to everyone no\nmatter what your budget is right let's\nstart out chatting about events running\nevents can really cost a fortune I was\nlucky enough to run New York Marathon\nlast year and it cost me nearly\n\u00a3400 just for the privilege of being on\nthe start line well thankfully there's a\nlot of much cheaper options out there\nstarting out with park run which is\ncompletely free if you've never done a\npark run this is simply a 5K run every\nSaturday morning available at loads of\nlocations all around the world it's got\na really fantastic Community Vibe about\nit and you get a time when you finish as\nwell as a lot of people know park run\nisn't a race but if you do want to do a\nrace and get an official time we' really\nrecommend getting in touch with your\nlocal running clubs in the local area\nrunning clubs are very rarely profit\ndriven and they like to put on little\nlocal lowkey races and all the ones I've\never done have had a fantastic Vibe\nabout them my own club here in London\nSerpentine hosts the last Friday of the\nmonth 5K and it cost just \u00a36 to enter so\nwhat I recommend is just simply Googling\nyour local running club so if you live\nin Manchester put Manchester running\nclubs Newcastle Newcastle running clubs\nsee the events they put on look at their\nevent sections and go out and check some\nof those ones out I guarantee there'll\nbe some really good value for money\noptions Trail Races tend to cost a lot\nmore money to put on so the entry fees\nare always a little bit higher one way\nyou can get some really good free\noptions out there is by doing some\nvolunteering in those races and quite\noften the organizers will give you a\nfree place for the following year\nCenturion down here in the south UK are\nreally good at offering this if you\nvolunteer one of their events you can\nget a free entry K wrath is another one\nif you volunteer then they give you a\nreally good discount on next year's\nentry so maybe get in touch with some of\nyour local Trail organizations and see\nif you can volunteer and maybe get a\ndiscounted or free entry into the race\nof the year after quite often there's a\nlot of community and group runs if you\ndid live in some of the biggest cities\naround the world we got a big one here\nat the moment from tracksmith put on by\nour friend of ours called AMR he gets so\nmany people turning up every week for\nthis free community group run they're\nrunning at lots of different Paces as\nwell doesn't cost anything we'll link\ntheir details Down Below in London but\nas I said just like before just Google\nManchester Newcastle Edinburgh community\ngroup runs and hopefully something will\ncome up a lot of run shops will'll put\nthese on as well so maybe get in touch\nwith a local Running Shop and see if\nthey're putting on some group runs and\nthen finally with all of this join your\nlocal running club if you can afford it\nmy local running club here \u00a345 for a\nwhole year they also offer discounts if\nyou're unemployed over 65 or a student\nthings like that for just2 a year\nfantastic Valley lots of free coaching\nthat you get with that as well unlimited\ngroup group runs and then finally run\nthrough put on a lot of big events all\naround the UK a lot of races I'm not\nsaying they're great value for money but\nthey're not too bad but they also have\nWhat's called the run through Foundation\nbringing a free Mass big sporting events\nto lower income areas around the UK\nright guys moving on to the all\nimportant running shoes so cheap doesn't\nhave to mean poor quality and poor\nperformance we've tested many budget\nrunning shoes here on the channel over\nthe years and while some were really\nreally bad and disappointing others did\nperform actually quite well and better\nthan some of the more expensive options\nout there two of my really big favorites\nwant to check out the Reebok float ride\nseries you talking around about 50 or 60\na pair or the pummer velocity Nitro\nseries as well we're on to Nitro 3 at\nthe moment about 80 or 90 for some\npumers there really good to seek out\nlast year's models as well newer shoes\ndon't always mean better like a lot of\nthings in life when the new version\ncomes out the old model will be on\ndiscount some really Dependable Classics\nyou can look for over the years things\nlike the aex Nova blast series series\nthe Nike Pegasus series The New Balance\n1080 series or something like the hoker\nClifton and then finally there's good\noptions out there to buy secondhand\nshoes now I buy a lot of running shoes\nevery year mainly to review here on the\nchannel and because I buy all of them\nmyself to give you completely impartial\n100% honest reviews we sell a lot of\nthose on eBay and vintage as well and\nthese are really good marketplac to have\na look you can look at Facebook\nMarketplace or some of the groups like\nrunning gear buy and sell on Facebook\nthat people that will sell pretty much\nnearly new shoes shoes a lot of running\nretailers you can't send things back so\nif people get shoes they don't quite\nlike they're going to be selling them\nthey might have only done a few miles in\nthere just to test them out so you can\npick up some really good secondhand\nBargains I would say don't try and buy\nshoes that are more than like one or two\nyears old really because of the foam and\nthe glues just don't tend to last that\nlong but if you are looking for some\nnewer clothes kit and gear some really\ngood brands that offer exceptional value\nBrands like Ron Hill the legendary Ron\nHill one of the best ever British\nMarathon out there Company still going\nstrong making some really good value\nproducts and also Classics like the\nCatalin Brands like high five you can\nget some really great deals on high five\ngels fantastic value and really good\nproduct as well it's scored really well\nwhen I've been testing out their gels\nthings like goodar for some fantastic\nsunglasses really good polarized options\nfor not a lot of money and a brand\ncalled at Tru which is a new running\nshoe brand out there we've tested out\nsome of their shoes as well all being\nreally really good options so let me\nknow down in the comments your best\nrunning Brands out there that offers\nsome really good value and where You'\nlike to find all of your Bargains and\nthen finally have a look at some Sal\nsection on some website I've got a sale\nSection on my website and a lucky di\nsection as well where we sometimes sell\noff some slightly damage or seconds or\nsamples and things like that so we'll\nlink to that section down below as well\ncheck out benp parks.com where you can\nfind amazing running hats technical gear\nand trading plans to help with your\nrunning now a lot of people when they\nget into running they don't invest too\nmuch in New Gear a lot of people say go\nand get a watch now if you can't really\nafford a watch then I just recommend\ndownloading driver on your phone and it\nwill track your mileage and your\ndistance and your time and get all those\nreally basic things that you need to be\ntracking during your running but if you\ndid want to get yourself a running watch\nthen have a look at something like the\nGarmin 55 for around about \u00a3 150\nfantastic value it has really all the\nrunning data that most people will ever\nneed choros I think got the pace three\njust over \u00a3200 some of these watches\nmight seem a little bit basic but I see\nso many people spending so much money on\nrunning watches and then use like 5% of\nthe features on them or you can suiz get\nsome older discounted models on websites\nlike C I've always gone into store with\nCX just to check what it's like but I've\nbought a few watches in there over the\nyears and they always worked out really\nwell but I always like to just go into\nthe shop first to see what the\nconditions like see if I got any\nscratches and things like that you can\nsell your old watches to them or buy new\nwatches off them well cheap running kit\ncan be great there's also an argument of\nyou get what you pay for spending a\nlittle bit more money on your kit can\nmean it's less likely to break or fall\napart it will last a hell of a lot\nlonger for you saving a lot of money in\nthe long term for example I bought four\npairs of Saw shorts I've actually got a\npair on here this evening about 4 years\nago and I wear them pretty much all day\nevery day and they're still going strong\nI've done thousands of kilometers in\nthem the quality has been absolutely\nfantastic there some really good brands\nthing like saw tracksmith Lululemon\nthings like that Mak some really good\nquality gear now when we race on the\ntrails you tend to need a lot of a quite\nexpensive gear to be able to do there's\na lot of mandatory kit and things like\nthat myself and Sarah usually share some\nsome of the items that we have with\nother Runners around and they share some\nstuff with us for example we did a race\nlast year where we needed some spikes\nwhat are they called Sarah micro\n micro spikes and we didn't want to\ngo out and spend \u00a3100 on those so we\nborrowed some off some of our running\nfriends around so ask again in your\nlocal community asking your running club\nmaybe on Facebook groups and things like\nthat if you just want to borrow\nsomething that's a mandatory kit item\nfor a race if you can't afford to buy a\nlot of these things there is an\norganization here in the UK called into\nUltra which aims to rake ultra running a\nlittle bit more accessible by providing\nsort of help and discounted options with\nrace entries kit and training as well\nyou can borrow some equipment off them\nso if that appeals you then again we'll\nlink to their details down below right\ntwo more things to go through second\nfrom last all about run commuting I used\nto really like doing this type of thing\nback in the day and I still run to\nmeetings that I have in London as well\nturning up a little bit sweaty but I'm\ngetting my run done you'll also save a\nlot of money on your travel class safe\ntime because you're getting your run\ndone while you would ordinarily be\ncommuting so maybe see if that's an\noption for you and then finally looking\nout for some affordable training plans\nthat can help with your running of\ncourse we have these on our website all\nof our beginner plans are completely\n100% free no catch at all just go on\nthere and download them we offer a lot\nof really good value I feel we do offer\nreally good value with all of the\ntraining plans we have on the website so\nif you want to know more all about cheap\nrunning shoes and which ones to avoid we\nbought the very cheapest running shoes\nfrom all the biggest brands out there in\nthe world so check that video that's\ncoming up next",

  "text": "the running shoe market is packed with\noptions these days the shoes for every\ndifferent type of run Racing shoes long\nrun shoes speed session shoes recovery\nRun shoes you name it the manufacturers\nare making it and while the\nmanufacturers are loving all of these\ndifferent types of shoes because they're\npersuading us to go out there and buy\nthese massive shoe rotations for some\npeople it's just not possible or even\nnecessary they just want that one shoe\nto do it all so if that's you you're\nafter a single pair of running shoes\nthat can handle just about everything\npretty well then you're in the right\nplace I'm going be breaking down my top\npicks for those daily running shoes\nshoes that are reliable versatile\ncomfortable shoes that you can go for an\neasy jogging pick up the pacing and even\nget on the start line of a race if you\nwant to I've got eight shoes to take you\nthrough here across four different price\ncategories there's going to be something\nhere for everybody and I'll give you my\nfavorite one at the end of the video so\nstay tuned for that as always here on\nthe channel I bought all of these shoes\n100% with my own money to give you that\ncompletely honest unbiased review and I\njust want to say a big thank you to\neverybody that supports the channel by\nliking the videos sharing with their\nfriends subscribing to the

supporting the channel\nand Ena us to review product as it\nshould be completely unbiased and\nunsponsored right let's get stuck into\nall of the shoes now we're going to be\nstarting out with the cheapest going to\nthe most expensive the first one being\nthat sub 120 category starting out with\nthe Adidas SL 2 priz VI the Adidas SL2\nsent me back\n\u00a310 stack kite 36 mil and a 9 mm drop\nWeight Wise a lovely 287 G for me in my\nUK size 12 which was a little bit too\nsmall so I'd recommend if you're looking\nat this shoe going half a size up the\nmidso we've got a layer of that lovely\nLight Strike Pro which is aded as most\npremium foam and that's sandwiched\nbetween two layers of the Light Strike\n2.0 for that durability to make the shoe\nlast that little bit longer and there's\nno plate of any description in this shoe\nas I said sizing wise these do run a\nlittle bit small so I'd say go half a\nsize up I got my normal size and they\nwere kind of okay but if I was going\nback for another pair I would go half a\nsize up right let's start out with my\nlights with the shoe it's super\nlightweight it's Snappy and it's fun as\nwell the midsole offers a really\nengaging ride in the shoe it's got a\nreally good turn of speed for something\nat this price point that's pretty much\nunheard of of course it's not as fast as\na shoe with the plates and the rods and\nthings like that in but it really does\nwell regardless of that and at this\nprice point it's fantastic I really like\nthe Foams they've used in the shoe as\nwell sandwiching that Durable foam in\nbetween a layer of that really nice\nlightweight engaging soft springy\nresponsive foam in there as well I'm not\nquite sure why Adidas have done this\nbecause one of their very cheapest shoes\nreally is one of their absolute standout\nsuccesses of the year in my opinion\nhe've also got really good durability\nwith the shoe and it's also been really\nversatile the outso grip was fantastic\nwhen I tested this so a good winter\nrunning option with my dislikes to the\nshoe as always it's not all smiles if\nyou do have wide feet this is probably\ngoing to be one to miss Adidas shoes\ngenerally are on the narrow side and\nthis one is especially narrow\nunfortunately also on the dislikes it\nmight be just a little bit too soft for\nsome people and it's not the best in the\ncorners a little bit unstable because\nit's so narrow there but overall a\nreally fantastic value show out there\none I'd wholeheartedly recommend for\ngetting the majority of your runs done\nreally well but price is a really big\nfactor in your buying decisions and I've\ngot another one coming up now which is\nthe Puma velocity Nitro 3 price-wise\nthis sent me back\n\u00a3110 now you can usually find this one a\nlittle bit cheaper stack outut of the\nback 36 mil 10 mm drop overall Weight\nWise a little bit heavier than the ads\none there 336 G for me in my UK size 12\nwhich was true to size here midso wise\nwe've got pummer standard entry level\nfoam they're Nitro foam and there's no\ncarbon plate in this shoe and underneath\nwe've got the pummer grip which is\nfantastic one of the best grip out SES\nin the running shoe market out there\nbrilliant in the winter especially as\nconditions turn a little bit wet likes\nwise with this shoe it's really\ncomfortable the Nitro foam is fun and\nbouncy really versatile and feels happy\nat all different paces and different\ndistances as well especially in the long\nrun as I said great grip in all weathers\nwith this shoe one of the best out there\nregardless of the price so a good solid\nwinter option dislikes wise with this\nshoe again like the ad shoe it's a\nlittle bit on the narrow side not as bad\nas the adash Sho so it will be okay for\nthe majority of people they did used to\nmake a wide version maybe you can find\nit but I can't find it out there for\nsale anywhere at the moment but overall\nit's a shoe that is massively\nunderpriced in my opinion if you can\npick up a pair at RP or even cheaper\nideally then you're going to be getting\na really good solid daily shoe it's just\na little bit firmer than the Adidas shoe\nso some people might like that so if you\nlike a soft squishy shoe at this price\npoint go for the Adidas if you like your\nride a little bit firmer feel a little\nbit more of the ground then go for the\npumer right let's move up a little bit\nin price now \u00a310 to150 at this point\nwe're going to be getting some higher\nquality Foams durability is going to be\na little bit better and we're going to\nstart to see some rods and plates appear\nin some of these more expensive shoes\nbut not with the first one which is the\naex Nova blast version 4 no plates and\nrods in this shoe just a classic all\nround training shoe price-wise this sent\nme back\n\u00a3135 stack cut at the back 41 mm a lot\nmore foam underneath our feet here at\nthis price point 8 mm drop overall\nWeight Wise 300 G not too bad for that\namount of foam Mido wise we've got the\nFF plus Ecco plus cushioning sizing wise\nI'd recommend just going half a size\ndown in the shoe from your regular one\nright let's start out with my lights\nit's a great balance of light cushioned\nand also responsive while being super\ncomfortable as well just a lovely\nallaround package good width in the shoe\nas well and you can also pick up the\npace really nicely in the shoe and run a\nlong way in it it's good for those\nmarathon training long runs it's a\nperfect shoe for anyone that's just\nstarting to take their running a little\nbit more seriously and you don't have\nany of the fancy Tech the rods and the\nplates and that all of that stuff in\nthere you're not sure how that's going\nto go and this is a really good option\nand get a nice standard training shoe\ndislikes wise the wet grip isn't\nfantastic in this shoe now they do make\na TR or a trail version of this shoe for\nvery light Trail runs it's exactly the\nsame shoe just a different grip on the\nbottom but overall the Nova blast 4 is a\nsuper versatile shoe at a really great\nprice point probably the most\ncomfortable shoe here on the whole list\nand it's probably the shoe I find myself\nrecommending more than any other to new\nRunners people getting into the sport\njust looking for a nice standard daily\nshoe to get a lot of their runs done\nwell now I said at this price point\nwe're going to start to get some rods\nand plates and that's what we're getting\nwith the Adidas Boston 12 using Adidas's\nenergy rod technology these glass fiber\ninfus energy rods that run throughout\nthe shoe this shoe sent me back\n\u00a340 stack out at the back 38 mm for a 7\nmm drop overall Weight Wise a little bit\nmore than the Nova blast probably\nbecause of those rods inside the shoe\nthere 318 G for me in my UK size 12\nsizing wise the shoe was a little bit\ntoo big for me I wish I'd gone half a\nsize down I did order my usual size 12\nit's strange with with the first adid\nDas shoe it was a little bit too small\nthen this one's a little bit too big I\nwish manufactur would get this right\nacross their whole range but just with\nthe lack of padding at the back of the\nshoe just had a little bit too much\nspace around my ankle anyway let's start\nout with the likes here it's a really\ngrippy shoe we've now seeing Adidas's\nContinental grip out so Continental they\ndo make car ties but they also make the\ngrip on the bottom of a lot of Adidas\nshoes as well fantastic for wet weather\nprobably the best option out there for\ngrip on the bottom of their shoe maybe\nthere s the pummer grip I know it's a\nreal tossup between them but they're\nboth fan fantastic it really delivers a\nfun and engaging ride and really happy\nto be picking up the pace feels like you\nspent a lot more than 140 lb the\nstability is much improved versus the\noutgoing model and you really notice it\nespecially in the cornering just got\nthat nice slightly wider base and you\ncan feel this in the upper as well it's\na really accommodating upper amazing for\nAdidas which always do tend to run a\nlittle bit on the narrow side this shoe\nhas got a good amount of space this is a\nshoe that I could really see someone\nstanding up to the S line of a 5K 10K\nright up to a marathon at distance in\nthis shoe and feel like they've got a\ngood shoe on their feet for running this\nrace they don't need a full out Flagship\ncarbon racing shoe it also feels really\nnice and lightweight on the foot as well\nreally helps to get that leg turnover\ngoing really nicely but also a good\namount of cushioning that will help you\nin those longer runs dislikes wise for\nme it's all about the back of the shoe\nhere just minimal padding for me it\ndidn't really give me any issues I\ndidn't get any heel slip but I have been\nreading about a few people having some\nheel step issues you can always go for\nthat heel lock lacing get a better lock\ndown with the shoe as well but it's just\nsomething to be aware of for me I just\nlike a little bit more padding at the\nback of the shoe but verdict overall if\nyou someone that likes a little bit more\nof an assisted feeling a little bit more\nTech in their shoe wants to pick up the\npace a little bit more than something\nlike the Boston 12 would be a really\ngood option it's not as comfortable as\nthe Nova blast but it can go a little\nbit faster than the Nova blast now\ninterestingly Adidas are about to drop\nthe Adidas Evo SL the much more afford\nable option of their Flagship Pro Evo\nwhich was way over \u00a3400 now they're\ndropping this new this lightweight daily\nspeed shoe for round about that \u00a3130\nprice point I'm going to get my order in\nat the end of this week so get\nsubscribed on the channel really\ninteresting shoe review coming up there\nin a few weeks right we're going to be\nspending a little bit more money now in\nthe \u00a3 150 to2 200 price bracket we're\ngetting some even more premium materials\nand generally a better quality of\nproduct that should last a little bit\nlonger starting out we're going to be\nhaving chat about this the Nike Pegasus\nplus this set me back\n\u00a365 stack cut at the back 36 mil 10 mm\ndrop overall Weight Wise 3133 G for me\nin my UK size 12 which was true to size\nfor me mid wise we've got a full length\nof Nike's Flagship Zoom X foam here\ntheir premium foam which we see in the\nlikes of the vaporfly and the apperly\nthey're all out super shoes and there's\nno plate in this shoe likes wise it's\njust a really versatile fun foam a lot\nof people me included just absolutely\nlove Nike zoomx foam and it delivers a\nreally fun engaging bouncy soft ride\nhere and this shoe can do all of those\nruns pretty well those easy runs speed\nwork Tempo longer runs it looks good too\nI've been wearing this shoe casually on\nmy travels recently as well it's kind of\nshoe you can go around the shops go to\nthe gym go for running and it's also\nHead and Shoulders much much better than\nNike's standard Pegasus shoe so it's\nreally definitely worth paying that a\nlittle bit more to get the Pegasus plus\ndislikes wise it is a little bit on the\nfirm side it's a little bit more of the\nkind of ride would be expected from a\nfew years ago I quite like it but not\neverybody will you've got that lower\nstack height more of a traditional\nfeeling on the road as well but for some\npeople they're not going to be fans of\nall this Mac stck height shoe with the\nplates and the rods in there this is a\nnice traditional type feeling shoe bit\nof a more old school running shoe with\nthat very high quality foam but if if\nyou'd like a plate in your shoe at this\nprice point then have a look at the\nsocony speed version 4 very nice\nlightweight speed SL daily shoe option\nout there stack C at the back 36 mm for\nan 8 mm drop overall just\n285 G for me in my UK size 12 midso wise\nwe've got the power run PB foam a nylon\nplate in the shoe but it's not too\naggressive so it's the kind of shoe you\ncan be using for those daily training\nMars sizewise this was good this was\ntrue to size for me starting out with\nthe lights with the shoe it works so\nwell at all different Paces it's really\ngood at those short Snappy workouts as\nwell as that cruising marathon pace soin\nhave called this their speed shoe which\nis what it's really designed\nspecifically for those faster workouts\nthose 5Ks 10ks and half marathons but\nit's the type of shoe that you can get a\nlot of your easy miles at died in as\nwell if you want a bit more of an\nengaging ride where you're going to feel\na little bit more of the ground again\nwith that lower stack height the plate\nin the shoe not only gives it a good\nSnappy speed but it also gives it a good\namount of stability in the corners this\nis a kind of shoe that's really good for\nsomething like a park run at 5K all out\nyou some fantastic grip on the bottom of\nthe shoe as well and also it's just nice\nand lightweight and it's fast and it's\nsuper Snappy perfect for that 5K\ndistance it's also pretty comfortable as\nwell as soon as you put the shoe on it\nfeels really nice get a good lock down\nreally like this breathable upper as\nwell although it really has started to\nBunch quite a lot for me we'll come on\nto that a little bit in the dislike so\nlet's start there it does bunch a little\nbit for me here so I'm always having to\nslightly adjust it and it as I say it's\nis a little bit on the firmer side so if\nyou're someone that likes a lot of\nground contact feel then you're going to\nlike this shoe some people like this\nsome people won't it's probably going to\nbe a little bit firm for those marathon\ntraining runs you might be getting done\nor even potentially raceing up in a\nmarathon although it's a lot softer than\nwhat I used to run a marathon in about\nfive or 6 years ago but with the way\nframes are the these days this is now\nconsidered a low stack height quite firm\nshoe it's amazing how times change and\nTechnology improves but verdict overall\nit's a great lightweight option for\nsomeone that likes doing a lot of speed\nwork in their training they like doing\nthose tempos those thresholds looking\nfor a lightweight shoe and they aren't\ntoo much into their Marathon racing so\nthey're going to be favoring the 5Ks\n10ks and half marathons and not doing\ntoo much of those super long runs right\nwe've got two shoes left to go this is\nnow in the \u00a3200 plus price point getting\nsome big money these next two shoes\naren't going to be to everyone's taste\nboth quite High stack height shoes but\npersonally I really love these two\nstarting out with what will probably be\nmy favorite shoe of the year which is\nthe aex super blast version 2 this sent\nme back 200 here in the UK if you can\nfind it it's really hard to find these\nshoes they in such high demand stack C\nat the back 45 mm stack height 8 mm drop\noverall and weighing in it just 288 G\nwhich is a lovely lightweight feel midso\nwise we've got asx's FF turbo foam which\nis their most premium foam that you're\ngoing to see in their high-end Ray shoes\nas well and there's no plate in the shoe\nbut it is definitely on the firm side\none of those shoes it doesn't need a\nplate not everybody loves a plate I\ndon't like to do a lot of my easy Mars\nand training Mars in a plated shoe and\nthis one just works really well getting\nthat stiffness from the foam sizing wise\nI went half a size down and what I\nreally like about this shoe is it's just\nsuper super versatile this is the shoe\nwhenever we've been traveling I can only\ntake one shoe with me this is definitely\nthe shoe I'm wearing you can wear this\nthrough the airport go and get your\nmarathon training long run even do races\nI have done races in this shoe it can do\neverything super well it's also\nextremely comfortable and the shoe as I\nsay that I reach for 90% of my training\nR when I'm not testing out other shoes\nit's so lightweight and allows you to\npick up the pace really effortlessly as\nwell it's also held up pretty well for\nthe amount of money you're spending on\nthe shoe you want it to last a long time\nI really think you can get a good 800\nsolid training marks out of this shoe\nfor me I did my review I can't remember\nhow many mils I done in my first first\npair but it was holding up really really\nwell we'll link to that video up here if\nyou want to check out my full super\nblast review but dislikes wise as I said\nat the start it's really difficult to\nget a hold of a pair it sells out pretty\nmuch on the day it comes out and yes\nit's really quite an expensive shoe but\nthe versatility and the durability\nreally make up for that my verdict over\nwith a shoe a lightweight Max cushion\nshoe can handle every type of run and\nPace absolutely brilliantly expensive\nbut it does last a long time right our\nfinal shoe of the day\n\u00a3230 here in the UK for the new Balan SC\nTrainer version 3 now it's a really\nweird thing with a shoe in some\ncountries it's a lot cheaper than that\nin America it's just $180 Us in\nAustralia $330 Australian doar so UK\nAustralia really expensive Canada USA\nthis shoe is probably one of the\ncategories below it's just a really OD\none but I'm in the UK so it's going in\nthis price category here stack kite at\nthe back 40 mm stack kite 6 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise not too bad a little\nbit on the heavier side\n325 G the midsole we've got a mix of\nthat Eva and peber midsole which is a\nreally good compromise for that softness\nthat responsive and that durability then\na carbon plate in the shoe as well for\njust that extra amount of rigidity and\nstability in the cornering likes wise\nwith this shoe it's super comfortable\nstraight out the box comfortable for\nthose long runs and this is what this\nshoe is this is what New Balance pitch\nthis is this is their training shoe to\ncomplement their high-end racer this is\nthe one they want you to do all those\nspeed sessions those easy miles in then\npicking out the SC Elite for when you're\ngoing racing and yeah as I said it's\ngreat value if you do live in the USA or\nCanada and a good option if you prefer\nthat softer feeling with a shoe this\nfirm is really really soft it's going to\nlook after your legs really\nfantastically well on those long runs\nthe plate here is not for that allout\nspeed it's adding a good amount of\nstability it's okay if you want to pick\nup the pace but for me this is a perfect\nshoe for people training for half\nmarathons and Marathon you're doing\nthose long runs and picking up the paast\nof marathon pace up to half marathon\npace it's not the kind of shoe you want\nto be going for your five in 10ks you'll\nbe much better off getting something\nlike the socony this is your allout\nCruiser to really perfect those long\nruns dislikes as I keep saying the price\nis just crazy outside of the US and it's\nreally as I say not the best option here\nfor that speed work it feels really good\nat marathon pace and half marathon pace\nor slower recovery jogs and easy Pace as\nwell so if you live in the USA\ndefinitely pick up this shoe it's a\nreally fantastic option to get a lot of\nyour daily training runs in so let's\nhave a chat all about my final thoughts\nhere my favorite shoe on the list it has\nto be the aex super blast it's just been\nan absolute Joy I'm going to carry on\ndoing my training miles in that but if\nyou can't get the super blast and\nsomething like the Nova blast 4 in fact\nall of these shoes are good that's why\nthey're on the list but the Nova blast 4\nas say is there an option that I do end\nup recommending the most for that good\nmix of that cushion responsiveness speed\nworkor and a good solid price point as\nwell next up I've got my video All About\nspecific long run shoes we'll link to\nthat one up here and if you want to look\nat my super blast review and super last\nAlternatives that video is coming up\ndown there that's it guys keep on\nworking hard keep on done let me know\nwhat what your favorite daily training\nshoers out there and we see you very\nsoon in the next one",

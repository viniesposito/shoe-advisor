  "text": "the 10K is a great distance for many\nRunners it's long enough to provide a\nserious challenge but short enough that\nthe training isn't going to completely\ntake over your life running a 10K at Max\neffort is seriously tough but if you\nexecute it well it really is one of the\nbest feelings ever crossing the line\nearning yourself that new PV after\nwatching this video I know that's what\nyou're going to be doing because today\nI'm showing my best top tips on how to\nrun that 10K PV we're going to go\nthrough all the training that you need\nto do the sessions that help me run at\n3245 and some bonus race tactics as well\nso stay tuned for those so how long\nshould you give yourself to train for\nthe 10K well ideally we're talking\naround about 10 weeks that's exactly how\nlong our training plans are that we have\non benp parks.com so check those out on\nthe link down below and this will allow\nfor a proper build and then a short\ntaper before race day you can make some\nreally good improvements in the 6 to 8\nweeks if that's what you've got but\nideally we're talking about 10 the next\nthing you want to do is figure out where\nor when you're going to be racing your\n10K and then work backwards those 10\nweeks to get to your starting point make\nsure that when you're searching for that\nflat and fast course also find one where\nthere's not too many turns that you've\ngot to slow down for during the race as\nwell if you're not interested in getting\nan official 10K time you just want to\nrun a fast 10K in your local area again\nsearch out for some parks search out for\nsome traffic free routs anywhere where\nyou're not going to get interrupted\nbecause we can't stop during the 10K it\nhas to be 10K of continuous running\nwe'll list a few race organizers that we\nlike to use down below yes they're all\nin the UK let us know down in the\ncomments where are the fastest 10k\nroutes for you maybe put your location\nand where they are help out the\ncommunity Down Below in the comments\nright so what's a realistic time to aim\nfor with where we're at well of course\nthis will vary wildly from person to\nperson newer Runners are often able to\nmake some more significant improvements\nin those early stages whereas more\nexperienced Runners are likely to be\nalready a little bit closer to their the\nImprovement isn't going to be quite as\nmuch but as a Rough Guide what can you\ndo well if you're someone tracing a sub\n60 you want to be around about in 1 hour\n10 shape or comfortable doing a sub 35k\nsub 50 we're talking around about sub 55\nminute shape already around about 25\nminutes for the 5K sub 45 you want to be\nrunning around about sub 49 already and\nsub 2230 for the 5K and if you want to\nget that sub 40 you want to be running\naround about 43 minutes before we start\nthe training or be comfortable running a\nsub 20 minute 5K now what does weekly\nmileage look like for doing this\ntraining how many times are we going to\nget out there how many miles we need to\nbe running well for a sub 60 we're\ntalking about 3 to four runs a week up\nto around about 22 miles or 35k for a\nsub 50 we're talking four to five runs a\nweek up to about 35 miles in those Peak\nweeks 56k per week sub 45 get a little\nbit faster now got a little bit more\ntraining to do about four to five runs a\nweek up to around about 40 miles 64k in\nthat peak week and then finally sub 40\nminutes we're talking 5 to six runs a\nweek up to around about 45 miles or 72k\none of the most important parts of\ntraining for a fast 10K is getting those\nweekly speed sessions those intensity\nsessions those reps those intervals into\nour training we need to get the body\nused to running at or even faster than\nour goal pce and a great way of doing\nthis is through these interval sessions\nnow we'd recommend setting aside at\nleast one day a week for your speed\nsession day traditionally this is\nnormally on a Tuesday but it's whenever\nit falls for you quite frankly and then\nmore experienced Runners probably would\nto be putting a second speed session\ninto their training but we'll touch on\nthat a little bit later on now these\nworkouts involve running at a hard\neffort for a particular time or distance\nfollowed by a period of rest to recover\nso get the heart rate up and then\nrecover get it down heart rate up and\nthen down and these interval sessions\nare what really help boost that V2 Max\nour fitness to be able to compete at the\n10K distance running really really fast\nso here's some example sessions that you\ncan try when you're next out there of\ncourse with all these runs you want to\nstart out by 10 to 15 minutes very light\njogging to get the body nice and warmed\nup maybe do some drills proper warm-up\nroutine to get the body ready to be\nrunning fast now the first session I'd\nrecommend trying out is 10x 400 m we\nwill be running these 400 m at our 5K\ncurrent pace and between these reps\nwe're going to be taking a 90c walking\nrecovery really good one to do on a\ntrack if you have that available to you\nbut don't worry if you don't just\ngetting it done in the local park will\nbe fine second session I'd recommend 6x4\nminutes at round about our 10K goal Pace\nthe pace we going to be running that\nrace at at the end of our training\nbetween these reps we're taking a\n2minute walking recovery and then\nfinally my favorite session for 10K\nrunning is what I call kick down KS\nthey're basically K reps we're doing the\nfirst 800 M of these at our gold 10K\npace and then the final 200 M of that K\nrep at our 5K pace and then taking a\n2minute recovery between this if you're\ntrading for a sub 60 do four reps of\nthis sub 50 five reps sub 40 we're\ntalking about six reps here so nice and\nsteady fast finish for the rep and then\na 2minute recovery really is the best of\nboth worlds with this one a little bit\nmore fun and interesting and gets used\nto increasing the effort towards the end\nof the rep which is what we need to be\ndoing when we're running that 10K now\nyour local running club might well put\non a weekly speed session maybe that's\nsomething you can check out speak to\nthem if you're not remember of running\nclub we always recommend joining making\nsome new friends in your local running\nCommunity as I said at the start you\ndon't have to be doing things on a\nrunning track if you don't feel\ncomfortable you don't want to there's\nnot one near you just getting somewhere\nnice traffic free local parks local\ncycle paths canal toe paths whatever\nyou've got available near you where you\ncan run uninterrupted that's the best\nthing quickly guys you find this vide\nwell please smash that like button share\nwith a friend that wants to run a faster\n10K and let us know down in the comments\nwhat your 10K PB is and where you'd like\nto get it to as well if you got time\nplease check out my website benp\nparks.com we've got amazing running hats\ntechnical gear casual gear to power you\nthrough those training miles and get it\ndone in races as well right back to the\n10K tips now most GPS watches I don't\ntend to wear one day today but I do find\nrunning and I normally like to program\nmy workouts into my watch and then I\nfollow it along as they go Garmin choros\nwhatever it is I recommend putting these\nworkouts into your watch one less thing\nto think about when you're out there\ngetting your runs done now as I touched\non before if you are more experienced\nRunner maybe you're looking to train for\naround about a sub 45 sub 401K run here\nyou may want to include a second speed\nsession during the week if you're in\nthis Camp focus on that first speed\nsession on the Tuesday maybe doing some\nshorter reps the 10x 400 something like\nthat then the second session maybe\nThursday Friday something like that\nwe're going to be doing some longer reps\nso maybe some reps here some mile reps\nor maybe even a 20 minute tempo run\nlater in the week on that Thursday or\nFriday this will just help to push that\nFitness up even more you're a bit more\nof an experience running you've got some\ngood leg strength already you're used to\ndoing some higher mileage weeks so\nthat's when we can start to really push\nour fitness forward by doing this second\nsession during the week another key part\nof this and so many people ignore this\nso please don't but look at getting some\nstrides into your weekly routine at\nleast once a week we want to be doing\nsome strides now it's really easy to\nincorporate this you can do this after\nan easy run as part of your warmup\nbefore you go and do a session but\nbasically these are 20 seconds running\naround about 90% effort so really really\nfast High Cadence High turnover and as I\nsay maybe do these before your session\nas part of your warmup or at the end of\nan easy run if you're you new to strides\nstart out with maybe four reps\nintermediate five reps more advanced six\nreps and then just take around 20 to 30\nsecond walk between each one really\nimportant when you're going through\nthese focus on good form staying in\ncontrol then just a gradual acceleration\nup these are really good way to recruit\nsome more fast twitch muscle fibers when\nyou need that Sprint finish at the end\nof that 10K and they also help building\nsome strength and improve our running\neconomy as well the more efficiently we\ncan get to point A to point B the less\nenergy we will use during that 10K and\nthe faster we can run it's really quite\ndifficult to run with bad form when\nyou're going that all out pace so it\nreally helps unlock some free speed so\ndefinitely get those strides into your\nweekly routine another key aspect of our\nrunning week is getting those long runs\nand those easy runs here this is when\nwe're really going to build that\nendurance build that engine that we need\nto be running at a very fast pace for 40\n45 50 60 minutes or so it's going to\nrequire a big effort and we need to\nbuild that endurance the speed sessions\nreally put a lot of stress on the body\nwe need time to let that recovery set in\nto adapt so the rest of the week outside\nthe speed sessions we need to keep this\na nice low intensity if every day was a\nspeed session we would get injured very\nvery quickly so we need to get a good\nmix of Paces throughout the week now for\nyour long runs I'd say if you're someone\ntraining for a sub 60 looking around\nabout 5 to 8 Miles for your long run sub\n50 we're talking about 7 to 10 miles for\nthe long run sub 40 we're talking about\n9 to 12 miles for the long run in terms\nof the pace for these long runs we want\nto be keep them nice and relax nice and\nconversational easy Pace zone two kind\nof pace you can chat to a friend at\nthat's a rough guide will put some\nrecommended Paces for that sub40 sub 50\nsub 60 recommended Paces for our easy\nand our longer runs up on the screen now\nright the fun is here it's race day\nwe're ready to go how are we going to go\nabout attacking this 10K to get your\nyour PB with all racing we want to avoid\ngoing too fast and blowing up this is\nwhat so many inexperienced Runners do\nthey go out feeling all good and by\nhalfway they're absolutely gassed and\nthey're walking it in I've done it many\ntimes myself when I was learning but\nI've learned the proper way of pacing\nraces now and that's what we're going to\ngo through what a lot of people like to\ndo is start out slightly easier than\ngold Pace then move to Gold pace and\nthen move ahead of gold pace so averaged\noverall is your gold Pace but you start\nout nice and relax and just build into\nit gradually and then that fast finish\nto get your time now what I prefer to do\nis aim for even pacing throughout and\nthen that final K just give it\neverything I've got throw the kitchen\nsink at it for that final K there's not\none way that's right or one way that's\nwrong there's definitely one way that's\nwrong is going out too fast and then\ntailing off at the end going through a\nslow sorry death because that never\nresults in a fast time now if there are\nsome Pacers in your event then it can be\na really good idea to stick with them as\nthis really does take away a lot of the\nguess work and that hard work if you're\nnot sure about your watch you just want\nto rely on someone else stick in the\npacing group if they're offering it now\nwith regards to fueling and hydration\nit's a little bit harder with 10K\nsomething like it some people don't I\nsay definitely make sure you're nice and\nhydrated maybe have a gel on the start\nline before you go off and then for me\nif it's a hot day I'm going to be taking\na couple of Cups going around just\nsipping drink to thirst there's no need\nto chug a load of liquids down as we go\ngel's little bit more of a personal\npreference here some Runners will really\nlike something around about that 30\nminute Mark to really help sort of spur\nthem through in that back end of the\nrace other people will just go all the\nway through without needing anything\nremember the gold W here don't try\nanything new on race day use what you\npractice in training another top tip I\nlike to say is use your lap Pace on your\nwatch rather than the overall pace for\nthe whole event if you've got Auto laps\nturned on these are going to be going\noff every mile or every kilometer it's\njust going to be telling you the pace of\nthat mile or that K that you're in\nthat's all I like to look at and I just\nmake sure I'm running the right pace for\nthat particular K this sort of takes\naway the errors with some potential GPS\nissues over the course of the whole run\njust focus on that moment focus on what\nyou're doing right here right now just\nmaking sure you're running at that right\npace now running a 10K flat out is\nreally hard I think it's one of\npotentially the hardest distances but it\nfeels so good when you cross that finish\nline and get it done now if you do need\na little bit more guidance on training\nthen check out our 10K plans we'll link\nto them all down below all the beginner\nplans are completely free to download\nand if you're interested in running that\nsub 40 minute 10K then check out this\nvideo up here next so that's it guys\nkeep on working hard keep on it done let\nme know when you're next running a 10K\nwhat time you're hoping for what your PP\nis that's it we'll see you very soon in\nand good luck was in the next one",

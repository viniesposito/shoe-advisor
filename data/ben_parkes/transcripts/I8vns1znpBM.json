  "text": "hello every and welcome back to the\nchannel today I'm going to take you\nthrough my top six running drills for\nregular Runners to get you moving better\nget you stronger improve your running\nform and enjoying your running a little\nbit more I've been putting these into my\nroutine for the last few years and I've\nreally seen a big Improvement in my\nrunning form over that time I like to do\nthese at least twice a week before my\nspeed sessions to get everything nicely\nactivated ready to go but let's get St\ninto the first one now before we start\noff it's really important to make sure\nyou're nicely warmed up I'd recommend\ndoing around about 10 minutes of easy\njogging and your regular warm-up routine\nbefore you get going with these you\ndon't want to be going into these cold\nright let's start off with something\nnice and simple in butt kicks these are\ngoing to get your hamstrings fired up\nnicely and help promote that quick leg\nturnover with this one you're trying to\nbring your heels up towards your bum\nunderneath you rather than flecking your\nheels behind you in terms of how long to\ndo this for you're looking for around\nabout 20 to 30 seconds beginners do this\none time intermediate two times and\nadvance three times with just a couple\nof seconds rest between each one next up\nwe've got Carri ochre which is one\nyou'll see all of the footballers doing\nit's great for engaging the muscles\naround your hips and then for that\nlateral movement helps improve our\nstability and coordination too this one\ndoes take a little bit of practice but\nonce you've got the hang of it it's a\nreally good one you're stepping out to\nthe side with one leg and then the other\nleg alternates between going in front\nand then behind so side forward side\nback side forward side back and then so\non walk through it a few times to get\nthe hang of it again we're going to be\ndoing this for around about 20 seconds\nin one direction and then stop and go in\nthe other direction and then consider\nthat one round beginners do this once\nintermediate two rounds and advance\nthree rounds Right Moving on we're going\nto be talking about the straight leg run\nwhich is a great one for encouraging\nthat midfoot strike and gets the quads\nnicely fired up too with this one you're\nkeeping your legs straight and kicking\nthem out in front of you what you want\nto focus on here is trying to stay\nupright and Tall avoid leaning too much\nback on this one we also want the steps\nto be quick and short throwing your foot\ndown into the ground again with this one\nwe're doing this for around about 20 to\n30 seconds beginners one time\nintermediate twice and Advance Runners\nthree times next up we have the walking\nlunge and knee Drive these will really\nhelp us open up the hips as well as\nengaging our lower leg muscles it also\nreally helps to improve balance and\ncoordination since you're spending a bit\nof time on one leg and that's all\nimportant for running because we're\nalways on one leg so you're pulling your\nknee up into your chest and then\nstepping forward into a lunge bending\nboth knees around 90\u00b0 if you do find\nyourself a bit wobbly with these imagine\nyour feet are on train tracks rather\nthan one in front of the other and that\nshould help stabilize you a little bit\nbetter performing these slowly will be a\nlot better than rushing them I'd\nrecommend doing 10 in total with five on\neach leg beginners do this one time\nintermediates twice and advance three\ntimes next up is those high knees an\nabsolute classic for a lot of us over\nthe years this is a great one to get\nyour calves glutes and hamstrings firing\nwhile promoting that good knee lift and\nit also encourages a quick turnover as\nwell this one is quite similar to butt\nkicks the one we did at the beginning\nbut the focus is bringing the knees High\nrather than heels to butt also trying to\nmaintain a nice tall posture when doing\nthese and again we do not want to be\nleaning back here you'll see a bit of PN\nwith this one because again we're doing\nthis for around about 20 to 30 seconds\nbeginners once intermediate twice and\nadvance three times okay five down and\none to go the final one is the strides\nI'd say this is the most fun one we get\nto start running and running pretty fast\nas well this is the one to do now all of\nour muscles have woken up the heart rate\nis elevated nicely and this is a good\none to finish with these are essentially\n20 second bursts of running around about\n90 to 95% effort these will really help\nimprove our Cadence increase our stride\nlength and get those fast twitch muscle\nfibers working the main focus here is\nrunning fast but also staying in control\nand relaxed at the same time this is not\nan allout Sprint I like to roll into\nthese gradually so it takes me about 5\nseconds or so to hit that top speed and\nthen hold that for around about 10 to 15\nseconds before gradually slowing down\nagain take a short rest between each one\njust to get your breath back beginners 2\nto 3 * 20 seconds intermediate 3 to 4 *\n20 seconds and advanced Runners 4 to 5\nby 20 seconds right I'm now warmed up\nI've done my drills and I'm ready to go\nand get my interval session done I hope\nyou found that useful and can integrate\nthis into your routine to help your\nrunning and your running form any\nquestions let me know down in the\ncomments keep on working hard keep on\ndone and I'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

  "text": "Max cushion shoes have become a really\npopular segment in the running shoe\nmarket recently with loads of options\nnow available and more and more Runners\nchoosing to go for these massive Foams\nthese Max stack shoes are often marketed\nas the shoe that's going to provide that\nultimate Comfort to protect your legs\nfrom the impact of the roads with all\nthat foam underneath us I've personally\nbeen enjoying getting a lot of my runs\ndone in this style of shoe recently so\ntoday I thought I'd break down my six fa\nshoes in this section letting you know\nwhat's different about them all my likes\nand dislikes to help you with your\nbuying decisions when you're looking for\nthis type of shoe and as always with\neverything here on the channel I bought\nall of these shoes 100% with my own\nmoney to give you my completely honest\nunbiased thoughts thanks to everyone\nthat supports this channel by liking the\nvideos sharing them with their friends\nand commenting down below with your\nthoughts on the best Mac stack shoes out\nthere and also everyone that checks out\nmy website benp parks.com we've got\namazing running hat training plans and\nTechnical gear to help you with your\nrunning and feel free to use code\nYouTube 10 for 10% off your next order\nright let's get stuck into all the shoes\nnow we've got six to go through starting\nat the cheapest finishing with the most\nexpensive starting out with a new\nbalance more version 5 I've been\nenjoying this shoe for a few months now\nusing it for a lot of my recovery runs\nwhich is where this shoe is best\nprice-wise this sent me back\n\u00a340 stack kite 44 mil at the back of the\nshoe 4 mm drop overall and coming at\n374 G for me in my UK size 12 a little\nbit on the heavy side as a lot of these\nshoes are on this list today we've got\nnew balances Fresh Foam X midsole extra\nsoft extra squishy very very plush here\nthis really does feel like you've got\nsome marshmallows under your feet and\nfinally it was true to size for me well\nlet's start out chatting about the\nlights with the shoe it was supremely\ncomfortable and very very soft this is\ngoing to be really good if you like that\nvery plush sinking into the foam type\nfeeling with a shoe like this there is a\ngood width to the base of their shoe a\nlot of surface area on the bottom here\nso you do feel surprisingly stable in\nthem given how soft it is as well it's\nalso got a really nice rocker here at\nthe front of the shoe really helps you\nget a nice leg turnover going there and\nthe upper with the shoe provides a\nreally accommodating area at the front\nof the shoe so if you've got wide feet\nyou're going to be good here but there\nis an extra wide option so if you have\ngot particularly wide feet then go and\ncheck that one out and this is a great\noption also not just for runners but\neverybody wanting some all day Comfort\nwhether you're walking working whatever\nyou're doing if you want a shoe for\ntraveling something like that this is\ngoing to provide you that all day\ncomfort with running and everything you\nchoose to do in it dislikes with the\nshoe the upper is quite thick\npotentially some breathability issues\nthere if you are running in the shoe in\na particularly hot climate and really\nwith the shoe this is just easy and\nRecovery runs over this foam is so so\nsoft so you really aren't going to be\npicking up the pace too much in this\nshoe but it's going to look off your\nlegs supremely well out there so in\nsummary with the New Balance Mo version\n5 this is the cheapest shoe here by\nLongway some pretty good value at 140\nperfect for someone that's going to love\nthat super soft super squidgy super plus\ntype ride right moving on let's have a\nchat about a puma shoe coming up next so\nthis is a puma magmax Nitro a very new\nshoe here from Puma their first real\ncontender in this Max stack height type\nof area this is for your easy runs your\nrecovery runs but also your long runs\nyou can go for a long way in this and\npick up the pace a little bit better\nthan you could in the New Balance treee\nthere price-wise quite a lot for a puma\nshoe here\n\u00a3170 stack kite 46 mil absolutely crazy\nat the back of the shoe 8 mm drop\noverall and 366 G for me in my UK size\n12 we've got Pumas Nitro foam midsole\nand the sizing was pretty good here it\nwas true to size for me well let's have\na chat out some of my likes with the\nshoe firstly the outsole with the shoe\nis very very grippy the pumer grip\noutsole is absolutely fantastic a great\nwinter option here many people say\npummer outso are some of the very best\nout there and this one delivers\nfantastically well it's also a good\nstable option here again surprisingly\nstable here in the corners you're not\ngoing to have to worry about rolling and\nankling this one the ility is coming\nfrom this foam it is definitely on the\nstiff side on the dense side so you're\ndefinitely not going to be wallowing it\ndoesn't have that soft marshmallowy\nfeeling that the New Balance had this\none's a lot firmer your feet sit\nslightly below that top level of the\nmidsole so you're getting a really good\nlock down there with this really nice\nupper as well you're also getting a\nsurprising amount of energy return a lot\nof Popp and springiness and\nresponsiveness from this foam here which\nis Puma's highest end foam so you can\ndefinitely pick up the pace a lot more\nthan you expect with a shoe that is\nquite this size you don't notice the all\nthat weight and that bulkiness with the\nshoe as much as you doing some of the\nones that are coming on a little bit\nlater in this video and also the upper\nwith the shoe is really quite nice and\nvery breathable as well if you are\nrunning some hotter climates get some\ngood air flow coming through here\ndislikes with the Puma sadly although\nit's the second cheapest shoe here is\ndefinitely on the expensive side for a\npuma shoe which is really because the\namount of pummer highest end foam that's\nin this shoe it just warrants putting\nthe price up to what it is but it's\nstill cheaper than most of the ones out\nthere so maybe it's a positive at \u00a3170\nshoes are going absolutely crazy these\ndays and then the final dislike it is a\nlittle bit on the narrow side a lot of\nPuma shoes are on the narrow side so if\nyou're someone that has narrow or sort\nof Fairly sanded feet you're going to be\nokay but a wider footed person is\nprobably going to want to look elsewhere\nso in summary with the shoe this is a\nreally great option for someone looking\nfor a very stable firmer and more\nversatile ride than something like the\nnew balance is offering and it's really\ngoing to be suitable for the your easy\nPace your steady Pace your marathon pace\nand your longer runs and you've got the\nbest grip out of all of these options as\nwell so if you're looking for a good\nwinter shoe option this is definitely\nthe one to be going for right going up a\nlittle bit in price now is the aex GEL\nNimbus 26 a shoe I had earlier on this\nyear I used it and then it was time for\nit to be retired and I don't have it\nhere anymore but really enjoyed putting\na lot of a Cas through that shoe the\npurpose of something like the S6 Joe\nnumber 26 this is definitely very\nsimilar to the New Balance here your\neasy and Recovery runs price-wise it\nsent me back\n\u00a380 stack height at the back 42 millim\nand then an 8 mm drop overall weightwise\n373 G for me in my UK size 12 the midso\nwe're getting a lovely Big Slab of the\nFF blast Eco plus to really help absorb\nall that impact from the roads and\nsizing wise it was true to size for me\nstarting out with the lights with the ax\nit comes in three different widths which\nis really fantastic standard wide and\nextra wide so if you're someone that has\na slightly wider foot this is definitely\ngoing to be one of the ones to have a\nlook at the upper is super soft and\nsuper stretchy this gives a fantastic\nlock down Ultra breathable and Ultra\ncomfortable as well it's actually Market\nas the most comfortable running shoe and\nit's really hard to disagree with that\nit came top of the list when I did my\nmost comfortable shoe video at the start\nof this year and I'll link to that up\nhere and down in the description as well\nand I had absolutely no overheating no\nhot spots no blisters or anything like\nthat but as I say it's not all smiles\nwe've got some dislikes to go through\nquickly as well like the more version 5\nat the start of the video the shoe is\nbest at those easy and Recovery run\nPaces the foam isn't quite as soft as\nthe New Balance but it's still very much\non the soft side New Balance very very\nsoft this is just very soft so don't\nexpect to be picking up the pace in this\none too much for me I use this just as\nmuch second run of the day type shoe\nwhen I just wanted to look after my legs\nso in some if Comfort is your main\npriority then this is definitely a good\none to be looking at as I say this is my\nrecovery on shoe that I used for the\nfirst half of this year and it looked\nafter my legs fantastically well plus\nthere's some really good discounts on\nthe 26 now because the 27 isn't far away\napparently right let's move on to the\nnext one we're talking about Brooks\nright this is a new shoe from Brooks The\nBrooks Glycerin Max and I think it's a\nreally nice looking shoe as well let me\nknow what you think down in the comments\nthis is I think one of the best best\nlooking shoes that Brooks have produced\nthe purpose of the glycerin Max this is\nan easy and Recovery run shoe as well\nbut it's going to be really good at the\nlong runs it's a little bit firmer a\nlittle bit more responsive you're\ngetting a little bit more propulsion to\nlook after yourself deep into those long\nruns price-wise\n1880 stack height at the back of the\nshoe 45 mm and a 6 mm drop overall\nWeight Wise\n375 gram midsole with a shoe we've got\nBrooks's DNA tuned cushioning here\nbasically we've got two different types\nof density Foams we've got some larger\ncells at the back for some nice Airy\nsoft Landings and some smaller density\nFoams at the front just to help with\nthat Poppy toe off and you can kind of\nfeel that working in there I'm not going\nto lie sizing wise this was true to size\nfor me right let's start out with the\nlikes now this is the closest feeling\nshoe I've ever found to the best shoe in\nclass here really which is the aex super\nblast version 2 just very very similar\nmid sole feeling that you get with the\nshoe the midsole is definitely a lot\nfirmer than You' expect for a 45 mil\nstack shoe but it's bouncy and has\nreally fantastic energy return as well\nthe rocker at the front of the shoe is\nreally quite pronounced and it gives you\na lovely transition through the foot\nstrike encourages a really good turnover\nso it really helps disguise the weight\nand the bulkiness of this shoe because\nit is a very big shoe here but also with\nso much cushioning and a lot of padding\naround the heel there and this\nengineered mesh upper getting a good\namount of air flow coming through there\nit's a really comfortable ride and as\neverything with Brooks everything I've\never tested really great build quality\nwith this shoe really feels like a very\ngood quality product and durability is\ngoing to be high on a shoe like this\nwe've got a fantastic rubber outso here\nproviding some really good winter grip\nas well right let's move on to chat\nabout a few of the dislikes and what\nreally sets this shoe apart from the\nsuper blast is you just really can't get\naway from the weight and the bulkiness\nin the shoe the superl is nearly 100 G\nlighter which is just of course you're\ngoing to notice something like that and\nyou can just pick up the pace far better\nin the super blast but yeah marathon\npace and slower it's just going to look\nafter your legs really well if you do\nwant to do some speed and some workouts\nin it you're going to get a good extra\nworkout with the extra sort of bulkiness\nand the weight in this shoe so maybe\nit's not all bad but yeah just weight\nand bulk unfortunately do let this shoe\ndown right let's have a chat about the\nsummary with this one this is just a\nreally great shoe for someone is looking\nfor a larger size shoe this goes all the\nway up to a uk14 Brooks offers some\nreally great versatility across a lot of\ntheir line unfortunately they're not\noffering this in wide at the moment\nhopefully that will come soon but the\nwidth in the shoe is surprisingly\ngenerous as well so another good wide\noption there if you have a slightly\nwider foot and if you like a kind of a\nlittle bit more of a firmer feel Under\nFoot then as I say this is going to be a\nreally good option right moving on to\nthe hoker Skyward X the biggest shoe\nhere the biggest shoe I've ever reviewed\n48 mm stack heite at the back of this\nshoe absolutely crazy this is for your\neasy runs recovery runs and longer runs\nas well this sent me back\n\u00a385 here in the UK stack C just said 448\nmm stack height 5 mm drop overall this\nis absolutely crazy you're going to feel\nso tall in this shoe you sit right on\ntop of that 48 mm stack kite you\ncurrently can't feel any of the ground\nweightwise 370 8 G for me in my UK size\n12 midso we've got two different layers\nof foam in this shoe one layer of super\nsoft premium peber foam from Hoka and\nthen one layer of that super critical\nEva for addit durability and you're also\ngetting a carbon plate in this shoe as\nwell which is added in there to add a\nlot more extra stability with this\namount of Stack height and this amount\nof softness that you get in the shoe you\nreally going to need that plate in the\nshoe to hold it all together sizing wise\nthis was true to size for me starting\nout with my likes with the shoe this is\njust really good fun to run in the\nsoftness the stability that the shoe\nprovides and that plate when you pick up\nthe pace it's just an all around fun\npackage it puts a smile on your face it\nfeels really quite smooth through the\nfoot strike despite a lot of bulk in the\nshoe and a lot of weight in the shoe as\nwell it feels really good quality it's a\nvery good build quality here from hoker\nand really great for that long time on\nfeet those long runs or maybe even long\ndistance walk as well it is also very\nvery soft and very Squishy in this shoe\nvery similar feeling to the gel ners 26\nand the more version 5 but that plate in\nthe shoe means it's a lot stiffer than\nthose shoes a lot more stability with\nthe shoe so it's just going to excel a\nlot more as you pick up the past to\nMarathon past and half marathon past\nsomething like that this is now a shoe\nthat some heavier people could\ndefinitely want to consider doing some\nracing in as well they're worried about\nsome of the Foams bottoming out\ndefinitely not going to be the case here\nin terms of dislikes with the shoe I\nkind of feel like I'm repeating myself\nquite a bit today but it's just\nobviously a bit heavy a little bit bulky\nit's the heaviest shoe here today the\nheaviest shoe that I've ever tested here\non the channel but with all that foam\nand those plates they really do look\nafter your legs very very well so in\nsummary there's a little bit more Tech\ngoing on in this shoe with that plate\nhere as to say it's the only one here on\nthis list it's also a lot of fun to run\nin it's quite extreme on the stack\nheight front so if you want a really\nlightweight shoe this is definitely\ngoing to be one to avoid but I've got a\nlightweight shoe coming up now so let's\nhave a chat about the super blast\nversion 2 as soon as you pick this up\nyou know you're picking up something\nvery very special it's so much lighter\nthis was 288 G for me in my UK size 12\nat least 100 G lighter than a lot of\nthose options this is my second pair\nwhich is why I've actually had to write\nnumber two on the back here wore my\nfirst pair out but anyway let's move on\nto sh all of the facts and figures the\npurpose of the shoe like this this is a\nclassic daily shoe you can definely do\nyour long runs you can do your races you\ncan do your easy runs you can kind of do\nrecovery runs it's certainly not the\nbest option out there for your recovery\nruns but it's a shoe that can do\neverything pretty damn well price-wise\ntalking around about \u00a3200 the prices do\nchange a little bit on the aex website\naround about2 200 though stack kite 45\nmm stack kite still a lot of foam you're\ngetting with this shoe here as with all\nthe ones in this video today 88 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise is coming in at 288\nG so around about 90 to 100 G lighter\nthan all the other ones but I did get\nthis in half a size down so that's just\nwhat you need to do in something like\nthe super blast so this wasn't true to\nsize I got half size down so 11 and a\nhalf for me midso wise we've got mostly\nasx's FF turbo plus foam asx's most\npremium foam that they offer in all\ntheir high-end ratio that's what the\nbulk of this shoe is here and then\nunderneath that we've got a layer of FF\nblast foam which is a lot more durable\nthen as usual we've got the rubber out\nsoole here these yellow bets you can see\non the bottom of the shoe just to add\nthat extra grip a big improvement from\nSuper Blast 2 versus one was a lot\nbetter grip but it's still nowhere near\nas good as something like the pummer\ngrip as I say sizing wise I went half a\nsize down likes with the shoe it's just\nso so versatile if you're traveling\nmoving around you can only take one shoe\nwith you this is really for me this year\nand a lot of last year as well this is\nthe shoe I'm always want to be taking a\nshoe that can really do it all Races\nI've raced in this shoe you can do speed\nsessions in this shoe easy runs long\nruns it's super comfortable as well a\nshoe that I reach for about 90% of the\ntime when I'm not testing other shoes\nit's also supremely lightweight as we've\nchatted about and also surprisingly\ndurable I got around about 1,000 very\nhappy ks in my first pair of super blast\nnow I'm on to my second pair I've got\nanother pair ready to go dislikes with\nthis shoe unfortunately still very hard\nto get hold of but as soon as this comes\ninto stock it always sells out within 24\nhours so yes it's very much on the\nexpensive side but the versatility makes\nup for that and the demand clearly makes\nup for that they could certainly put the\nprice up with the shoe and people would\nstill be paying for it it's that much in\ndemand so summary with the super Blast 2\nyes definitely the lightest shoe here\nthe most versatile but definitely the\nfirmest ride this is a shoe that is\ngoing to give you a pretty firm ride out\nthere but it's responsive and I say you\ncan pick up the pace really quite nice\nwith the shoe now some people might be\nasking why you not reviewing the\nInvincible well I haven't got it yet\nversion 4 is due out supposedly this\nyear here we'll be bringing that full\nNike Invincible version 4 as soon as it\ndrops so get subscribed for that so\nlet's go through my final Thoughts with\nthese shoes here starting out with the\nNew Balance definitely the softest\nsquishiest shoe here but also the\ncheapest one as well perfect for someone\nlooking for those super squishy soft\nrecovery runs to look after your legs\npummer the outstanding feature with the\npummer it's got the best grip the best\nwinter running option here and\ndefinitely something you can do some\nlong runs in a little bit more\nresponsive the Joe Nimbus 26 the most\ncomfortable shoe here in the lineup the\nBrooks best for people with particularly\nbig feet with the sizing options that\nare on offer and again you can go long\nin this shoe really nice and responsive\nas well hokus skywood X the most extreme\nthe biggest stack kite a big fan\nfavorite on the channel this year a lot\nof you guys absolutely loving the\nskywood X as we've got a dedicated\nreview all about this one so go and\ncheck that one out and then yeah\nprobably going to be my favorite show of\nthe year the best allrounder most\nversatile lightweight but sadly the most\nexpensive option as well but the one I\nwould definitely recommend\nwholeheartedly above all the others on\nthe list but they're all really good\noptions let me know what you would\nchoose on the list here next video\ncoming up is our best daily shoe options\nyou can see that up here if you want to\nsee that dedicated hocus skyex video\nI'll link to that one down here keep on\nworking hard keep on done we'll see you\nvery soon in the next one",

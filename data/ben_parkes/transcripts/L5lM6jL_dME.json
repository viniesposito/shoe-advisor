  "text": "this year I spent \u00a3\n7,952 buying running shoes to be able to\ntest here on the channel to give you\nthose completely honest unsponsored\nreviews and that's about just over\n$10,000 for our American friends and of\nall the pairs I've tested along the way\nthere have been some absolute bangers\nout there that I've really enjoyed and\ncarried on using after the videos have\ngone up from that initial testing so\nthat's what this video is all about the\nbest of the best all the shoes that we\nbuy here on the channel to review and\ntest I buy 100% with my money so just\nwant to say a massive thank you this\nyear to everyone that supports the\nchannel likes our videos comments on the\nvideos checks out my website benp\nparks.com buys running hats technical\ngear our festar rated plans I love\nhearing all about your stories your\nsuccesses with the kit and the plans and\nthe videos as well so thank you so so\nmuch so in this video we're going to be\ngoing through the best daily the best\nspeed shoe the best race shoe the best\nMax stack recovery shoes the best long\nrun shoes the best budget shoes the most\ncomfortable shoes the best for heavier\nRunners the best for beginners and then\nfinally the best overall so make sure\nyou stay tuned for that feel free to\nmove the slider around in the video\neverything will be timestamped so\nstarting out with the best daily shoes\nand the Nova blast 5 but what's a daily\nshoe all about these really are shoes\nthat do it all pretty well great for\nthose daily Mars for people that just\nwant to maybe just have one shoe in\ntheir rotation or it's going to be a\nstaple of a big shoe rotation as well\nthe shoe where you're clocking up most\nof your miles and this was a late entry\nthis year it's only just come in the\nnumber five Nova Blast from aex set me\nback\n\u00a335 a 41 mil stack cut at the back 8 mm\ndrop overall 300 G so nicely on the\nlight side new updated midsole with the\nFF blast Max sizing wise what worked\nbest for me was going half aze down\nright starting out with my likes a\nreally smooth stable ride with this one\nit's very bouncy it's very cushioned it\nlooks after the legs well on those\nlonger runs a true daily trainer the\nshoe's really comfortable at lots of\ndifferent speeds second like really good\nvalue at this price segment it's well\nput together good build quality as well\nand should last a decent amount of time\nthird like comfort with the shoe again\nreally good I'm really liking the new\nlacing system they've got on the Nova\nblast 5 giving a really good solid\nlockdown and again with this partially\nusted tongue in there that's not moving\naround and providing any irritation it\ndoes feel a little bit wider up front\nhere so if you've got a wider foot\nyou're going to Rejoice here a little\nbit of extra material just really comfy\nstraight out the box and some good\nbreathability as well my next like is\nyou've just got a lot of cushion here\nversus the weight of the shoe sho's\nquite nice and lightweight but you've\ngot lots of chunky foam here to look\nafter the legs it feels really\nlightweight on your foot as well so\nkudos for aex for getting this around\nfor me around about 300 G my fifth like\nis the true versatility of this shoe\njust very easy to run in no fuss really\nsimple and again really easy for me to\nrecommend it just gets on does the job\nno matter what distance or Pace is on\nthe plan it's going to look after you\npretty well in terms of what I don't\nlike about the shoe the dislikes the wet\nweather grip real shame at this time of\nyear as well it's just surprisingly not\ngood the version four of this was\nequally as bad and unfortunately they\nhaven't changed the compound of the\nrubber on the bottom you might be\nslipping around a little bit with this\nshoe in the winter but in the dry and in\nthe summer you're going to be all good\nso in summary the Nova blast 5 one of\nthe best all rounders out there a really\ngreat shoe at this price point whether\nyou're going to get your bolt training\nin or you just want one shoe in your\nrotation to do at all if you are worried\nabout that winter grip let's have a chat\nabout the aded ass Boston that's coming\nup next so my next best daily shoe of\nthe year is the Adidas Boston version 12\ngot some really good winter grip on the\nbottom of here so you don't need to\nworry about sliding round without us\nthis fantastic Continental grip but this\nshoe sent me back\n\u00a3140 38 mil stack out at the back 7 mil\ndrop overall for me 318 G little bit\nheavier than the Nova blast but still\nnot too bad midso wise we've got a layer\nof the ultra light light strip Pro added\nasses at premium foam and then a layer\nof the light strip 2.0 Eva and it's also\ngot some glass fiber infused energy rods\nin here kind of like a play added as his\nversion of a plate with these rods that\nrun through the shoe sizing wise these\ndo come up a little bit big for me I\nordered my usual UK size 12 had a bit\ntoo much room at the front of the shoe\nprobably due to the very minimal amount\nof padding at the back of the shoe but\nyeah that's just me I'd recommend going\nhalf aze down right let's have a chat\nabout my likes starting out with that\nexcellent grip that Continental rubber\noutsa really fantastic for wet weather\nthe second like here it just delivers\nthat fun engaging ride it's really happy\nto pick up the pace probably a little\nbit more than the Nova blast because of\nthose rods you've got running through\nthe shoe the ride feels surprisingly\nfast it feels like you spent a lot more\nthan 140 to get the kind of speed that\nyou'll be able to pull out of this shoe\nthis update here bought that slightly\nwider base so stability again\nsurprisingly good in the shoe this is a\nshoe I could definitely see someone\nracing a 5k all the way up to a Marathon\ndistance so true versatility and then my\nfinal like with the shoe it also feels\nnice and lightweight on the foot the\ncushion really helps with those longer\nruns and as say pretty wide in the upper\nwhich is really good for an anad shoe\nnormally they do come in very much on\nthe narrow side but the Boston don't\nneed to worry about that plenty of space\nup front in terms of dislikes with the\nBoston just that minimal padding around\nthe heel that's just kind of what you\ngot with this update it didn't cause me\nany problems i' just like a little bit\nmore Comfort there for my longer runs\nsome people might get some heel slip and\nthe tongue is just a little bit on the\nshort side so you can't do that heel\nlock down lacing I didn't have any\nissues with it it just something that\nmight well happen but in summary with\nthe Boston just a great all round daily\nshoe it's got that more assisted ride\ncompared to something like the Nova\nblast it's not quite as comfortable as\nthe Nova blast but it's definitely\nslightly faster and you're going to pick\nup the pace a little bit more with the\nBoston but if you do want to pick up the\npace a little bit more than that let's\nhave a chat about the best speaches of\n2024 right we've got a couple of speed\nshoes to chat about now some very\ndifferent types of speed shoes as well\nthese are for when you want a nice\nSnappy fast shoe for doing some of your\nworkouts in for your faster efforts your\ntempos or your thresholds or maybe some\nshorter races as well although really\nyou can do a lot of different racing in\nthese shoes there really are those shoes\nthat are just that one down from the\nallout Super Shoes starting out with one\nof my very best shoes of the Year stay\ntuned to see if it makes the best shoe\nof the year the Nike Zoom Flight version\n6 this has been an absolute joy to run\nin this set me back\n\u00a315 really big maximum stack cut at the\nback 42 mil so just over that legal\nlimit 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise\ngetting a little bit heavier now\n322 G midsole wise we've got a couple of\ndifferent Foams here on top we've got a\nnice layer of Nike's Flagship zoomx\nmidsole and then underneath we've got\nthis EVA foam which Nike called the sr2\nfoam that's a little bit firmer but adds\na little bit more stability and also\nsome really good durability and support\nin there as well there is a carbon fiber\nPL PL in the shoe Nike call that a fly\nplate and that sandwich between those\ntwo layers of foam and this was true to\nsize for me right let's chat about the\nlikes there's quite a few to get through\nhere the first one being the comfort\nthat this shoe offers really fantastic\nthe heel counter lock down really good\ngood amount of padding at the back of\nthe shoe so you feel nice and secure no\nissues with any sort of slipping good\namount of width up at the front of the\nshoe as well really comfortable for\nthose longer runs could certainly run up\nto a Marathon distance in this shoe it\njust has that all day Comfort feel about\nit second one speed wise I've been\nreally surprised at the speed I've been\nable to extract from the shoe version\nfive the one before this was super\nchunky really heavy this one is lighter\nand it just feels and is a lot faster as\nwell the rocker at the front of the shoe\nhere just gives a really smooth\nfootstrike really smooth turnover and I\nactually found myself always looking\nforward to the next rep the midsole\nmashup that you've got here with those\ntwo different Foams it's just really\nresponsive and so so bouncy you really\nfeel like the shoe is just propelling\nyou forward you could Cruise along at\nthose Marathon effort Paces for a very\nlong time the plate isn't super stiff\nyou don't really notice it too much and\nit really helps with that stability in\nthe shoe as well and I'd really say this\nSho is only slightly slower for me\nversus my alphafly and my vapor fly and\nthey're much much stiffer and of course\nmuch more expensive as well my third\nlike with this shoe is just the True\nValue at this price point it appears to\nbe really quite well well built and\ndurable the out soole really really good\ngreat grip on this outs soole is just\nnot wearing at all at the moment and I\nwas carried on running the shoe well\nafter 100 miles which is really\nimpressive given the amount of fast\nrunning I haven't done too much jogging\nin this shoe most of the time I've been\ndoing my speed sessions those fast\nrunning efforts as well and carbon\nplates at this Price Point again pretty\nhard to find odd that Nike have kind of\npric this very competitively but I think\nthey thought they've got a real winner\non their hands here they've got to\nlaunch this with an attractive price\npoint to real sort of say their back on\nthe scene and a lot of people check up\nand notice just how good this shoe is at\nthat price point but as I say it's not\nall likes a couple of dislikes three\ndislikes to go through actually the\nfirst one with this waffle outsole\nNike's waffle outsole is just a little\nbit noisy again it's just something to\nnote here if you run by yourself it\ndoesn't matter but if you're a little\nbit self-conscious it might be a little\nbit noisy but you're getting some really\ngood grip in the shoe there as well the\nrear stability it's just a little soft\nat the back of the shoe that might put\nsome heel Strikers off for me I'm a\nmidfoot or 4ot sort of Striker so I\nhaven't really had any issues there and\nthirdly I don't know let me know what\nyou think down in the comments it's just\nnot the prettiest shoe again does that\nmatter if we're running fast let me know\nyour thoughts but in summary a really\ngood option for anyone training for a\nfull Marathon or a half marathon to do\nthose speed workouts those longer run\nworkouts with those race Pace blocks in\nalso a good option for racing for people\nthat don't want to break the bank and\nspend 200 plus 250 I think the alpha FES\nare \u00a389 and absolutely crazy that's not\navailable to everybody so again a really\ngood option for a significant amount of\nchange just a great value shoe a lot of\ntech and a really good price point right\nlet's look at something a little bit\nmore lowkey which was the socy Endorphin\nspeed 4 so I got the socony shoe in In\nThis Very vibrant colorway earlier on\nthis year used it a little bit through\nthe summer there's a much lower stack\nheite lot more ground feel you're going\nto get in this shoe compared to the Nike\nbut starting out I paid \u00a3180 for this\nshoe little bit on the expensive side\nfor this segment stack cut at the back\n36 mm 8 mm drop overall weightwise a lot\nlighter though 285 G really can pick up\nthe pace so well in this shoe we've got\nsoers power run PB foam here a nylon\nplate so it's not too aggressive not\nlike that full stiff carbon plates that\nyou get sizing wise this was good this\nwas true to size for me starting out\nwith my lik's really versatile shoe I\nactually put this shoe in my sort of big\ndaily recommendation because you can jog\naround in the shoe just as much as you\ncan pick up the pace in the shoe as well\nso it kind of goes between the two\ncategories you could easily go out for\nan easy run with stries Tempo runs track\nsessions and even races for me i' say up\nto a half marathon personally wouldn't\nwant to do a marathon this I'm sure some\npeople have but for me up to a Half\nMarathon distance I just personally want\na little bit more cushion in the Foams\nthere for a Marathon distance and then\nI'm really liking the plate in this shoe\nit's not super aggressive it feels\nreally nice at those easy running Paces\nso for your warm up and cool down and\njust jogging around between reps as well\nfeels super comfortable there and my\nsecond like with the shoe we've got a\ntouch on it because it's so lightweight\nit's Nimble it's Snappy but also really\nstable as well just got that fast\nengaging ride good ground feel for those\npeople that like a little bit more\nground feel that's what you're going to\nget in their shoe for a fast park run\nfantastic grip on the bottom of the shoe\nas well good stability in the corners it\nthe lock down it holds your foot nicely\nin place but let's have a chat about a\ncouple of dislikes for some people this\nis going to be a little bit too firm I'd\nrecommend then going for that Nike\noption if you want that super soft super\nbouncy super squishy responsive type\nshoe go for the Nike if you want a bit\nmore ground contact feel again it's\nstill responsive and it's still py but\nyou just don't have as much sort of\nrange of motion in the cushion you don't\nsink into the foam as much with this\nshoe so there maybe a dislike maybe a\nlike I never know what to say in these\nthings it depends what type of shoe\nyou're after but because of that flip\nside I think it's probably a little bit\ntoo firm for that Marathon distance for\nme I'd like a little bit more cushion in\nthere so better suited this shoe 5Ks\n10ks half marathons you're going to\nreally enjoy that lightweight nature of\nthe shoe but in summary who do I\nrecommend the sakon Endorphin speed 4\nit's a really great option for someone\ndoing a lot of speed work a lot of\ntempos lot of thresholds anyone looking\nfor that lightweight shoe that isn't\nprobably going to be into their\nmarathons too much or anyone just\nlooking for that lightweight Snappy shoe\nthat they can really pick up the pace\nand run very fast with a high Cadence in\nas well but probably just steering away\nfrom those super long runs or that\nmarathon training right let's have a\nchat about the big Racing shoes of the\nYear those Super Shoes starting out with\nthe shoe that I think I've raced three\nmarathons in this year which is the very\nlovely Nike fly version 3 so this set me\nback\n\u00a3285 I probably bought it on sport shoes\nwith a bit of a discount code but that's\nthe RRP anyway stack C at the back right\nof that legal limit 40 mm 8 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise a staggering 269 G\nso lightweight for the volume and the\namount of foam in this shoe mid wise\nwe've got a full chunk of Nike Zoom X\nfoam here two Air Zoom Pods at the front\nof the shoe and a carbon fiber plate\nthat's running throughout the shoe as\nwell sizing wise all good here this was\ntrue to size for me starting out with my\nlikes it's just a super smooth ride that\nyou're getting in alphafly version 3\nversus 1 and two 1 and two were just a\nlittle bit clunky this one is so much\nsmoother through the footstrike it's\nvery lightweight especially given the\nsize and the bulk of the shoe if you are\na heel Striker this shoe again is going\nto be a lot smoother than vers version\none and version two my second like\nthey've just dialed up that Comfort\nagain in version 3 just a little bit\nmore the breathable upper you're getting\nso much air flow through this shoe\nyou're getting a really good solid\nlockdown with this fly knit upper it\njust hugs the feet so well just like\nyou've got an extra pair of socks I've\nhad absolutely no issues with any\nblisters any hot spots or anything\nuncomfortable at all no discomfort\nduring any of my marathons or training\nruns and I did have plenty of issues\nwith the alpha 5 1 and version two\nespecially just here on the inside it's\njust a little bit too built up and I was\ngetting some rubbing and irritations\nthere for me that's definitely gone away\nwith version 3 just finding a little bit\nfaster than the first two versions and a\nlittle bit more comfort as well my third\nlike with the shoe is just the\ndurability that this one offers I think\nI did my review of this shoe after 250\nmiles and I was just really surprised at\njust how Poppy the foam was holding up\nhow popular the airpods were it just\nwasn't slowing down even after those 250\nMI of course I was getting a little bit\nof wear as we're now getting on this\npair here and I've done about 100ks in\nthis shoe that's always going to happen\nbut it just didn't feel any slower when\nI had a brand new pair on one foot and\nmyly older pair on the other they both\nfelt really surprisingly good I really\nthink most people could get about 3 to\n400 miles of good happy training miles\nand racing miles out of this shoe and\nreally don't listen to all the\nmanufactur saying you're only going to\nget 100 good K they just want you to buy\nmore shoes they really do last a long\ntime this dislikes really still a little\nbit on the noisy side I'll put some\nfootage of me running the mabor marathon\nhere going through the park you can just\nhear the shoe again if you're a little\nbit self-conscious they're a bit Slappy\nthat's just what you get but they're\nsuper fast my second one they're still a\nlittle bit on the narrow side through\nthe midfoot so if you have got a\nparticularly wide foot through that area\nyou might still be getting a little bit\nof irritation but those tweaks they made\nwere all good for me and then yeah just\nthe price this is pretty much the most\nexpensive running shoe you can buy I\nknow added have got their one at \u00a3400 I\ndon't think anyone's really entertaining\nthat you've really got to be an elite\nathlete to get the most of that anyway\nbut nearly \u00a3300 the alpha fly it's just\na lot of money but for me it's the\nfastest shoe that I've run in this year\nespecially over those half marathon and\nMarathon distances but I didn't do all\nof my races in this shoe we did actually\nreach for another shoe just here that's\nbeing pass to me done a lot of training\nMars I actually ran New York marathan\nlast year in this shoe but this is still\nthe current shoe from Nike and I ran\nLondon marathon in this shoe and I ran\nBoston Marathon in this shoe earlier on\nthis year pricewise this sent me back\n\u00a3240 stack kite I said we going the\nwrong way around Stack kite 40 mil stack\nat the back of the shoe 8 mm drop\noverall and Weight Wise are very nice\n252 G so it's a little bit lighter than\nthe alphafly but it's a lot lower volume\noverall we've got Nike zoomx from\nmidsole and we're getting that all\nimportant carbon fiber plate and this\nwas true to size for me well let's have\na chat about the likes of the vaporfly\nstarting out it's very very fast because\nit's a little bit lighter than the\nalphafly it just feels a little bit more\nSnappy you're getting loads of\nspringiness and responsiveness from the\nplate in the shoe it gives a really\nengaging ride as well it really feel\nlike the shoe is out there working for\nyou it's also very comfortable probably\nthe most comfortable racing Super Shoe\nthat I've ever probably it is the most\ncomfortable racing Super Shoe that I've\never run in so many of the Super Shoes\nin this category are very aggressive\nvery stiff and pretty uncomfortable as\nwell with minimal padding but again this\nshoe it just works it's super\nlightweight so it doesn't have a lot of\nexcess materials in here but for me it's\njust been comfortable right at the box\nand I think I've probably must have done\naround about 600 K in this shoe so far\nand it's been comfortable through every\none of them and also with this shoe it's\nreally the most versatile Super Shoe I\nthink out there at the moment for me I\ncould run 5Ks 10ks half marathons and up\nto the Marathon distance with the alpha\nflly because it's a bit heavy a bit more\nof Cruiser it doesn't have that sort of\nturn of pace because it's a little bit\nheavier but with this you're getting\nthat I really feel the airly is better\nit just lasts longer it looks after your\nlegs a little bit better in the Marathon\ndistance but for the shorter distances\nthis is where I'm going this is where\nI've been using this shoe just an\nabsolute joy to running and it's also\nsignificantly cheaper than the alpha as\nwell dislikes with this shoe I really\nfeel the shoe's best at your race Paces\nit's not the best shoe to be running\nagain no super shoes really have that\nsort of ability to run around jog\nrecovering easy run Paces in so maybe\nI'm being a little bit harsh there but\nthese shoes are so comfortable and so\nPoppy and so much fun at your race Paces\nnot a shoe to be walking around in or\njogging around in or anything like that\nbut in summary slightly more versatile\noption than the alphafly better suited\nto those shorter race distances 5Ks 10K\nhalf marathons with the alphafly is just\na little bit more Marathon specific and\nvaporfly just a little bit more on the\ncomfortable side and obviously a little\nbit cheaper as well but once we've done\nour races then it's all about Mac stack\nand Recovery shoes to look after those\nlegs so let's come on to our first entry\nin the video from Puma now I really\ndidn't think I would enjoy this type of\nshoe but I found myself reaching it so\nso often these are kind of my Monday run\nshoe after a big Sunday session just to\nhelp my legs recover and look after the\nreally well or whenever I've just going\nout for a very long run for a 30k run or\nsomething like that this is the type of\nshoe I really like to take on those runs\nwhen I'm not going to be picking up the\npace so starting out with the Puma mag\nMax Nitro quite an expensive shoe here\nespecially for Puma\n\u00a3170 stack height a massive absolutely\ncrazy 46 mil stack at the back of the\nshoe 8 mm drop over allil and as you\ngoing to see with the both these shoes\nhere a little bit on the heavy side\nobviously for the banner bulk in them to\nlook after your legs\n366 G mids soole we've got Puma's ful\nlength nit TR foam midsole and the\nsizing was true to size for me lik wise\nwith this shoe Ultra grippy pumer grip\non the outsole been fantastic especially\nas I've got this shoe during the winter\ntime it just hasn't let me down once\nmany people now say that pumer make the\nbest grippy outso on their shoes and\nthis one I can't disagree with that it's\nbeen fantastic also surprisingly stable\nYou' got to have confidence in the\ncorners when it comes to these Mac stack\nshoes people worried about rolling\nthings like that but this shoe you\nhaven't got to worry about that the\nstability in this shoe from the phone\nbecause it's slightly more on the dense\nside here so you don't feel like you're\nwallowing all over the place this is a\nlittle bit firmer than most people might\nimagine it doesn't have that super soft\nsuper squishiness stay tuned for the\nnext shoe if that's the type of thing\nyou're looking for but it's got that\njust right amount for perfecting that\nlong run performance and touching on\nthat stability as well your feet\nactually sit slightly below the top\nlayer of the Mido it's has this almost\nlike sort of V running through the\nmiddle of the shoe so they just stay so\nfirm and so planted in the shoe don't\nworry that doesn't sound comfortable but\nit really is and then the energy return\nfrom that microfoam Mido surprisingly\ngood and you can pick up the pace a\nlittle bit more in this shoe then you\nmight realize again it's not going to be\nthe shoe you're going to be watching\ndoing your speed sessions they are very\nbouncy for sure but you really don't\nnotice this bulk and the weight quite as\nmuch as you might imagine but touching\non a couple of dislikes with the shoe\nagain slightly expensive for a puma shoe\nusually offer some really good value the\nprice point of the shoe it's fine it's\njust not the usual Puma sort of value\nfor money that they're offering and\nsecond it's just a little bit on the\nnarrow side but if you got pretty\nstandard to all narrow feet you're going\nto be absolutely fine but wif footed\npeople should avoid you'll be all right\nin the next one though so summary of the\nPuma mag Max Nitro just very wellb built\nlonglasting shoe it's going to absorb a\nlot of that impact on those slower Pace\nrun those recovery runs or those long\nruns where you're going out all easy and\njust really great grip on the bottom of\nthe shoe so you don't need to worry in\nthese winter months also very stable\ngood for heavier Runners here and we\nhave got a section all for heavier\nRunners coming up later in the video but\nif you want something a little bit more\nsuper soft super squishy then have a\nlook at the hoker skywood X this is just\ncrazy I feel like an absolute giant\nwalking around in the shoe and running\naround in the shoe you need to check\nBridges when you're running through them\nbut anyway this is the Hocus skywood X\nsent me back\n\u00a385 48 48 mm stack height at the back of\nthe shoe they've got absolutely no\nground feel in the shoe whatsoever you\ngot a 5mm drop overall\n378 G which I'm pretty sure is the\nheaviest shoe I've ever reviewed but\nit's the type of shoe where it doesn't\nmatter too much no one's really\nconcerned about the weight of the shoes\nin this category here midso wise we've\ngot two layers of midso foam here one\nlayer of hok's Premium super soft peber\nfoam and then one layer of their super\ncritical EVA foam for that durability so\nthis soft foam with the peber for that\nsquishiness that softness that bounce\nEva for that durability so it lasts a\nlong time and we have got a carbon plate\nrunning through this shoe that's not\nreally in there for any speed it's in\nthere to help with that stability with\nthis amount of foam you'd just be like\nalmost like you're drunk C there\nwallowing all over the place it just\nbinds that all together to give a nice\nstable ride sizing wise it was true to\nsize for me now what I really liked\nabout the shoe let's have a chat about\nthose likes it's fun it feels really\nquite smooth despite all that bulk in\nthere I think that carbon plate is just\nhelping with that smooth ride and it\nalso feels pretty good quality as well\ngreat for longdistance walking or anyone\nbeing on their feet all day as well for\nme it's been the shoe I'm just reaching\nfor my legs are really tight I'm just\nenjoying that squish that softness that\nthis phone provides it's also very much\non the comfortable side again as you'd\nwant for this type of shoe good lock\ndown no hot spots or any blisters like\nthat really nice support at the back of\nthe shoe dislikes with this shoe it's\nreally hard but it's just obviously it's\nheavy and it's bulky it's the heaviest\nshoe I've ever worn it' be nice if they\ncould strip out just a little bit of\nthat weight but we've got some good\nrubber on the outside here again\nabsolutely no problem running in the\nwinter with this this out soole so yeah\nit's hard to really pick these apart and\nsay these shoes they're too heavy\nbecause they always going to be really\nyou just got to bear that in mind when\nyou buy them they might feel a little\nbit on the heavy side let's a little\nsummary chat about the skyex as with the\nPuma it's been really good for those\nrecovery jogs the Mac stack that really\nsoft foam looking after my legs when\nthey're just feeling a little bit\nbattered on those Monday mornings the\npummer got a little bit more firmer feel\nto it that's the shoe I'd be reaching\nfor for my long all easy runs the sky X\nagain you can run long in it of course\nyou can but it's really a lot softer a\nlot squishier a lot more compression\nyou've got going on here but still it's\nreally stable and just really good fun\nto run in right let's have a chat out\nsome more dedicated long run shoes when\nwe're doing that marathon training\nsessions we're going out for long steady\nefforts picking up the pace over the\nlong runs starting out with one of the\nshoes that's definitely a contender for\nsure of the year so much lighter than\nthose last ones the absolutely lovely as\nsuper blast version 2 this is my second\npair luckily I've managed to secure four\npairs this year but you've really got to\nknow what you're doing when to log on to\nwebsites to buy them because it's the\nmost in demand shoe this year without a\ndoubt this shoe sent me back 200 stack\nat the back of 45 mm but an 8 mm drop\noverall weightwise so lightweight 288 G\namazing for the amount of foam you're\ngetting midsole we've got mostly asx's\nFF turbo foam which is classic most\npremium foam this is what they put in\nall of their high-end ra shoes there's\nno plate in this shoe and then sizing\nwise I did go half a size down I went\nhalf size down in version one and again\nin version two I did get two sizes when\nI first bought version two to see if\nthey corrected the sizing but nope still\nwent half a size down and it was\nabsolutely fine right likes with the\nshoe it's just so so versatile I\ndefinitely could have put this one in\nthe daily shoe category as well but long\nruns where this shoe really sings a shoe\nthat really can do it all Races speed\nwork easy runs long runs this shoe could\nfeature in any of the categories in this\nvideo and it's also so comfortable as\nwell this is the shoe that I reach for\n90% of the time when I'm not testing\nother shoes second light with this shoe\njust so lightweight it's just amazing\nyou can pick up the pace so well in this\nshoe if you're just out there and you\nthink I fanty having a bit of fun today\non easy runs you want to do some strides\nor just think I'm going to do a bit of\nan impromptu fart Le if you are doing\nsome marathon training long runs with\nsome 5K marathon pace blocks in it can\ndo it all it's so versatile and also yes\n\u00a3200 for a non-plated shoe is expensive\nbut it's been so durable for me as well\nit's holding out surprisingly well we\ncan easily get 1,000 k out of this shoe\nno problem at all 600 miles if you're a\nlittle bit heavier probably a little bit\nless a little bit lighter potentially a\nlittle bit more as well but really\ndurable the upper is holding up\nfantastically well this is what it looks\nlike after this is probably around about\n600 K I've got in the shoe plenty more I\ncan do in this one dislikes wise just\nsuper hard to get hold of and yes it is\na little bit more expensive but the\nversati makes up for that also just have\na quick chat about the grip on the shoe\nI haven't actually got this on my notes\nhere but after the Nova blasting with\nthe grip problems the grip is not too\nbad on this aex have a different\ncompound of rubber on the bottom of\ntheir shoe and it's okay you're going to\nbe all right in the winter I wish they\ntake it off here put it on the Nova\nblast Mak it such a better shoe it's not\nthe best don't don't get me wrong you\nknow it's not like the Puma grip or the\nAdidas Continental grip but it's okay\nyou get by you don't need to worry about\nit it was a really good upgrade on\nversion 2 versus what they had on\nversion one but in summary a lightweight\nMax cushion shoe that can handle every\ndifferent type of run brilliantly\nexpensive but it's so much damn fun and\nit will last a long time as well\ndefinitely a contender for sh of the\nYear stay tuned for that\nright let's have a chat about another\nlong shoe surprisingly even more\nexpensive than the super blast but\nyou're getting a plate in here and\nthat's the shoe I had in over the summer\nthe New Balance SC Trainer version 4 the\ntrainer version that goes with the SC\nElite a shoe I didn't really enjoy but I\nreally enjoyed the trainer version so\nmuch more comfortable and just a good\nall round training shoe but anyway this\nset me back a quite staggering \u00a3230 it\nreally is probably the most overpriced\nshoe here but I've really enjoyed it 40\nmm stack height at the back of the shoe\n6 mm drop overall\n325 gam so what's that a good 40 odd G\nheavier than the super blast and you\nreally do notice that difference midso\nwise we've got a mix of peber and Eva\nFoams here from New Balance just a good\ncompromise and that softness that\nresponsive and getting that durability\nin the shoe as well and then that carbon\nfiber plate in here which is a little\nbit on the stiff side but not too bad\njust adding a little bit of rigidity and\nstability sizing my TR size for me likes\nwise with this shoe just really\ncomfortable straight out the box\ncomfortable on those long runs just for\nthose time on feet again when you want\nto pick up the pace during those long\nruns this is an ideal as New Balance say\ntraining shoe for those marathons those\nhalf marathons and it's a really great\nvalue shoe if you live in America for\nsome reason this was so much cheaper in\nthe states for any people from Europe if\nyou're going to America then definitely\nlook at picking up this shoe you're\ngoing to save a good amount of money if\nyou're out there dislikes just the price\nreally that's the only thing I can silly\nsay if you're in the UK or Europe and I\nthink in Australia it was absolutely\ncrazy and it's quite hard to recommend\nso this recommendation really is just\nfor our American friends only but if you\ngot the cash and you want to spend it\nher might to stop you it's been a really\ngood trainer for those long runs a\nslightly softer option than the super\nblast some people find the super blast a\nlittle bit on the firm side I actually\nquite enjoy it without amount of\nfirmness but if you want a more of a\nsofter ride again this is the type of\nshoe you should be looking at it's also\na dam easier to get hold of than the\nsuper blast which is permanently out of\nstock right not everyone's got this\ncrazy amount of money to spend on shoes\nso let's have a chat about some good\nbudget options out there we've got a\ncouple of really good options perfect\nfor anybody starting out in the sport or\nanyone looking just to save a few\npennies and just want to get some really\ngood value and durability out of their\nrunning shoes as well starting out with\nthe anadas S SL2 one of my most\nsurprising shoes of the Year this sent\nme back just an amazing \u00a3110 that I\nthink I even got this one special for\n\u00a397 when I actually bought it 36 mm\nstack height 9 mm drop overall\nweightwise so lightweight\n287 G we've got a layer of Adidas's\nsuper premium light stripe Pro and then\nthat sandwich between two layers of\ntheir more durable Light Strike 2.0 foam\nso you're getting that durability with\nthat foam a little bit of Poppin with\nthe Adidas light stripe Pro sandwich\nbetween them and unsurprisingly you're\nnot getting plate in the shoe at this\nprice point these do run a little bit\nsmall so I definitely recommend going\nhalf a size up here I got my normal size\nand they were just about okay but if I\nwas getting them again I would\ndefinitely go half a size up my likes\nwith the shoe it's lightweight it's\nSnappy and it's good fun it brings a\nsmile to your pace when you run and\nthat's what running should be all about\nthe midso off is that really engaging\nride and a really good turn of speed\nyou're getting here of course it's not\nas fast as the shoes with those rods and\nthose plates or full length of the\npremium Foams as well but it's still\npretty good it holds its own weight\nsurprisingly well it's punching above\nits weight I should say surprisingly\nwell my second like with the shoe just\nof course the Great Value that this shoe\nis offering usually Foams at this price\npoint are just so dull and hard and just\nunengaging and normally I can't wait to\nget them off my feet with this one I\nactually enjoyed it and I carried on\nusing it cuz I couldn't believe just how\ngood it was add as for some reason\nputting that layer of the most premium\nfoam in the shoe has really just bought\nit to life it's made such a difference\nwith this shoe it's so good to see ad\nputting that into their entry level\ngetting people interested in the brand\nso many people are going to try this\nshoe because of the price point get them\ninterested in the brand and then they\nwill spend a little bit more potentially\non the Boston and all the pros\nlater down the line as well so it's a\nreally good move I think from Adidas and\nthirdly really good durability with the\nshoe the outsole you're not getting the\ncontinential grip but the out soole was\nsurprisingly good good amount of grip\nfrom Adas own rubber on the bottom of\nthe shoe and then touching on a few\nlittle dislikes here it might definitely\nbe a little bit too narrow for some\npeople average to narrow size footed\npeople you're going to be okay but if\nyou got a wide foot I'm afraid this is\ngoing to be one to avoid also it's a\nlittle bit unstable in the Corning just\nbecause of how narrow it is but overall\nan excellent value shoe here for a lot\nof people when they starting out or a\nlot of people that are just a little bit\nmore budget conscious out there you're\ngoing to be able to get the vast\nmajority of your training done in this\nshoe which at this price point is really\nfantastic but there was another really\ngood Contender out there early on this\nyear and that was another shoe from Puma\nwhich was the velocity Nitro version\nthree so this shoe sent me back\n\u00a310 36 mil stack at the back of the shoe\n10 mm drop overall Weight Wise\n336 G midso we have pummer standard foam\nhere they Nitro foam and there's no\nplate in this shoe the sizing was true\nto size for me starting out with the\nlikes with the shoe just really\ncomfortable right from the off lots of\npadding in this shoe the laces hold the\nfeet in position really quite nicely\nsecondly surprisingly again really quite\na versatile shoe the Nitro foam is fun\nand bouncy it's a good all round daily\ntrainer and you can definitely run at\nlots of different Paces in this shoe\nthird like really good grip the pumer\ngrip as we said earlier with the magmax\nabsolutely fantastic also really good\ndurability regardless of the price this\nis a really good solid winter option and\nthen fourth like you've got to talk\nabout the price here as we did with the\nSL2 it feels a lot more expensive than\nit actually is really surprisingly good\nbuild quality with the shoe as well you\ncan also pretty much always get the shoe\na lot less than RRP so just absolutely\nmind-blowing value dislikes wise the\nstandard width again unfortunately with\nboth these budget shoes they are a\nlittle bit on the narrow side but\noverall with the Puma just a really good\nvalue shoe massively underrated\nmassively underpriced as well in my\nopinion as I say you can usually pick\nthese up for a lot cheaper than RRP very\nsimilar to the Adidas but a little bit\nmore on the firmer side little bit more\nground contact feel you're getting in\nthis one so if you want a budget shoe\noption a little bit more squishy softy\nbouncy go for the Adidas a little bit\nharder a little bit more ground contact\nfeel but a little bit more responsive\nthen look at going with the Puma Right\nMoving On Let's have a chat about the\nmost comfortable shoes of\n2024 when speed isn't everything you\njust want something to cruise along with\nto look after your feet just wrap them\nup in some cotton wool in the most\ncomfortable package that there is then\nthese are the shoes that will do that\nfor you so starting out with the aex GEL\nNimbus 26 in this very vibrant canary\nyellow colorway that I had earlier this\nyear the purpose of this shoe just those\neasy runs and those recovery runs a\nlittle bit on the expensive side this\nsent me back\n\u00a380 although there are a lot of deals on\nthis shoe at the because version 27 is\ndue out sort of early part of q1 of 2025\nstack cut at the back 42 mm stack kite 8\nmm drop overall Weight Wise little bit\non the chunky side 373 G for me in my UK\nsize 12 midso wise we've got asx's FF\nblast Eco plus and sizing wise it was\ntrue to size for me now starting out\nwith the likes it comes in three\ndifferent widths Hallelujah for those\nwider footed people standard wide and\nextra wide as well the upper super\ncomfortable super soft very stretchy\ntongue as you can see in the video here\nUltra breathable everything about this\nshoe has been engineered to be\ncomfortable it's actually marketed as\nthe most comfortable running Sho of all\ntime it's quite hard to disagree with\nthat but it gives a really nice lock\ndown here no overheating no hot spots no\nblisters or anything like that to worry\nabout dislikes wise again it's just not\ngoing to be the most versatile type of\nshow there really ideally this is dialed\nin for those slower Paces those recovery\nrun Paces easy Pace runs just when you\nwant to go out and just have something\nthat just going to look after your feet\nreally nicely there's not much pop in\nthis shoe so don't expect to be picking\nup the pace too much of course if you\nneed to you need to run for a bus you\ncan of course you can but it's not going\nto be the type of shoe that you're going\nto want to have on those for races or\nspeed sessions or anything like that if\nComfort is your main priority then look\nno further than this shoe this was my\nrecovery shoe for the definitely for the\nfirst half of the year before I got the\nskywood X in and the Puma magmax and\nthen I sort of went a little bit more\ndown that route but one shoe from New\nBalance that's just being handed to me\nnow was the New Balance Mo version 5\nthis is definitely I think this is going\nto be the softest squishiest shoe I have\never run in the foam here is absolutely\nridiculous you'll be melting into the\nfoam and into the road as you run along\nthis one this shoe for me is just simply\npurpose wise all about recovery and\nlooking after your legs you really can't\npick up the pace too much in this one\nprice-wise 140 so not too bad as they go\nSt Co at the back we've got 44 mm of new\nbalan's Fresh Foam x midsole 4 mm drop\noverall 374 G all these shoes are around\nabout the same sort of weight in this\ncategory Fresh Foam X mids sole here\nextra soft extra plush this really does\nfeel like you're running along with\nmarshmallows under benath your feet this\nwas true to size for me now likes with\nthis shoe very comfortable but also very\nvery soft a great option not just for\nrunners but for anyone wanting all day\nComfort out there people that might be\nwalking Long Way working retail working\nin a medical envir anything where you're\ngoing to be on your feet all day this\nwill really look after your feet\nfantastically well second like with a\nshoe just a really good width and good\nsurface area on the bottom of your feet\nas well so do feel surprisingly stable\nin them you can have a little bit of\nconfidence in the corners but you will\nbe sort of tipping a little bit over to\none side with just how soft this foam is\nyou've also got a really nice rocker at\nthe front of the shoe is a very nice\nsmooth ride in terms of dislikes with\nthis shoe the upper is quite thick\npotentially some breathability issues\ngetting some air flow through the shoe\nthere that's not really going to affect\nanyone at the moment but in the summer\nit might well do and really this is just\nan easy and Recovery run shoe only as\nwith the Joe Nimbus the foam is really\nso soft so you're not really going to to\npick out the pace too much in this shoe\nbut this one is even softer Joe Nimbus\nvery soft this one very very soft the\nsoftest shoe I've ever had the pleasure\nof running in but perfect for someone\nthat loves that soft marshmallowy\nfeeling in a shoe \u00a340 cheaper than the\ngel nimus so that's not bad too right\nlet's have a chat about heavier Runners\nso we put a video earlier out this year\nall about the best shoes for heavy\nRunners and it did really well so thank\nyou to everyone that checked that one\nout just perfect for Runners looking for\na little bit more protection from the\nroad some Foams that aren't going to\nbottom out and some good extra\ndurability because there a bit more\nForce going through the shoes here so\nthey would last a long time we've\nactually had some really good options\ncome to the market and these are our top\npicks the first one being Nike zoomfly\nversion six that's right at the bottom\nour P but this shoe we had here we'll\nput the time stamp for when this appears\nearly on so definitely check that one\nout as well as the Puma mag Max two\nreally good options there for heavy\nRunners again we'll put the time stamps\nup on the screen now but another really\ngood option out there for heavy Runners\nis the Brooks Glycerin Max which we had\nin through well actually quite recently\nin the Autumn and I really enjoyed\nrunning in the shoe perfect for those\neasy runs those recovery runs and also\nthose long runs as well this shoe sent\nme back\n\u00a380 45 mil stack at the back of the shoe\n6 mm drop overall Weight Wise again all\nkind of roughly the same\n375 G we've got Brooks's DNA tuned\ncushioning two different types of\nnitrogen density within this foam got\nsome larger cells at the back of the\nshoe perfect for those soft little Airy\nsort of Landings and some smaller cells\nat the front of the shoe just for a\nlittle bit more of a poppy toe off\nthrough that foot strike and sizing wise\nthis was good this was true to size for\nme so what did I really like about the\nshoe the first one being it's very\nsmooth and stable through the footstrike\nthe mids soole is a little bit firmer\nthan you might expect quite super blast\ntype feeling with this shoe but this is\nso much heavier Unfortunately The Rocker\nat the front of the shoe is really nice\nand smooth just helps with that\ntransition through the foot strike and\njust helps disguise the weight of the\nshoe really quite well second light with\nthe shoe comfort-wise again really good\nhere so much cushioning around the heel\nreally giving a really nice lockdown\nthird like with the shoe it's just very\nwell put together a really good quality\nshoe something you always do expect from\nBrooks and my fourth like with the shoe\nit's really good in larger sizes some\nheavier Runners bigger people bigger\nframed people this goes all the way up\nto size 14 and have a really good\ngenerous width at the front of the shoe\ndislikes with this shoe it's really\nideally only good for that easy Pac\nrunning heavier Runners if you want a\ngood race shoe look at this one or the\nalphafly as well but the zoomfly 6 and\nthe alphafly be perfect for some heavier\nRunners that want that allout speed Tu\nbut those daily miles this is where\nyou're going to be getting a lot of your\ngood training in so in summary with the\nBrooks that 45 mil stack kite really\ngood op option for those heavy Runners\nyou're not going to be bottoming out\nthis foam here and it's definitely going\nto last a long time as well some really\ngood durability really liking the rubber\nthat Brooks have put on the bottom of\ntheir shoe again some good winter grip\non there as well and the fact that it\ncomes up in some larger sizes as well\nand that decent width means it's a\nreally nice option right let's have a\nchat all about best shoes for beginners\nif you're new to running and looking for\nyour first pair of running shoes you\nwant something that's going to be really\nnice and versatile something you can run\non the roads run on the treadmill maybe\na little bit of light trail out there as\nwell lots of different paces and\nsomething that's course going to be\nreally nice and comfortable and off some\ngood longlasting value as well you're\nprobably not at this stage so dedicated\nand invested in the sport to have a big\nshoe rotation or anything like that so I\nthink the best options here would be\nlooking at something like the novablast\nversion 5 it just ticks so many boxes\nfor that doit all shoe at a pretty good\nprice point as well for people that\ndon't want to break the bank again we'll\nput the time stamp for this one so you\ncan go and look at the full review there\nanother great option at that even\ncheaper price point the Adidas SL2 again\ntime stamp is up on the screen now go\nand check that one out there again both\nthese shoes really good price points\nreally good versatility they're offering\nyou can get so many of your runs done in\nthem and potentially have a good race in\nthem as well it's really going to get\nyou invest in the sport with some good\nquality kit that's going to last a long\ntime we do have a dedicated full video\nwhich we made before these shoes\nactually came out so you want even more\noptions on some good beginner shoe\noptions then we'll link to that down\nbelow and up here as well right here we\ngo the best of the best the best overall\nsection of the video before we get stuck\ninto that let me know down in the\ncomments what has been your best shoe of\nthe year what shoe have you bought and\nit's really bought a smile to your face\nshare and help out the running community\nand let everybody scroll through the\ncomments and see some great options out\nthere as well I think the second best\nshoe the runnerup shoe of the Year for\nme has been the Nike Zoom Flight version\nreplaced a quite frankly terrible\nversion 5 in my opinion this one I got\nit in and I just wasn't that excited to\ngo out for running it and as soon as I\nput it on as soon as I started in those\nearly CES I was like there's something\nvery very special going on with this\nshoe I quickly got over the slightly odd\nquirky looks with it and I say I've done\nso many training sessions a lot of the\ntime I've just put this shoe on instead\nof my Alpha F instead of my vapor fly\ndon't want to put 20 miles on that and\nI've just been amazed at how fast this\nis amazing how fun it is we've had some\nreally good times together so that's\nbeen my runner up shoe of the year but\nyeah maybe a little bit predictable and\nmaybe a little bit more a little bit\nboring I don't know but this oh Sarah\njust smashed the microphone hopefully\nyou can still hear us now but yeah I\nreally can't say anything other than the\nsuper Blast 2 for my shoe of the year\nunfortunately with the availability\nissues it is still hard to get a hold of\nbut it's so light it's so much fun and\nit is that shoe that if I could just run\nin one shoe for the rest of my life then\nthis is what it would be it travels with\nme wherever I go if I can only take one\nshoe on a plane on a trip or on a train\nthis is the shoe I'll be taking it's\ncomfortable to wear casually and just\nwhatever you do in it it just delivers\nan amazing fun engaging responsive ride\nand it just makes me feel quite happy so\nthat's my shoe of the Year let me know\nyour shoes of the Year down in the\ncomments below hope you've enjoyed the\nvideo got so much shoe content coming up\nin 2025 really excited planning those\nvideos out and finally thank you for\nmyself and Sarah everyone that supports\nour videos so I hope you've enjoyed it\nthat's it guys keep on working hard keep\ndone I'll see you in the next one",

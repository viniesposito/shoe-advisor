  "text": "after really enjoying the Mac 4 and Mac\n5 I've been eagerly anticipating this\nMac 6 update when I heard about all the\nchanges I was really worried though but\nwas I right to be concerned well stay\ntuned as we dive into all that and more\nwith the full review of the Hoka ma\nversion 6 my name is Ben Parks 225\nMarathon please excuse this work going\non behind me at the moment we're getting\nset up for the London Marathon Expo we\nhope to see a lot of you there as we're\nexhibiting our whole range which you can\nsee on benp parks.com any time but today\nwe're talking all about this new latest\nand greatest update from hoker going to\ngo through the facts and figures the\nchanges my likes dislikes and is this\ngoing into rotation so without further\nAdo let's get stuck into the facts and\nfigures so the purpose of the hookup Max\n6 well this is an everyday non-plated\nspeed shoe perfect for your daily miles\nand slightly faster runs as well this\nshoe set me back\n\u00a3140 I bought the shoe 100% with my own\nmoney here off the hoko website in the\nUK I give that completely honest\nimpartial review it's going to be about\n\u20ac60 or\n$140 the stack out of the back 37 mil at\nthe back of the shoe 5 mm drop overall\nand for me this is coming in around\nabout 276 g a pretty nice lightweight\noffering here from hoker it's a neutral\nshoe and it has this lovely engineered\nmesh upper not the most brutal one I've\nrun in but really not too bad we'll come\non to all that a little bit later on in\nthe midsole of the shoe you've got one\nmassive chunk of hokus super critical\nfoam one of the biggest updates here\nwith this shoe there's no carbon plate\nin the shoe but we've got an all new\nrubber out soole the first for the Mac\nhere which does give it a little bit of\nstiffness a little bit of rigidity as we\ngo through the whole foot strike there\nare two different widths available in\nthe shoe regular and wide which you can\nspec on the hoker website if you think\nyou have any sort of extra width in your\nfeet definitely go for the wide version\nthere's also four different colors to\nchoose from and this for me in my UK\nsize 12 was true to size right let's get\nstuck into all of the differences\nbetween this and the outgoing version 5\nthe biggest update with the Mac 6 is\nthis new massive chunk of their super\ncritical EVA foam in the outgo Mac 5 you\nhad a little bit of that and then\nbeneath it a really hardwearing Eva\nphone now you've just got a big chunk of\nthe most sort of softest squishiest but\nalso pretty responsive super critical\nfoam there's also been a big increase in\nstack code about 7 to 8 mm extra St kite\nin the shoe so many manufacturers are\ndoing that these days and you can really\nfeel that difference when you're running\nin both of these shoes version six now\nhas this rubber outso to the shoe to\ngive that a little bit of extra\nstability a little bit of extra support\nin the foam if you didn't have that this\nfoam would wear out very very quickly in\nthe old shoe you didn't have that you\njust had a layer of the Eva hard wearing\nfoam on the bottom you can't have that\nin this they've added this extra bit of\ntraction extra bit of rubber outs salt\non the bottom of the shoe so you do Lo a\nlittle bit of ground feel there as well\nversion 6 also to me does feel a little\nbit on the narrower side and hus say\nthey've updated the back of the shoe as\nwell it's a very minor tweak right let's\ngo to my likes the first like with the\nshoe is it was supremely comfortable one\nof the most important things when\nlooking for a new pair of shoes let us\nknow down in the comments what's your\nmost important thing you want speed\nComfort let us know got a really good\nsolid lockdown with this very nice\ncomfortable upper I really like the\nupdated heel color I can't really feel a\nmassive difference but it's still really\ngood no heel slip issues or anything\nlike that when I go out testing these\nshoes I'm always hyperware Sensations\ntrying to pick up any sort of things of\nhow my feet are feeling I just kind of\nSwitched Off running this one it's\nreally odd and so I had said to Sarah\nwhen she was cycling behind me it's just\nthere getting the job done my second\nlike with this shoe is this update this\nnew super critical big chunk of super\ncritical foam it really delivers a fun\nand also very responsive ride a little\nbit like the New Balance Rev V4 again\nwith that massive chunk of foam at the\nbottom of the shoe there it's always\npushing you to go a little bit faster\nand that could be good or it could be\nbad this is really not a shoe to take\nout for your recovery runs but it's\nalways egging you on always sort of\npushing you to pick up your stride pick\nup your Cadence and run just that little\nbit faster for me the shoe really sings\nthat faster end of our easy Pace all the\nway up to Marathon half marathon 10K all\nthe way up to 5K paast that's where the\nshoe really delivers and not only\nthrough the foam but also because it's\nsuper lightweight as well you really\njust feel you've got running along with\nabsolutely nothing under your feet which\nis a really impressive job from hoko\nwith what they've done considering that\nincrease in stack height that increase\nin responsiveness adding the outsole for\nthat extra durability the weight has\nonly gone up a very very small amount\ndifferent depending on what size you're\nrunning in so just a great all around\neveryday shoe to bring a smile to your\nface when you're getting your runs done\nmy third like with the shoe is this new\noutso that they've added for version 6\nyes it really helps with durability\nand grip when I have taken out in some\nwet weather the out soole has been okay\nthe grip's been okay everything's just a\nlittle bit average probably as you'd\nexpect on a shoe like this I have seen a\nfew people complaining about the wet\nweather grip but in the dry the out\nsoole is delivering some really good\ngrip but it just really helps support\nthat midsole gives it a slightly stiffer\nfeel but also it means you can just\ncover the ground that much smoother and\nI really just love how this shoe feels\nthrough the whole foot strip with the\nrocker at the front of the shoe as well\njust a much better structure with how\nthe shoe is put together right let's get\nstuck into my dislikes now the first\nthing to have a chat out here is not\nreally a dislike for me but I really\nwant to bring attention to it it's just\nthis is a very very different shoe from\nthe outgoing version 5 if you're a\nmassive fan of the version 5 you might\nnot necessarily really like version 6\nwith a massive increase in stack height\nthis shoe gets with that outsole you're\nlosing a lot of that ground contact feel\nG is that very very lightweight and\nsuper responsive ride that the Mac was\nfamous for and now it's just a bit more\nsubdued now some people are really going\nto like this update but some people are\nreally not going to like it so depends\nwhat type of Camp you're in there have\nbeen some really big changes with this\nupdate for me I personally really like\nit I like a little bit more stack heite\nI like what the outso is doing this shoe\nit's a much better overall General shoe\nbut we're losing some of these Niche\nproducts out there and the Mac was a bit\nof a niche sort of speed workor Fast\nVery responsive lightweight shoe and\nthat's kind of gone from the hoker range\nso you may be wanting to stock up on\nversion 5 if you were a fan of that type\nof shoe and the other things to note in\nthis shoe is very typical of hoker they\ndo like their narrow shoes this is\ncertainly a little bit narrower than the\noutgoing model so I'd certainly say\ndefinitely look at the wide options if\nyou have anything approaching wide feet\nas well and my final sort of thing to\nnote is it just feels a bit awkward at\nrecovery run Pac it's not a true Do-it\nall shoe that's still going to be the\nClifton but for this type of shoe which\nreally is that higher end of all the way\nup to 5K it really does deliver very\nvery well so in conclusion who should be\nlooking for a shoe like the Hoka Max 6\nor for me someone looking for a\nnon-plated shoe for their faster easy\nruns their tempos maybe a little of an\nimpromptu sh race maybe a park run\nsomething they do their sessions in as\nwell best suited for those definitely\nquicker Paces am I going to keep this\nshoe is it going to go in my rotation\nI'm definitely going to keep it I don't\nthink I'm going to do too much and I got\nso many shoes to test but I've really\nenjoyed running in it it has really\nbought a smart on my face I probably\nenjoyed the rebel just a little bit more\nbut I had some bad heel issues with that\nshoe with some blisters nothing with\nthat in this shoe so I definitely\nrecommend checking it out I've really\nenjoyed running in it I have no problem\nin recommending it to friends family and\nmost importantly all of you the amazing\nrunning Community out there next up\nwe've got the hoker massive comparison\nvideo you can watch that over here or\njust below that you can check out the\nreview of this the New Balance Rebel\nversion 4 keep on working hard keep on\ngetting done guys we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

  "text": "running a 5k at Max effort is one of the\nvery hardest things you can do in\nrunning the margin between a Flawless\nrace and complete disaster is Razor thin\nbut when you have a good day and\neverything clicks it really is one of\nthe best feelings and I know that's what\nyou're going to experience after putting\neverything in practice that you're going\nto see in this video because I'm sharing\nmy very best tips on how to run that\nfaster 5K we'll go through the training\nyou need to do the sessions that help me\nrun a 1526 at a park run 5K and some\nbonus race tactics too so stay tuned to\nthe end of the video for that right\nlet's get stuck into it how to run a\nfaster 5K so how long do you need to\ngive yourself to train for that faster\n5K well ideally you want to give\nyourself around about 10 weeks for a\nsolid training block which\ncoincidentally is the exact amount of\ntime that all of our plans are that we\nhave on the website so maybe check those\nout at benp parks.com so you need to\nfigure out where and when you want to\nhave this 5K attempt and then work\nbackwards 10 weeks from that maybe a run\nmaybe a race but making sure somewhere\nthat is nice and flat without too many\nsharp turns as well but maybe you're not\nthat bothered about having an official\n5K time and you just want to go by your\nstraa go by your GPS and find a nice\nflat fast loop somewhere near your house\nwe'll put a list down below of the\nfastest Park runs here in the UK and a\nfew race organizers that we know\norganize some really fast races as well\nto get that official 5K time if that's\nwhat you're after check out the links\ndown below so many people come and ask\nme what is a realistic IC time that I\ncan be aiming for well this obviously\nvaries wildly between the amount of\ntraining that you've been able to do in\nthe past our historic training in our\nlegs but newer Runners are able to make\nsome significant improvements in those\nearly stages the more experienced\nRunners are because they're already\ngoing to be a little bit closer to their\nlimit so the margin of improvement is\ngoing to be a little bit smaller but as\na Rough Guide with around about 10 weeks\nof training this is roughly where you\nneed to be before starting these\nattempts so for someone looking for a\nsub 20 you should already be about sub\n22 for a sub 25 you need to be already\nbe about sub 28 and for a sub 30 attempt\nreally need to be at least sub 35\nminutes moving on to have a chat about\nweekly mileage how far do we need to be\nrunning every week during our training\nwell for a sub 20 attempt we're talking\naround about 5 to six runs a week up to\naround about 40 miles or 64k in total\nvolume for sub 25 we're talking four to\nfive runs a week up to around about 30\nmiles 48k of total training and for a\nsub 30 attempt 3 to four runs a week up\nto around about 20 mil or 32k that total\nvolume during the week in order to run\nfaster over that 5K distance we need to\nget the body used to running at that\ngold pace and even a little bit faster\nthan that gold Pace as well and a great\nway to do this is incorporating speed or\nworkout sessions during our week we'd\nreally recommend setting aside one\ndedicated run during this week more\nexperienced Runners might want to\ninclude two of these sessions during the\nweek but we'll touch on that a little\nbit later on on now these workouts will\ninvolve running at a hard effort for a\nparticular amount of distance or time\nfollowed by a period of rest and\nrecovery and then repeating this a\nnumber of different times so here are\nsome really good sessions that you can\ntry to incorporate into your week all\naround about 4 to 5K of total overall\neffort the first one 8 to 10 times\nrunning 90 seconds repeats this will be\na little bit faster than our goal pace\nand then about 90 seconds to 2 minutes\nrelax walking recovery between each of\nthose blocks the second session I really\nlike to do is 6 times 3 minute reps at\nthe goal pace and then around about a\n2minute walking recovery between those\nreps as well and then my third one what\nI like to call kick down C so it's four\nto six reps of a k but we're doing the\nfirst 800 M of that rep around about our\n10K pace and then kick down at the end\nfor that last 200 M at our goal pace so\nwith these ones we want to add in around\nabout a 2-minute walking recovery\nbetween those reps really helps to get\nthe body working at effort towards the\nend of a rep simulating what it's going\nto be like during that 5K race before\nall of these we need to start out with\nabout 10 to 15 minutes of very light\njogging doing some running drills and\ngetting the body warmed up and ready to\nbe running fast now alternatively your\nlocal running club might well be putting\non some weekly speed sessions so maybe\ncheck those guys out and also a lot of\npeople ask me do I have to be doing this\nat a running track well if you've got\none near you that's great they are\nreally good and you'll know you can run\nsome exact distances if you do your\nsessions there but you really don't need\nto have a track there just find\nsomewhere nice and flat available to you\nand ideally traffic free as well also if\nyou weren't aware most of our GPS\nwatches that we wear you can program\nthese sessions into your watch and then\nfollow it through so you don't have to\nremember exactly what you're doing in\nyour head all the time you've got a\nGarmin choros all the major\nmanufacturers look up how to program\nthose workouts into your watch so as I\ntouched on before if you're a fairly\nexperienced Runner and you've already\nused to a lot of this type of training\nyou could include a second speed session\nduring the week as well I would\npersonally recommend focusing the first\nspeed session of your week on some\nshorter reps something like a 10x 400 m\nand then the second session of your week\nsome slightly longer reps so something\nlike 3 to four * 1 mile reps or even\nlook at including something like a 20\nminute tempo run which will elevate your\nFitness even more moving on to a little\nsecret that I really love and I really\nwish more Runners would put this into\ntheir routine because they are fantastic\nthat is something called strides now\nthese are really mini reps little burst\nof speed of pace around about 20 seconds\nof fast running around about 90% effort\nwe say here and it's really good to\nincorporate these when you finish one of\nyour easier runs throughout the week now\nif you're new to stri you've never done\nthese before then maybe start out with\nfour reps of this and after each of\nthese just give yourself round about the\nsame around about 20 30 seconds just to\nrelax and recover get yourself focused\nagain before you're ready to go on the\nnext rep now it's so important with\nthese to be focusing on good form and\nstaying nicely in control we don't want\nto be doing all out Sprints here the\nmain benefit of doing things like\nstrides they're really good at\nrecruiting they fast twitch muscle\nfibers so you can put in a strong Sprint\nfinish at the end but most importantly\nthey really help improve our running\nform it's very hard to run with bad\nrunning form when we're running at this\nsort of pace the rest of your week\noutside of your speed session should\nideally involve some kind of long run\nand then also some easy runs in there to\nhelp build and maintain your endurance\nthe speed sessions during the week do\nput a lot of stress on your body so\nyou're going to need to include some\nrest stays in there so our body can\nadapt and recover but we also need to be\ndoing some easy runs during that week at\na nice low intensity running\nconversational Pace because if every day\nwas one of those allout speed sessions\nwe would get injured very very quickly\nso how long should our long runs be for\nsomeone training for a 20 minute 5K\nprobably around about 7 to 10 miles\nsomeone training for a sub 25 we're\ntalking six to eight miles for the long\nrun someone training for sub30 around\nabout 4 to7 miles the pace of these\nshould be nice and relaxed very easy\nZone 2 heart rate conversational Pace\nthe kind of pace you can have a chat\nwith a friend if they were running next\nto you on the screen now we'll put some\npacing recommendations for anyone\nlooking for that sub 20 sub 25 or sub30\npacing recommendations for those easier\nlonger runs and then finally race day is\nhere how are we going to go about\nputting these 10 weeks of training into\npractice well for me there's two\ndifferent ways you can Pace a 5K run\neither start slightly slower than your\ngoal pace and then speed up as the Run\ngoes along so a nicely Progressive Way\nstart out slower than gold Pace then to\nGold Pace then finish strong ahead of\nour goal Pace or as I think most people\ndo and what I like to do is set out at\nmy gold Pace running nice even splits\nall the way there and then in that last\nlittle bit at the end the last 300 M or\nso really give it my all kick down for\nthat stronger finish if you're the kind\nof person that likes to go out hard and\ntry to bank time that rely rely works\nmost of the time this ends up in blowing\nup and you'll just see on straa that\npacing chart that just goes like that is\ngetting slower all the way down you want\na nice even splits all the way through\nso do we need to eat or drink anything\nduring a 5k well probably not if it's a\nreally really hot day then potentially\nwe want to be taking on a little bit of\nwater but for most people they're going\nto be fine to get through this distance\nof course if you're thirsty please do\nhave something to drink with gels or any\nother race nutrition we aren't going to\nneed these during the race some people\ndo like to take a gel on the start line\npotentially but really your body will\nhave enough fuel in it to get through\nthe 5K some races and some Park runs\noccasionally do have pacing groups as\nwell so I'd really recommend having a\nlook into that if that's the kind of\nthing you're looking for helps take away\na little bit of the mental stress of\nworrying about your pacing and then how\ndo we set up your watch well I'll put my\nexact watch setup on the screen now for\nme when I'm racing a 5k I really like to\nfocus on just my lap pace which is the\npace I'm running that particular a\nkilometer for me cuz I work in\nkilometers but oh that's that particular\nK or or that particular mile if you're a\nmild person and I just like to stick to\nthat and tick each one off so for me\nwhen I ran my 15 20 or something like\nthat I was just looking for round about\n303 304 for each K yeah I'm sticking to\nthat nicely it ticks off and then I want\nto repeat it again for the next K\nrunning a 5k flat out really is one of\nthe hardest things that we can do in\nrunning believe me when you cross the\nfinish line look down at your watch in\ndisbelief at what you've just managed to\nachieve it feels feels amazing it's\nincredibly addictive so please let us\nknow how you get on in your next 5K race\nI always love to hear how everyone gets\non in their training one of the most\nimportant aspects that we need to also\nfit into our training is making sure\nwe've got a really good strong head on\nour shoulders to keep pushing when\nthings get really tough around about\nthat 3 and 4K Mark so to learn some\nreally good mental tricks you can take\nthrough to your next races check out\nthis video next",

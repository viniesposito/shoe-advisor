  "text": "[Music]\nNike has just launched the second\ngeneration zigama with a few big changes\nthat will hopefully solve the issues\nthat many people face with version one\nI've just put 100 miles through this\npair here to see if Nike have finally\nsolved their outso issues that have\nplayed a lot of their recent trail shoes\nso coming up we've got all my likes my\ndislikes and there's a few so stay tuned\nfor that and to see if this shoe is\ngoing to be going into my rotation and\nof course like everything on this\nchannel I've bought this shoe 100% with\nmy money to give you my complete\ncomplely honest impartial unsponsored\nthoughts on this shoe to make sure that\nyou get the right shoes on your feet if\nyou're running right let's get stuck\ninto this review and get the zigama 2\ndone so the big update from version one\nwhich is here to version two is this all\nnew Vibram outsole the grip on version\none was really truly terrible especially\nin the wet and the dry it was okay but\nthe wet was just a disaster so now we've\ngot this updated Vibram Mega grip out\nsoole that Nike put in the shoe they'\nalso the upper a little bit and just\ntided a few little things up made a\nlittle bit more aerodynamic and they've\ngot a little bit more of a rocker on the\nfront here as well versus the outgoing\nmodel not any big updates up top the big\nupdate everyone's talking about is that\noutso right let's have a chat about all\nof the facts and figures starting out\nthe purpose of a shoe like the zigama 2\nthis is very much a longdistance cruisy\ntrail shoe built for Comfort terms of\nprice wise this sent me back\n\u00a3160 buying this off the sport shoes\nwebsite site here in the UK it's going\nto be around about $180 or\n\u20ac180 stack card at the back Nike is so\ngood they love telling us all these\nfigures well they really don't it's hard\nto find out but we're thinking around\nabout 36 mil stack at the back and\naround about a 4 mm drop overall in\nterms of weight for me this is coming at\n389 G in my UK size 12 the outgo model\n387 so 2 G basically exactly the same as\nthe outgoing model it's a neutral shoe\nthe upper of the shoe this engineer mesh\nupper hopefully getting a nice amount of\nbreathability through there we'll come\non to that later on in the review the\nmidsole of the shoe we've got Nike's\nFlag ship zoomx sort of wrapped up in a\ncarrier foam to protect it out of those\nTrail so super squishy super bouncy very\nresponsive and now zig's finally joined\nultrafly Nike sort of Flagship carbon\nplated Trail shoe to have that Mega grip\nout soole Unfortunately they haven't put\nit in the Nike Pegasus Trail 5 which\nwe'll be reviewing soon on the channel\nbut yeah the zigama and the ultra have\nthis fantastic grip on the bottom there\nare no different widths available terms\nof colors we've got two at launch here\nin the UK and five in the US rather\nbizarrely they're all very light colors\nso a lot of people like some darker\ncolors when they're running on the trail\ncuz they get muddy and everything bit\nodd and finally this was true to size\nfor me in my UK size 12 exactly the same\nsize as I had in the outgoing model\nquickly guys if you are find this video\nso please smash that like button share\nit with a friend and let us know your\nthoughts down in the comments Below on\nwhat you think about Nike cigar you are\nyou interested in it are you going to be\ngiving it a go or could you recommend\nsome other options out there to help out\nthe community and if you got time please\ncheck out my website benp parks.com that\nwould be really fantastic where we make\nthe best running hats and Technical gear\nin the business thanks very much guys\nright back to the video so starting out\nwith my likes the first one is this\noutsole that Nike put this vibrant Mega\ngrip the wet grip the dry grip the\nallaround traction in the shoe is night\nand day better than the outgoing model\non mud rocks wet Dr it all past with\nflying colors as I said I've done 100\nmiles in this shoe I've barely slipped\nat all my second like with the shoe is\njust the stability and it's just got\nsuch a smooth ride through the\nfootstrike I think a lot of that's\nprobably coming from this outsole it\njust gives a lot more rigidity there's a\nlot less chance of rolling your ankle\njust a lot less of this sideways\nmovement you get with a shoe compared to\nthe outgo model which just will move a\nlot more so in corners and changing\ndirection it really handles it very well\nlove this sort of increase rocker we've\ngot at the front here so when you are\nrunning on Tac sort of as a more of a\nroad to Trail shoe you can run in much\nmore of a natural way as well so it\nreally gives you a lot of confidence\nwhen you're out there with that grip and\nthat stability as well my third like the\nreason I really like the originals of\ngar was it super comfortable that\nComfort remains here it is still super\ncomfortable and you've got so much\ncushioning to protect your feet when\nyou're out on the trail yes it's a high\nstack shoe it's not going to be for\neverybody but if you're looking for that\nsuper soft super comfortable just\nrunning over rocks and everything in\nyour path without really even feeling\nthem or noticing them then you're really\ngoing to like running in the shoe and\nthis is what the shoe looks like after\n100 miles of running it's really got\nvery little we on there so far so\ndurability with this is really going to\nbe fantastic and I'm expecting to get a\nlot of miles out of this the ankle Gator\nat the back for me it's kept all the\nlittle rocks out and I personally didn't\nhave any heel slip issues in the shoe at\nall and we'll touch on that a little bit\nin the negatives coming up so with that\nlet's get stuck into the negatives the\nfirst one being it's still quite a big\nheavy clunky shoe but at least there\nhasn't been any weight gain with this\none they also do run a little bit hot\nI've been running in in quite hot\nconditions it's coming into the summer\nmy feet have been getting a little bit\nwarm in this shoe as I've been running\nalong hasn't caused any issues but if\nyou are in a particularly hot climate\nyou may get some overheating issues in\nthe shoe my second is like is\nsurprisingly a little bit on the narrow\nside now I did quite a long RAC in the\nshoe at the weekend the new upper just\nseems to have a lot less depth to it and\nwhen I took my feet out at the end my\nfeet were so scrunched up sorry I\nhaven't got any fidget this my feet look\ndisgusting my feet were so sort of\nscrunched up and I actually did have a\ncouple of small blisters starting to\nform just because it felt a little bit\non the narrow side they look very\nsimilar to the outgo model never had any\nissues in that it just has a little less\nmaterial up the front here and the feat\njust haven't got as much room to spread\nout and breathe up at the front it's a\nreal shame at the moment there's no wide\noption with the shoe because that would\nbe a really good one to go for if you\nhave got some wider feet I really think\nit's it's one to avoid but on my shorter\ntraining runs had no issues at all like\nthat it was just when I was going out\nfor a super long time feet were getting\na bit swelled up towards the end of a\nvery long day out on the trails and my\nfinal dislike is the laces are just\nbizarrely quite short so if you are\nsomeone that has some ankle slip issues\nit's going to be really quite hard to do\nthat heel lock lacing I did manage to do\nit as you can see the footage here now\nand one thing the outgo model had was a\nhalf decentish toe bumper at the front\nso if you stab any rocks or trees you\nhit that that seems to have disappeared\noff this one now I did have quite a bad\nfall in the sure I just hit a tree route\nas you can see I've got a little bit of\ndamage on my arm here and and on the\nknee if you can see that but I didn't\nhurt myself in any way but yeah just the\nend of my end of my feet were just a\nlittle bit sore from that would be nice\nto have had a proper toe bumper on there\nfor when we are heading out some more\ntechnical Trails especially in the\nmountains when you get a lot more rocks\nand things so in conclusion let's bring\nthis all together who should be looking\nfor a shoe like this there someone\nthat's looking for that long distance\ncruisy shoe that screams all day comfort\nso long as your feet aren't too wide and\nthere now going to have the confidence\nthat it can run in all different\nweathers and conditions with this\nfantastic updated outsole if you're\nlooking for a lightweight Nimble shoe\nthen this one really isn't for you if\nyou as I say if you have got a slightly\nwider foot you are going to struggle\nwith this if you were a big fan of the\nzigama 1 are you going to like this I\nthink very much yes the updates of the\noutsole are really really good so will\nthis be going to my rotation W\ndefinitely yes I'm going to be enjoy\ndoing a lot more training Mars in this\nover the summer if I had another race\nsay next week would I be reaching for\nI don't think I would I think I'd be\ngoing back to my version one because\nit's just got that slightly wider\nfeeling up at the front but I'm going to\nenjoy putting some more testing miles\nthrough this to see if that was a bit of\na weird oneoff in that race or whether\nwe have really got that slightly\nnarrower toe box in the shoe as I've\nexperienced if you do go for a pair make\nsure you test them out really well\nindoors before heading outside just make\nsure you're getting a good lock down no\nsort of heel slip and yeah just see how\nthat front of the shoe feels but overall\nfantastic update on the bottom next up\nwe're going to be testing Killian all\nnew Tamir version 2 from New Normal some\nmassive vibrant Mega grip lugs on the\nbottom of that one so going to be really\nlooking forward to testing that one out\nnext up we've got Nike's whole Trail\nlineup if you want to check out some\nother Nike Trail shoes then check that\nvideo coming up here now that's it guys\nlet me know your thoughts down below\nkeep on working hard keep on get done\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

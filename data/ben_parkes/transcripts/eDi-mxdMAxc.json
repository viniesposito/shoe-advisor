  "text": "long runs long runs long runs arguably\nthe most important run of the week for\nanyone training for those longer\ndistances and with so many shoes out\nthere it's so hard to know what's\nactually best for you there's been a\nreal explosion from shoe manufacturers\nlaunching specific long run shoes\nrecently they designed to be comfortable\nfor a long amount of time with massive\nstack Heights and softer Foams to look\nafter your legs and keep that fatigue to\nthe minimum so I've got six shoes today\nhere to go through all tried and tested\non those longer runs at six different\nprice points too so there's something\nhere for everyone anyway let's get stuck\ninto it starting out with the cheapest\nand finishing off with the most\nexpensive the first one being the pummer\nvelocity Nitro 3 before we get stuck\ninto it I bought all of these shoes\ntoday 100% with my own money to give you\nthat completely honest impartial\nunbiased review so thanks very much to\neverybody liking sharing and subscribing\nto the channel it really helps us out\nhere so much right starting out with a\npuma this cost me\n\u00a3110 here in the UK well it should have\ndone but actually got these on for a bit\nof a cheeky discount PID just \u00a388 this\nshoe you can always find on offer\nsomewhere stack cut of the back 36 mm 10\nmm drop overall and 336 G for me in my\nUK size 12 the midso we've just got\npummer standard foam here their Nitro\nfoam and there's no plate in the shoe\nand this shoe for me was true to size I\nthink the shoe looks pretty cool but not\nquite as cool as the Ben Parks PB hat\nwhich is what I'm wearing in all of this\nfootage here so check it out in the\nlinks down below and feel free to use\nuse code YouTube 10 for 10% off your\norder thanks very much guys right let's\nhave a chat about all the likes of the\nPuma velocity Nitro version 3 this shoe\nreally was super comfortable in all the\ntraining I did the Nitro foam that\nthey're using here is fun and bouncy it\nfeels a much more expensive shoe than it\nis it's a good all round daily option\nreally versatile at all sorts of\ndifferent paces and different distances\nas well dislikes for the shoe just\nunfortunately it's a little bit on the\nnarrow sides this one is really just for\nthose narrow fitted people average\nyou're going to be okay but it might be\na little bit snug there I think they\nused to make a wide version but I can't\npersonally find it unfortunately so not\nsure about that but overall with their\nshoe if the price point is real priority\nthis is a fantastic option great value\nfor money massively underprice and you\ncan usually as I said pick it up for\ncheaper than the RP it really is more of\na general everyday shoe rather than\nspecifically for long runs at this price\npoint it's virtually impossible to find\na dedicated long run shoe but I think\nthis shoe really does get very very very\nclose to it so I wanted to put it in for\nthat budget offering here that really\ndoes do long runs pretty well moving on\nto have a chat about the aex Nova blast\nversion for came out earlier this year\nthis set me back\n\u00a3135 stack coat at the back 41 mm a good\nchunk of foam under the feet here for\nthose long runs 8 mm drop in the shoe at\na weight of 300 G so nicely on the light\nside here it's really what I personally\nlove to see in my running shoes with the\nmidsole we've got the FF blast Eco plus\ncushioning sizing wise I went half a\nsize down in this shoe what I really\nliked about the shoe is just a great\nbalance of light cushioning and\nresponsive all while being super\ncomfortable in this package as well it's\nalso got a bit of extra width in the\nshoe as well so really good wide-footed\noption here and it's a shoe that can\nreally pick up the pace nicely as well\nnot one that's again just for all out\nlong runs this one can actually pick up\nthe pace very versatile offering but\nwith that massive chunk of Stack height\nagain really good on those longer runs\nas well and I really think at this price\npoint around about \u00a3135 there is no\nbetter value that you can get out there\nwhat I didn't like about the shoe the\nwet weather grip isn't fantastic which\nis actually one thing that is really\ngood with a pum I forgot to add what\nthat in there fantastic grip there but\nthey do actually make a tree version a\ntrail version of this shoe which is\nexactly the same but they just slap a\ndifferent outso on the shoe which has\ngot a lot better winter grip so as we're\ncoming into the winter here in the\nnorthern hemisphere it could be a really\ngood solid daily and long run shoe to\nlook for there and then overall I just\nfeel this shoe is offering great value\nfor money it's so versatile like the\nPuma it's a little bit hard to find a\ndedicated long run shoe at this price\npoint but with these two options I\nreally feel you can go out there and get\nyour long runs done and also pick up the\npaces they're just really good allaround\noptions but with the Nova blast 4 you\njust got a little bit more stack height\nto absorb the impact coming up through\nthe road as well just to keep your legs\nfeeling fresh for a little bit longer\nand I think that's what you're going to\nfind by spending that little bit extra\nto get something like the Nova blast\nfour right moving on to a shoe that I\nstill have because I haven't actually\nworn it out we're talking about the\nBrooks ghost Max 2 which has only\nrecently dropped this shoe sent me back\n\u00a345 stack Co at the back 38 mm and a 6\nmm drop overall weightwise it's a little\nbit on the heavy side 373 G for me in my\nUK size 12 the midsole in this shoe here\nthis big white chunk here we've got the\nDNA Loft version 3 which has been an\nupdate from version one to version two\nand sizing wise this shoe was true to\nsize for me and it comes in medium wide\nand extra wide the only shoe on the list\noffering these wide options so wi footed\nRunners this is the one you need to be\nlooking at Brooks are fantastic are\noffering so many different widths and\nsizes and Support options in their shoes\nand what I liked about the shoe yes this\nupdated mids is now much much better\nthere's also a lot of foam underneath\nyour feet and it will look after your\nlegs really well on the long run I\nreally like this rocker design again a\nlittle bit of update here The Rocker\ndesign at the front of the shoe it just\nhelps you cover the ground well through\nthe foot strike it's just really quite a\nsmooth shoe it doesn't look it when you\nfeel it and you hold it and you put it\non you don't think it's going to be like\nthat and this when it's just got a\nlovely turnover through the footstrike\nit's also just very dependable it's a\nlittle bit boring a little bit like uh I\ndon't know this really doesn't excite me\nthat much but it's a shoe that can just\ngo out there on your long run and just\nget the job done with no fuss very very\ncomfortable option here as well it's\nalso a good shoe I'd recommend for any\nbeginners or any newer Runners out there\ngot some good stability in the shoe as\nwell just as people are building up\nstrength coming back to running on newer\nRunners as well it's going to look after\nyour feet really nicely on the long run\nnow what I didn't like about the shoe as\nI said it's just a little bit\nunfortunately on the heavy side also\nincredibly padded which some people will\nlove don't get me wrong but around the\nankle there is so much padding here yes\nit's great for Comfort but it's probably\na little bit Overkill and you're also\ngoing to struggle a little bit to pick\nup the pace too much this shoe like a\nlot of the shoes here is just very very\nhappy cruising along in that marathon\npace easy Pace recovery Pace second run\nof the day type option so overall with\nthe ghost Max 2 obviously it's going to\nbe a good option if you like the ghost\nas a daily option already this is\nbasically that but with a lot more foam\nunderneath just to make it a lot more\nsuitable for long runs and it's also\ndefinitely the option to go for as I\nsaid if you've got wider feet as well\nright let's move on to the hoker Skyward\nX we're now starting to talk about some\nplates in this shoe which is what you\nstarting to get by going up to this sort\nof price point now at\n\u00a3185 that I paid for this shoe and I\ncouldn't get it on special offer\nanywhere no discount codes so had to pay\nRRP for the shoe stack cut at the back\nan absolutely crazy 48 mm it's a really\nodd sensation when you put the shoe on\nyou just feel like you're 8 ft tall\nwalking around in this thing in terms of\ndrop we're talking about a 5 mm drop\nhere and\n378 G for me in my UK size 12 I'm pretty\nsure this is the heaviest shoe I have\never reviewed huge midsole wise we've\ngot two levels of midsole here one very\nsoft premium Heber midsole the kind of\nfoam that a lot of shoe companies using\ntheir very highest end Racing shoes and\nthen want a level of super critical EVA\nfoam here just for that added durability\njust a lot more hard wearing and then a\ncarbon plate that runs through the shoe\nkind of an x-shaped carbon plate it's\njust there really more for stability\nrather than speed now what I liked about\nthe shoe it's just so much fun to run in\nit feels super smooth smooth as well\ndespite what is a lot of bulk in this\nshoe and it feels really good quality\ngreat for the long run or even long\nwalks as well just for a good option for\nanyone that's going to be on their feet\nall day there's so much foam underneath\nyou to absorb impact and that's really\nwhat I found on my longer runs in terms\nof dislikes with the shoe yes it's just\nvery heavy it's very bulky and it's\nreally only good for going up to that\nmarathon pace in my opinion but overall\njust perfect for someone that's just not\noverly worried about the pace they're\ngoing at they just want something that's\ngoing to be Dependable super comfortable\nout there when they go out for their\nvery long run it's a good option also\nfor heavier Runners whose shoes might be\nbottoming out a little bit there's so\nmuch foam in this shoe you're not going\nto be worried about that at all right\nlet's spend a little bit more money to\ngo up to 20000 now we've actually lost\nthe carbon plate in the shoe and this is\nI know you can't smell this but the shoe\nabsolutely stinks cuz it's been pouring\nwith rain here today and this is still a\nlittle bit damp but this is my aex super\nblast version 2 no car carbon plate in\nthe shoe but you've now got a f length\nvery high-end PE midsole in the shoe and\na massive stack kite in here as well 200\nfor this shoe but it's really for me\nit's been my favorite shoe of the year\nit's sold out absolutely everywhere if\nyou see one coming up for sale then\ndefinitely go and buy it if you can\nafford it because obviously it's quite\nexpensive stack wise 45 mm stack at the\nback of shoe 8 mm drop overall and\ncoming in at a lovely 288 G which is so\nnice and light and yes you can massively\nfeel the difference between something\nlike that and the Skyward x 100 G\ndifference per shoe 200 g overall yes\nyou really do noce it seems like that\nmidsole wise it's mostly the FF turbo\nthe high-end peber midsole and there's\njust a little Slither as well of the\nmore Durable aex foam and as I said\nthere's no plate in this shoe sizing\nwise I went half a size down ax I tend\nto always go half a size down compared\nto every other brand that I buy but what\nI like about this shoe it's just so\nversatile easily the most versatile shoe\nhere on the list a shoe that can really\ntruly do everything races speed easy\nlong runs whatever you want to do it's\njust super comfortable this is the shoe\nthat I reach for about 90% of the time\nwhen I'm not testing other shoes hence\nthis is now done about 400 miles in this\nshoe now and I've absolutely loved every\none of those it's really lightweight and\nso you can pick up the pace really\neasily I've done reps in the shoe 5K\nPace 10K Pace run every different type\nof pace in this show as I say I raced a\nhalf marathon in it and it performed\nsuper well and I've taken it up to Long\nRun wise uh 36k getting ready for Berlin\nand I've raced marathons in version one\nof the shoe as well and it's been\nabsolutely fine what I didn't like about\nthe shoe yeah unfortunately it's just\nsuper hard to get hold of at the moment\nin those regular sizes yes it's a little\nbit more expensive but it's so versatile\nthe durability is fantastic this is\nholding up really well I'm pretty sure\nI'm going to get about 800 really good\ntraining marves out of this shoe before\nit's going to drop off and the phone\nwill become a little bit dead the super\nblast does give quite a firm ride so if\nyou looking for something a little bit\nsofter to really look after those legs\nthat marshmallow that cloud that squishy\nfeeling then go for something like the\nskywood x or our next option which is\nthe New Balance SC Trainer version 3 you\ncan really sort of feel the weight\ndifference it's not too much this is 50\ng heavier anyway let's start out with\nthe facts and figures\n\u00a3230 this shoe set me back so a hell of\na lot cheaper in the United States at\njust $180 there's a lot of price\ndifferences around the countries with\nthis shoe it's a little bit of an one\nstack height 40 mil stack height at the\nback of the shoe and a 6 mm drop overall\nas say Weight Wise 225 g so not too bad\nthe mids sole we've got a mix of a pea\nand Eva blend which is a really good\ncompromise for that softness and that\nresponsiveness and that durability and\nwe've got a carbon plate running through\nthe length of the shoe here again like\nthe skyex it's more there for stability\nrather than all outspeed and sizing wise\nthis was true to size for me I did\nactually get half a size down and it was\ntoo small small because I couldn't find\nmy size and I wanted to get in to review\nit so half size down was okay but I\nreally should have gone up true to size\nin the shoe I also really love this\ncolorway let me know what you think of\nthis guys it goes so nicely with our\ntechnical te which you can get on our\nwebsite and I'll link to it down below\nand feel free to use code YouTube 10 for\n10% off anyway let's talk about the\nlikes really comfortable straight out\nthe box as of course A lot of these\nshoes are are here I'm talking about\nsome really good high quality trainers\nhere they've got to be comfortable for\nour long runs and the plate adds a good\namount of stability as I say rather than\nthat speed so again it's suited more for\nthose slower Paces marathon pace I think\nyou could go up to half marathon pace in\nthe shoe absolutely fine half marathon\npace marathon pace easy Pace recovery\nrun Pace this is just going to\nabsolutely look after your legs really\nnicely on those long runs just really\nsoft marshmallowy feeling this foam here\nis just going to massively really help\nto absorb that impact of those long runs\nespecially anyone that's out they're\nrunning like I do living in a big city\nhere in London spending a lot of time on\nthat aspal and that tarmac dislikes the\nprice is absolutely crazy unless you\nlive in the USA or Canada which is just\nreally unfortunate because a lot of\nthese shoes here they are a bit Niche\njust for those long runs but overall as\nI say I have really enjoyed running this\nshoe and I'm going to continue running\nit even after I've done my testing and\nit's definitely one to pick up if you\nlive in the USA and Canada and can get\nit for around about $180 $185 Canadian\ndollars but for a lot of people they\nmight be better off in the UK going for\nsomething like the Skyward X very\nsimilar feeling Skyward X is just a bit\nchunky a bit heavy here this is a bit\nlighter bit more Nimble but still two\nvery good options so final thoughts I\nknow what you want me to say just tell\nme which is the best one and it's really\nhard to do that for me the super blast\nis probably going to be my best show of\nthe year so get subscribed to that when\nwe drop that video out probably at the\nstart of December when we do our top\nthree worst three and all of those sort\nof videos that will be coming up soon\nyeah it's really just that good but if\nyou want to go out there for simply all\nout comfort and a bit of fun something\nlike the sky X it's a really good solid\nbet as well or as I said something like\nthe SE trainer if you live in the states\nor if you're visiting the states or\nsomething like that so again a really\ngood option to pick up the ghost Max 2\nis going to suit some newer Runners out\nthere some more beginner Runners it's\njust so dependable very comfortable as\nwell and the pume and the Nova blast at\nthose price points they're really good\nso don't think you're being short\nchanged or anything and you're not\ngetting a fantastic trainer all the\nshoes on this list will look after you\nreally well the cheap ones they just\nmight not last quite as long and just\ndon't feel quite as premium as some of\nthe more expensive ones so that's it\nguys thanks very much for watching if\nyou want to check out my super blast\nafter 350 miles full review that is\ncoming up here and if you are a bit more\nof a beginner Runner then check out my\ncomplete list of beginner running shoes\ndown there that's it guys keep working\nhard keep wa done I see you very soon in\nthe next one",

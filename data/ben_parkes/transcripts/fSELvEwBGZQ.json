  "text": "whether you're gearing up for your first\nmarathon or you've run loads before\nthere are some classic mistakes that can\nturn your dream race day into a complete\nnightmare today I'm breaking down the\nbiggest Marathon blunders that could\nsabotage your race day but most\nimportantly I've got loads of solutions\nto those so you can run at your absolute\nbest and secure an amazing run over the\nmarathon from Pacing too fast to\ndisastrous fueling choices and even that\nlast minute temptation to try out new\ngear we've seen it all I've done most of\nthese before I've leared the hard way\nover the years but I've got some really\ngood news for you because if you stick\naround to the end I'll teach you all\nabout how to ster clear of these\npitfalls race smarter and have more fun\nout there and of course finish the Run\nstrong right let's get stuck into\nprobably the most common mistake of them\nall and that is going out too fast\neasily the most common mistake we see is\npeople charging off far too fast at the\nstart of the marathon they're feeling\ngood they've got all that nervous to get\nrid of and they look down at their watch\nand it says they're going to do 715 a\nmile when they really want to be running\nalong at 8 to do their 330 and then\nbefore they know it they've blown up at\nhalfway and they're running and walking\nand the race is a complete nightmare\nwhen you go off at the start of the\nmarathan of course you're going to feel\ngood you're going to be out there for 3\nfour or 5 hours if your training's going\nokay the pace is going to feel very easy\nat the start of the marathon and this is\nreally not the time to be thinking you\ncan suddenly go and run a 310 marathon\nwith when you've been training for a 330\nso what are we going to do about this\nwell no doubt you'll have a goal time in\nmind set off at that pace everyone's\nrunning with these fancy GPS watches\nthese days they tell you how fast you're\ngoing look down at your watch if you\nwant to be running 8 Minute miles or 5\nminutes okay make sure that's what it\nsays on your watch don't suddenly go off\na lot faster than that ideally for the\nfirst few miles go off a little bit\nslower than that and ease up to your\ngoal Pace as the race goes on so make\nsure you have a plan for your race know\nthe paces that you want to be running at\nand be patient by the time that mile 20\nrolls around you'll be overtaking a lot\nof people around you and be finishing\nstrong believe me no one has ever gone\nout and magically run 20 30 minutes\nfaster than they intended to over the\nmarathon in as so many sports you can\nhave really good lucky days where\neverything comes together with running\nit's not like that you're going to get\nout what you've put in in training so be\nrealistic stick to your paces and run to\nthe the ability that you've been\ntraining for some other top tips for not\ngoing out too fast monitor the lap Pace\non your watch which will reset every\nkilometer or every mile if you've got\nlaps turned on just focus on that\nticking off every K as they go sticking\nat your pace potentially run with some\nother pacing groups that are going to be\nout there so if you want to run a\nthree-hour Marathon stick with the\nthree-hour pacing group they will make\nsure that you run the race nice and\nevenly all the way through and not burn\nout by going out too fast no doubt a lot\nof you out there will have been\nfollowing our training plans which you\ncan pick up at benp parks.com we'll link\nthat down below loads of five-star rated\ntraining plans from thousands of Runners\nthat have run some incredible times\nusing our plans and one of the big\nfeatures of our plans is practicing at\nyour goal Pace during your long runs we\nlike to put in blocks of goal Pace\nrunning there so you know what that\nfeels like to be running at your go pace\nso practice at your go Pace know what\nthat feels like look at your watch don't\ngo off too fast use a pacing group if\nyou want\nto something that isn't absolute classic\nover Race Day weekend is if you're going\nto a new city exploring somewhere that's\nexciting people spend far too much time\non their feet The Day Before the Race\nI've done this mistake myself before I\ndid 35,000 steps the day before I ran\nAmsterdam Marathon doing a bit of\nsightseeing I got to race day and felt\nobviously quite fatigued by doing that\njust because you might not be running\nthat day it also means you want to be\nspending some time off your feet and\nrelaxing go to the Expo means and then\nget back back to your hotel get back to\nyour Airbnb and just relax if you\nparticularly want to get out and do some\nsing maybe look up some segue tours out\nthere a bus tour a boat tour something\nelse to take you around the city other\nthan your legs you want to be saving\nthem but ideally plan to explore after\nyour race walking is a fantastic way to\nrecover after your Marathon one of the\nbest things we can be doing so plan some\nsightseeing maybe for Monday and Tuesday\nwhen you can walk around and get that\nrecovery process going that's definitely\nthe best time to be sight\nseeing this is way more common than you\nthink it would be but so many people use\nthe OnCourse nutrition when they haven't\npracticed with it in their training this\nis especially a problem on trail races\nwhen there's a lot more selection to\nchoose from than in Road marathons but\nit still happens in Road marathons as\nwell and not only is this a problem for\npeople trying the encourse nutrition\nit's also potentially problem from\ntaking things from people in the crowd\nthat are handing out jelly babies or\nsome other gels out there they do mean\nreally well and it's fantastic people\ncome out and support runners in this way\nbut if you haven't tried this stuff in\nyour training then how do you know it's\ngoing to work and be okay with your\nstomach during race day your body and\nyour guts are under a lot of stress when\nyou're running and throwing something\nnew in that could result in a few\nunwanted trips to the portaloo or pter\npoty for me I took some Lucas a sport\nduring a race once like as one of the\nLucas a drinks and I thought I've had\nthis all the time when I've not been\nrunning I've never used it when I'm\nrunning what's the harm that can do well\nI found out was some disastrous\nconsequences pretty soon after that with\na pants round the ankle type situation\nyour body works a lot differently when\nyou are running the solution to\nsomething like this only put things in\nyour mouth that you've used during your\ntraining try out lots of different\nproducts figure out what works with you\nin your training research what the race\nis giving out and potentially practice\nwith that in your training as well if\nyou do want to use the OnCourse\nnutrition fuel often fuel early fuel\nevery about 30 to 45 minutes during the\nmarath as well don't wait till you feel\nfeel tired cuz that will be too late in\nthe day practice carrying your gels in\ntraining for me I like to use a\nwaistband a waist belt I can tuck all of\nmy gels in there that I'm going to be\nusing for the race practice what it\nfeels like and you'll be absolutely fine\ngetting it done on race\n[Music]\nday moving on to have a chat about\nweather and tough weather conditions and\npeople not adapting to that now I get\nthis 100% you put your heart and soul\ninto your training get to race day\nfeeling really good only to find out\nsudden it's going to be 25\u00b0 855 F or\nhumid and bad weather conditions for\nrunning or potentially our worst\nnightmare windy conditions who remembers\nrunning the London marathon in 2017 or\nthat year that the big half had these\nhowling stormy winds your body's going\nto be working a lot harder to keep cool\nout there or battling through those\nwinds burning through your energy stores\na little bit quicker than you will be\nused to and if you push through this\nthen you're going to be hitting the wall\nVery quickly you can put some things in\nplace to delay this happening but it\nreally will result in having to slow\ndown and adjust your expectations for\nthe race the solutions for something\nlike this check the OnCourse weather\nduring the buildup for the race now it's\nnot really worthwhile to be panicking\nabout this all week and the week before\nbut just have some things in place that\nif it is going to be a hot day when you\ncheck a day or a couple of days before\nthat you can then adapt if it's going to\nbe warm then I say you need to adapt\nyour pacing wear some sun cream take on\nsome electrolytes in the buildups of the\nrace and ideally as you're going around\nas well we a hat of course getting a hat\nfrom benp parks.com we sell the best\nrunning hats anywhere in the world\nthousands of festar reviews used by\npeople in all sorts of different racing\nTrails roads and everything like that go\nand check them out and help support the\nchannel here now the wind is a really\nreally tricky one because there really\nisn't much you can do practice running\nin a group in some of your training and\nthen you can share the lead if you're\none of the faster Runners out there with\nnot too many people around you and you\ncan practice sort of drafting and then\nsharing the lead or if you are more of a\nmid pack Runner the roads are going to\nbe a little bit busy then winds don't\naffect us as much as we might think they\ndo in our training when we're just out\nthere by ourselves suddenly you're in a\nbig group and they don't affect us too\nmuch so don't panic too much about the\nwind we can usually get through that one\nokay something again that happens way\nmore than you think it would be people\nthat arrive late to the start line and\nthen have to start at the back of the\nfield add so much unnecessary stress and\nall that wasted energy weaving trying to\novertake people to get up to Pace what I\nreally always like to do with the races\nI do is practice that Journey from where\nyou're staying to the start line the day\nbeforehand or a couple of days\nbeforehand if you have time have a\nbackup plan if that goes wrong as well\nstaying close to the start line is\nreally important to me if I can afford\nit with the price of hotels and things\nin the running boom it's becoming harder\nand harder to do that but I always\nprioritize staying in maybe like a worst\npart of the city or a worse\naccommodation so long as it's near the\nstart line and I can walk to the start\nline for a completely stressfree start\nto the\nday so pre-race fueling in the lead up\nto the race and the morning of again\nit's a really tricky thing especially\nwhen we are traveling to races if you're\ngoing abroad staying in a hotel then\nplan your dinner and breakfast during\nyour training that you know you're going\nto be able to replicate in the day\nbefore and the morning of the race don't\nwalk into the hotel breakfast thinking\noh what do I fancy today I'm going to\nhave this massive mound of porridge and\nhoney and oats and stuff like this if\nyou never had it that could be an\nabsolute disaster keep it super simple\nRice is available pretty much everywhere\nin the world as a night before car blad\nan absolute classic for race day morning\nis my Bagels but maybe there's not a\ntoaster available I don't particularly\nlike eating bagels without that so maybe\nQuant is a really good backup you can\nhave them cold warm whatever you want\nChuck some jam on them Quant are a\nreally good thing you can buy again\npretty much anywhere take them to the\nrace and get those down potentially just\nhaving a peanut butter and jelly or Jam\nsandwich you can just practice that in\nyour training and again you can use that\non race day morning think of these\nthings that you can just make up cereal\nwith some milks make up these meals you\ncan definitely replicate on your race\nday morning and you know they're going\nto\nwork now I wasn't sure whether to put\nthis one in because it's something that\nhappens to me all the time I've never\nreally seen it on any lists or anything\nI've ever seen over the years but I\nthink it's such an important thing so\nlet me know in the comments if you agree\nwith this one and let us know what are\nyour best race day tips to help out the\nrunning Community as well well now this\nis not ignoring nagging things as they\nhappen during the race shoe issues\nclothing issues toilet issues things\nlike that these will normally only get\nworse if you ignore them the classic one\nhere is like something like a stone in\nyour shoe it's just as simple get your\nshoe off get that stone out get it tied\nback up and in and get back on your run\nif you got a stone in your shoe your\nfoot will probably be under tension\ntrying to stop the pain and then you\ncould develop quite a nasty little\ninjury from just running in a different\nunnatural way get that stone out your\nshoe as quickly as you can with some\nclothing you might be getting chafing\nhopefully not because it's a clothing\nyou've practiced in all the time but it\ncan still happen on a particularly hot\nand sweaty day something like that grab\na medical person grab some anti-chafe\nget it on there stop that chafing as\nsoon as you can maybe you tied your\nshoes up too tight or too loose at the\nstart again just stop adjust them don't\nlet these issues become other issues\nyou're going to be getting some blisses\nif they're too loose stopping off some\ncirculation if they're too tight stop\nadjust them carry on I know this goes\nagainst a lot of a natural instinct you\ndon't want to waste any time but when\nI've had these issues in the past myself\nI've always felt like I've made up more\ntime in the long run by just addressing\nthem really quickly using the L is\nanother absolute classic I ran a 238 in\nValencia last year including a l stop in\na porta potty that was just for a number\none but then I ran about 240 mid 240s or\nsomething at the uh in Denver at a\nmarathon before with a full sit down\nloose stop during the race so don't\nworry you will feel so much better\nafterwards for just getting that out of\nyour system as well and yes these things\nare annoying when they happen during the\nrace but deal with them quickly and I\nguarantee you're going to make up that\ntime now the final one here is an\nabsolute classic wearing new shoes and\nnew kit on race day again people do this\nall the time I've done it myself I've\nlearned the hard way and now I'm making\nthese videos to make sure you don't do\nit as well but again so many people go\ninto this panic mode in the night before\nthe race or the day before and just\nthinking I'm just going to suddenly use\nthis brand new shoe because I've seen\nthis influence us it or this\nprofessional athlete use it just being\nsuper boring is the best thing we can do\nin this situation no new shoes no new\nclothing no new gels no new breakfast if\nyou are in any doubt at all about what\nsort of shoes and what gear to go go\nwith the most comfortable ones running\nfor three four or 5 hours is a hell of a\nlong time you don't want to go with\nsomething that is potentially going to\ngive you some issues and be\nuncomfortable even if you feel like it's\ngoing to be faster you're going to get\nsome issues and you will run slower go\nwith the most comfortable option out\nthere but overall my message for this\nwhole video is I don't want to panic\neveryone it's awesome that you're\nwatching a video like this learning\nimproving yourself I'm still learning\nI've run nearly a 100 marathons here in\nmy lifetime and maybe about 10 of them\nhave gone what I would call absolutely\nperfectly stuff always does crop up but\nwe can really control is everything\nthat's happening before our race and\ngetting that right to really minimize\nthe chance of things happening during\nthe race so have a great time out there\nguys let me know how you get on if you\nwant some specific advice on how to not\nhit the wall in the marathon and check\nout this video up here that video is\ncoming up next that's it guys keep on\nworking hard keep on getting done we'll\nsee you very soon in the next one",

  "text": "I've brought loads of running products\nthis year mainly to review for the\nchannel but also some for my own running\nto overcome some of the little issues\nI've been having throughout the year I\nfound some really great bits of Kit\nalong the way some of which I now use\nevery single day and that's what this\nvideo is all about as with everything\nyou see here on the channel and of\ncourse in this video as well I've bought\nall of these products 100% with my own\nmoney to give you that completely honest\nunbiased impartial review and it also\nmeans we can have a chat about some of\nthe negatives in there as well thank you\nso much to everyone that supports the\nchannel by checking out my website benp\nparks.com with the best running gear and\nalso some amazing five-star training\nplans it really helps us so much with\nwhat we do here and also everybody that\njust likes shares comments on the videos\nand also subscribes as well right let's\nget into the first one now which is a\nbig change I've made with my nutrition\nproducts Morton is out and this one's\ncoming longer time viewers of the\nchannel will know I've mainly been using\nMorton in my races but earlier on this\nyear I listened to to an interview with\na guy called Andy blow the CEO of\nprecision hydration I was really\nimpressed with what he had to say so I\nplaced a big order and I was really\nexcited to test it out and see what I\nthought of the product I've always\nstruggled to get those Morton gels down\nlate on in a\nrace never easy today my body just\ndoesn't want to have it so yeah as I say\nI got these in and I've been using them\nin pretty much all of my races so far in\nthe second half this year so they're\nvegan there's nothing artificial and\nthey're informed Sports tested as well\nthey taste kind of like a bit like a\npeachy yogurt but it's an incredibly\nmild flavor and they've just got that\nsort of yogurty texture to them too I\njust love love this 90 G pouch that's\nsort of three regular gels worth I did\nactually I've just bought a new box of\nprecision hydration gels here from xmes\nthe other day so this is what the\nregular gels look like and then you get\nthese Mega ones here which is as I say\nthree times the size 90 G and that's\nwhat I've been taking out in some of my\nraces as well it's super easy to get\nthese down just unscrew the top and then\nyou can just get it straight in much\neasier than using a regular gel and then\nyou can just take as much or as little\nas you want as you go around and this\nfits in my naked band which I wear\naround my waist really really well but\nif you are using the regular GS which I\nwill probably use in some of my races\ncoming up I just really like because\nthey've got this band here so you really\ncan't Litter with it really important\nfor anyone really but especially TR\nathletes who can get disqualified for\nthat sort of thing yeah you just pull\nthat and it stays attached nicely and it\njust goes down super well I've had\nabsolutely no problems getting these\nWings down late on in a race and really\nactually enjoy having them in my\ntraining and in the races as well on top\nof the gels I actually got some of their\ndrink mix as well I've only used this\npre- run I actually use it before my run\ntoday cuz I had a speed session to do\ntoday it just tastes really good this is\ntheir electrolyte and carb drink mix I\nthink they do one without the\nelectrolytes in as well but I I do sweat\nquite a lot so I've gone for that mix\nthere it just tastes really good it\nmixes really well I've used this a lot\non the turbo trainer inside as well and\nit just goes down really nicely again a\nvery mild flavor to this one the\ncustomer care has been really good as\nwell they offer video chats to help you\nget the right product they offer sweat\ntests I think that's probably only in\nthe UK again to see what type of\nelectrolytes might be good for you the\ntaste is good it's not as sweet as\nMorton and I just don't get sick and\nbored with it especially not in\nsomething like a road Marathon over that\nsort of time and in terms of dislikes\nit's really hard to find I think and I\nhonestly I can't i' be trying to come up\nwith dislikes for this but I've really\nbeen impressed with this product it's\nperforming really well for me performing\na lot better than Morton mainly because\nI can just get it down when it matters\nin terms of alternative to something\nlike prision so many gels and things\nnutrition it's about trying a few out\nsee what works for you I was chatting to\nanother running YouTuber and recommended\nhe tried this out and he said he did and\nit just didn't work for him so that's\njust one of those things but this is\ndefinitely working for me at the moment\nnext up we're talking strength training\nnow I've always been told I'm a very\nquad dominant Runner a little bit weak\non my hamstrings and my glutes so this\nyear I really wanted to set about doing\nsomething about that to improve my\nrunning form improve my strength and get\na lot more power coming through my body\nwhen I'm trying to pick up the pace and\na lot of power comes from your glutes\nand then if you follow my training on\nstraa you might know I actually got a\nhamstring tear right at the start of the\nyear so I was doing a lot of hamstring\nrehab exercises in the gym but I wanted\nto improve my home exercise regime as\nwell so I basically set out to find\nwhat's called a glute ham roller which\nlooks like this I got this from a\ncompany called Mirror fit and there's\nloads of different exercises you can do\nI'm mainly using this to basically get\ninto a bridge position extending my legs\nout and then pulling the roller\nbackwards into towards sort of where my\nglutes are and then pushing them out\nagain this loads up the hamstrings super\nwell it looks really like quite a\ntorturous thing and it is when you start\nbut it's amazing how strong you do get\nafter a few weeks of doing this the\nother main thing I'm doing is really\nimproving my core to support my body as\nI'm running but I didn't just get that\nin I actually also got a new Castle Bell\nbut this is my 24 kg Castle Bell and I\ngot this to really improve my squat game\nas well and I think for runners\nespecially and just everybody really a\nsquat really is one of the best\nexercises you can be doing now it's\ngreat if you've got access to a gym go\nto the gym I'm so time poor a lot these\ndays I like do a lot of my strength\ntraining at home so I've been doing a\nlot of goblet squats with this holding\nthis into my chest and doing those\nsquats like that I'm using the 24 kilo\nwhen I'm feeling quite good I've got my\n16 kilo one down here which I actually\npicked up in the cathlon but what I like\nabout both of these items the're extreme\nHigh Bill quality that you get with them\nboth and they just work really really\nwell I'm definitely feeling a hell of a\nlot stronger by doing this it always\nstores Away really easy just slides\nunderneath our little TV cabinet in\nterms of dislikes make sure you put it\naway afterwards you could easy stand on\nthis thing and it could slide away and\nyou could have quite a nasty acccident\nso it could be potentially dangerous if\nyou leave it lying around your house I'm\nreally kind of proud of myself for how\nwell I've been doing with my strength\ntraining the second half of the Year\nthere're just a few items I've been\nusing check them out we'll link to\neverything down below no affiliate links\ndoesn't benefit me in any way next up I\nbought this lovely little thing this is\nthe Garmin 65 so many people on my straa\nhave been asking me about this basically\nsaying why you got the cheapest garon\nwatch and is it actually any good and\nsurely you should be using something\nlike a 965 or one of the more fancy\nwatches in the range and people are just\na little bit confused so that's why\nwe're doing this video so I picked this\nup in the spring quite soon after it\nlaunch I just paid the full RP I'm\npretty sure I got this on sport shoes\ncouldn't find any discount codes but I\nreally wanted to try out the cheapest\nGaring watch I've been using the epex 2\nwhich had kind of a fancy screen it had\nbeen out for a few years really enjoyed\nit it a really good watch and it had\ngreat build quality but a lot of\nfeatures I just didn't really use in the\nwatch and it was quite heavy it was very\nexpensive it still worth quite a lot of\nmoney so I've sold it now and I wanted\nto see how well I could get on with\nbasically the cheapest Garin watch in\nthe lineup I fully expected to really\nmiss all of the color Maps the Dual Band\nGPS the really good battery life that a\nlot of the higher end models have I\nreally haven't missed any of it to be\nperfectly honest I've used the 165 for\nevery run every race every walk every\nhike I've done done every workout and\nit's really surprised me I've probably\ndone around two 2 and 1 half th000 K and\nthis one of my real pet peeves with\nrunning and running watches and me\nincluded I'm including myself in this is\nthat so many people buy these high-end\nsmart watches \u00a3800 900 \u00a31,000 only to\nuse the most basic features they just go\nfor a run and put it on their stra don't\nuse any of it anyway here's my lights\nfirst thing the screen this AMOLED\nscreen that you get on the entry level\ngarment is really fantastic it's so\nclear it's really easy to read in all\nsorts of different light at night in the\ndaytime in bright Sunshine the graphics\nare really great you can only have four\ndata fields on this some of the more\nfancy ones you can have up to six I've\nonly ever had four on every watch I've\nhad and that's been absolutely fine it's\nso slim and lightweight as well I hardly\nnotice I'm wearing it I really just hate\nhaving things touching my skin I can't\nwear a watch all day anyway I really\nlike the lightweightness of it also it\nhas all the good health Basics things\nthat you're going to need HR V the heart\nrate variability sleeping and napping\ntracking and body battery as well I\ndon't wear it to sleep in so I haven't\nactually been using it for that but it\nhas those features if that means a lot\nto you it's also got the alterer built\ninto it as well which has been\nabsolutely spot on when I've been out in\nthe Hills tracking the elevation the\nbattery life has been surprisingly good\nfor the size of the watch I didn't get\nthe music version I just like to listen\nto music and podcast and Things by my\nphone this watch I'm getting around\nabout 10 to 12 hours over the course of\naround about 12 days as I say I'm only\nwearing this for running actually still\ndo have my uro which lasts for abs like\na 100 odd hours of GPS battery life the\nGPS accuracy has been absolutely\nsurprisingly really good it doesn't have\nthe Dual Band GPS the fancy GPS that a\nlot of the higher end watches will have\nI'll come on to that a little bit more\nin the dislikes I know all of my roots\naround here where I live extremely well\nit's been bang on even running through\nCanary Warf where the skyscrapers are\nagain it tracks as well as pretty much\nany watch is going to around there a lot\nof people have been asking me about the\nnavigation on this because it doesn't\nhave those lovely color Maps it just has\nthe basic breadcrumb navigation because\nthe screen is just so crisp it's super\neasy just to follow that breadcrumb\nnavigation and I actually do take less\nwrong turns with this watch than I do on\nthose couple of times when I was using\nmy uro because with the color Maps it's\njust so overly complicated there's so\nmuch stuff on the screen you got always\nsee where you're going with this it's\njust follow the line and it's really a\nlot more basic but I find myself getting\ncost a lot less using this watch so\nlet's come on to some of the dislikes\nwith the Garmin yes as I say the Dual\npan GPS would be nice they can't give\nevery single watch all of the features\nobviously otherwise everyone would just\nbuy the basic one this watch is sort of\nmain competitor the choros pace 3 does\nget that for roughly the same price\npoint but then with the course you don't\nget this lovely AMOLED color screen so\ndual pan GPS is a big feature for you\nand you've got about this money to spend\nyou don't care about the screen then the\nchorus might be a bit of a better option\nI certainly do have to charge it up a\nlittle bit more than than my regular old\nwatches but charges up so fast anyway if\nit is a little bit low just put on for 5\nminutes I'm going to have more than\nenough to get my run done some people\nmight like the Garment feature which is\ncalled trading Readiness and the load\nmetrics which the 165 doesn't have and\nthere's also no Triathlon settings on\nthis watch you need to go up to the 265\nif you want to get that I've personally\nnever used those anyway the Garmin app\nis getting a bit better and better but\nit's just not the most userfriendly\nthing still after all these years so in\nsummary I've really enjoyed I love this\nlittle thing I'm never going to let this\ngo and I'm using it every day and it's\nso simple to use the price point is\nright and it really will make the\nperfect running watch for the vast\nmajority of Runners absolute five-star\nproduct the next thing which I bought to\nreview which is part of the influencer\nrunning video I think but I've just\ncarried on using it and it's just been\nso good it's this little mini massage\ngun this is the th body one I actually\nbought this on eBay for about 125 the RP\nis a little bit more than that but just\nreally enjoyed it it travels with me\nwherever I go and I just take it with me\nfor pre-run and post run this has helps\nme keep me going if we're doing a lot of\nrunning on our travels but anyway let's\nhave a quick shat about the the body\nthing what do you get with this you get\na nice little travel bag here USB a to\nUSBC you can charge this up with USBC\nand you get three different heads which\nyou can attach onto it basically like\nthat this also goes absolutely fine\nthrough airports and things well this\nonly does every airport I've taken it\nthrough in hand baggage as well so let's\nhave a shout out all the likes I really\nlike the app that you get with this it\nsyncs up perfectly with the device\nbiggest issue with mass drones is people\njust don't know how to use them properly\nso they don't know what to do and it\nends up just of sitting in a drawer or\nthey end up hurting themselves by not\nusing them properly so the app is just\nsuper easy to follow along the USBC with\nthe device is again really good don't\nhave to have specialist charging cables\njust use it with my regular Chargers\ndislikes with this you can certainly get\na lot more pressure with your more\nregular shaped massage guns and yes it's\ndefinitely a little bit more on the\nexpensive side there are some cheaper\nalternatives out there a lot of people\nRave about the Bob and Brad massage gun\nthere are a couple of physiotherapists\nthat have a YouTube channel I'm sure\npretty much every Runner has come across\nsome of their videos so definitely check\ntheirs out if you're looking for\nsomething and of course an actual foam\nroller is a good alternative and way way\ncheaper and probably the best thing we\ncan be doing is getting inperson massage\nif you have the budget for that sort of\nthing so yeah this I've been really\nsurprised it's kept me running it's kept\nmy hamstrings in shape it's kept my hips\nin shape maybe more of an older athlete\nthing as I'm getting a little bit old\nthese days but yeah really enjoyed using\nit right next up I have what's called a\nsports recovery pillow so as I said\nearlier this year I had some hamstring\nissues and some hip issues as well so I\nthought I'm going to get this pillow to\nreally help my hips as I sleep now a lot\nof people obviously recover really well\nduring their sleep for me sometimes I\nwas wake up in more pain than when I\nwent to bed but anyway that's where this\ncomes in basically you put one leg over\nit and it's just going to help keep your\nhips aligned a lot better in reality\nit's kind of just a pregnancy pillow\nrebranded for athletes so they can put\nthe price up a little bit and that's how\nthey definitely got me when we travel my\nbody definitely mythes this but then I\njust use a regular pillow that you get\nin a hotel or air BBE to put between my\nlegs in terms of liks with this thing I\nwouldn't say it has helped me sleep any\nbetter but I certainly I wake up a lot\nless stiff and a lot less pain in the\nmorning and my hip issues have\ndefinitely improved it's really also\nsort of good quality it's comfortable\nand it comes with this easy to remove\ncover as well for when you do need to\nwash it in terms of dislikes of course\nspending \u00a355 on a pillow is absolute\nMadness in terms of Alternatives well\nIkea have one for \u00a39 so maybe we were a\nlot better off going to Ikea and getting\nthat but as I say earlier on this year I\nwas just in a lot of pain and you end up\njust sort of throwing a little bit of\ntoo much money at things and so that's\nwhere this Sports recovery pillow comes\nin we'll link to it down below I\nwouldn't recommend you spend this amount\nof money on it if you having some hip\nissues then look at products like this\nand pregnancy pillows and just type in\nlike sports recovery pillow and see what\nyou can find but yeah it's worked for me\nanother really interesting product I\npicked up at the start of the year is\nwhat is called a slant board to help me\nwith my carves and also my ankle as a\nlot of people know I did break my ankle\na couple years ago it's been a long\nprocess getting it back to full strength\nthis was one of our best products on\nAmazon video but I've been using it so\nmuch since I've also been been using\nthis to work on my car for my Caya\nstrength as well couple of really\nimportant muscles there for runners\nstretching those out nicely at the end\nofi runs it's also been really good at\nhelping me work on my ankle range of\nmotion to increase my ankle dorsy\nflexion what I really liked about this\nthing it's really good quality this one\nit's solid metal it's super easy to set\nup and then slide away again when I'm\nnot using it in terms of dislikes well\nwith that really good metal build\nquality it is definitely on the heavy\nside so not that easy to move around\nonce it's set up you're good to go you\ncertainly wouldn't be want to be\ntraveling with anything like this yeah\nfor me just been really good at helping\nas I say with that ankle strength that\nankle dorsy flexion and stretching out\nthose tired calf and cus muscles as well\nright next up we have some socks a\nreally interesting product I thought a\nlot of you might like to know about this\nas we head into the winter months here\nin the northern hemisphere last year my\ngirlfriend Sarah used some of these Dex\nshell waterproof socks when she ran a\nrace called the winter Downs in December\nyou really couldn't believe how good\nthey were and to be fair pretty much\nevery runner in this race was using them\nhaving wet feet for such a long time in\nthese like more longer distance races or\njust whenever you're going out to get\nyour runs done really can be quite\nuncomfortable and when they get sort of\nwet and all sort of shriveled up a\nlittle bit can be incredibly prone to\nblisters happening and that could be a\nrace ending thing and for me I always\nlike to look for something a product\nlike this to really sort of have that\ngood barrier between your feet and the\nshoes rather than using gortex\nwaterproof shoes which I just find just\ndon't really work that well on my feet\noverheat and everything just gets a wet\nsoggy mess inside so what I really like\nabout these socks you can fully submerge\nyour feet in water and it won't get in\nand you can confidently run through\npuddles bogs streams there's no need to\nalter your stride dislikes with the\nsocks they are quite thick despite being\ncalled ultra thin they definitely are on\nthe thick side you might want to have a\nlittle play around with the shoes you're\nwearing make sure you've got a little\nbit of extra space at the front of shoe\nand what they really do keep your feet\nsurprisingly dry from the outside if\nyou're running them for quite a long\ntime your feet will start to sort of\nsweat they are quite breathable so\nmoisture can escape from your sweaty\nfeet to come out but also after a amount\nof time with a bit of friction your feet\nare inevitably going to get a little bit\nwet so definitely worth checking out\njust really think this is going to be\nthe best thing to keep on your feet if\nyou're going some snow wet conditions\nboggy conditions this is going to do a\nfar better job than some regular socks\nI've be really impressed with them so\nfar let me know down in the comments\nyour favorite running gear of the Year\nwhat's the stuff that you found this\nyear that you've been really impressed\nwith this video coming up here next is\nall of my best running products that I\nfound on Amazon and this video down here\nis testing out loads of running\ninfluencer products as well that's it\nguys keep on working hard keep on\ngetting done thank you all for the\nsupport and we'll see you very soon in\nthe next one",

  "text": "if you've ever tried to keep your heart\nrate low during a run you know how\nfrustrating or even impossible that can\nfeel at times well today we're going to\nbe talking about how slow you should be\nrunning your easy runs at and we'll also\nbe going over how to calculate your own\npersonal heart rate training zones as\nwell as some tips on how to improve your\nrunning form and how you can ultimately\nrun faster at a lower heart rate\nmastering the art of running easy or in\nzone 2 is crucial for building that\nstrong aerobic base and that overall\nendurance and by the end of this video\nyou'll know exactly what you need to be\ndoing to achieve this so how slow should\nour easy runs be well you should be able\nto hold a conversation at this pace\nrunning with a friend or a colleague or\njust someone you know going out for a\nlittle bit of a chitchat and catch up is\na great way to tell you're running at\nthe right sort of intensity there's also\nsome calculators online our favorite is\nthe Jack Daniels calculator where you\ncan put in some recent race results or\njust some times of where you think your\nFitness is currently at and then will\ngive you some rough guides for where it\nthinks your various training zones are\nmost importantly we're here we're\nlooking for that zone two for that easy\nPace but for some people they won the\nabsolute gold standard the most accurate\nway of doing their easy runs and how are\nwe going to do this well we need to\ncalculate our heart rate training zones\nthere's basically three different ways\nyou can do this the first one being\nanother form of some online calculators\nthese are very very generalized but\nthey'll give you a rough idea of where\nyou're at the second option which will\ngive you the very very very best data\nnow I've done this a few times who put\nsome footage of me in the lab is to go\ninto a lab and get your lactate\nthreshold and your V2 Max tested and as\npart of that they will give you your own\npersonal heart rate training zones that\nyou can then take and use those in your\ntraining in the UK this is going to be\naround about \u00a3 150 to2 200 and then\nwhat's going to appeal for most people\nthe middle ground between those two is\nto test these out yourself and for this\nyou're going to need to know your\nmaximum heart rate and also your resting\nheart rate rate so to calculate your\nmaximum heart rate and I would always\nsay please get some medical advice if\nyou're at all unsure and definitely you\nshould be doing this in a supervised\nenvironment but you basically need to be\npushing yourself to the absolute limit\nthis is very very tough on the body\nplease don't do this if you got\nabsolutely no running Fitness or you're\nfeeling slightly ill now the best thing\nis to do is to get yourself a heart rate\nmonitor a chest strap or at the very\nleast a arm band these will be far more\naccurate than the heart rate monitors\nthat are built into some of our watches\nthese days these are very vague at best\nthey're very good for looking at heart\nrate longterm but for in the moment\nthey're really not going to be accurate\nenough for what we're trying to achieve\nhere there's a couple of options here of\nwhat to do when you're all set up heart\nrate monitors ready to go the first one\nis to run 400 m fairly hard fairly\nintense and then another 400 m\nabsolutely flat out the maximum heart\nrate will be somewhere towards that\nsecond rep of 400 m and then you can\njust look through the data and see where\nyour heart rate gets up to and another\noption you can do here is to find a\ndecent Hill in your local area and then\nprogressively pick up speed pick up\nintensity as you start running up that\nhill do this for around about 60 seconds\nfor that rep and again then look at the\ndata afterwards super fit people might\nwant to repeat this two or three times\nfor those 400 m reps or two or three\ntimes to do those Hill reps and just see\nwhere that heart rate is spiking to at\nthe end of the data before you do this\nyou want to make sure you're properly\nwarmed up you're going to be getting\nsome very intense running straightaway\nso i' say at least around 50 minutes of\nsuper easy jogging lots of dynamic\nstretching as well before you get going\nif you are a little bit injured or a\nlittle bit unwell or don't want to go\nout and do something like that straight\naway go back and look at some of your\nhistorical data from the last couple of\nmonths leading up to where you are now\nhave you done a hill rep session have\nyou done some allout efforts have you\ndone a Max 5K for example just look\nthrough that data if you've got reliable\nchest strap or arm strap data have a\nlook see where it is peaking some of the\nrunning apps as well such as Garing\nthings will be able to tell you what\nyour max heart rate is by reading the\ndata that is fed into it as well so\nthere you go you've got your maximum\nheart rate data then we need to find out\nour resting heart rate now what a\nrecommend here is to take your pulse\nfirst thing in the morning just over the\ncourse of maybe 2 or 3 days most modern\nwatches will give you a resting heart\nrght data and this is going to be fairly\naccurate watches these days with the\nwrist-based heart rate are pretty good\nat looking at long-term heart rate data\nso I would trust the figure that your\nwatch is giving you if you have that\navailable to you so now we've got those\ntwo figures and for Simplicity I'm going\nto say my maximum heart rate is 180 and\nmy resting heart rate is 60 now again\nthere's some online calculators where\nyou can plug these figures in that\nyou've now calculated it will spit out\nyour exact heart rate training zones\nagain we'll link to those down below lot\nof links Down Below in this video but\nfor example maximum heart rate 180\nresting heart rate 60 gives us a heart\nrate reserve of 120 beats a minute this\nis the range of what's available to us\nin our daily life basically the lowest\nit will be and the highest it will be in\nour current state of health so for Zone\none this is going to be 50 to 60% of our\nheart rate Reserve very easy recovery\njogging zone two 60 to 70% of our heart\nrate reserve for our easy runs our\nconversational pace and also some of our\nlong runs as well to build that\nendurance zone three 70 to 80% of our\nheart rate Reserve this is going to be\nsome moderate intensity we don't spend\ntoo much time here in this Zone Zone 4\n80 to 90% of our heart rate res this is\nour Tempo our threshold efforts\nintervals this builds performance it\nbuilds speed it really helps to build\nour ability to run faster and then\nfinally zone five 90 to 100% of our\nheart rate Reserve this really is\nreserved just for those race Sprint\nfinishes and really short intervals as\nwell and potentially some Hill reps and\nthings like that just when we're peaking\nright at the top of a rep so let's\ncalculate our Zone 2 heart rate using\nour data of 180 for our maximum and then\n60 for our resting heart rate so our\nreally simple formula here for\ncalculating it is that percentage of our\nheart rate Reserve plus adding back on\nour resting heart rate so here we're\nlooking for that 60 to 70% range so 0.6\nfor our 60% Times by 120 for our heart\nrate reserve and then add on 60 which\ngives our lowest value of 132 beats a\nminute which is where our Zone 2 Section\nstarts and then our upper end of that\nzone here we're looking for that 70% so\n0.7 times 120 for our heart rate Reserve\nadding on that 60 for our wrestling\nheart rate gives us 144 so our Zone 2\nheart rate section in our example is 132\nto 144 beats a minute but what do we do\nwith this data now we've got it well\nlike with anything the more you practice\nsomething the better you're going to get\nat it and in this instance it's that\nzone two that easy Pace running we want\nto be practicing so for your easy runs\naround about 80% of our total weekly\nvolume put your heart rate monitor on\nyour chest strap or your arm strap we\nlink to recommended heart rate monitors\ndown below as well stick to that zone to\nrunning you can set up alerts on your\nwatch if it goes too high or too low\njust to keep yourself dialed in in that\nexact right zone now for some people\nespecially when you start out me\ndefinitely included in this running in\nzone 2 will feel painfully slow and it\ncan be quite frustrating you feel like\nyou're hardly moving but believe me\nstick with this and you will speed up\nover time your easy runs will get a lot\nfaster because over time your Fitness\nwill grow your body will be adapting and\nyou'll be able to run faster at this\nlower heart rate so practice and be\npatient you might need to walk I\ndefinitely did when I first started out\ndoing this just to bring your heart rate\nback down get it dialed in back in the\ncorrect Zone you also really need to\nlose the ego and have some patience as\nwell a lot of people putting their runs\non social media on straa want to be\nrunning fast all the time that's not how\nyou're going to improve you need to lose\nthat ego you might be running a lot\nslower than you're used to for those\nfirst few weeks but stick with it you\nwill improve you will get faster and you\nwill see yourself naturally running at a\nfaster speed at a lower heart rate\neventually over time you'll know what\nthis will feel like and this is why a\nlot of elite runners or more experienced\nRunners will say I just run on feel and\nI do a lot of my running now like that I\nknow what easy Pace feels like I know\nhow my body should be feeling and so\nwhen I'm out on my easy runs I don't\nalways need to be monitoring this sort\nof stuff because you just get a good\nfeeling of what it's like but for some\nbeginner Runners some people trying to\nimprove learn more about running use\nthat technolog to monitor it make sure\nyou know what you're doing your body\nwill adapt and then you'll start to\nunderstand what it all feels like\nquickly guys if you are finding this\nvideo all please smash that like button\npotentially share it with a friend\nthat's always running too fast on their\neasy runs and also check out my website\nbenp parks.com we've got five star rated\ntraining plans on there helping Runners\nall over the world improve their running\nwe've got awesome running hats and some\nof the very best technical gear out\nthere to help you with your running\nthanks very much guys right back to the\nvideo there's also some other really\nimportant things we need to have our\nchat about when we're trying to run at a\nnice low heart rate in our easy Zone too\nthere's some things that might be\naffecting as well such as temperatures\nhigh temperatures high humidity as well\nthe body is going to have to be working\na lot harder so when we are running in\nthe summer or warmer climates you're\ngoing to be running again a little bit\nslower as well this is when heart rate\nmonitor training could be really really\ngood because you always know you're\ngoing to be training in the right Zone\nbut you might be running a little bit\nslower as you're used to because your\nbody's having to work that little bit\nharder to keep cool also hydration is\nreally important if you do become a\nlittle bit dehydrated your body's going\nto have to work a little bit harder to\ndeliver that oxygen to the muscles so\nmake sure you're definitely hydrated and\nkeep hydrated when you're going out in\nyour long runs the elevation of the\nroute you're running on will play a big\nfactor as well if you're going up a hill\nyour heart rate is going to spike you\nmight need to have to walk or slow it\ndown a lot just to bring that heart rate\nback down and I would say if you are\nrunning on a particularly hilly course\nyou could just look at something like\nyour average heart rate over the course\nof a run it' be how hard if you're\nhaving to stop all the time just have\naverage heart rate potentially on the\ndata field on your watch also altitude\nif you are running up in the mountain\nsomewhere again there's less oxygen\navailable you'll be running a little bit\nslower as well and then finally things\nlike caffeine alcohol lack of sleep and\nfatigue these are going to affect how\nyour body is going to be feeling these\nare other things we have to factor in of\nwhy we might be running a little bit\nslower Right Moving On Let's have a chat\nabout running form and efficiency this\nis all about how we can cover the ground\nfrom point A to point B using as little\nenergy as possible keeping that heart\nrate nice and low there's some really\ngood things we can do here to improve\nour running form very very simple the\nfirst one is all about strides running\nat a very fast rate just for very short\nburst of time about 20 seconds maximum\nalso doing things like Hill reps as well\nsuper important it's very hard to run\nwith bad form with Hill reps both of\nthese things will get you running well\nand also get you nice and strong some\nother things we can focus on as we're\nrunning making sure we're Landing nicely\nunder our Center of mass not out in\nfront of you which can be a bit of a\nbreaking force and then finally all\nabout increasing our Cadence potentially\ndepends where your Cadence is a lot of\npeople when they start out their Cadence\nis quite low in the 150s the 160s which\njust means we're not moving in the most\nefficient way possible the area we're\ngoing to be focusing on for a lot of our\neasy running is around about sort of 175\nup to 180 potentially just over 180\nwe've got a whole video on how to\nimprove your cence again we'll link to\nthat up here and down below as well so\nlots there to get stuck into hope you\nfound the video useful please let me\nknow any questions down in the comments\nwe'll hang out down there to answer your\nquestions we're always here to help with\nyour running that's it guys keep on\nworking hard K wa down we see you very\nsoon in the next one",

  "text": "the New Balance 1080 has been a staple\ndaily running shoe for many years now it\nused to be one of my absolute favorite\nshoes one that I'd recommend to almost\neverybody looking for that classic\ncomfortable everyday running shoe we\nreviewed and absolutely love version 10\nversion 11 version 12 but it really was\nunlucky number 13 which was it was still\na very comfortable shoe the cushioning\nwas way too soft and it had no stability\nwhatsoever was it just an unlucky blip\nhas the greatness now being restored\nwell stay tuned because we're going to\nfind out very soon and we're also going\nto be comparing it to the New Balance Mo\n5 and maybe the greatest daily running\nshoe you can get at the moment the Nova\nblast version 4 so stay tuned to the end\nof the video for that just before we\nstart out I just want to say I bought\nthis shoe 100% with my money from the\nRunning Company in jalong on our recent\ntrip to Australia so shout out to those\nguys and girls in there and also thanks\nfor everybody supporting the channel\nchecking out benp parks.com we've just\nlaunched our brand new long sleev\nperfect for all that winter running\nyou'll see me running them in all of the\nfootage we've got here today and feel\nfree to use code youtu10 for 10% off\nyour order right let's have a chat about\neverything that's changed in version 14\nfrom the outgoing version 13 well we've\ngot an all new mesh upper this triple\njackard upper with increased\nbreathability this is what New Balance\nare saying I actually disagree with that\nwe've got an updated out soole with the\nshoe as well with some repositioned\nrubber to give it a little bit more\nstability as well as improving that grip\nin those High wear areas and to increase\nthat durability as well we've also got\nsome of that increased stability from\nversion 13 and it's not quite now as\nsuper soft and plush and really\nmarshmallowy as version 13 now a little\nbit firmer and a little bit more stable\nand we can start to use this as a daily\nrunning shoe again the price is the same\nthe drop and stack is also the same but\nthe weight has slightly increased right\nlet's get stuck in all the facts and\nfigures so what's the purpose of the\n1080 well this is a premium daily\ntrainer sure you can do the vast\nmajority of runs in pretty well with\nsome good high quality materials in here\nas well pricewise this is \u00a360 here in\nthe UK\n\u00a310\n$165 $270 Australian dollar which what I\npaid for the shoe or around about $210\nCanadian do stack out of the back 38 mm\nand a 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise and\nfortunately a little bit on the heavy\nside here coming in for me at\n360 G version 13 was 323 so for me\naround about a 40 G increase in weight\nneutral stability this is a neutral shoe\nwith the upper of the shoe we've got\nthis triple jackard mesh upper midsole\nwe've got new balance's classic Fresh\nFoam X midsole there's no plate in this\nshoe whatsoever outsole we've got this\nrubber out soole it's not covering the\nmid soole completely just adding some\nextra grip and durability in those High\nwear areas different widths available\nwell unfortunately it varies from\ncountry to Country if you're in the USA\nyou've got four different widths\navailable narrow standard wide and extra\nwide in the UK we're just getting two\njust your standard and your wide so\ncheck with what's available in your\ncountry in terms of men's and women's\nfit we have that available for both and\nthe sizing it was true to size for me\nright let's get stuck into all of my\nlikes my first like with this shoe is\nthe improved stability versus vers 13\nit's now not quite as super soft a\nmarshmallowy which some people won't\nlove because there were a few fans of\nversion 13 although most people agreed\nit was just so soft and unstable that's\ndefinitely gone it's now just that\nlittle bit firmer a little bit more\nusable the slightly wider base we've got\nwith the shoe and the improved rubber on\nthe outso all adding to that extra bit\nof stability the updated geometry\noverall is working a lot better for me\non my runs so for fans of version 10 11\nand 12 this is going to be a real turn\nto form and you're going to be a lot\nhappier in the shoe my second like with\nthe shoe it's just extremely comfortable\nfor those easy runs those recovery runs\nwalking around and genely having a comfy\nshoe for living your life around\nOutdoors the upper is great the lockdown\nhas been spoton for me the sizing was\ntrue to size it's the same size I've\nused in all of my previous 1080s as well\nthe width has also been improved in the\nshoe it's now a little bit wider just a\nlittle bit more accommodating as well\nand you can always go for that wider\noption if that appeals to you if you're\nsomeone that you think you've got a wide\nfit definitely go for that wider option\nI particularly like the padding around\nthe ankle at the back of the shoe here\nas well and the updated upper is just\nreally working well for me just holding\nthat foot in place no sliding around no\nhot spots no blisters or anything like\nthat my third like with the shoe is just\nvery very dependable it's not the most\nfun shoe I'm going to review it's not\nthe most exciting but it just gets the\njob done in minimal F there's no fancy\nplates no fancy Foams or fancy rods it's\ngoing to be really great for a beginner\nRunner that's looking for that premium\nshoe they can get started in or that\nintermediate Runner just looking for\nsomething that as I say it's just very\ndependable it's going to give you no\nissues out there The Rocker at the front\nof the shoe provides a really good\nconfident feeling and for heel Strikers\ntoo at the back of the shoe the way the\nheel tapers here it's going to feel\nreally nice through that whole foot\nstrike so again really good option for\nthose heel Strikers it just feels like a\nreally premium well put together product\nit's built to last for a very long time\nbut as always it's not all smiles I\nalways buy these shoes so I can give you\nmy 100% honest thoughts on it so let's\nhave a quick chat about the dislikes the\nfirst one being I have experienced a\nslight little bit of overheating New\nBalance say this is an improved upper\nwith better breathability unfortunately\nI would sort of disagree I have been\nheating up a little bit in this shoe\nespecially when you do pick up the pace\nbut yes it might be just one that's\ngoing to be good for winter running if\nyou're the Norther hemisphere you're\nprobably going to be fine in the shoe\nover the next few months the weight gain\nis just a little bit frustrating now 360\nG the last one was 323 the wet weather\ngrip isn't fantastic in this shoe it's\nvery wet in London here at the moment\njust sliding around a little bit more\nthan I would like with my fourth dislike\nlike we saw with version 13 gone on the\ndays of the 1080 being that shoe that\nreally can do everything really well now\nreally the 1080 is just the shoe that's\ngoing to be good for the day after your\nreally big effort it's the day after\nyour long runs easy runs recovery runs\npeople going out for longdistance walks\nor people just working in retail and\nthings and being on their feet for a\nlong period of time if you want to pick\nup the pace in the shoe you're going to\nneed to invest in something a little bit\nspeedier a little bit faster a little\nbit lighter with this shoe it really was\nhard work to pick up the pace in\nanything faster than marathon pace and\nI'll just be begging to put something\nelse on but it's fantastic at those\nslower Paces for me right let's have a\nchat about some other options as well\nnow my best daily shoe of the year was\nthe Nova blast version 4 and how is that\ndifferent to this well the Nova blast is\nslightly narrower but really a very\nsimilar fit overall it's a little bit\nfirmer a little bit bouncier and it's\ngot some better energy return through\nthe foot strike as well and as I say\nit's just a little bit more versatile\nhas a bit more pop about it and it can\npick up the pace a little bit better\nthat's where the 1080 is lacking\nunfortunately and when the 1080 is\ndifferent from the Nova blast it's just\na little bit more comfortable it's a\nlittle bit softer as well and it's a\nlittle bit better on those easier and\nRecovery runs with that foam just\nabsorbing a little bit more of the\nimpact as you go along the no thought is\na lot lighter too plus lighter on your\nwallet as well coming at just \u00a31\n135 so for me it really is a bit of a\nclear winner there I'd really recommend\nsaving the money and picking up\nsomething like the Nova blast 4 if\nyou're looking for that classic daily\nDo-it or shoe and maybe pick out one of\nour new wraps for just \u00a3 12 which we'\njust released on the website with the\nmoney that you will save as well we're\nnow shipping those worldwide what most\npeople have been asking me about the\n1080 is not how it compares to the Nova\nblast but how it compares to the more\nversion 5 we've just released our\ndedicated review to this shoe so we'll\nlink that up here and at the end of this\nvideo the mo version 5 is very very soft\nfor that pure recovery and easy run shoe\nit's a hell of a lot bulkier as well if\nI put these side by side here you'll\njust see it's got a much bigger\nfootprint especially at the back of the\nshoe as well yeah this is just a big\nshoe and you really feel that massive\nbulk on the end of your foot as you run\nalong both have the same Fresh Foam X as\nwell but more 5 is a lot more of it and\nit is just a little bit heavier but\nsurprisingly not as much as you would\nthink this is really quite a heavy sh\nI'm not sure where they're getting all\nthat weight from the mo version 5 has a\nwider 4ot as well a little bit more of\naccommodating toe box neither of the\nshoes have a plate in them and the more\nfirst and find is just a little bit more\nstable little bit wider and it's got\nsome of the higher sidewalls in the shoe\nas well the 1080 just has a bit more of\na traditional run feeling through the\nfoot stripe really because it's not\nquite anywhere near as bulky as the mo\nversion 5 so go for the 1080 if you want\na little bit more versatility a little\nbit lighter you can pick up the pace a\nlittle bit better more version 5 is that\nPure Energy absorption Bliss super soft\nto look after those legs on those easy\nand Recovery runs so let's a chat about\nmy final thoughts on the 108 version 14\ndo I recommend the shoe yes I do\nrecommend the shoe if you want a soft\nvery comfortable shoe for easy and\nRecovery runs that isn't too bulky that\nyou get a lot of these Max cushion shoes\nthen this is going to be a good option\nto go for the more version 5 might be\nslightly too soft and too extreme for\nsome people so this is where the 1080\ncomes in is it worth the upgrade over\nversion 13 yes it very much is for me I\nreally did not get on with version 13 at\nall this one is now definitely a shoe\nthat I can now happily go for running\nand I really don't have to worry about\nit too much it's just a nice Dependable\ngood easy and Recovery run shoe and who\nshould buy a shoe like this well any\nRunner who wants a simple no fuss\ncomfortable trainer they can get the\nmajority of their runs done in pretty\nwell be more than happy with the 1080 so\nto answer the question that we've called\nthis video is this the most comfortable\ndaily shoe ever I'd say it's very close\nbetween this and the asex Joe Nimbus\nversion 26 which is my most comfortable\nshoe of all time they're both very\nsimilar shoes and you really can't go\nwrong with it either the Nova blast\nversion 4 is still the best daily shoe\nout there in my opinion but the 1080\nStrays away from this sort of daily shoe\nsegment it's fast becoming a little bit\nmore like the Joe Nimbus and that's\nreally where its bigest competition is\ncoming from so thanks very much guys for\nfollowing along with the video if you\nwant to watch the more verion 5 full\nreview that is coming up up here if you\nwant to check out our complete New\nBalance lineup review and learn all\nabout what the different shoes are that\nreview is down here so that's it guys\nkeep on working hard keep on getting\ndone let me know your thoughts on the\n1080 and we'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

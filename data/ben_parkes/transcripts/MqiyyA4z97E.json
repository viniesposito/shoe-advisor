  "text": "the New Balance more version 5 is one\nMammoth of a shoe packed with loads of\nsoft squishy cushioning underfoot it has\nthe potential to be one of the comfiest\nshoes of all time perfect for those\nlonger runs those recovery runs so would\nit be crowned the king of comfort today\nor will it end up being a clumpy\ncumbersome waste of money well today\nI've got all my thoughts on the more\nBion 5 plus some comparisons with\nsimilar shoes you might be torn between\nas always on the channel I bought this\nshoe 100% with my own money from sport\nshoes here in the UK give you that\ncompletely honest impartial 100%\nunbiased review right let's start out\ntalking about how this compares to the\noutgoing version 4 I don't actually have\nmy more V4 here anymore but I had good\nfun testing it out if you want to look\nat the review of that I think it's over\non my second Channel anyway we'll link\nto it down below the updated version 5\nhas a wider geometry underf foot but\njust really basically providing a lot\nmore stability which you need with these\nhuge High stack shoes because yeah this\nhas now has an extra 10 mm that's crazy\na whole cmet extra stack height compared\nwith the outgoing more V4 they've also\nupdated the tongue we've now got a nice\ngusseted tongue giving a little bit of a\nbetter lockdown and along with all of\nthat extra stack heite of course\nunfortunately it comes with a little bit\nof extra weight so an extra 19 G of\nweight for me and my UK size 12 this is\nnow tipping the scales at\n374 G right let's check out the stats\nthe facts and figures so the purpose of\na shoe like this this is for your long\nruns your recovery runs maybe your long\nwalks as well and for people that spent\na lot of time on their feet dayto day so\npotentially people from working in\nretail working in hospitals you know who\nyou are it's a great shoe for people\nthat spending a lot of time on their\nfeet when to look after their legs and\nbe nice and comfortable all day long\npricewise \u00a3140 this cost me here in the\nUK we'll pop up the dollars the\nAustralian dollars the Canadian dollars\nand the Euros up on the screen now stack\ncode at the back 44 mil and we've got a\n4 m drop overall it's a 40 mil stack at\nthe front of the shoe that is absolutely\ncrazy as I said weightwise 374 G for me\nversion 4 was\n353 with the upper of this shoe we now\nhave this engineered mesh with what\nthey're saying is a seam free\nconstruction to help with that Comfort\nmidsole wise we've got new balances\nFresh Foam X midsole extra soft very\nplush very very squishy here this really\ndoes feel like you have marshmallows on\nthe of your feet out soole wise we've\njust got two big patches of rubber one\nat the front one at the back and then\nsome exposed midsole here in the middle\nof the shoe so few durability concerns\nthere especially for some Ultra Runners\nwhich this shoe might well appeal to and\nyou can get two different widths\navailable although the standard shoe is\npretty wide as I keep saying but of\ncourse wider footed runners go for the\nwide size you can get a men's and\nwomen's fit and it was true to size for\nme right let's get stuck into all of my\nlikes so my first like with the New\nBalance more version 5 is quite simply\none word Comfort it is absolutely\namazing probably the most comfortable\nshoe I've ever run in it's very soft at\nall speeds but it's not really mushy you\ndon't have to worry about sort of this\nbig squishy mess that's not propelling\nyou forward it really doesn't feel too\ndead at all yes you can pick up the pace\nin the shoe given this rocker that it\nhas at the front of the shoe you get a\nreally good turnover going that's really\nnice plenty wide enough to give no sort\nof irritation no hotpots no blisters or\nanything like that just out of the box\nComfort right from day one a slightly\nsort of minor thing though it doesn't\nhave a pull tab at the back but it's\nfine to get off and on anyway my second\nlike with the shoe is this super stable\nvery wide platform that the shoe has an\na roomy toe box as well at the front of\nthe shoe it really is the amount of\nwidth and stability that a shoe with\nthis amount of Stack height needs\nsometimes when you get this High stack\nkite shoe the stability isn't very good\nand you can risk rolling an ankle you\ndon't have to worry about something like\nthat with a shoe like this as I say it\ncomes in the regular wits which is\ndecent but wider footed runners go for\nthat wider tow box just this larger\nsurface area in the bottom of the shoe\njust it gives you a lot more confidence\nin the corners and I like this sort of\nflaring at the back of the shoe as well\nit's just really nice design Touches at\nthe back of the shoe and then my third\nlike with this shoe is the ride is super\nsmooth as I said that rocker at the\nfront of the shoe heel Strikers are\ngoing to love this we've got a nice sort\nof rocker is at the back of the shoe\nthere so you can just transitions\nthrough the foot strike super smoothly\njust a really nice shoe for cruising\nalong if you're on an easy run you just\nwant to pick up the pace from of a\ncruisy pace this shoe will handle that\nreally nicely no heel slips good lock\ndown in the shoe as well really like the\nimproved tongue nothing moving around\nthere and yeah nice ankle Comfort at the\nback no irritations or anything like\nthat and then finally my fourth like it\nis a great option not just for running I\nknow some people that like to watch my\nvideos that aren't Runners they're\nlooking for a nice comfortable all day\nshoe you can get this spect in all black\nas well so if you like to look a little\nbit smarter right it's not all smiles\nlet's have a chat about my dislikes the\nfirst one being you can't get away this\nis a big shoe it is definitely on the\nheavy side but a lot of shoes in this\ncategory are going to be like that but\nit would have been nice just to be a\nlittle bit lighter there what do you\nguys think about lightness and heavy\nshoes like this they can do it the 1080\nhas got a good amount of foam in here\nand is significantly lighter it's like\nthe sort of different density Foams\nbetween these two shoes but the weight\nof the shoe is distributed really nicely\nthroughout and it doesn't feel too heavy\nwhen you got on it it doesn't even feel\ntoo heavy in the hands the second\ndislike with the shoe is it's definitely\na shoe on the stiff side now it doesn't\nhave a plate in the shoe but it's\ndefinitely just that sheer amount of\nfoam it is a little bit on the stiff\nside I personally quite like that but\nnot absolutely everybody will and my\nthird dislike with the shoe is just this\nupdated upper it's really not the most\nbreathable this is quite thick so if you\nare someone that's going to be running\nsome hotter humid climates you might\nwant to to avoid something like this but\nreally for anything you get in the UK\nyou're going to be absolutely fine right\nwe're just going to compare it quickly\nto some other options out there that you\nmight be thinking about firstly the most\nobvious one the 1080 version 13 the 1080\nis a lot lighter here probably just has\ngot a slightly less dense version of The\nFresh Foam X foam in there I wasn't a\nbig fan of that foam it just felt quite\nmushy but yes the more 5 slightly on the\nheavier side but a lot more stable which\nI really like the 1080 is just a lot\nmore versatile with that lightweight\nNess you can has just got a more of a\npace range that you can use it for\nwhereas the more V5 more of an easy and\nRecovery run shoe only one of the\nanother Classics the Hoka Bondi version\n8 very similar geometry with that shoe\nbut it's a lot lot firmer and it's quite\nan old shoe now it's really due an\nupdate hopefully that won't be very far\naway better for those that want that Mac\nstack shoe without that super soft\nsquishy feeling but for me the more 5\ndefinitely wins here I just really like\nthis nice super soft squishy phone for\nmy recovery runs and then finally\nprobably well it is the shoe I said was\nthe most comfortable shoe last year the\naex GEL Nimbus version 26 is a lot\nlighter well a little bit lighter than\nthe mo V5 and also a little less chunky\nas well Comfort is definitely on par I\ndefinitely prefer the stability in the\nmo V5 and the feel I just like I'm\ngetting a little bit better energy\nreturn in this shoe so I can just pick\nup the pace a little better and they\nalso 40 cheaper so quite a significant\nsaving there pricewise right conclusion\ntime do do I recommend this shoe well\ndefinitely yes this is my go-to recovery\nrun shoe right now I really do prefer it\njust a little bit over the Joe nus 26\nwhich is what it's replacing in my\nrotation is it worth the upgrade over\nversion 4 well I think so this has got a\nsignificant improvements quite surprised\nwith the amount of improvements that New\nBalance have managed to get into the\nshoe it's been a lot smoother it's much\nmore lively much more fine it can pick\nup the pace a little bit better as well\nand also just better lock down and\ncomfort in version 5 so you've got the\nbudget for it then definitely Splash out\non version 5 so who should be buying a\nshoe like the more version 5 or someone\nlooking to add a shoe into the rotation\nfor those slower runs of the week those\neasy runs those recovery runs those\nlonger runs as well so long as you're\nnot looking to pick up the pace too much\nUltra Runners I'd really recommend a sh\nlike this for some of your flat Ultra\nruns something in the UK maybe like a\ntemps past through as long as it's not\ntoo wet in the second half of the run\nbut Ultra Runners if you're running on\nprepared Services your toax fire roads\njust prepared services this will be a\nfantastic option to take on those yes\nit's a little bit on the heavy side but\nit's super comfortable to offset that\nand yeah finally just people need that\nall day Comfort up work as well then\nwe'll be keeping it definitely really\nenjoyed this shoe it is not going on\neBay I'm afraid right next video we've\ntalked a lot about comfort in the shoe\nup here we've got my most comfortable\nshoe review so go and check that out and\nthis would have certainly featured it if\nI had the shoe when I recorded that\nvideo that's it guys keep on working\nhard keep on done let me know what you\nwant to see reviewed on the channel next\nand we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

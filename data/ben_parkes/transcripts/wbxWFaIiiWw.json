  "text": "running a marathon is an amazing\nachievement for any human being and\nwhat's even better than that running a\nmarathon faster than you've ever done\nbefore and setting a brand new PB or PR\ndepending on where you are in the world\nand by the end of today's video you're\ngoing to be armed with loads of tips and\ntricks to get you that time that you\nwant we're going to go through what time\nyou should be aiming for the sessions\nthat help me run a 225 Marathon how to\nPace the race itself and those all\nimportant fueling options as well with\nmy own recommendations for what to do\nright let's get stuck into all of the\ntraining how long should you give\nyourself to train for a marathon well\nwould recommend ideally around 15 weeks\nthat's how long all of our training\nplans are which allow for a proper\nbuildup some recovery weeks those all\nimportant high mileage training weeks\nand then the full taper down before race\nday our beginner plans are just a little\nbit longer at 18 weeks to just give new\nmarathoners a little bit of extra time\nto get ready you can check these out on\nmy website vino.com we'll link them down\nbelow all our beginner plans are\ncompletely free to download during this\ntime you're also going to want to pick a\nTarget race to aim for typically\nmarathons are either in the spring or\nthe Autumn is that's when the weather\ntends to be best for Marathon running\ncomment down below with your favorite\nraces where you may already have your PB\nor PR to give your fellow Runners some\ninspiration of the best races some of my\nfavorites some fast races Valencia\nFrankfurt Berlin Rotterdam London and\nChicago I think there some really good\noptions out there so what's a realistic\ntime to aim for for your Marathon well\nthere's loads of different marathon time\ncalculators on the internet and you can\ninput a recent race time from a\ndifferent Race distance from say a half\nmarathon or a 10K and that will give you\na predicted marathon time based on that\nnow these aren't the most accurate way\nof doing things and they usually tend to\npredict time slightly faster than what\npeople are capable of but it gives you a\ngood of inspiration\na little bit of extra umph to get out\nthere and really hit the training hard\nso if you're not sure we'll link to the\nJack Daniels calculator down below as we\nfeel that's the best one out there but\nsetting a go time is going to look\ndifferent for everybody a lot of people\nsimply just take their current time and\nthen just chip away at multiples of five\nso if you're a 335 Marathon the next\nlogical step is sub 330 this is\nsomething you can adapt as your training\nprogresses you may want to find a goal\nthat's a little bit faster a little bit\nslower just with how well the training\nis going how far during a training week\nshould you be running for various goal\ntimes someone wants to run a sub 5H hour\nmarathon they're looking around about 3\nto four runs a week up to around 30 m in\nthat Peak Week 48 km for a sub four\nMarathon really talking again three to\nfour runs a week now up to around 40\nmiles in that biggest week in that peak\nweek around about 64k for that week for\na sub three-hour Marathon 5 to six runs\na week now up to around 64 mil in in\nthat peak week just over 100 km right\nlet's have a chat all about those all\nimportant long runs arguably the most\nimportant run of the week these are runs\nthat going to help build and improve\nyour cardiovascular system and also get\nthe body really strong to be able to run\nthat 26.2 miles the long runs will tend\nto build up progressively throughout the\nplan and then tap out for the longest\nrun tends to be around about 3 weeks\nbefore race day around about 20 to 23\nmiles or 32 to 37k for that longest run\nnow there are a few different types of\nlong runs that we would recommend\ngetting into your training again these\nall feature in our marathon training\nplans the first one being a fast finish\nlong run this might be a 20m total run\nwith the first 14 miles nice and easy\nrelaxed conversational pace and then the\nnext 5 miles of that run at your\nmarathon gold paast then the final mile\njust a nice easy cool down this type of\nrun is a really good Mar Marathon\nsimulator it gets their legs used to\npushing more towards the end of your\nlong run gets our legs nice and tired\nwhich is how they're going to feel\ntowards the end of the marathon so it's\na really good race preparation type of\nrun the second type of long run I really\nlike is marathon pace blocks this is\nsomething I like to do all the time as I\nbuild up for my races my absolute\nclassic is a 30k long run with three 5K\nblocks at my goal Pace with a 5k block\nbetween them at a nice relaxed\nconversational pace practicing marathon\npace during your long runs will really\nhelp you get comfortable with what it\nfeels like to run at this pace and\nyou'll be able to pace yourself so much\nbetter on the day if you spend a lot of\ntime at your goal Pace during your\ntraining splitting your runup into these\ndifferent pace blocks I find really\nhelps mentally with these long runs as\nwell and then my third type of long run\nI like to do in my training is simply\ngoing out for a long run and doing these\nare just all at your easy Pace just\nbanking the distance getting a good time\non feet long run I tend to do these\nduring my recovery weeks when I'm just\ntrying to reduce that intensity and\nreduce that overall load as well I'd\nalso recommend if you can doing some of\nyour long runs at the same time of day\nas your go race starts it just gets the\nbody used to working at this time and\nthen you can practice your pre-race\nroutine with your breakfast as well for\nme when I'm doing my long runs and also\nmy races as well my pre-ra breakfast is\npretty much always the same of two\nbagels with some peanut butter and jam\nor jelly if you're in America again\ngetting these down around about 2 hours\nto 90 minutes before go time practice\nthis in training there's absolutely no\nsurprises on race day it's also a really\ngood time to think about what you want\nto wear on your race day as well and\nwear this during your long runs and\nmaking sure everything fits together\nreally well what's going to be the most\ncomfortable type of shoe top clothing\nhat and all of that sort of stuff for\nthree four five six plus hours\npotentially out there are those\nlightweight carbon Racing shoes going to\nbe the best option people always ask me\nhow many runs should they do in their\nrace shoes and I'd always say do as many\nas you feel you need to do to feel\nconfident in the shoe choice that you're\ngoing to be making on the race day\nputting a brand new pair of shoes out\nthe box on race day is very very risky\nmaybe slightly less risky if youve run\nin exactly that model before it's not\nsomething I would ever do so please\ndon't do that but at least just go out\nthere spend a little bit of time in\nthose race shoes for a lot of people\nthey're going do a couple of their long\nruns in their shoes and it'll warm up\nbefore the race so you're really talking\nmaybe like 60 70k and they'll be\nabsolutely still fresh as a daisy at\nthat sort of level and you absolutely\nhave confidence that they're going to\nget you through the race really well\nmoving on to have a chat all about speed\nsessions now in order to run a faster\nMarathon we need to get the body used to\nrunning faster than your goal pace and\nthis is where our speed workouts and our\ninterval sessions come in these help\nbuild our fitness to increase that\naerobic capacity your V2 Max basically\nand by improving this it improves our\nbody's ability to deliver oxygen to the\nmuscles we'd recommend setting aside at\nleast one run a week dedicated to your\nspeed sessions more experienced Runners\nwill probably want to get two speed\nsessions in per week we'll touch on that\na little bit later on but here's some\nabsolutely classic examples that you can\ntry the first one being is a progression\nrun around about 10 km of distance the\nfirst 3K nice and easy second 3K at your\nmarathon pace the next 2K at your Tempo\npace and then 2K cooling down my second\nfavorite is something like a 6X 3 minute\nsession running these 3 minute blocks\naround about your 5 to 10K pace and just\ntaking a 2minute very chill jog or walk\nbetween each of those reps we're also\ngoing to want to build in some longer\nreps in here as well another classic\nthat I like to do 3x 8 minutes at Tempo\nPace with a 2minute recovery between\nthose blocks there again with the\nrecovery is just walking or a very very\neasy jog just to get your heart rate\nnice and recovered now lot of people ask\nme should we be doing these on a running\ntrack you can if you want to absolutely\nfine they're great places to train I\npersonally don't I just try save my\nmoney and go out and run on the roads in\nthat sort of environment which is just\nbetter replicating what the race is more\nlikely to be like but wherever you want\nto do them just somewhere safe and\ntraffic free we can uh put a drink down\nand get some fluids on board and some\nnutrition then that's going to be\nabsolutely fine now as I touched on at\nthe start of the section more\nexperienced Runners might want to build\nin a second speed session during the\nweek for example one session that\nfocuses on short reps like that 6x3\nminute sessions on a Tuesday and then a\nsecond session with a more sustained\neffort something like a 20 minute Tempo\nthey're going to have the strength in\ntheir legs and the mileage in their legs\nto be able to add this extra amount of\nintensity into the routine which then\ncombined with those long run sessions\nduring those Peak weeks as well will\nreally help build that Fitness and push\nit up even more right moving on to\nanother absolutely classic to get in\nthere during the week that a lot of\npeople don't know about or they neglect\nbut I say it's really important in there\nand that is running strides strides\nquite simply are burst of around about\n20 seconds of fast running at around\nabout 90% effort so not all out running\nfor a bus just below that these really\nhelped to improve our running form and\nhelp to build some strength as well if\nyou're new to strides I'd recommend\ndoing something like three to four reps\nof this more experienced Runners\nanything up to around six or seven reps\nof this with just a very easy jog or\nwalk in between these strides let's have\na chat about easy runs now the rest of\nour week is going to be made up of\nrunning at a nice relaxed easy run Pace\nthe speed sessions the long runs will\nput a lot of stress on the body and so\nthat's why we're now running at a nice\nlow intensity if every day was a speed\nsession we would get injured pretty\nquickly now I want to recommend for your\neasy run Paces for a sub five hour sort\nof goal Target we're talking around\nabout 1140 to 1245 a mile sub four\nrunners going to be doing that easy runs\naround about 10 minutes a mile to 11\nminutes a mile sub three-hour Runners\naround about 750 to 840 minutes a mile\nbut let's have a quick chat about\nstrength work which is a crucial part of\nany training plan especially important\nfor people during the marathon and even\nmore important for some older Runners\nwe' recommending one day a week to this\nand of course more is great as well but\nas a minimum add something like this to\na current day of easy run training and\nkeep your rest days as rest days that's\nreally really important to let your body\nrecover and adapt during those rest days\nnow we have a strength training routine\nwhich is part of our training plans\nwhich you can add on but it's just a\nvery Basics we'd recommend getting in a\nroutine squats Bridges lunges and planks\nget that into your routine and it's\ngoing to help you running so so much now\nrace J is here we want to think about\nwhat we're going to be doing during the\nrace how are we going to Pace it so many\nRunners make this mistake of going out\ntoo fast and blowing up so having a\npacing plan is really important for me\nthere's two different ways of pacing a\nmarathon either start slightly slower\nthan your goal pace and then speed up as\nthe Run goes on this requires a lot of\npatience and control which a lot of\nRunners really do struggle with\nalternatively and what I personally aim\nto do is simply set off at my go pace\nand hold that all the way through and\nthen final few C just try and pick up\nthe pace a little bit more to come in\njust ahead of my goal time now this of\ncourse will depend on the course you're\ndoing what the route's like if it's\nhilly you might to save some energy for\ncertain Hillier parts of the course\ngoing out hard and banking that time\nreally works there'll be a few examples\nof people that have managed to set new\nPBS and PRS by doing that but I'd always\nsay you probably could have gone faster\nif you Pace it a little bit better and\nstart nice and slowly what I recommend\nis using the lap Pace on your watch\nwhich if you have your laps turned on\nwill then reset every kilometer or every\nMile and just stick to that pace\nthroughout the race now if you got some\nsome bad GPS issues on the course such\nas Canary War through London or at the\nstart of the Chicago marathon you'd have\nto worry about this too much because as\nI say it resets all the time and just\nkeep clocking with your watch looking at\nthat lap Pace as you go on also if there\nare any Paces during the event then you\ncan look out and try and run with them\nrunning some of the pacing groups most\nof these Pace groups are really really\ngood I think in the recent New York\nMarathon for example 95% of the Pacers\nachieve their goal time and help all the\nthousands of Runners out there achieve\ntheir goal times as well Right Moving On\nLet's have a chat about fueling how are\nwe going to fuel the race this is what\nsets the marathon apart from so many\nother races with 5Ks 10ks and even up to\nHalf Marathon distance really you can\nget away with not really fueling much or\nat all during these races but with the\nmarathon you cannot do that so it's\nreally important to fuel regularly\nthroughout the race a mistake a lot of\nRunners make when running the marathon\nis they wait till they get tired before\nthey start taking on some fuel and by\nthat point it's far too late and you\ncan't recover from it so what I\nrecommend is a Rough Guide is 30 G of\ncarbs round about every 35 to 45 minutes\nand do this from the start now of course\nas with all things running it's going to\nvary a little bit from person to person\nso we always stress to practice this\nduring your long runs to find out the\nquantities and the timings that work\nwell for you and there's also so many\ndifferent products so many different\ngels natural gels so many different\ntypes of things you can try during your\ntraining all with different amounts of\ncarbohydrates in them as well different\ntextures different flavors so it's\nreally important to find out what works\nfor you we do have a huge gel taste test\ncomparison video to give you some ideas\nwe'll link to that down below as well so\nmaybe have a check out of that if you're\nlooking for some new ideas of some gels\nthat you want to try out now for\nhydration you'll likely have drinks\navailable every few miles on the course\nbut look this up beforehand all of the\nbig majors and the big races will have\ndrink stations at a bare minimum every\ncouple of Miles most of them is every\nsingle mile out there I'd always say\ndrink little and often if you're thirsty\nhave a drink it's very hard to have an\nexact game plan of trying to get a\ncertain amount of liquid down for me I\njust run through a water station if I'm\nfeeling thirsty I try and get something\ndown and then carry on now if you are\nfeeling a bit dehydrated and you need to\nstop and walk to get some water down\nthat's absolutely fine make sure you get\nthat water down sometimes it is really\nhard running through these things and\ntrying to get a cup and get it down you\nbut as I say if you need just stop for a\nfew seconds just to get it down make\nsure there's no one running up down\nbehind you you're going to block someone\nall of a sudden just get that down and\nthen carry on running now you may want\nto use a hydration vest to keep some\nliquids on you and your gels as well or\nany other valuables during your long\nruns and also potentially during your\nrace as well a lot of people like to do\nthis just so they know they've got\nabsolutely everything on them and\nthey're going to be okay they don't have\nto rely on anybody else out there maybe\nthey've got some special drinks or\nthings like that again I would say not\nevery race allows you to have a\nhydration breast but the vast majority\ndo so just make sure you double check\nfor me when I'm doing my long runs I\nusually just simply like to just leave a\nbottle under a bush come in grab that\ndown the drink get a gel on board as\nwell and then carry on just takes about\n30 seconds out of my long run just to\nmake sure I'm getting that fuel on board\nright a couple more things to chat about\nthe next one being recovery during our\ntraining sleep is so important this is\nwhen our body is going to be making\nthose adaptations to become that faster\nrunner we want it be most likely you're\ngoing to be feeling a little bit tired\nanyway so just keep checking with\nyourself see how you feel try and get as\nmuch sleep as you possibly can for a lot\nof people after their runs they're going\nto want to get a nice recovery Shake on\nboard something with a good mix of\ncarbohydrates and proteins something\nlike a 3:1 mix is pretty standard yeah\ngetting something like that down within\nthat 30 minutes after you run is really\ngood thing as well I'm making sure\nyou're doing a really good solid warm up\nwith some dynamic stretches easing into\nall of our runs before we head out and\nthen some static stretches after our run\njust to look after ourselves the thing I\nwant to have a chat about is just\ntalking to those around you about what\nyou're doing communicate with your\nfriends and family adding this whole new\nthing into what is probably already\nquite a busy schedule can be quite a\nstressful thing chat to people let them\nknow how you're feeling if you've got\nany injuries and pains get some advice\nis no problem at all just to cross train\nfor a few days just while they die down\nI absolutely guarantee that everybody\ntraining for a marathon will have some\nsort of minor injury thing to deal with\nduring their training block yes it's\nquite stressful but get some helpful\nadvice look up some advice on YouTube\nideally get to see someone a physio\nsports massage therapist in person if\nyou can running a marathon is an\nincredibly amazing thing to do also a\nvery hard thing to do so give yourself a\npad on the back for taking time to do\nsome research to improve yourself\nbecause no doubt you're going to have an\namazing time out there as I say running\na marathon is hard but it feels so good\nwhen you cross the finish line knowing\nthat you've had a really good run out\nthere and if you need a little bit more\nguidance on your training then check out\nthe marathon plans Down Below on benp\nparks.com the next video coming up is my\nfull 24 hours before race day complete\nguide and my Ultimate Guide to long runs\nas well Che your pick from one of those\nvideos that's it guys keep on working\nhard keep done let me know how you get\non in your race and we'll see you in the\nnext one",

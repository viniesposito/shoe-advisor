  "text": "a simple Do-it all shoe for a bargain\nprice isn't that what all Runners want\nbut manufacturers make it so hard to\nfind constantly trying to sell us Niche\nshoes so that we end up spending more\nmoney well today I've got an absolute\nGem of a shoe in to test out and if the\nrumors are true this could well be the\nbargain shoe of the Year this shoe joins\nAdidas's Legacy Adi Zero range of their\nhigh performance running shoes joining\nthe Super Shoe adios Pro the super\nSpeedy Tumi Sen the classic uptempo\ndaily Boston the SL2 is a classic daily\nshoe where you can pick up your pace and\nhave some fun with your runs and that's\nwhat we will be reviewing today so St\nrelax let's get the Adidas SL2 review\ndone as always I bought this shoe 100%\nwith my money so I can give you that\ncompletely impartial 100% honest review\nlet me know down in the comments some\nother shoe reviews that you'd like to\nsee coming up we just putting a little\nlist together for some testing we're\ngoing to do over the summer I'd love to\nhave your input so let me know down in\nthe comments and if you like these kind\nof videos please like them and share\nthem with a friend and as I say let us\nknow down in the comments what you want\nto see coming\nup right let's chat about the\ndifferences between this and the\noutgoing model the first one being we've\ngot an updated upper which is now more\nlightweight and a little bit more\nbreathable well that's what Adidas are\ntelling us the second one we've now got\nthis fulllength strip of the Light\nStrike Pro Adidas's premium foam that\nruns the whole length of the shoe and\nthen that's surrounded by Adidas's up\nupdated Light Strike 2.0 foam as well as\na carrier foam meaning that this model\nis so much softer and also more\nresponsive with these really much better\nupdated phones and the third update is\nit's now much lighter as well coming in\nat 287 G that's ridiculous for me in my\nUK size 12 well let's get stuck into the\nfacts and\nfigures so the purpose of a shoe like\nthis this is your classic daily trainer\nfor me this is a 5K 10K up to half\nmarathon racing or training shoe yes of\ncourse you can do some marathon training\nfor your easy dogs I wouldn't personally\nwant to take it out for a super long run\nthe price of this shoe is fantastic this\nshoe sent me back just 98 here in the UK\nfrom sport shoes against an RRP of\n\u00a30 Stack Heights we've got a 36 mil\nstack heite at the back of the shoe 9 mm\ndrop overall and as I just said at 287 G\nvery very light weight for a shoe like\nthis it's a neutral shoe the upper we've\ngot this lovely engineered mesh very\ntraditional feeling here the midsole\nwe've got a lovely fulllength layer of\nAdidas's light strip Pro foam and that's\nencapsulated by Adidas's updated Light\nStrike 2.0 Pham treating as a carrier\nfoam just to add extra durability into\nthe shoe there's no carbon plate in this\nshoe the outsole is Adidas's own rubber\noutsole it's not the Continental one\nwhich you sometimes see on on most of\nthe Adi Zero range but still pretty damn\ngood at this price point at the time of\nfilming and the release there are no\ndifferent widths available hopefully\nthey will be along soon we'll chat about\nthat in some of the negatives coming up\nthere are three different colorways\navailable at the moment and this was\npretty much true to size for me I would\nsay if you're between sizes you're not\nreally sure then definitely go half a\nsized up added us on their own website\ntell you to go half a size up but it was\njust about okay but if you're totally\nunsure go half a size up right let's get\nstuck into my\nlights my first light with this shoe is\njust the sheer versatility that you can\nget with it the traction surprisingly\ngood with Adidas's own very basic outso\nhere but it works really well this will\nbe a really great shoe to get the\nmajority of your training runs and\npotentially some races done in it as\nwell whether you're training for your 5K\n10K or half marathon or even some\nmarathon training Mars in there as well\nand it's just a really fun shoe to run\nin it's so engaging it brings a smile to\nyour face it's Poppy it's just got that\njust the right amount of softness and\nresponsiveness a really fantastic shoe\nto get the vast majority of your runs\ndone and it's just incredible at this\nprice point as well I didn't have any\nslipping issues got a really good lock\ndown at the back of the shoe didn't have\nto use any heel lock lacing feet just\nfelt really secure in the shoe no hot\nspots no blisters the second like with\nthis shoe is just the lightweightness of\nit it's Snappy it's fun to run in the\nmid Soul offers a really engaging ride\nat this price point is just incredible\nreally of course it's not as fast as\nsome of the assisted shoes with their\nrods or plates in other manufacturers\nbut this shoe equally is certainly no\nslouch for that completely unassisted\nvery traditional ride and my third like\nwith the shoe as I've touched on a lot\nso far is just the sheer value that this\nshoe offers it really is unheard of at\nthis sort of price point usually the\nFoams in this area are hard dull just a\nreal afterthought of manufacturers Just\nchucking any of thing in there it\ndoesn't really matter but added ass have\nfor some reason added their premium\nphones to this entrylevel shoe and it's\njust fantastic the durability should be\nreally solid here I've only done three\nruns in the shoe so far but it's holding\nup really really well and although I\nhaven't really be able to run in the\nrain in this shoe because we're here in\nthe summer in the UK and the weather's\nactually quite good for a change I\nreally think it should be pretty good\nthe build quality at this price point is\njust exceptional as well I've heard a\nfew people complaining about the laces\nare a bit cheap and yeah they are you\nmay may want to swap them out but for me\nthey were absolutely fine so nothing to\nworry about just a fantastic brilliant\nvalue shoe that really really\ndelivers moving on to my dislikes the\nshoe is definitely on the narrow side\nquite a traditional Adidas quite\nEuropean fitting shoe here it's\ndefinitely a lot narrower than the\nBoston and the adios Pro and other shoes\nin their range as I said earlier their\nown website does suggest to get half a\nsize up here and that is is what I'd\nrecommend if you're at all unsure\nbetween two sizes but if you do have\nwide feet then really I'm afraid this is\ngoing to be one to avoid hopefully edit\nus will release a wider fitting option\nhere which will be fantastic but sadly\nat the moment this shoe really is for\nyour narrower or standard width feet\n[Music]\npeople so do I recommend the Adidas SL2\nwell as you can probably tell very very\nmuch so I'm definitely going to be\nkeeping it in my rotation this shoe is\ndefinitely not going on eBay we're\ndefinitely going to be shifting I'm\ngoing to enjoy putting many more miles\nin the shoe just perfect for someone\nlooking for that standard traditional\nfeel no plates no rods none of all that\ntechnology that some people love in\ntheir shoes but some people really don't\nyes you can pay more to get the Boston\nwith that assisted ride and it is a\nlittle bit wider as well but for the\nmajority of people this would be a\nreally good daily shoe now compared to\nthe other budget options out there at\nthe moment two of the really good ones\nlike the pluma pluma Puma velocity Nitro\nthree and the rebot float ride this just\noffers a far more engaging ride the foam\nin here you're getting added as's light\nstripe Pro foam and that's just their\ntop end foam that you see in their 200b\nplus shoes yes it's just a small Slither\nin there but that really brings the shoe\nto life it's so much fun to run in and\nthat sort of ride is just something\nyou're not getting at this price point\nyes there's a couple of nitpicky things\nI would like a little bit more stability\nin this shoe cuz it's just a little bit\non the narrow side nice it's a little\nbit wider if if I was going to be using\nthis for them dedicated Marathon long\nruns and things like that but for me at\nthe moment this is unbeatable value at\nthis price definitely the best shoe you\ncan buy around about that1 price point\nso I'd really recommend picking up a\npair before Adidas realize what they're\non to here and put the price up so very\nmuch recommended now clearly a lot of\nyou guys watching like myself want to\nget some exceptional value out there\nrunning which is why you're looking at a\nshoe like this we've got a really great\nvideo coming up next all about a load of\nKit and Tech to help you prove your\nrunning when you're on a budget so check\nout that video up here now keep on\nworking hard guys keep on it done and\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

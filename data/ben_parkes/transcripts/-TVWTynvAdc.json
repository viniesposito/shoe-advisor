  "text": "the New Balance Rebel version 4 is\nrumored to be one of the best daily\nshoes of 2024 in my testing there have\nbeen some amazing highs and really\nfalling in love with a shoe but also\nsome real lows so that's what this video\nis all about my roller coaster ride with\nthe New Balance Rebel version 4 so the\npurposes of a shoe like the New Balance\nRebel version 4 is just a classic\neveryday shoe to do all sorts of\ndifferent types of runs in pretty well\nthis shoe set me back4 0 around about\n\u20ac60 or\n$140 and of course like everything on\nthe channel I bought this shoe 100% with\nmy money so I give you that completely\nimpartial honest review in terms of\nStack Heights we've got a 30 mil stack\nat the back 24 at the front giving that\n6 mm overall drop in the shoe for me\nthis came in as a super lightweight\n248 G I rarely run in a shoe under 250 g\nand I really noticed that lovely\nlightweight feel it's a neutral shoe and\nit has a lovely engine mesh Phantom fit\nupper the midsole of this shoe is New\nBalances all new peber and Eva blend and\nthere is no carbon plate in the shoe at\nall in terms of the outsole you've got\nfive rubber strips on the out soole\ngiving a really good amount of grip and\ndurability to the shoe are there\ndifferent widths available well at the\nmoment it depends where you live if you\nlive in the USA get it on the New\nBalance website then yes you've got the\nstandard width and the extra wide one in\nthe UK we've only got standard at the\nmoment and then finally this was true to\nsize for me in my standard UK size 12\nright let's have a chat about the\ndifferences the first one is this new\nmidsole the peba and Eva Blended midsole\nit's about a 3 mm gain in stack height\nand also significantly ligh as well\nabout around about 10 G lighter\ndepending on what size of shoe you have\nthere's also been a slight price\nincrease in the shoe kind of to beit\nexpected in the world we live in and a\nslight increase in the width a lot of\nroom in the front of the shoe we'll come\non to that later on in the review right\nbut let's get stuck in to my likes now\nmy first like I've just written\nlightweight and fun because that's what\nthis shoe is it really puts a smile on\nyour face as you run along but despite\nbeing lightweight they've also added\nthis extra width in the shoe wider\nfooted Runners rejoice and you've got a\nreally good amount of volume up there\nfor all sorts of different foot sizes\nyou've got a really good amount of\ncushioning but also it's a really\nresponsive ride as well you can really\npick up the pace if you're going to be\ndoing some speed workouts some races the\nturn of speed in the shoe is really\ngreat considering it doesn't have a\ncarbon plate in it it's also with that\nextra width it's super stable at all\nspeeds as well especially going around\nthe corners it's just an all around\nreally good fun shoe to run in puts a\nsmile on your face and wants you to run\na little bit more and a little bit\nfaster as well the real highlight of\nthis shoe is this new midsole that peber\nand Eva blend basically peber foam is\nthat lightweight racing super responsive\nsuper Snappy the Eva part of that foam\nis to get you that extra bit of\ndurability so not quite as is responsive\nbut it's going to last a long time\nthat's that really good balance which we\nwant in a daily shoe my second like with\nthe shoe is it's so versatile or\nwhatever type of running you want to\nthrow at it it's really happy at easy\nPaces Tempo Pace threshold Pace marathon\npace whatever you want to be doing your\ntraining at this shoe will handle it\nreally well with this durable outsole\nhere you could even do some light Trail\nsome fire roads and things like that it\nwill handle that absolutely fine the\nupper of the shoe New Balances Phantom\nfit upper really breathable getting good\namount of air flow through there as well\nand I wouldn't hesitate to use this for\nall different types of races as well 5K\n10K half marathon even up to a Marathon\ndistance with the amount of cushioning\nyou're getting from this midsole so yeah\ntrue versatility which is really what we\nwant to see in a classic daily trainer\nmy final like is that price and that\nvalue that you're getting from this shoe\nI managed to get these for just \u00a3118 I\nthink it was with a discount code off\nsports shoes really fantastic value for\nthat sort of price point so far\ndurability wise holding up really well\nwe've done about 30 m about 50k in this\nshoe and there is absolutely no wear on\nthis whatsoever it makes you feel good\nwhen you're running and also in your\nback pocket as well I honestly can't\nthink of a better value shoe if you can\nget a little bit of a discount like I\ndid for around about \u00a31 1220 out there\non the market at the moment but like\neverything in life it wasn't all smiles\nthere were quite a lot of them but there\nwere some dislikes with this shoe as\nwell the first one being I did\nexperience some really bad rubbing at\nthe back of the shoe on the back of my\nankle on the Achilles area real sort of\nbad chafing and I had to cut short my\nfirst run in the shoe which was really\nannoying because I was loving it so much\nabout 5k absolutely fantastic and a k of\nlike something's not quite right here\nand this is on both ankles as well and\nthe last 2K was just trying to limp back\nto the car as fast as I could I put a\nlittle photo of what my ankle looked\nlike after 8K of the first run in the\nshoe and it was really really quite sore\nI had to have a rest day the next day\nbecause it was soaring all the other\nshoes I was then trying to walk around\nin it was a really odd sensation I\ndidn't feel like anything was slipping\nbut I think all this comes down to is\nthe shoe is particularly wide my feet\nare a little bit on the narrow side\nyou've got a lot of space in here and I\ncouldn't really get it locked down very\nvery well now we're do went out from the\nsecond testing run of this shoe some\npeople suggested in my straa comments\nand on Instagram to try some heel lock\nlacing and that definitely improved\nthings a little bit and I didn't suffer\nany sort of pain at the back of the shoe\nquite as much but I really wanted to run\nand test this shoe properly so I did add\nsome plasters or Band-Aids As Americans\nsay to the back of my ankle and of\ncourse then it went away there was\nnothing to rub in so I think all this\ncomes down to is if you have a\nparticularly narrow foot you might\nsuffer some bunching some lockdown\nissues and just find it really hard to\nget a good lock down in the shoe with\nthose little tweaks that Hill lock\nlacing at the front and some plasters at\nthe back of the shoe that obviously went\naway and then it really was all smiles\nback again and that really was the only\nnegative to the shoe quite a big\nnegative because no one wants to be\ncutting runs short but overall have\nabsolutely Lov putting those test Mars\nin their shoe despite the pain I really\nwant to persevere through it because I\nthink think the shoe could be absolutely\nfantastic on my achilles will just\ndevelop a little bit of callous and I'll\nget i'll get on with it but yeah a lot\nof shoes these days you don't even have\nto run them in back in the day I've been\nrunning for so long every shoe you got\nout it was a little bit uncomfortable\nthat for that first sort of 20 miles so\nthen it all it would all soften up but\nshoes have come so good these days you\ndon't really need to do that at all but\nwith this one I think just my breaking\nperiod is just going to be a little bit\nlonger so in conclusion is this going to\nmy rotation am I keeping it is it going\non eBay I definitely really want to keep\nit because it's been so much fun to run\nin the slight little issues at the back\nwe'll get over that and I'm really\nlooking forward to doing some\nlongdistance training runs for the\nmarathons I've got coming up in this and\nit's going to be a good speed session\nshoe and a good Marathon long run\ntraining shoe as well especially for\nanyone that doesn't want a carbon plate\nin the shoe this really is one of the\nbest options out there but there are\nsome other options as well the classic\nshoe it's up against is something like\nthe Nova blast version 4 this is a\nlittle bit heavier a little bit chunkier\nnot quite as fast and not quite as\nlightweight so it depends the type of\nthe feeling you want you feel a little\nbit more in contact with the ground with\nthis one lightweight Snappy whereas this\none is just a good sort of chugging a\nlong shoe super super comfortable a lot\nmore comfortable than this one that will\nlook after you pretty well or\npotentially you can't justify I don't\nwant to spend the amount of money that\nthe super blast cost because it's a\npretty expensive shoe at over \u00a3200 then\nthis shoe is really really good as well\nmaybe not quite as Snappy not quite as\nfast but a significant price drop from\nthis you're going to saving about 90 p\nin your back pocket with a shoe like\nthis so very much it's staying rotation\ndefinitely not going on eBay I really\nhave enjoyed running and testing this\nshoe out let me know your thoughts down\nin the comments have you had some heel\nslip issues what did you think about the\nwidth but yeah very much recommended go\nout and check it out wherever you buy\nyour shoes from the next video coming up\nis all about my best ever comfy shoes\nthis video is kind of blown up quite\nwell so a lot of you guys must look for\nsome comfort in your shoes so go and\ncheck that one out I'm off to get\nanother run in the New Balance r version\n4 that's it guys keep on working hard\nkeep on get it done we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

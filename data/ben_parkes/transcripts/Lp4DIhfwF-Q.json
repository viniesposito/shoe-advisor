  "text": "over the past 3 months I spent over \u00a3700\non some of the most popular running\nproducts that influencers are promoting\nI've been on a mission to see if they\nlive up to the hype that they claim or\nthey are a complete waste of money as a\nconsumer it can be hard to tell if these\nproducts are genuinely good or if\nthey're just promising great things\nyou'll go out and buy them with their\ndiscount code no doubt so they get a\nreally nice chunky commission check at\nthe end of the day well that's why we\nare here today so I can give you a\ncompletely honest un bied opinion to\nhelp you in your buying decisions now\njust before we start I want to say this\nis not me having a go at influences in\nany way whatsoever I've got many friends\nwho are influencers all going to make a\nliving in lots of weird and wonderful\nways but like so many of you I'm curious\nabout the good and also the bad about\nthese products but also the complete\nbuying experience that some influencers\naren't going to see because they just\nget sent most of these products\ncompletely for free and touching on that\nI did have a bit of a negative customer\nservice experience with one of these\nthings today so hopefully it goes\nwithout saying that I bought all of\nthese 100% with my own money exactly the\nsame way we do with everything we buy\nhere and review on the channel so\nstarting out we have this from purport\nthis is a muscle balm to help you with\nyour tired and aching muscles it's\ninfused with 1,000 mg of CBD also some\nmagnesium and arica in there as well\nlike a lot of people I found out about\nCBD a few years ago when it was all the\nrage and I've actually bought six jars\nof this stuff over the last couple of\nyears at40 of Pop \u00a3210 I've spent with\npure sport I've actually used a little\nbit of CBD when I was having some a not\nso good mental health time to try and\nimprove things and at the same time I\nheard about pure Sport and what they\nwere doing with this stuff but let's\nstart out with the likes of the pure\nsport muscle B the first one being it\nreally got me into a good routine of\nlooking after my body learning about my\nbody doing some self massage working\nthrough those little aches and pains\nit's also informed sport so I can trust\nit there's nothing and anything here and\ngood customer support when I did have to\ncontact them for a couple of things it\nsmells really nice it feels really nice\non the skin the ingredients that they\nusing it the arica the cvd the Magnesium\nall appear to me to be really good\nquality ingredients and it's actually\nquite good value for the amount of CBD\nthat you're getting into this it's\npretty potent stuff so if you want to\ntry out this type of product with some\nCBD in this is going to be a really good\nhigh quality premium product and then\nfinally I'm not sure if this is a like\nor a dislike but it's just that sort of\nStellar artto or that weight rro effect\nmaybe Whole Foods in America it's just a\npremium thing it's like reassuringly\nexpensive but it you spend \u00a340 in it so\nyou're going to use it but talking about\nthe dislikes here it is obviously super\nexpensive I've spent over a couple of\nhundred on this so far you're paying for\nthat influencer Kickback you're paying\nfor the marketing teams all of that the\nbenefits probably are a little bit\nminimal I feel the benefits I had were\nfor me actually doing the massaging into\nmy skin I feel I could have used all\nsorts of different type of muscle bombs\nand probably had a fairly similar effect\nI didn't personally receive any sort of\nreal pain relief or any reduction in\ninflammation or things like that if\nsomething's gone wrong I've rolled an\nankle or something I'm getting an ice\npack out of the freezer rather than\nrubbing something like this on and\nfinally some of the people I do follow\nthat are promoting this stuff it's just\nvery scripted and I'm just very\nuncomfortable watching sort of how\nthey're promoting it so yeah are there\nsome Alternatives well Holland and\nBarrett do a CBD one doesn't have the\naner and the magnesium in it and it's\ncertainly not as potent and then Neil's\ny do a one without the CBD and but I've\njust got some arac in as well that does\nappear to be really good and that is a\nhell of a lot cheaper so if you have the\ncash to spend on something like this\nthen it's going to be worth trying to\nsome extent CBD is going to affect\neverybody slightly differently but I\nwould say just take some time to learn\nsome self massage techniques just\nslapping this on your skin and thinking\nyou're going to feel better in the\nmorning is not going to happen so what's\nmy rating for this and I'm going to keep\nusing it well i' give it a three out of\nfive it's worth trying but it's not\ngoing to be for absolutely every it's\ncertainly very expensive I'm probably\nnot going to be buying much more of it\nnow and just use it a little bit\nsparingly but yeah not too bad three out\nof five Right Moving on we're going to\nbe talking about pillar performance\ntriple magnesium powder I've bought a\ncouple of packets of this from xmars\nhere in the UK they're a great company\nalways give them a shout out and you get\na bottle with it I think if you get the\npack at the start it's basically a\nmagnesium drink powder you put one scoop\nin with 250 Ms of water ideally having\nit before you go to bed it makes a right\nold mess here Sarah's get me on the\ncamera mix it up and then just give it a\nshake up and that's you done and yeah\nand then let's get this on the\nmicrophone give it a good Shake because\nthen it has this really ASR now someone\nlike me I've always really struggled\nwith my sleep over the years I find it\nso hard to get my brain to shut down\nlate at night so that's really\ninterested to try this to help with my\nsleep but also as they say on the packet\nsupporting muscle function tiredness and\nfatigue to help you sleep better so you\nrecover better you wake up feeling ready\nto go the next day as I said I picked\nthis up from X Mars here in the UK\nthey're one of the official suppliers I\nthink pillar are from Australia they all\nThe Branding is quite Australian they\nsponsor quite a few Australian athletes\nas search and they also do this in a\ncapsule form as well so you can take\nthis as tablets or make this little\ndrink mix they also did this in Berry\nand pineapple I just got the berry\nversion twice and I've had two packs\nover the last three months 40 servings\nper pack costing \u00a345 a go so as usual a\nlot of talking about here it's a little\nbit on the expensive side and I took\nthis around about 30 minutes before bed\nnot absolutely every night but probably\nsort of about five nights a week\nso what does it taste like well very\nvery very very sweet we'll come with\nthat in the negatives right let's have a\nchat about everything I liked about the\npillow performance first one being it\nmixes really easily no lumps or anything\nlike that just whack it and any bottle\ngive it a shake and you're good to go 30\nminutes before bed we're also getting\nsome really good quality magnesium\nglycinate in here which is the best to\nhelp with those tired muscles do I feel\nI slept better the most important thing\nyeah definitely and I did have some very\nmore peculiar dreams after taking this\nas well so there certainly a lot going\non one thing I really did notice though\nwas getting back to sleep if I do wake\nup in the night I stir you go to the\ntoilet or anything like that getting\nback to sleep was just so much better\nafter I had this and then finally I\nreally genuinely felt it did help with\nmy recovery I was just sleeping so much\nbetter I haven't had any injuries touch\nwood over the last few months since I've\nbeen using this anyway let's have a chat\nabout the dislikes the first one being\nit didn't help me fall asleep any\nquicker initially I haven't taken any\nsleep medication or anything like that\nover the years cuz I don't really know\nwhat that type of stuff is this is not\nthat and it certainly didn't help me get\nto sleep it was just if I woke up and\ngetting back to sleep it definitely\nhelped with and then it's also very\nsweet and very artificial tasting this\nis just to the berry flavor it just\ntastes like you're having some kids\nsweet so it's not going to be for\neveryone's taste let me know if you've\nhad it what do you think of the taste\nand then finally some alternatives to\nsomething like this well pure sport du\nmagnesium capsule with added beetroot in\nit as well so you could potentially\ncheck that out so my rating for this i'\ndefinitely give this four out of five\nand I totally will be keeping up taking\nit I'm not going to be able to afford to\ntake it all year but just when I'm doing\nmy hard training I'm training for some\nmarathons now at the end of the year I'm\ndefinitely going to be trying to take\nthis sort of four to five nights a week\nso four out of five super expensive but\ndoes seem to be making a difference next\nup we are talking about this this is the\nThea gun mini version 2 RP of\n\u00a3175 though I bought this one on eBay um\nfor 125 so yeah massage guns some people\nlove them some people hate them they\nhave been increasingly popular over the\nlast 5 to 10 years they're kind of\nBuilders I guess the foam roller for the\nmodern athlete to help with their Master\nrecovery seemingly every pro athlete out\nthere has one of these in their bag\nyou're seeing people using them quite a\nlot and the body or Thea gun as they\nused to be called they've rebranded I\nthink um seem to be the go-to brand that\nsponsor a lot of high-profile Athletics\nteams and influencers and stuff like\nthat the world now I bought a Theon\nPrime which is just like the basic entry\nlevel one a couple years ago it was a\nbit of a pain to travel with and\ncharging it up and always lose a stupid\ncharger for it so I bought the mini so I\ncould travel with it charge it up really\neasily cuz it's USBC so what you get in\nthe package is obviously the theun mini\nyou also get the USBC cable um three\ndifferent heads that you can snap on and\nthen snap back off again this runs at\nthree different speeds there's some\nlights on the side here these LEDs those\nlight up with increasing different\nspeeds and then finally the other fact\nis it's 12 mm of amplitude there so I've\nbeen using this to warm up before my\nruns using it for some recovery after my\nruns the first like for this is actually\nnot the the massage gun itself but the\napp that it comes with on your Android\nor iPhone whatever it just syns up so\nperfectly to the device with bluetooth\nthe biggest issue for most people using\nmassage guns is they just don't know how\nto use it now I'm not an expert I'm\nlearning like everybody else but so many\npeople hurt themselves by using these\nthings badly using too much pressure in\nthe wrong sort of places the app is\nreally good it guides you through you've\ngot videos in there it tells you how\nmuch pressure to use where to place it\nand everything like that for the\nproblems that you're having in that\nparticular point in time it's just very\neasy to use when you know how so I\ndefinitely recommend use the app if\nyou're going to be using one of the the\nbody products and I think if you even if\nyou don't have a massage gun from theab\nbody you can still use the app obviously\nit won't control it and it won't speak\nto each other but you can get some\nreally good guides on there for how to\nuse things second like USBC is just just\nso much easier to travel with I've been\ntraveling loads with this we've been on\nplanes driving in the car it's gone\nthrough security absolutely fine in hand\nluggage no issues anywhere in all of the\ntravels and the battery life has been\npretty good I've been getting at least 2\nhours out of this which is lasting sort\nof about 10 days of use probably 10 days\nto 2 weeks of use so I really don't even\nhave to charge it up that much and I\ngenuinely feel better by using it I've\nhad a lot of issues at the start of this\nyear from driving my car getting really\nbad super type hip flexors I really put\na lot of credit into this device for\nhelping sort that out I mean I can do a\nbit more driving than I want to do so\nthis goes with me pretty much every time\nI go on a long car Journey this thing's\ncoming with me I can charge up in the\ncar stop every hour or so and just go\nthrough my hip flexors and then my final\nlike is it's pretty powerful it's\nsurprisingly powerful probably not going\nto be if you're a massive Burly\nweightlifter or something like that it\nmight have struggle to get through your\nsort of muscles but for people like\nmyself and the vast majority of Runners\nout there it's going to have more than\nenough power to look after your muscles\nbut as always it's not all smiles my\ndislikes with this it doesn't come with\na plug so you're going to need to have\none of those like little adapter boxes\nto be able to charge it up and you can\ncertainly apply more pressure with a\nmore normal shaped massage gun the way\nyou hold this it's not the best thing\nbut it's super convenient and easy to\ntravel with it's obviously quite\nexpensive if you buy it for full RP so\nare there alternatives to this of course\nthere are the main one being like the\nBob and gr Bob and gr the Bob and Brad\nmassage gun let me know if you've used\nthat you can obviously use your foam\nroller at the gym or at home if you're\ngoing a little bit more old school or of\ncourse get a Weekly massage if you can\nevery two weeks 3 weeks 1 month whatever\nyou can do whatever you can afford that\nis going to help you out way more having\nsome some actual human go through your\nbody than these sort of things can but\nit's a nice thing for me to keep\neverything ticking over between saying\nmy regular massage therapist so my\nrating for this I really really quite\nimpressed because it's helped sort out\nso many little problems I've been having\ndayto day so four and a half out of five\nand will I keep using it yeah this is\ncoming everywhere with me we good\nfriends traveling around the world\ntogether right just going to have a\nquick drink if you are enjoying the\nvideo let me know hit that like button\ndown below and is there any influencer\ntype products or just any products you\nwant to see me review let me know down\nin the comments there it's going to\ngoing in there pick a few and we'll do\nanother one of these videos in a few\nmonths time I'll go and buy all this\nstuff and see if it's any good right\nback to the video I think we're talking\nabout aftershocks next right aftershocks\nas my girlfriend is just behind the\ncamera has reminded me they're not\ncalled aftershocks anymore they are just\ncalled shocks these sent me back\n\u00a360 if you don't know what these are\nthinking what the hell is he waving\naround these are headphones basically\nfor active people Runners cyclists\nWalkers well that's certainly how they\nbrand them on their website these used\nbone conduction Technologies they sit on\nthe side of your head like that and I'm\ngoing to read this because it's really\ncomplicated but if you're wondering how\nthey work they convert sound into\nmechanical vibrations that are\ntransmitted through the skin and the\ntemporal bone to the clear\nbasically these pods on the side of\nthese headphones vibrate and they go\nthrough your bones and you can hear them\nwhat do you get in the Box well you get\nthe cable the charging cable the\ntraveling case and the headphones as\nwell they come in two different sizes\nfor different size head shapes they\ncharge up super quick you can go from n\nto 60% in around about 20 minutes and\nthey'll be fully charged in one hour the\nbattery lasts about 10 hours so let's\nchat about my likes one the sound\nquality for listening to podcasts and\nany sort of spoken word audiobooks and\nthings like that is pretty good my\nsecond like is the safety aspect of\nthese because there's nothing actually\nin your ears you can hear of any\npotential dangers traffic other people\ncyclist whatever around you and you can\nalso use these pretty much all the time\nin races you still need to check with\nthe race organizer but pretty much every\nrace certainly here in the UK you can\nuse aftershocks even when headphones are\nbanned because the safety aspect you can\nhear medical people you can hear\ndirections and stuff from everything\ngoing on around you you can also connect\nthese up to any phone any watch so you\ndon't have to take your phone with you\nif you just want to connect it to your\ngarment and listen to the music on that\nthat works absolutely fine also super\ncomfortable you could easily wear these\nall day without any problem at all some\npeople also like to use these in like\noffice environments and things if I've\ngot a call in the house this is normally\nwhat I'll be reaching for battery life\nas we touched earlier really good as\nwell they also do work well in heavy\nrain I've never had a problem I've never\nhad a pair break I think this is my\nthird pair I've just upgraded so the\nbuild quality of these things is superb\nlet's have a chat about some dislikes\nwell because they're not properly in\nyour ears the sound quality for music\nisn't great especially the bass I've got\nthe like the pro version here which is\nmeant to have a bit of better bass if\nyou want to listen to music you're a big\naudio file these are definitely not the\nheadphones to be going for also you\nreally can't hear much if you are in a\nnoisy environment the whole point of the\nsafety thing you can hear the dangers\nbut if you're running through a busy\nUrban environment all the time you\nreally can't hear a lot of what's going\non in these I guess that's just the flip\nside of being safe which a lot of high\nvolume alerts I don't know if Android\nhas this but on my phone it's always\nwarning me because I keep listening to\nthese too loud because you listen to it\nnearly about sort of 80% volume most of\nthe time so Apple thinks you're\nabsolutely ruining your hearing but they\ndon't have a setting for these type of\nheadphones um you so I can't really wear\nthese under a beanie so we're coming to\nthe winter now so I tend to get my\nairpods out for wearing under a beanie\nand just put them on the past three mode\nother Alternatives out there I really\nwould say maybe just save \u00a330 and buy\nthe not pro version just the open run\nthey actually have a better waterproof\nrating as well they're \u00a33 cheaper and\nwhen I'm out a run I really honestly\ncan't tell the difference they've also\ngot a refurb section on their website\nwhere you can buy some with a pretty\nhefty discount as well so if you're in\nthe market for that then check out the\nrefurb section other alterers as well\nsunto have actually released um two new\nvery similar headphones to this I think\nthey're called the sunto wing and the\nsunto Sonic um the early reviews say\nthey are quite good so my rating for the\nafter trucks is 4 and2 out of five will\nI be keeping them definitely I use these\non absolutely every run I go on right\nour final product on the list today are\nsome running sunglasses from a company a\nBritish company called Su God I see a\nlot of people wearing this influences\nlove a pair of sunglasses I think I look\nmore like I'm about to go and do\nsomething in a laboratory with my bunson\nburner but yeah for them it's a nice\nlittle earner they s me back\n\u00a330 they make all sorts of different\nsunglasses um also like ski go they\nsponsor loads of pros and influencers as\nwell what do you get you get a nice\nlittle case you get three different\nlittle nose section things which are\nhere and you can just unplug that bit in\nthe middle and put one of these on the\nstandard pair fit me absolutely fine\nthat starts out with my first like\nbecause these do not move around\nanywhere on my head whatsoever I was\njumping around shaking around they do\nnot move even when I'm like Midway\nthrough a run here as I'm it's pretty\nsweaty here in the summer they don't\nmove they don't bounce they just stay\nthere they're also extremely lightweight\nas well just 26 G and when I've got\nthese on I can't see anything around my\nface at all they completely block any\nsort of normal bit of light coming in\nhere you can also spec them with\nrecycled material for the same price as\nwell when you sort of build your glasses\non the website you can custom pretty\nmuch everything on here but it's really\nnice to see them offering a recycled\nPlastics as well here for the same price\nas the new stuff and then my final few\nlikes I really like how you can just put\nthese on and you can run from shade into\nlight back to shade into light never had\nto like put them down like this to be\nable to see in sort of more darker areas\nlike that I'm not sure what this lens is\nI'll put the name of this lens up on the\nscreen it's got quite a yellowy tint to\nit so it was really good in low light\nbut then even when the sun was quite\nbright it worked pretty well as well\nI've never actually running them in the\nrain or any sort of high humidity but\nnever got any like fogging up issues\nwith the lenses here and they do offer a\nlifetime guarantee which I haven't had\nto call on for these obviously they're\nstill in good shape here but when I did\na bit of research online some people\nthat had said it was really quite good\nand they're having some positive\nexperiences and then finally when you've\ngot these on and maybe you've got your\naftershocks on as well you put them the\nother way around or whatever headphones\nyou've got everything sort of went\ntogether pretty well and comfortable and\nit worked absolutely fine when I was\nusing everything together right of\ncourse like all these things it's not\nall smiles I did have a bit bit of an\nissue with the customer services it's\nprobably my fault to be fair but\nbasically I logged on at about 9:30 in\nthe morning to order these glasses\nbecause I wanted them to go away on a\ntrip in a couple of days time and they\nhad a special offer on them buy one get\none free I was like that sounds really\ngood then with my whole adhp D brain\njust abandoned the checkout went off and\ndo something else came back about 40\nminutes later about 10 10 and the offer\nwere gone it was like their weekend\noffer so I just sent a little message\nsaying I I started my check out do you\nthink you can do the offer and they was\nlike no so that that was the end of that\none I was like like I run a website here\nin the UK of course I'd help someone out\nuh with that but they was like right\nfrankly no sorry you missed it you\nshould have checked out your fault it\nwas my fault they didn't have to but it\nwould have been nice and then I then\npaid for like the next day delivery said\nif you order before 3:00 p.m. we'll get\nthese in the post arrive the next day\nand they didn't dispatch them and then I\ncouldn't take them on my trip I wanted\nto go on and they arrived a day late and\nit was just a little bit annoying and\nthen finally some of the customization\noptions weren't available when I ordered\nthese I wanted to slightly different\ncolor whatever you call this arm on the\nside of the glasses and they weren't all\navailable at the time but yeah overall\noh oh Alternatives well goodar are like\nthe main one it's certainly a hell of a\nlot cheaper than something like Su God\nbut they do scratch up so easily and I\nhave bought a few over the years they\njust kind of ended up in the bins they\njust really did not last very long so\nI'm not sure how great that is then of\ncourse Oakley the other big one out\nthere I've got a few Oak glasses and\nthey've always looked after me really\nwell and I think uh what's Rich Roll oh\nRoka he's always going about rer glasses\nso my rating of the sung God glasses\nwell I give these a four out of five as\nsunglasses go I really can't fault them\nI'm not a massive lover of running in\nglasses but I've enjoyed running in\nthese you do look a little bit s see I\ndon't know I feel like I'm sort of back\nat school doing some experiment in this\nstyle if I was as cool as Courtney dewal\nI would definitely go for her pair so\nthat's it guys that's my thoughts on\nthese products here let me know what\nelse you'd love to see me test and get\nmy thoughts on down in the comments\nbelow and if of course if you've tried\nany of these products help out the\ncommunity and let us know your thoughts\non all of these things down below as\nwell so one of the biggest influencer\nproducts is the ag1 which I tested back\nend of last year so I'll link to that up\nhere keep on working hard keep on\ngetting done and we'll see you very soon\nin the next one",

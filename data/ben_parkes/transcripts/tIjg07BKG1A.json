  "text": "you've put in the hard work done\ncountless Mars over the last few months\npushed through many difficult runs no\ndoubt highs and lows along the way\nrunning has completely taken over your\nlife but you can now finally see the\nlight at the end of the tunnel that\nstart line is in sight congratulations\nyou've reached the taper phase my name\nis Ben Parks 225 Marathon I've run\nnearly 100 marathons over the years and\nCoach so many athletes to achieve their\nPBS over the Marathon distance this is a\ncollection of everything I've learned\nand used in my own training and everyone\nwe coach so starting out what is\ntapering well in simple terms that\ntapering is reducing the volume we are\nrunning each week to maintain our\naccumulated Fitness while allowing us to\nfully recover from the training block\nthat we've just been through this full\nrecovery period we're about to go\nthrough will allow us to use that\nFitness to its full potential and reach\nrace state in our Peak state to go out\nthere and perform if you don't take then\nyou run the real risk of arriving at the\nstart line tired and fatigued so many\nRunners are really scared of losing\nFitness but over the tape of period our\nmuscles will be repairing our body is\nrecovering our mind is recovering as\nwell it will give us the opportunity to\nsharpen everything up to be in the best\npossible shape on the day all of our\ntraining plans follow a 3 we taper the\nfirst week you've only got a very small\nreduction in the amount of volume and\nthen two weeks out you see a decent\nreduction and then one week out quite a\nbig reduction in overall volume right\nlet's go through each week in detail\nstarting out with 3 weeks to go so with\n3 weeks to go you're talking around\nabout a 10 to 15% drop in overall volume\ncompared to our peak week so if your\nbiggest week was 100K for example this\nweek you're talking around about 85 to\n90k in volume we want to be keeping our\nintensity the same so our long run our\nspeed sessions and our strides should\nstill be in there just as they always\nhave been the number of runs should stay\nthe same as well we're just slightly\nreducing the the length of those runs\nyour long run this week is still going\nto be fairly long around about 16 to 18\nmil for a lot of people and it's the\nfinal chance to practice in your race\nday kit and with your race day nutrition\nas well to make sure they're completely\ndialed in so you're going to be feeling\nreally confident you also want to have a\nquick look at your nutrition now just\nmaking sure you're getting some good\nprotein sources in there each week just\nto help that recovery and help our\nmuscles repair right it's getting a\nlittle bit serious now 2 weeks to go and\nthis has been a lot of people St getting\na little bit nervous and thinking\nthey're going to be losing a little bit\nof a fitness but don't worry trust the\nprocess you're going to be fine at this\npoint in the taper we can't add any\nFitness we're now just concentrating on\nmaintaining that Fitness we've built and\nrefreshing everything and getting nice\nand recovered to maximize the potential\nof using that Fitness so in terms of\nvolume wise we're looking around about a\n30 to 35% drop in that peak week volume\nso using our 100K example there we're\ntalking about 65 to 70k running this\nweek you want to also be keeping the\nsame structure that you've been used to\nas well again just slightly shorten\nThose runs but don't go adding in any\nextra rest J just keep the structure the\nsame as you've been following throughout\nyour plan you going to be keeping a\nlittle bit of intensity in there as well\nkeep your speed session in there for the\nweek maybe just cut down the Reps a\nlittle bit if you've been doing say 6 or\n7 by 3 minutes maybe now do four or 5 by\n3 minutes just so our body can recover\nthat little bit quicker from that\nworkout and in terms of long run range\nfor anything from about 10 to 15 miles\nfor our long run and it's also a really\ngood time to book in a sports massage\nand again get those legs nice and\nrefreshed get everything flushed out of\nour legs so they'll be feeling really\nnice and Poppy and ready for race day\nit's also a really good time to plan out\nyour race day Logistics your travel how\nyou getting there any last minute gel\npurchases but don't go try any new gels\njust those gels you've been practicing\nand you know they're going to be working\nhow you get into the Expo where you're\ngoing to meeting your friends and family\nand of course downloading our race day\nchecklist from the website we'll link to\nthat down below because we want to be\nkeeping that stress to a minimum and\nwhat was going to make you very very\nstressful is if you go and get a cold or\nan illness this week so really try and\nfocus on getting some extra vitamin C in\nyour body just a supplement or just\nnatural things like orange juice things\nlike that just to help keep that immune\nsystem topped up and keep those colds\nand sicknesses at Bay right moving on to\nthe most important week race week is\nhere probably 6 days to go before one of\nthe biggest runs of your life but don't\nworry you're going to be absolutely fine\nthis week is going to be quite common\nfor a lot of people to be feeling just a\nlittle bit lethargic maybe your energy\nlevels are a little bit lower than\nnormal there maybe be a few little extra\neights and pains this is called taper\nTantrums or Marino we'll come on to\nchatting about that a little bit later\non but for now in terms of our volume\nwe're talking around about a 60 to 70%\ndrop in overall volume about 30 to 40K\nplus the race this will be a bigger drop\nfor the beginner plans if people are\nfollowing that though what I really like\nto do with everybody is a marathon pace\npractice session so lower int inity\nsomething like 3 or 4X 5 minutes at your\ngoal Pace on the Tuesday or Wednesday\nwith just jogging recoveries between\njust reminding our body what that race\nPace feels like again and it won't add\nreally any extra fatigue into our body I\nwould also say this never feels easy but\nit's a really good thing to do but don't\ngo panicking too much of how am I going\nto run 3 four hours at this pace it\nnever feels easy but it's just good to\nremind our body what that race Pace\nfeels like some people like to put some\nstrides a little short burst about 15 to\n20 seconds of running just to help\nfreshen up the legs just get that\nturnover up a little bit more and they\nwon't be adding really any extra fatigue\nI personally wouldn't be doing any\nstrength work this week probably from\nabout 10 days into the race I wouldn't\nbe doing any strength work because as\nyou know I've said quite a few times\nthis week is all about recovery many\npeople will suffer with what is known as\nmarinia or taper Tantrums as I just\ntouched on earlier when your body\npresents these really weird pains and\naches you freak out thinking that every\npain in your body is going to be some\ncareer ending injury this has happened\nin pretty much every race I've done and\nabout nine times out of 10 your body is\nabsolutely fine it's just the stress\nyou're going through and your body\nadapting to all the changes and just\nbecoming a little bit fresher and ready\nfor RAC so try not to get too stressed\nabout it but believe me I know that's a\nlot easier said than done but just be\naware that is a thing that happens to a\nlot of people should I run the day\nbefore the race run if you want to it's\nnot going to have any bearing on the\nrace but just two or three Mars 3 4 5K\nsomething like that very relaxed and\nvery easy the main benefit of doing this\nis just keeping your stress levels lower\njust helping combating those nerves this\nwhole week is about listening to your\nbody and trying to get as much sleep in\nas you can so we're going to be feeling\nfresh for race day now a lot of people\nit's going to be very hard to sleep on\nusually that Saturday night the day\nbefore the race you're going to have all\nsorts of stress and worries going\nthrough your system so we really want to\ntry and prioritize that Thursday and\nthat Friday night to really try and get\nto bed early and get a decent night\nsleep and then so when that inevitable\nslightly Sleepless restless night\nhappens on Saturday which has happened\nto me so many times over the years and\nI've always had a pretty good run on\nRace there as well so don't worry about\nit Thursday night Friday night that's\nthe key nights you want to be getting a\ngood night's sleep also starting think\nout about car bloing in those 2 to three\ndays before the race as well and if you\nare doing like a destination Marathon\nyou're going to some exciting place\nplease this week don't go go doing\n20,000 30,000 steps a day doing all your\nsing do that after the marathon wear\nthat metal with pride as you're walking\naround a beautiful city if you're\ninterested in my exact 24 hours before a\nrace dat everything I'm doing and eating\nand things like that that video is\ncoming up next click over here for that\nbut finally best of luck with your race\nlet us know how you get on I'm sure\nyou're going to be amazing we're going\nto be in Boston and London coming up\nLondon will be at the Expo as well\nexhibiting there every day we'll hope to\nyou there keep on working hard guys keep\non it done see you very soon in the next\none",

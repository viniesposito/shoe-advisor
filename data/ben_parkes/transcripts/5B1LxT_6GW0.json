  "text": "with so many big marathons always on the\nhorizon you'll be noticing your long\nruns are getting pretty long as the\ntraining plan progresses no doubt you'll\nbe wondering how on Earth am I going to\nget through these you might be getting a\nlittle bit nervous about them well don't\nworry we're talking all things long runs\ntoday how you going to get through them\nhow you going to be feeling strong all\nthe way through them right the way to\nthe finish and ultimately have a much\nbetter stronger more enjoyable race day\nas a result so I've got my five golden\nrules all about long runs today so sit\nrelax let's get long runs done the first\nthing I want to chat about is planning\neverything we're going to be doing\nbefore we're going to be heading out on\nour long run the first thing we're going\nto be deciding a good route to go on a\nlot of people like to lapse of their\nlocal park in London the famous ones are\nbatti Park and Victoria Park both very\nsafe and traffic free as well maybe\ndoing some out and backs maybe be doing\na potential race route or doing a race\nas a long run training run for me I\nspend so much time on straa rout Builder\nworking out where I'm going to go the\ndistances I've got on my plan this week\nand a good route to go through so plan\nout a good route for your long run we'll\ncome on to fueling a little bit later on\nin the video but in terms of planning\nnow do you need to drop some bottles\npotentially along your route where\nyou're going out so you can say nice and\nhydrated do you need to plan some shops\nto potentially stop at are you going to\nneed to find some fountains can you do\nthat EST straa really good at pointing\nwhere fountains are out on your run so\nthink about how you're going to carry\nand transport all of your fuel that you\nneed if our long run the day before our\nlong run we want to be treating the same\nas the day before our race as well so\nwe're going to winning a good\ncarbohydrate heavy meal the evening\nbefore that run the classic some things\nlike pasta some rice some pizza getting\nearlyish to bed and make sure we're nice\nand hydrated as well check the weather\nfor your long run do we need to be\ntaking some extra electrolytes with us\nthe day before if it's going to be\nparticularly hot some sun cream or maybe\nif the weather isn't so good an extra\nlayer to keep warm a waterproof top as\nwell don't get caught out and let the\nweather ruin your long run potentially\nyou want to go out there with some\ncompany as well if you're going out solo\npotentially taking some podcast along\nwith you or some music on your\nheadphones to keep you motivated and\nthey're really good distractions you can\ntick off loads of KS it's another really\ngood idea to start your long run at the\nsame time as your race day run so if\nyou're running London Marathon for\nexample starts at around 10 10:30 can\nyou do your long run starting at the\nsame time maybe not every week but a\nreally good thing to practice and just\ngets your body used to running long at\nthat time of day right coming on to my\nsecond section this is all about pacing\nsuper important to get the right effort\nfor your long run to get the maximum\ntraining benefit now if you follow the\nplan no doubt this will all be laid out\nfor you we design all of our long runs\nin our training plans not only to get\nyou very fit but also provide lots of\nvariety to keep your motivation High and\nthe runs fun and interesting as well so\nhave a think about the structure of your\nlong run it's a really good idea to\nbreak your long run up into blocks of\ndifferent pace sections easy Pace\nmarathon pace maybe half marathon pace\nfor those people training for half\nmarathons my absolute classic marathon\ntraining long run is 5K On 5K off 5K\neasy 5K gold Pace 5K easy 5K gold Pace\nup to 30 35k potentially of that or you\ncould have a faster finish long run\nwhere you maybe do the first half of\nyour long run nice and easy the second\nhalf pick that up to your marathon and\ngoal Pace or a fart Le run where you're\njust adding in some random burst where\nyou can pick up the pace maybe 5 to 10\npickups during your long run again it\njust keeps it interesting just go up to\nmarathon pace half marathon pace a\nlittle burst during the run just when\nyou feel like just picking up the pace\nhaving a bit of fun opening up the legs\na little bit it just means that you're\nfocusing on such a small part of the run\nat any one time you won't get\noverwhelmed by looking at the bigger\npicture of what you've got to do and\nthen also research the paces or the\nheart rate zones that you want to be\nrunning out during your long run I'll\nlink to it down below we've got a\ncompletely free download with a marathon\npacing chart which has all the different\nMarathon goals you could be going for\nand then the paces for each of your\ndifferent types of run there as well so\ngo and check that out and get that\ndownloaded always start off your long\nruns with a few very easy kilometers as\nwell and build into the run this is\nespecially important for older Runners\njust to ease into it those first few\nkilometers should be below the goal Pace\nthat you have for the run and then ease\ninto that pace and they go onto your go\nPace maybe sort of 3K into the Run\nmoving on to have a chat all about\nfueling now so I'd recommend breakfast\nis going to be anywhere from sort of 2\nhours 90 minutes up to really the limit\nis about an hour before because you want\nto get everything settled in your\nstomach it can be a really good idea to\npractice the options that you're going\nto have available on your race day\nduring your training runs as well so\nthere's no point practicing with all of\nyour training runs by having bagels and\nthen get to your race day and think I've\ngot no toaster to toast my bagels or I\ncan't buy Bagels in this country that\nI'm in so practice for the option that\nyou think are going to be available on\nrace day in your training runs the\nClassics for breakfast are things just\nlike as I say Bagels oatmeal and\nporridge cassant musly granola bananas\nand another thing that a lot of people\nforget is hydration so water and\nelectrolytes or maybe a carbohydrate\nsports drink as well so many people Bonk\nor hit the wall not necessarily from\nlack of calories but also lack of\nhydration as well just get very very\ndehydrated so once you're out on those\nruns we want to be taking a gel around\nabout every 30 to 40 minutes\nfigure out what works for you and other\ncouple of little pointers here don't\nworry if you need to stop for a minute\nor two to take on a gel get a bottle\nfrom a bush just to rehydrate properly\nit is so important to be getting these\ncalories getting this hydration on board\nfar more important than it is just to\nmake sure you don't stop during the long\nrun a couple of minutes here and there\nreally isn't going to make any\ndifference you want to be fueling these\nruns to feel strong all the way to the\nend then obviously we want to be\nthinking about how we're going to be\ncarrying our liquids and carrying our\ngels as well for me I'm always taking my\nnaked band my waist belt around my waist\nhere and then in that I can stick in my\ngels for in terms of staying hydrated\nluckily I've got my girlfriend that\ncomes out with me on a bike I don't mind\nstopping a shop every now and then if I\nhave to putting water bottles in bushes\nis another absolute classic that I like\nto do on my long runs as well make sure\nI've got access it's planned out before\nI go so I don't have to worry about it\nonce my run has started a lot of people\nreally like to take a pack with them as\nwell a hydration pack where you can have\nbottles up the front or maybe a\nreservoir bladder in the back of it and\nthen you can just sip on it as you go\nthis is a bit of a weird one because\nmost people won't do that on Race\nbecause they use the hydration available\non the course but it's bit of a weird\none where we have to do it in training\nbut we don't normally do it on race day\na lot of people you just got to get that\nhydration in and that's the simplest and\neasiest way to do it now moving on let's\nhave a chat about Kit everything be\nwearing for our long run you want to\ndedicate a few of your long runs for\nfull dress rehearsals this is shoes\nclothing because we don't want be doing\nanything new on race day including socks\nand pants we want to make sure we'\npractice with all of it so there's no\nsurprises on race day make sure\neverything really works well together as\nwell with absolutely no issues we don't\nwant any chafing any bouncing any\ndiscomfort get some of that good old\nbody Glide in there to stop any chafing\nthis is when you want to iron out any of\nyour issues now what shoes to wear do\nyou want to be doing all of your runs in\nyour race day shoes well weirdly I'd say\nprobably not I like to do some of my\nreally important runs I'm going at\nmarathon pace those practice dress\nrehearsal runs in my race day shoe so at\nthe moment I'm doing those in my\nvaporfly 3s but then some other runs\nthat a bit more chilled long runs I'm\ngoing to be doing those in my comfy\nshoes at the moment that's the super\nblast Tu so just have a think about it\nwhat singlet are you going to be wearing\nwhat t-shirt are you going to be wearing\nwhat waistband are you going to be using\nand how are you going to be carrying\nyour fuels and liquids on your run and\nthen once the run's done you've paed\nyour watch you saved your watch you've\ndone your stra you've done your social\nmedia and everything like that how are\nwe going to recover from our long run\nbecause that's the most important thing\nit's how well we can recover from our\nlong run is how well we're going to\nadapt and become a better runner in the\nfuture so I always like to finish my\nlong run with about 5 to 10 minutes walk\njust to bring that heart rate back down\ngradually doing some post run static\nstretching we've got a follow along\nvideo you can use we'll link to that\ndown below and up here as well and then\nI like to get a good post run recovery\nmeal some good protein some good\ncarbohydrates in there and rehydrate\naround about 30 to 45 minutes about an\nhour after I've run somewhere in that\nsort of window but as soon as I come in\nfrom the door I like to have a recovery\nShake just get some good protein powder\nsome blueberries some cheer seeds things\nlike that into the blender get that all\nready to go and get that down and start\nthat recovery process as soon as\npossible I always like to take a rest\nday after my long run which is what I'm\nsticking to in my current buildup\nMondays for me at the moment are always\nrest days after that Sunday long run and\nthen make some notes after your run as\nwell what went well well what didn't go\nso well what can we tweak for next time\njust have a time of reflection and see\nwhat we can do to improve I know you're\ngoing to be amazing when it comes to\nrace day up next we've got a video all\nabout how to avoid hitting the wall in\nthe marathon so go and check that one\nout to have that perfect Race date which\nI know you're going to have finally\nenjoy your long Runs run with a smile on\nyour face they are tough but it feels\namazing when you get out there and get\nthe runs done properly please check out\nmy website benp parks.com and we'll see\nyou very soon in the next one",

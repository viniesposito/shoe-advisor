  "text": "over the past 6 months I've been buying\nthe best rated running products on\nAmazon to see if they are actually any\ngood I've purchased a real mix of\ndifferent gadgets clothing nutrition\nskin care recovery tools and of course\n100% with my own money there's\nabsolutely nothing here sponsored I've\nbeen testing all of these things out\nreally really vigorously to see if\nthey're going to improve my running or\nit all be one big disappointment and\nwaste of money right starting out guys I\nbought a couple of pairs of balaga socks\nthe best rated socks I could find on\nAmazon they were really comfortable\ndurable still going strong I've done\nprobably a good couple hundred K in\nthese socks and they show absolutely no\nsigns of giving up yet no holes or\nanything like that in terms of the cons\nthey are a little bit expensive Amazon\npricing is always a little bit all over\nthe place different sizes of different\nprices they are really quite thick as\nwell I think if you do run in a slightly\nhotter climate you are going to struggle\nthese are not going to be the most\nbreathable socks and in terms of my\nrating I would give these a 4.8 as well\nmoving on to energy gels to help with\nthose all important long runs and\nmarathon training I bought these CIS\nisotonic energy drills you get this\nvariety pack in a box loads of different\nflavors 22 G of carb in sport and vegan\nas well but I've been using CIS gels for\na very long time and what I really\nreally like about them is you don't need\nany water with these they're really\nreally liquidy and where I've always\nreally like to use these like on the\nstart line of races where you might not\nhave some water around as well really\nnice flavors so if you're the kind of\nperson that suffers with maybe some like\nFlavor fatigue you got loads of\ndifferent options here that you can have\non your run and also coming at just\nabout a pound of gel so something like\nMorton which is sort of a bit of the\nmarket leader you only about3 of gel in\nterms of the negatives of the cyst gels\nthey are a little bit on the large side\nas well and quite heavy for gels and\nthey can just get a little bit messy\nthey're a little bit hard to open and\nthese pull tabs do sort of come off and\nthen normally they fall on the floor\nwhich isn't really great as well but for\nsomeone trying GS for the first time I\nalways really recommend to a lot of\npeople start out with something like\ncyst gels they're really good on the\nstomach they've never given me any\nissues for me i' give these four stars\npersonally yeah they're not going to be\nthe best gels out there in the world but\nfor the value you're getting for these\nthey really are fantastic next up on the\nlist is one of the most oddest looking\nthings can you guess what this is yet a\nlot of you guys recommended this during\nthe winter and I thought I had to get\nthis in now to make it for this video so\nthis is what's called a shoe dryer\nreally good for any homes a bit like\nours without any sort of warm rooms so\nsomething like this can be really good\njust to get your shoes dry when you've\nwashed them or you've been out in the\npouring wind and rain down with rain\nGuys these shoes are welling through the\ndrenched so let's get back home and's\nsee how long it takes them to dry and\nafter I came in after this run the shoes\ntook about 40 minutes on here to be\ncompletely bone dry there basically like\nsome heating elements in the bottom here\nand a little fan inside here and then it\nblows hot air out these things here so\nyou rest your shoes on on there and it\njust basically just very simply blows\nhot air out into the shoes to help dry\nthem a little bit like a hair dryer I\nsuppose but nowhere near as hot as a\nhaird dryer and yeah overall it worked\nreally well I was quite surprised I\nwasn't expecting much in the depths of\nwinter when I'll be using this sort of\nthing a lot more in terms of the\nnegatives it was surprisingly loud if\nyou live in a small place it might be a\nlittle bit annoying so yeah I'd give\nthat four four stars to me now following\non from that when I was cleaning my\nshoes I was using this the boot buddy\nmaybe one of the most famous things to\nhave been on a program called Dragon Den\nin the UK Americans call this shark tank\nfill it full of soapy lukewarm water\nclean your shoes get all that muck off\nthem and then you've also got a scraper\nhere on the back as well just to get any\nsort of nasty or really dried on bits on\nthere as well in terms of what I really\nlike about it it did the job well it\ncleaned my shoes it got rid of dried mud\nor fresh wet stuff as well easy to use\nsuper portable if you're going out to\nthe trails you can just take some water\nwith you clean your shoes before you get\nback in the car in terms of what wasn't\nvery good about it it does run out of\nwater quite quickly a lot of water does\ncome out here so it needs refilling a\nlittle bit but one of these will\nprobably did one shoe for me so I need\nto refill it once to do two shoes if you\nhave got quite small hands it might not\nbe the easiest thing to grip I've got\nquite big hands so that's what it looks\nlike on there in terms of my rating 4\nand a half stars for this only sort of\nslightly let down because for me I'd\nlike a little bit of a bigger reservoir\non it next up I bought some Cal sleeves\ncompression for your calf muscles\nbasically supporting your muscles when\nyou're out there doing activity helping\nincrease blood flow and your recovery\nARS as well the thing with compression\ntechnology it could will be a little bit\nup here in the head but I just basically\nlike to put these on when I'm out on the\ntrip Trails it keeps my legs a little\nbit cleaner stops any sort of brambles\nand Stingers just nasty things when you\nget out on the trails it just helps look\nafter my legs a little bit better so in\nterms of what I liked about these they\nwere just great they were comfortable\nthey were fine the compressed Spore and\n2xu like the flagship ones are going to\nbe about 3540 a pairs these are so much\ncheaper and they did pretty much the\nsame thing I didn't personally notice\nany difference at all in terms of the\nwhat negatives these aren't as nice of\nmaterials as those High Flagship ones\nbut essentially they're all doing the\nsame job so yeah four stars for me\nmoving on we have this rather rather\nNatty invention here bit like a sort of\na sports bra really essentially what\nthis is is for carrying around your\nphone in here in this sort of pouch here\nyou can also put a few little valy boys\nand your car keys up in here this is an\niPhone 14 like the normal size and you\ncan just sort of Chuck that in there\nalong with your house keys or whatever\nand some other little valuables and then\ngo for a run and it works quite well\nstops everything bouncing around I do\nsee quite a lot of people running around\nLondon in these type of things since\nI've always been curious to get one in\nand just see how it feels it's a really\ngood option if you don't know the person\nthat doesn't like an armband or you\ndon't want anything around your waist or\nyou don't want a big sort of pack in\nterms of what I didn't like about it\nit's just not my sort of style if I'm\nbeing perfectly honest and it just seems\nlike a lot of material and faf just for\nbasically carrying your phone which I\nreally personally rather do in my\nrunning belt and that works absolutely\nfine not really the kind of thing I'm\ngoing to ever be using again and keeping\nin my rotation but yeah not to knock it\nat all but I would personally give it\nthree stars now longer term viewers of\nthe channel know my favorite way of\ncarrying my phone and my valuables is\nwith something called a naked band and\nthat just goes around your waist and you\ncan really good carry poles you get\nloads of stuff in there it's fantastic\nbut a kit but they don't sell that on\nAmazon so I can't be reviewing that here\nbut what they do sell on Amazon is\nprobably the best selling belt in the\nworld which is something called a flip\nbelt very sort of similar style of thing\nand I've really been enjoying using this\none here can stick my phone in the back\nhere again some valuable in there as\nwell my keys on this really handy little\nclip that keeps them nice safe and\nsecure in terms of what you really like\nabout this thing super comfortable got\nlots of different colors as well I just\nwent for the plain black easily holds my\niPhone 14 in here and I can you can also\nadd some gels in there as well and it\ndoesn't bounce around at all what I\ndon't like about it it would be nice to\nhave a bit of a security pocket here\nwith a zip but I never had any issues\nwith my keys just on there but stuff can\npotentially fall out I didn't lose\nanything myself but some of the\nreviewers did mention that yeah a little\nbit on the pricey side but really good\nquality product in here I'd give this\n4.3 out of five right moving on to some\nnutrition products I bought this massive\nthing of vegan protein powder 20 g of\nprotein I'm actually on my second packet\nhere now you can get it in chocolate or\nvanilla flavor 100% of vitamin D B12 and\nB6 as well and you get loads of other\nquantities of zinc and magnesium and\niron fruits and vitamins in there as\nwell as the protein that you need taste\nokay probably the best tasting vegan\nprotein as a dedicated protein shake\nthat I've been able to ever find Blends\nokay too it's got no nasty additives in\nthere and it isn't too sweet it isn't\nsickly sweet and it also doesn't really\ntaste too artificial as we also quite\nnice packaging quite cool packaging and\nand you can request it without a scoop\nbecause we've all got Scoops in our\nhouses already and they'll also plant a\ntree for you if you message them after\nyou bought it they will actually plant a\ntree which is a nice little Eco tip\nthere it does get a little bit thick and\ngritty it doesn't have many carbs in\nhere so if you're looking for a\ndedicated recovery Shake there something\nlike cyrio will be better just got a bit\nmore carbs in there so this isn't going\nto be replacing my cyrio but it's just a\nnice little extra thing if I feel like I\nneed an extra protein boost during the\nday so yeah keep this into my rotation\nas I said I've finished the vanilla one\nthat was great Chuck one enjoying that\none as well in terms of my rating we'll\ngive that four and a half Stars right\nsticking with the nutrition theme is\nTailwind you bought a load of these\nstick packs and I've been using them so\nmuch this year to get ready for a big\ncycle race I did a few months ago so\nwhen I've been doing a training on my\nbike I've been using the tail wind\nproducts for that and been feeling\nreally good by using them Tailwind say\nthat this is all you're going to need so\nyou can get all of your sugar salts and\nminerals you're not going to need to\ntakeing any other types of fuel or\ncarbohydrate I don't really agree with\nthat we'll come on to that in a minute\nin my own testing of it what I really\nliked about it very very mild flavor\nit's not overpowering it's really\ndrinkable even when I was feeling rough\nat the end of some of my cycles and some\nof the runs I was doing I could always\nget this down so that was a really sort\nof big positive very easy to drink lots\nof different flavor options you get\nincaffeinated or non-caffeinated as well\nand I've really seen a really good\nImprovement in how long I can last on\nthe bik done plenty of 100 mile rides in\nthe flat here on Swift and 100 mile\nrides outside as well I've definitely\nseen a really big Improvement in how\nlong I can go for and just feeling\nbetter for a little bit longer during my\nCycles as well the stick packs of these\nare really convenient you can put them\nin the back and when you are out in the\nrun just having these in your pack is\nreally convenient as well in terms of\nthe negatives of these the packs are\nreally quite to open they are really\nfiddly and I struggled pretty much every\ntime trying to get into these things I\njust still felt in during my running\npart of this I ran a 50 mile race a few\nweeks ago with these I still need to top\nup with other things but from a cycling\npoint of view these were absolutely\nfantastic in terms of my rating I'm\ngoing to give it like a five for cycling\nfor me but in terms of running it was\nabout a three next up we've got one of\nmy absolute favorites but as I had to\nstock up in the last few months on my\nbody Glide I thought why not including\nthis review because I love this stuff\nit's stops me chafing it's basically\nthis sort of almost like a roll on\ndeodorant type thing you can put it\nbetween your legs by your arms anywhere\nwhere you're going to have some skin on\nskin contact to stop that dreaded\nchafing and potentially ruining your\nruns I've been using this for absolutely\nyears and it's just an absolute staple\nin my running routine in terms of what I\nlike it just works if you put this on\nyou're not going to get any chafing and\nit doesn't really smell of anything at\nall it's really portable easy\napplication and no mess at all in terms\nof what I don't like like about it\nabsolutely nothing really I guess they\ncould have some more eco-friendly not\nplastic packaging but that's about it\nfive stars for me next up guys is my\naftershocks headphones now technically I\nbought these about 3 years ago people\nalways ask me what headphones to use so\nI thought I'd sneak them in because I\nbought these on Amazon or bit about 3\nyears ago these are basically bone\nconducting headphones you can usually\nuse these in races because you can hear\neverything that's going around you\nthere's a really good safety aspect to\nthe headphones if you're running around\na big city near Cod battery life is\nreally good I'm still getting at least 8\nhours out of these headphones really\ngood sound quality so long as you're\nlistening to podcast or audiobook spoken\nword stuff sounds really good through\nthis and music isn't great you know\ndedicated proper headphones in your ear\nwill be much better for music and these\nare an absolute staple in my running\nroutine I basically can't really go for\na run without these I absolutely go\neverywhere with them in ter what I don't\nlike about them you can only really use\nthem for running if you're going to be\nusing these for commuting or any sort of\nnoisy eras you're not going to hear\nanything that's going on mod and areas\nyou're going to be absolutely fine noisy\nareas you can't hear anything and the\nonly other negative I can really think\nof is they have their own dedicated\nlight I think it's called proprietary\ntype cable which if you lose it or you\nforget it you're not going to be able to\ncharge it I'd really love it if\nsomething like this was USBC but it's\nonly a minor sort of setback overall 4.8\nI'll give that it's just annoy it annoys\nme with the stupid charging cable moving\non to some more nutrition stuff now\npeople are often asking me if I could\nrecommend any like snacks and things to\nhave on the go and this is about the\nbest sort of thing I can find find naked\nbars I think they're a British company\nactually fruit and nut bars basically in\nthe states and you can get them in the\nUK if you got a whole food and things\nyou get Lara bars well this is probably\nsomething about the most equivalent to\nsomething like that 100% natural\ningredients no added sugar raw cold\npress available in most big supermarkets\nthey are quite cheap on Amazon and you\ncan buy them in these big boxes I think\nit's 18 bars in a box my personal\nfavorite was the lemon I just love lemon\nstuff anyway in terms of what I like\nabout it reasonably cheap I paid \u00a313 a\nbox of 18 bars and you get loads of\ndifferent flavor options and it's just\nsuper convenient when traveling they\ndon't make any mess but in terms of what\nthey look like it's basically just like\nthat and if you bite into it there's\nnothing that falls down so it's quite\ngood to have in the car if you're going\nsomewhere in terms of the ingredients\nlist all that's got in this one is dates\nraisin almonds coconut cashews lemon and\na h hint of natural flavorings and\nthat's not too bad some not you get some\nlong massive ingredients and they're\njust a good thing to have in the store\ncupboard if you ever get a little bit\npackage in terms of the negatives\nbecause they're sort of like natural\nfruit then the sugars are in them a\nlittle bit high if you're someone that\nhas some sugar problems then maybe steer\na little bit clear of something like\nthis so for me 4 and 1 half Stars\nthey're just a little bit on the small\nside and I only end up eating two at a\ntime right next up is this thing it is\nincredibly heavy but basically this is\ncalled a slant board and I bought this a\nwhile ago to really help with my ankle\nstrength cuz some of you might know I\nbroke my ankle in a skateboarding\naccident about 4 years ago go now I'm\nreally always working on my ankle dors\ndeflection to really try and improve\nthat range of motion have a bit really\nbig disparity between my good foot and\nmy bad foot and also using it to stretch\nout my carve stretch out my CES you can\nadjust it to all sorts of different\nheights there's loads of slant boards\naround this is definitely on the premium\nside of things in terms of build quality\nbut solid metal really good grip you get\non here as well it's like sandpaper type\nthing but it feels really nice just in\nbare feet as well you can definitely get\nsomething a little bit more on the\ncheaper side and I've seen really good\nimprovements with my ankle range of\nmotion if I just test it out and then go\non this for a few minutes and then test\nit again it really does help improve\nthat in terms of negatives but this one\nin particular it's very very heavy\nyou're not really going to transport\nthis around too easily so what would I\ngive this definitely five out of five\nnext up is this some sun cream from a\ncompany called life jacket as some of\nyou guys know I ran the Boston Marathon\nthis year I can't put any of that\nfootage up on the screen cuz Boston and\nMarathon will not like that but during\nthe race I got quite badly sunburnt\nbecause I was really stupid I'm normally\nso conscious of looking after my skin\nbut it just didn't feel that hot that\nday I just forgot about it and got badly\nsome got some heat stroke it's a real\nissue and after the race I did a lot of\nresearch and stumbled across this and I\nthought this would be really good and\nI've been putting into my rotation for\ngoing out on the hotter days in terms of\nwhat I really liked about it it just\ngoes on really well it's not really\ngreasy it doesn't leave any white marks\nand when you get super sweaty on your\nlong runs and things it doesn't really\nmatter it just all sort of rubs in\nreally quite nicely and really like the\ncompany and what they stand for it SED\nby three guys one of them unfortunately\ngot skin cancer and they started this\ncompany so where we're checking out some\nof these smaller companies selling their\nproducts on Amazon so they only make one\nwhich is Factor 50 plus it is a little\nbit expensive but \u00a320 that's going to be\na whole year of suncream for me the\nrating on Amazon gives 4.3 I think it's\nprobably a bit higher than that for me\npersonally so yeah 4.8 for this moving\non I bought another foot roller because\nI lost my beloved roll recovery R3 I\nwent on Amazon searched for foot rollers\nand this was available on same day\ndelivery which is super convenient one\nof the perks of living in central London\nso it's really good for rolling out the\nunderside of your feet keep plant our\nfasciitis at Bay rolling your feet on\nthese little nodules here it just helps\nmassage that fascia sort of stretch it\nout a little bit I really like this\nmiddle section they have in the middle\nit sort of raises up in the middle you\nget some really good angles going on\nunderneath your foot it's super\nlightweight hardly anything at all so\nreally good for traveling around and the\nspikes in this one particular one aren't\ntoo harsh Sarah has an orange one under\nher desk but it's really really severe\nin terms of what I didn't like about it\nit does just feel very cheaply made it\ndoes pick up a little bit of dust and\nthings like that but it got the job done\nI give that four out of five now if you\nwant to know what the best rated running\nshoe on Amazon is then that video is\ncoming up so go and check that out so I\nhope you enjoyed the video guys I've\nreally enjoyed putting this video\ntogether testing out these products and\nbringing that completely impartial\nhonest review as we always do on the\nchannel keep on working hard guys keep\ndone we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

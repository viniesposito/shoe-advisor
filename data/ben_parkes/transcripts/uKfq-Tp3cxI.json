  "text": "I've had the aex super Blast 2 for just\nover 2 and 1/2 months now and I've\nthrown so much at them speed sessions\neasy runs races and I've clocked up over\n350 testing miles in this shoe so I'm\nsure you really want to know how they\nare holding up I gave this shoe a pretty\nglowing review when it first came out\nbut a lot can change did I maybe get it\na bit wrong because I've tested a lot of\nother shoes things so maybe I found\nsomething better because today we're not\nonly going to talk about the super blast\nbut also four Alternatives if you are\nstruggling to buy this shoe at the\nmoment so let me know have you managed\nto get a hold of a pair of the coveted\nsuper Blast 2 and what do you think of\nit let me know down in the comments for\nnow I'm going to get stuck in to the\nreview and starting out as always with\nthe facts and figures so the purpose of\nthe super Blast 2 this is a long\ndistance mileage monster of a shoe a\nnon-plated racing shoe potential perfect\nfor 10ks half marathons marathons and\neven longer but definitely the kind of\nshoe you're going to want to keep on the\nroad pricewise coming in around about\n\u00a3200 stack height we're talking about 45\nmil stack at the back of the shoe 8 mm\ndrop overall this shoe is coming in at\n288 G 10.2 o for me in my UK size 11 1/2\nin this shoe that is super lightweight\njust holding it here in the hand you\nalmost can't believe a shoe of this\namount of volume with this much stack\nheight weighs so little this is a\nneutral shoe midso wise we've got the FF\nturbo plus this is the same foam that\nasex put in their highest end races and\nat the bottom of the shoe it has a layer\nof the FF blast Eco midso just for a\nlittle bit of extra wear and tear\nability just to prolong the life of the\nshoe outside wise on the bottom we've\ngot aex grip here this is the same type\nof material that they put on some of\ntheir trailer shoes as well so a really\ngood update was one of the big updates\nfor version two different widths\navailable sadly not just the one here\nbut it's pretty good on the width side\nthere are no dedicated men's and women's\nversions and finally this was not true\nto size for me I had to go half a size\ndown exactly the same thing as I did in\nversion one of the super blast right\nlet's get stuck into my likes so my\nfirst like with the super Blast 2 is the\nsheer versatility it really is the type\nof shoe you could take away on holiday\nor traveling and you could just take one\nshoe with you I've done speed sessions\nwhen I've been away I've done easy runs\njust when I've only been able to take\none shoe I also ran erasing it the big\nhalf handled it so well picking up the\npace in the second half cruising along\nat around about 345 350 a pace handles\nthat kind of pace so so well and it's\nalso really stable at all different\nPaces as well the updated phone they've\ngot here is just a little bit more Poppy\nand responsive than the outgoing one and\nit's just that perfect balance from a\nshoe that can Cruise along so nicely and\nthen give you that sudden turn of speed\nit's just a real sleeper shoe that you\ndon't expect to be able to go so fast my\nsecond like is the comfort of the shoe\nthis is the shoe I've been reaching\nabout about 90% of the time when I\nhaven't been testing out other shoes\nI've done loads of long runs 32 34 and\n36k long runs in this very shoe here\ngetting ready for my next marathon it's\nfelt super strong all the way through\nthose runs the shoe really looks after\nthose legs so nicely on those long runs\nand the foam has really felt good from\nthe start of the run the middle of the\nrun and the end of the Run haven't felt\nit sort of wearing and tearing and\nfeeling different as the runs have gone\non my third like is this shoe is just a\nlittle bit faster than it really\ndeserves to be mainly because it is so\nlightweight it's amazing how light this\nshoe is for that 44 mil stack heide in\nthe shoe when you really want to pick up\nthe pace you can as I said I ran the big\nhalf in the shoe and it just coped with\nit so so well I was just dealing with a\nfew little issues at the time I just\nwanted to put something that was\nDependable going to get me through have\na really good solid run this shoe really\ndelivered there for sure a carbon plated\nracing shoe is going to be faster than\nthis but there's nothing that's quite as\ncomfortable for around about 85 90% of\nthe speed that the shoe can produce and\nthen finally I want to have a chat all\nabout the durability of the shoe what\nit's been like over the 350 miles we've\nput in it it's probably around about\nhalfway through its really good life now\nI think you can get about 700 mil of\ngood solid training in the shoe before\nyou're really going to start to see it\ntear off the wear on the new out soole\nis really impressive I land slightly on\nthe outside of my foot and roll in which\nis fairly standard yes of course it's\nwearing down a little a little bit there\nbut it's holding up a lot better than I\nexpect again for something that is super\nlightweight and here in the footage you\ncan see I've got a brand new shoe on my\nleft foot and my used and abused shoe on\nmy right foot and I really I can tell\nthe difference between the two but it is\nvery very minimal over the course of\nthese 350 Mi this phone really has not\ndegraded an awful lot at all and yeah as\nI say it's got plenty of life left in it\nas you would hope it would do for a 200b\nshoe but of course it's not all smiles\nwith a super L lo as you guys know here\non the channel I'll give you my likes\nand all of my dislikes as well because\nwe buy all these shoes 100% with my own\nmoney to give you those completely\nhonest impartial reviews so the first\ndislike it's just still really hard to\nget a hold of they have just dropped a\nnew colorway that sold out pretty much\nin the first day it came out I did\nmanage to get hold repair so thank you\nto a lot of you guys that sent me\nmessages saying going buy a pair now and\nyeah it went very very quickly my second\ndislike it is just a little bit on the\nfirm side for me I quite like that but\nit's not really great at that sort of\nrecovery or lower end of your easy Paces\nhere if you're going out for that second\nrun of the day or you just want to go\nout and let the legs recover you might\nwant to get something a little bit\nsofter for your recovery runs and some\npeople also might want something a\nlittle bit softer for those super long\nruns if you're going out for three or 4\nhours maybe training for Ultras and\nthings like that you might just want\nsomething a little bit softer a little\nbit more forgiving for me I quite like\nthe firm side so it's not really\nnegative for me but it's something I\nwant to let you guys guys know and then\nfinally the price yes this is a super\nexpensive shoe but with the supply and\ndemand they could probably charge \u00a3300\nfor the shoe and it would still sell out\nit is just that good it's just one of\nthose unfortunate things high price\npoint and scarcity as well if you can't\nget hold of the shoe you are struggling\nbut you'd like a really good shoe for\nyour long run SP now we're going to have\na chat about all of the best\nAlternatives so because the super blast\nshoe is so hard to get hold of people\nare always sending me messages saying\nwell what else can I buy because I can't\nfind it but I've just got to be honest\nwith you guys there is nothing quite\nlike the super blast this really is a\nunicorn shoe it's very very unique no\none makes anything quite like it which\nis probably why it's been so successful\nso I've put together a list of four\nshoes none of these are that similar to\nthis I've got to be honest but they're\nall really good long run shoes which is\nwhere this superl 2 really excels so\nstarting out we want to have a chat\nabout the mauno Neo Vista shoe here now\nthe Neo Vista is a little bit softer and\na little less reactive than the super\nblast and it has a very different upper\nto the shoe this booty upper giving you\na nice snug lock down plus it does use a\nlittle bit more of a basic EVA foam\nwhereas the super blast has that peber\nbased foam and it also has at the bottom\nof the shoe this nylon plate of repello\nalong so as you're seeing I have quite a\nfew differences between this and the\nsuper blast but the Comfort levels are\nhigh on the super blast the Comfort\nlevels also very high on the Neo Vista\nas well and it's significantly cheaper\nthis shoe com com in around about \u00a3 150\nso a really good saving there both very\ngood long run options but for me you can\njust Cruise along a little bit better in\nthe super blast it's just much nicer\nthrough the footstrike No Doubt the near\nVista is going to be one of the\nHighlight shoes of the year it's very\nvery good and at this price point it's\nabsolutely fantastic as well so a really\ngood solid long run option to consider\nmoving on we're going to have a chat\nabout the hoker skywood X now I've only\njust got this shoe in started to do some\nearly testing the shoe again we'll put\nall the facts and figures up on the\nscreen the hooker shoe is absolutely\ncrazy 48 mm stack height I've never run\nin a shoe quite like that this is a lot\nmore cushioned softer bouncier just\nincredibly bouncy in fact the super\nblast is a lot stiffer firmer and it\nreally does pick up the pace a little\nbit better as well there's a big weight\ndifference the trouble with the skyex it\nis incredibly heavy and because of that\nit just doesn't have that pace range\nthat the super blast does there is a\ncarbon plate in the bottom of the skyex\nas well and so many shoes have these\ncarbon plates they're putting carbon\nplates in shoes like this not for all\nout speed but for stability because\nthese Foams are so soft and squidgy so\nreally like this shoe is really quite\nfirm so if you like potentially like the\nride of the super blast and that sort of\nfirmness you're going to get some good\nfirm stiffness here but then this sort\nof this direction the shock absorption\nthis is where the skyex really comes\ninto its own at your easy pace and\nrecovery Pace the Skyward X is a really\ngreat option I'm going to have my full\nreview coming soon so if you want to go\nand do some really nice recovery runs\nsomething to really look after your legs\non very very long runs I'll say this\nshoe is going to be better than the\nsuper blast but the super blast is just\nfar excels at those faster Paces\nsomething like the Skyward really just\nfor those easy recovery run Paces it's\ngoing to look after your legs very very\nwell right moving on to a shoe I don't\nactually have anymore so I'm going to\npretend I'm holding it here but it's a\nshoe I had earlier in this year which is\nthe super blast is baby brother the Nova\nblast 4 which yeah you can save a\nsignificant amount of money going for\nsomething like the Nova blast 4 it\ndoesn't have the carbon plate in the\nshoe doesn't have any plates in the shoe\njust a nice good stack of foam it's it's\naix's all around shoe just a good daily\noption for sure the super blast is going\nto be a lot quicker it's a lot more\nresponsive less bouncy better suited for\nthose longer runs as well but if you're\nhappier with a slightly softer ride that\nthe Nova blast gives and you're not\ngoing super long or not going on too\nmany long runs then the Nova blast would\nwork just as well for a lot of you guys\nout there if the super blast wasn't\naround I would definitely be spending a\nlot more time or I'd have bought another\npair of the Nova blast 4 after I wore my\npair out earlier on this year finally\nthe final show I want to have a chat\nabout is the New Balance SC Trainer\nversion 3 which I've really been\nenjoying putting some miles here the S\ntrainer version 3 it's such a different\nfeeling a different ride compared to the\nsuperlast the foam is so sof and you\nreally sort of sink into it it doesn't\nhave the most poppy doesn't have the\nbest energy return in the shoe again\nyou've got a carbon plate running\nthroughout the shoe here similar to the\nskywood x that plate is more for\nstability rather than speed and the\nsuper blast as I say it's a lot firmer a\nlot more responsive and that foam is so\nfirm it doesn't need a plate in there so\nthe SC Trainer is far more suited for\nthose easy runs those recovery runs that\nslower Pace running again to really look\nafter your legs with all that squish\nthat plushness on those long runs\nwhereas the firmness in the super blast\njust me it has more Pace uses really you\ncan just pick up the pace a little bit\nbetter in a few weeks time hopefully if\nthe rumors are true Nike will be\nreleasing the Invincible version 4 we\nwill get that in to review and that is\ngoing to be another big potential\ncompetitor so to bring that to a\nconclusion a lot of you guys probably\nthink well what should I buy if I can't\nget this and it's really hard for me to\nsit here and say this one is the most\nsimilar because they're really not that\nsimilar there is nothing quite like the\nride and the fear and the lightness and\nthe nimbleness and responsive of the\nsuperl if it was me and this didn't\nexist this wasn't in the world I'd\nprobably be running most of my runs in\nsomething like the Nova blast 4\ncombining that with a carbon plated\nratio for my speed session something\nlike the vaporfly which is what I've\nbeen doing a lot of my speed session in\nthis summer and then yeah some of my\neasier longer runs in this you know the\nthe SC Trainer that's probably the one I\nwould be going for out of all of these\nso far I have to be building a bit of a\nrotation because this just covers so\nmany different types of runs and that's\nwhy it's that beautiful doit all\ntraining shoe that you can travel with\nput in your bag and just do so much in\nit it's an amazing shoe probably the\nbest shoe I've ever run in quite frankly\nso there are my final thoughts let me\nknow your thoughts down in the comments\nbelow I hope you've enjoyed this video\nthat's it guys keep on working hard keep\ndone and we'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

  "text": "this is the Nike Pegasus plus the daily\ntraining shoe I have been super excited\nfor I've been testing this all week over\nloads of different types of runs and I'm\nhere to give you my 100% honest thoughts\nbut first before we get stuck into it\nlet's take a little trip down memory\nlane in 2018 Nike came out with one of\nthe best ever shoes in my opinion the\nNike Pegasus turbo which is this one\nhere this is actually my girlfriend shoe\nbut this was one of the first ever Super\nShoe trainers that the world had ever\nseen there was a huge marketing campaign\nbehind it all the influencers had it and\nit really was one of those shoes that\ndefinitely lived up to the height\nthousands of Runners myself included say\nit was one of the very best ever shoes\nout there a year later they stripped it\nall out released version two a even\nlighter weighted version I absolutely\nloved it and then it's fair to say after\nthat Nike went a little bit off the\nrails and they released the turbo next\nnature in 2022 which is really\ndisappointing subpar zoomx Foams all\nthat recycled stuff glued together heavy\nand narrow but now fast forward and Nike\nare back with this the Pegasus Plus or\nmaybe the turbo 4 as they have on the\nbottom bizarrely so will this give me\nthe same spring of my step as the OG did\nor will it be another let down well\nfirstly let's dive into the facts and\nfigures and of course before we start I\nbought the shoe 100% with my own money\nto give you that completely honest 100%\nimpartial review right let's get stuck\ninto the facts and figures so the\npurpose of a shoe like the new Pegasus\nplus is a road running daily trainer\nthis sent me back\n\u00a365 but \u20ac180 we'll put all of the\ndifferent currencies up on the screen\nnow 36 mm stack height and a 10 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise this is coming at\n313 G for me in my UK size 12 so yeah on\nthe lighter side as we go another tick\nthere from Nike we'll talk about all of\nmy likes and dislikes coming up in terms\nof the upper we've got this lovely fly\nknit upper here mids salt we've got\nNike's F length Zoom X foam this is\nNike's premium foam that you get their\nVapor Flies their Alpha flies their\nFillon race shoes nothing recycled no\ncarrier Foams here we got a ful length\nzoomx there's no plate in this shoe the\noutside we've got these two patches of\nthe hban rubber out soole it has a weird\ncutout in the middle I really can't work\nout why they've done this other than to\nsave weight but now you've got some\nexposed zumex mids here which I just\nthink if you're going to be taking this\nshow Offroad in any way on that's going\nto get a bit bashed so this is really a\nroad running shoe only and as I\nmentioned at the start of the video it\nsays Pegasus turbo on the bottom of the\nshoe here and on the top Nike Pegasus\nplus I guess there's just been a little\nbit of misunderstanding between the two\ndepartments at Nike over what they're\ncalling it Nike got a lot of changes\ngoing on in their running department at\nthe moment to try and sort of bring a\nlot of life back into to their running\nshoes so I hope you we see that as we're\nseeing with this Pegasus plus there are\nno different widths available there are\nmen and women's different size available\nand this was pretty much true to size\nfor me if you're a little bit unsure\nmaybe go half a size down I got this in\nmy UK size 12 they were just maybe a\nvery tiny little bit too big I had 12 in\nversion one 11 and 1/2 in version 2 and\nI think I really if I was going to get\nanother one I would get an 11 and a half\nin this half a size down but it was\nreally okay if you're on the fence go\nhalf a size down right let's have a\nquick chat about the Pegasus 41 and the\nPegasus plus so the Pegasus 41 has\nNike's react X foone this is a little\nbit more on the heavy side 347 G versus\n313 G in the plus version these are also\n35 more expensive the Pegasus \u00a341 \u00a3130\nthe sizing may be very very slightly\ndifferent these were really good true to\nsize to me as I said maybe half a size\ndown would have be better for the in\nthese ones also the Pegasus 41 has the\nAir Zoom pods up at the front here\nadding that little bit of extra\npropulsion they've gone from the plus\nversion to make it a lot lighter and the\nNike X foam is far more responsive the\nplus version of the shoe is just a more\npremium option it's lighter weight it's\ngot better foam more responsive foam it\njust feels better quality but the 41 is\nstill an okay daily shoe as it goes\nwe'll link to the review up here and\ndown in the comments as well they are\nmuch better all around sort of daily\ntraining shoe definitely in the Pegasus\nplus but let's chat about all of my\nlikes and then we'll chat about the\ndislikes afterwards my first one being\nthis is just a great daily shoe it's\nsuper versatile it's handled everything\nI've thrown at it it's that perfect\nbalance between the Invincible and the\nstreak fly the Invincible being that\nvery plush that very chunky Sho perfect\nfor your easy runs and Recovery runs the\nstreet fly being that very lightweight\nshoe perfect for Speed workor and this\njust sits so nicely in between a shoe\nthat can do speed work easy Pace work\nTempo and also recovery runs pretty well\nmy second like is this is a really fun\nfoam we've been big fans of the zoom X\nfoam here on the channel for many many\nyears and it's a really good option for\nsomeone that wants to get out their runs\nbut doesn't want a plate in their shoe\nso maybe if you are a super blast fan\nfor example you don't like running with\na plate in your shoe all the time this\nis going to really bring that fun factor\ninto your running there's so many high\nstack height shoes out there at the\nmoment this is a fun lower stack height\noption for people that want a little bit\nmore ground feel with their running more\nof a traditional feeling very very\nsimilar to how the OG Nike Pegasus turbo\nwas when that was released when picking\nup the speed it's got some really good\nlevel of responsiveness and it's got no\nproblem maintaining that speed as well I\ndid a very long run session in the shoe\nwhich is some of the footage you can see\nfrom the screen now this is me running\nat about 340 a pace just cruising along\nat some 10 minute reps here felt super\ncomfortable throughout the whole rep and\nit's also really nice to get a little\nbit more ground feeling in your running\nshoe rotation to help with that Pro\nreception my third like with this shoe\nis just a great looking shoe it feels\ngreat on the feet it just brings a good\nsmile to your face you look down you see\nthe stripe going down the bottom of the\nshoe and I know it doesn't make any\ndifference but anyway let me know what\nyou think of all the different colorways\nwhat colorway option would you like I\nreally like the flare at the back here\nthe way it sort of tap is off because\nthe everybody was having issues with the\nfirst two shoes with the way it would\nsplit at the back here so yeah this is\nwhat they had on the nature version kind\nof Turbo version 3 and I really like how\nthat sort of flared at the back just a\ngood all around good looking shoe and my\nfinal like here is the breathable upper\nand which really gives a really good\nsolid lock down there's no gusseted\ntongue here but it's held in place by\nthe laces absolutely fine all around\ngood Comfort pretty good width on the\nshoe here it's a shame there aren't some\nwider width options available but Nike\naren't really one for doing that type of\nthing that some of other brands like\nBrooks and hoker are really good with\nbut unless you've got a seriously wide\nfoot you're going to be absolutely fine\nin the shoe right let's have a chat\nabout the dislikes now the first thing\nI'm just going to say here this could be\na positive could be a negative it really\ndepends what sort of Camp you're in so\nagain let me know down in the comments\nit is certainly a little bit firmer than\nyou would expect for say like a 2024\nrelease of shoe but it is certainly a\nvery similar feeling to the original\nshoe me sort of thinking back all of\nthose years ago and everybody holds this\nshoe in such high esteem one of the best\never shoes of all time and it's true\nlots of shoes have moved on technolog\nhas moved on Foams have moved on plates\nhave moved on the world is a very\ndifferent place as it now as it was in\nsort of 2018 2019 a couple of years ago\nI actually bought some turbo on EB I was\nsurprised just how different they were\nfrom the shoes I was running in the\ncurrent times so yes this is a really\nsort of true feel to the original shoe\nit's hard to say whether that's a\npositive or negative for some people\nlooking for a firmer lower stack ride\nit's really great and you will really\nlove this and I personally really do\nlike it but please don't think Nike\nrevolutionized this shoe to expect a\nsuper super super responsive very high\nplush shoe something like the super\nblast or sort of a very plush soft Ride\nLike the rebel version 4 it's not like\nthat it's got this really good section\nof the market and I'm really pleased\nNike kept true to those original\nfeelings with the shoe with the pricing\nit's a really difficult one what do you\nthink \u00a3165 for this shoe plenty of\npeople saying it's overpriced it's\nactually the same price as version one\nand version two which when you count for\ninflation over all these years would\nmake this significantly cheaper now in\nmy opinion in the current range of shoe\nit's probably around about \u00a310 too\nexpensive it puts it into the realm of\nall sort of the lower end plated shoes\nout there and some more responsive\nphones with without a doubt the trouble\nis this shoe isn't meant to be competing\nwith them but because it puts it into\nthat sort of price bracket you draw into\nthose natural comparisons so yeah maybe\na little bit on the expensive side and\nthen thirdly there's just potential for\na bit of big toe irritation here with\nthe line down the front of the shoe some\npeople are getting a little bit of\nirritation because the the height of the\ntoe box isn't great it certainly hasn't\naffected me of all if you got a really\nbig chunky toe then maybe this is going\nto be one to avoid because the toe box\ndoes sort of taper a little bit more\nmore aggressively than some other shoes\ndown to the front of the Shoe Right\nconclusions and final thoughts so should\nyou go out and buy this shoe well for me\nyes I've really enjoyed it I'm glad I\nspent \u00a365 on this shoe if you're looking\nfor a shoe with that lower stack height\nbit more ground feel to do your daily\nruns in I would say going up to only\nabout half marathon distance I wouldn't\nwant to be doing my super long marathon\ntraining runs in the shoe in 2024 we do\njust have some better options out there\nsuch as the super us be doing those very\nlonger runs I'm just going to want a\nlittle bit more stack height to look\nafter my legs just take advantage of all\nthe tech in these days but if you want\nto get some speed work in then give it a\ngo if you're a fan of the original\nPegasus turbo I really think you will\nlike this shoe is it worth \u00a335 over the\nstandard Pegasus well yes I really do\nthink so if you've got the budget to\nspend an extra 35 then I really\nrecommend going for this shoe it's just\na much more capable lightweight fun\ndaily shoe the next video is coming up\nwe've got the whole Nike lineup video up\nhere if you want me to sit here and\nexplain what each shoe is good for we've\ngot the best value shoes down here if\nyou want some really good value for\nmoney hope you enjoyed the video guys\nlet me know your thoughts on the Nike\nPegasus plus down in the comments and\nI'm off to get some more miles in this\nbecause it's definitely staying in my\nrotation that's it guys keep on working\nhard keep on we'll see you very soon in\nthe next one",

  "text": "a hybrid shoe or road to Trail shoe is a\ncross between a road shoe and a trail\nshoe something that is cushioned to\nsupport you when you're pounding the\nPavements but also grippy enough to keep\nyou upright when you're going along at\nsome more challenging terrain shoes like\nthis are super popular with Runners at\nthis time of year who want to dip their\ntoe into the trail world and don't want\nto fully commit to a trail shoe just yet\nplus they're really great winter option\nwhen you could be running on a lot of\nwet and slippery roads and can do with\nsome increased traction that shoes like\nthis offer so today I've gathered\ntogether my three top Road trail shoes\none from Nike one from Hoka and one from\nSalamon we're going to be putting\nthrough a full test going through all my\nlikes my dislikes of each one and see\nwhich one of these comes out on top all\nof these shoes here on test today are\nall neutral shoes and all hybrid and\nrotor trail shoes are not going to be\nperfect in really deep wet winter muddy\nboggy conditions or super technical\nTrails running through the mountains\nequally you're don't going to be sing\nany 5k PBS and shoes like this they're\nthe best of both WS pretty good on the\nroad and pretty good on the trail and\nperfect for this time of year as always\nI bought all three of these shoes 100%\nwith my money to give you that\ncompletely unbiased 100% honest review\nso you can get the right shoes on your\nfeet right starting out the first one\nwe've got here is the Nike Trail 5 this\nsent me back\n\u00a3130 here in the UK stack height at the\nback 38 mm we're in a drop overall of 9\n1/2 mm Weight Wise this came in at 344\nBrowns and my UK size 12 midsole we've\ngot Nike's all new react X which is\nexactly the same midsole as you see in\nthe Nike Pegasus version 41 we'll link\nto that video up here if you're looking\nfor a new road shoe potentially in terms\nof the outsole we've got some 3.2 mm lug\nand we've got Nike's own allterrain\ncompound here as well there is\nunfortunately no wide option in the shoe\nalthough the width is good but there is\na waterproof version a gortex version\nhere and it was true to size for me\nright let's get stuck into my likes\nfirst things first as I just alluded to\nit's a nice wide toe box here lots of\nroom in the standard shoe Unfortunately\nthey haven't got a wide option but they\ndon't really need one because the stand\none has got loads of room for a good\nfootplay if you thought version 4 was a\nlittle bit on the narrow side this is\ndefinitely improved in version 5 and it\nis also supremely comfortable one of the\nmost comfortable trail shoes I've ever\nrun in the Nike react X foam just works\nso well on this type of tril and it's\njust so nice through the foot strike\nreally nice and responsive as well the\nupper here gives a really good lockdown\nwith no slipping at all no blisters no\nhot spots this shoe is just all about\nComfort on the trails really like the\nNike Flywire lacing system here and when\nyou're on some more challenging terrain\noff-road jumping over some logs and\nthings like that it just holds the foot\nin place really really well and the\nankle collar as well something to really\npoint out really gives a good confident\nfeel no slipping or rubbing or anything\nlike that good sort of toe bumper at the\nend here just to protect your feet at\nthe front of the shoe as I mentioned the\nreact X mids is a big step up from just\nNike's standard react phone which they\nused previously and it just feels really\ngood on road and off-road and if you\nreally want to pick up the speed put in\na little bit of extra effort up those\nHills or towards the end of the race\nthen it really does that well it now\nfeels just much more responsive than the\noutgo model just much better energy\nreturn and it just looks good casually\nafter run a really good looking shoe\ndidn't really like this sort of pull tab\non the back it just looks a bit flimsy\nso that brings me on to my dislikes\nfirst one the grip is fine for wet roads\nlight Trail but you're going to struggle\non wet rocks or anything like that yeah\nit's difficult with these shoes they're\nnot really designed for that I'd love to\nsee the vibr out sole on the Pegasus\nrange that they put onto the zigama that\nwould be a bit of a dream but yeah the\ntraction's okay it's fine for what we're\ndoing testing on this type of service\nbut in some rocky areas you are going to\nbe able to feel the stone sort of coming\nthrough slightly there's no Rock plate\nor any sort of plate in the shoe to\nprotect you from that all in all the\nPegasus Trail 5 is just a really good\noption for those nontechnical Trails\nthose fire roads those single tracks and\nCity running to and it will really work\nwell for anyone that's going on some\nhiking walking long distances right\nlet's move on to the next one in from\nhoker the Challenger 7 quickly guys if\nyou are funing the videos so please\nsmash that like button and please check\nout my website BP parks.com we've got\nRoad plans Trail plans loads of\nfive-star rated plans the best running\nhats in the business and Technical gear\nto keep you powering it through as\nyou're getting it done thanks very much\nguys right back to the video I've really\nenjoyed running in the Challenger 7 or\nATR senser all terrain I think I really\nlike this colorway let me know what you\nthink about this my girlfriend hates\nthis colorway but I just think it's got\nsome really cool 80s retro Vibes anyway\nthis sent me back\n\u00a3130 here in the UK stack card at the\nback 31 mil which is a slight increase\non the outgo model which was 29 and a 5\nmm drop hit overall Weight Wise just\nover 300 G for me in my UK size 12 306 a\nslight weight decrease come on we love\nthat versus the outgoing version six the\nmidso with got the updated compression\nmolded EVA foam here we've got the\ndurasan rubber outs soole 4 mm lugs here\na little bit longer than the Nikes ones\nand it also does come in a wide option\nshould you spec that as well which you\ndo need because this shoe is a little\nbit on the narrow side there's also a\nwaterproof GTX gortex version and\nfinally this was true to size for me\nright let's get stuck into the likes\nstarting out you really got to think of\nthe shoe as the Clifton of the trail\nWorld it feels exactly like a Clifton on\nthe road just with that little bit of\nextra rip that extra outso which you can\nfeel that's the only slight sort of\ndifference but it's got a really good\nroad feel and when you want to pick up\nthe pace on the road or the trail with\nthe lightweight nature of this shoe and\nthat big chunk of hokus midsole here\nit's just a perfect shoe for those long\nruns and whenever I've been out for\nextending period of time just had no\nheating up issues at all really nice\nankle flare at the back I have been\nhaving a few little Achilles issues but\nthis has been an absolute joy to running\nno agitation there there's a lot of\nCushing here to look after your legs\nit's certainly one that's definitely on\nthe softer side hok's really squishy\nsoft foam some people will really like\nthat kind of ride and a stable ride as\nwell and then finally the updated\nengineered mesh upper feels really\ndurable to me haven't had any issues\nwith that so far a few little dislikes\nto go through I'd love to see a bit more\ntoe protection at the front a little bit\nof a toe bumper just to stop yourself\nstubbing roots and bigger rocks and\nthings like that but it's just not the\nmost Nimble it's a little bit big a\nlittle bit clumpy but that's just sort\nof the classic hoker feeling and the\nstandard version is definitely on the\nnarrow side so if you have got a wider\nfoot definitely go for the wider option\nhere but no all around fantastic shoe\nperfect for getting those road miles in\nand those Trail Mars as well and finally\ntoday we have the Salamon sens ride\nversion 5 one of the first Salamon shoes\nI've actually reviewed on the channel\nand hopefully it won't be the last\nbecause again I've enjoyed the shoe\nthese are all really good shoes for chel\nout here today now this sent me back\n\u00a3130 stack out at the back not\n12929 mm and an 8 mm drop overall Weight\nWise 346 R for me in my UK size 12 the\nmids soole here we've got some energy\nfoam midsole which is an Eva blend from\nSalamon and the Contra grip rubber out\nsoole lug depth 3 and 1/2 mm all these\nshoes very very similar to that there's\nno wide option here but there is a\nwaterproof option that you can expect\nand this wasn't true to size for me I\ndid get this in my UK size 12 but just\nfound it a little bit small so I would\nsay go half a size up because this this\nshoot is definitely on the narrow side\nright let's start out with my lights it\nhas salamon's famous quick lacing system\nhere you just pull it up lock and then\ntuck it away there and you're good to go\nit never came loose on any of my runs I\nnever had to adjust it it's what you\nneed when you head out on the trails you\ndon't be stopping adjusting your laces\nit just cinches right and it gives a\nreally nice lock down throughout the\nwhole foot it just hugs the foot really\nreally nicely with that fantastic lock\ndown you've got some really good grip on\nthe shoe here this is the best grip out\nof the lot of the grip at the back going\nup and down Hills has been really\nfantastic you're really not going to get\nmuch slip here unless you're getting\nsome deep mud but this shoe grips\nfantastically in any sort of spring\nsummer or Autumn type conditions and\nthen not everyone will like this but\nsome people really will is that this\nshoe is definitely on the firm side\nyou've got a lot of ground feel coming\nthrough this very very similar to\nsomething like The New Normal KAG and as\nwe know Killian was a Salomon athlete\nbefore he set up the whole new normal\nshoe brand everything and the feeling is\nvery very between those shoes it's\ncertainly a harder ride versus the hoker\nwhich is sort of super soft and pillowy\nyou can feel a lot of the ground when\nyou're cornering when you're running\nfast you can run really fast in this\nshoe and feel very very confident it's a\nbit more of an old school traditional\nfeel but that's what a lot of salomons\nare like and finally I think this shoe\nis just pretty damn cool I love Salamon\nproducts I love what they do I love the\nathletes that they sponsor as well it's\njust got a really good Cool vibe about\nit let's have a chat about the dislikes\nthis is very narrow if you are someone\nthat has average and narrow feet you're\ngoing to be okay if you're a wider\nfooted Runner unfortunately you're going\nto have to give this one a miss and then\nfinally as I say you either like it or\nyou don't like it but if you want a\nreally soft plush ride to look after\nyour legs on very long distances this\nmay be one to avoid it really has that\nsort of faster engaging ground contact\nsort of feel with this type of shoe bit\nmore suited for some shorter distances\nright let's wrap this video up so if\nyou're looking for the most comfortable\nshoe out of this range I would go for\nthe Nike trail version 5 the best for\nlong distances then definitely the hoker\nChallenger ATR with that super soft foam\nin there going to look after your legs\nthe best for grip I would have to give\nthat to the Salamon shoe the outsole in\nhere is absolutely fantastic and the\nbest for Speed would be the Salamon shoe\nas well in there just so much more\nconfidence inspiring really good lock\ndown just worked really well but I think\nthe best overall here the best that sort\nof mixes everything that I'm looking for\nis going to be the Nike Trail version 5\nit's very hard to find any sort of fault\nwith a shoe rctx foame I just think\nworks a lot better on trail than it does\nin a dedicated row to it just gives that\nreally nice responsive feel that you\nwant out in the trails and super\ncomfortable you're just not really going\nto have any issues good width in the\nshoe as well great lock down and it\nlooks pretty cool so that's my best on\ntest today but I wholeheartedly\nrecommend all of these three shoes for\nanyone looking to get out on the trails\nfor maybe the first time and that's\nwhere the next video is coming up\nbecause that's all about how to get into\ntrail running so go and check out that\nvideo guys that's coming up next up here\nor up here hope you enjoyed this video\nkeep on working hard keep on it done and\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

  "text": "New Balance have just released the third\ngeneration of the super trainer which on\npaper seems like it could be the perfect\nshoe great for long runs great for easy\nruns and also a potential really great\nrace Sho for people looking at marathons\nand half marathons but unfortunately\nthere's one pretty big thing that's\ngoing to be putting a lot of people off\nbut we'll touch on that later on so here\nis my full honest review of the super\ncomp trainer which of course I bought\n100% with my own money give that\ncompletely impartial unbiased review\nwe'll go through all the facts and\nfigures my likes my dislikes whether I\nrecommend you buy this shoe but firstly\nlet's talk about what's changed and\nwhat's all new in version 3 the super\ntrainer from New Balance is such an odd\nshoe because with every new version that\ncomes out New Balance like to change\nloads of different things on it so if\nyou really like version one and then you\nget version two it's not the same\nversion three again some big changes\nhere version one had this huge stack\nkite to it version two had totally\ndifferent geometry from that and\nactually did feature it in one of my\nmost comfortable shoes of last year it\nwas super bouncy great at all speeds and\nI say Ultra comfortable but a little bit\nunstable so what's new with version\nthree where we've got an updated upper\nhere the midso foam is a slightly\ndifferent composition as well and the\ntoe box at the front is a little bit\nmore tapered it doesn't feel quite as\nbouncy as version 2 but it's certainly a\nhell of a lot more stable oh and it's\nalso \u00a320 more expensive here in the UK\nbut we'll touch on pricing a little bit\nlater on right let's get stuck into the\nfacts and figures all the stats about\nsuper comp trainer version 3 with a\npurpose of a shoe like this this is for\nyour long runs and just a very premium\neveryday shoe targeted towards people\nthat are training for half marathons\nmarathons and potential some longer\ndistances as well price-wise this is\nabsolutely outrageous this shoe is\ncosting\n\u00a3230 yes2\n\u00a3130 here in the UK as a dollar\nequivalent that's\n$300 for our American friends but they\ndon't have to pay that because in the\nUnited States this is just\n$180 \u20ac250 Aussie doll\n$330 again people in Europe and people\nin Australia people pretty much\neverywhere around the world apart from\nAmerica and Canada are paying a massive\npremium on their shoe stackwise we're\ntalking a 40 mil stack at the back 34\nmil at the front giving a 6 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise for me this is\ncoming at\n325 G I've actually got this in half a\nsize down in a UK 11 and half cuz I just\ncouldn't find a 12 anywhere and that was\na mistake I wish I'd waited and try to\nfind my UK size 12 so it should be true\nto size go with your regular size don't\ngo half a size to like I did upper wise\nwe've got a phantom fit engineered mesh\nupper and a gusseted tongue inside\nmidsole we've got new balances fuel cell\nphone which is very soft it's a peber\nand Eva blend very very similar if not\nidentical to the rebel V4 but offering a\nlot more stability than the rebel V4 and\nit's got some biobased content in here\nas well plate wise yes we have got a\nplate we've got the energy art carbon\nplate to add in some extra rigidity and\nstability and of course a little bit of\nextra speed and propulsion as well out\nsoole we've got a very wide rubber out\nsoole here the grip in the shoe has been\nsurprisingly good as well so far you can\nget this in two different wids again I\nthink this is only in America and Canada\nas well they're offering the two wids\neverywhere else we've just got that one\nwidth unfortunately hopefully New\nBalance might update the websites but\nthat's what I'm seeing at the moment\nwell let's get stuck into all of my\nlikes my first like is this Phantom fit\nupper it's really fantastic and it's\nalso really quite breathable for\nsomething that's actually quite thick as\nwell you can see your socks or put your\nfingers through you can see you're going\nto get get some good amount of air flow\nthrough this shoe I've been running this\nshoe in some quite hot weather in London\nhere in the summer and it's been really\ngood also getting a good heel lockdown\nloads of heel padding at the back of the\nshoe here adding to that extra Comfort\nyeah didn't have to use any heel lock\nlacing the gusted tongue good amounts of\npadding around the tongue as well and\nalso a good length for the tongue as\nsome people know if you have got the\nelite the tongue is just so short and\nflimsy but in the trainer version it's\njust that but lot more comfortable\ncarrying on that comfort from version\ntwo in version three as well no issues\nno hotpots no blisters or anything like\nthat just good allar around Comfort\nstemming from this lovely updated upper\nmy second like with this shoe is just a\nfantastic Cruiser New Balance have\npitched this for someone that's training\nfor those marathons and half marathons\ngoing out for your long runs and ticking\noff those ks in comfort and that's what\nthis shoe has really been doing well for\nme at easy Pace at marathon pace and\nalso a little bit faster up to half\nmarathon pace it's just really really\ncomfortable the midsole has without\ndoubt lost some of its spark that\nversion 2 had in my opinion but what\nit's lost there it's gaining providing\njust some non nonsense cushion some\nreally good stability a shoe that you\ncan really trust now not going to roll\nany ankles or anything like that in a\nshoe like this just going to go out\nthere tick off your runs and get it done\njust fantastic at cruising along all\nthose nice steady Paces yeah very very\ndependable my third like with the shoe\nas I've touched on before just that all\naround Comfort straight out the box it's\na really good option for that mid pack\nRunner that doesn't want to have an\nallout super lightweight but quite\nuncomfortable shoe when they're going to\nbe going out for 3 four 5 hours on some\ntraining runs and during the race as\nwell they're just looking for sure they\ncan trust for many hours out on their\nfeet to get their training runs done and\nalso in the race as well it's nicely\ncushioned but with enough extra speed\nfrom that carbon plate in the shoe to\nmake all the difference versus that\nstandard daily shoe that you'll get in\nthat sort of 120 1340 price point you\nreally feel the premium difference\nyou're getting with something like this\nright as I said it's not all smiles\nlet's move on to my dislikes the first\none being it's really not the CPP of\nshoe you could use for all sorts of\ndifferent speeds it's not going to be\ngreat for your super super fast running\nit's just not responsive enough for\nthose 5K and those 10K training Paces\nthis is a shoe that's Happy cruising\nalong at marathon pace and easy pace and\neven recovery Pace as well this will be\nperfectly happy with that there really\njust isn't the same amount of pop that\nversion 2 had this one's just a little\nbit Bland a little bit less responsive\nbut a little bit more stable version two\njust had a little bit more range speed\nrange that you get versus version three\nmy second dislike is just the ridiculous\npriceing\ncompared to Canada and the USA I just\ncan't work out why they're charging\n\u00a3230 which is honestly crazy it's just\nreally really weird I can't really see\nwhy they think this is \u00a330 better than\nsomething like a super blast but the\nrebel 4 pricing at \u00a340 that was\ncompletely fine and normal the more\nversion 5 \u00a3140 pricing completely normal\nlike it's only \u00a330 cheaper than that all\nout Flagship super light rate full peber\nracing shoe and it just I just can't\nwork out the pricing and what they've\ndone here you can go buy a pair of\nvaporfly 3es from Nike for only \u00a39 more\nexpensive so his Flagship and dorphin\npro is the same price as this so the\npricing is just all wrong this shoe\nreally should be priced at \u00a3180 in the\nUK \u20ac190 all day long anyway let me know\nyour thoughts down in the comments maybe\nyou know more than I do but it's just\nabsolutely crazy but there are of course\nsome similar options out there a Shoe I\nhad in quite recently the mauno Neo\nVista \u00a3 150 you get in the plate you get\ngetting some really nice high-end foam\nin that shoe and you're getting some\ngood comfort and it can do a lot of\nthings that this shoe can do as well\nsomething like the Boston 12 140 again\nyou get in the plate you get in the\npremium Foams in there as well or the\nHocus skywood X again a plated everyday\ntype of shoe I haven't actually running\nthe Boston 12 or the Hocus Skyward X so\nI can't recommend those but we will be\ngetting them in for a review on the\nchannel but as you can see with the\npricing of those shoes significantly\ncheaper than this so it's really hard to\nrecommend but anyway let's have a chat\nabout my final thoughts on this shoe do\nI recommend this shoe 100% definitely if\nyou live in the USA and Canada or you're\ngoing to be visiting soon then maybe try\nand pick it up but at \u00a3230 I couldn't\npossibly recommend this it's absolutely\ncrazy is it worth the upgrade of a\nversion 2 probably not I just really\nlike version two it's just bit more\npoppy bit more versatile but if you're\nlooking for something that's got a more\nstable ride then yeah you're going to\nwant to upgrade to something like this\nso who should buy a shoe like this\nsomeone that is looking to train for a\nhalf marathon or Marathon prioritizing\nthat Comfort over all outspeed for their\nlonger runs so that's it guys let me\nknow your thoughts on the super comp\ntrainer have you got it are you going to\nbe getting it in have you been put off\nby the price or are you in the states\nand you love this shoe I really wish\nthis was 1880 and I'd be giving it a\nmuch more glowing review but I just\ncan't at that price unfortunately we've\ngot our full New Balance comparison\nvideo down up here for you to check out\nnext to go and see that and we'll be\nupdating that probably next year at some\npoint so that's it guys guys let me know\nyour thoughts keep on working hard keep\ndone we see you in the next one",

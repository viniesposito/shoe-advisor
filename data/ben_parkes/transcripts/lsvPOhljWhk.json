  "text": "this is the hoker skywood X and at the\ntime of recording this is the best rated\nshoe on hooker's website Runners are\nabsolutely raving about the shoe saying\nthings like this is the most comfortable\nshoe ever and it was so good I bought\ntwo pairs but as always it's not all\nsmarts with a few onear reviewers in the\nmix saying I feel no stability in this\nshoe and they feel and look cheap so I\nwanted to get this shoe in and see for\nmyself what it's like put it through its\npaces and see if it delivers on the\nPromises as a top choice for long runs\nthat is how hoker art billing this shoe\nit has this absolutely crazy 48 mm stack\nheight at the back we've got that and a\nload more to chat out this so let's get\nstuck into the hoker skywood X review as\nalways I bought the shoe 100% with my\nown money so I could give you those\ncompletely honest unbiased thoughts and\nthank you to everyone that supports the\nchannel by liking these videos\nsubscribing commenting down below with\nyour thoughts as well and of course\nchecking out my website benp parks.com\nwhere we've got amazing running gear\ntechnical teas hats to help you out on\nyour run feel free to use code YouTube\n10 for 10% off your next order right\nlet's get stuck into the differences\nbetween this and the outgo model so\ntechnically the Skyward X is a brand new\nshoe for hoker but really it does\nreplace what was known as the Bondi X\nwhich was a carbon plated version of the\nHoka Bondi Hokah have just basically\nrenamed that to be the Skyward X I guess\nbecause the Bondi X just didn't really\nsell very well it was one of the worst\nshoes I actually ever reviewed and\nRunners just found it so confusing and\nso here we are we are with a brand new\nname and a much better shoe thankfully\nthe Bondo X had really old EVA foam the\nskyex has this dual layer peber and\nsuper critical EVA foam midsole it's\nmuch more responsive much softer and a\nlot easier on the legs as well the\nrocket is just a lot more pronounced at\nthe front of the shoe as well and it\njust rolls through the footstrike a lot\nlot smoother than the outgoing Bondi X\nright let's get stuck into all of the\nfacts and figures so the purpose of the\nSkyward X is for your long runs your\neasy runs recovery runs something that\nis very happy around about marathon pace\nor slower that long run Cruiser to look\nafter your legs as you're panning the\npavement to get those miles in\nprice-wise this set me back\n\u00a385 here in the UK R about 225\n$225 $360 Australian and $280 Canadian\nreally quite expensive in the EU and the\nUSA normally we're the ones in the UK\nthat have to pay the high prices but for\nsome reason it's pretty pricey in the\nstates I don't know why maybe you do let\nme know down in the comments stack\nheight at the back as I mentioned 48 mm\nstack height you will notice this you\nwill be walking around while trying this\nshoe on feeling like you're absolutely a\ngiant basically it's just crazy I it's\nonly a tiny bit more than something like\nthe uh super blast but I don't notice it\nin that shoe you really notice it\nwalking around in the shoe that stack\nheight 5 mm drop overall weightwise this\nis coming in at 378 G 13.3 o for me in\nmy UK size 12 which was true to size\nit's very much on at the heavy side I\nthink this might even be the heaviest\nshoe I've ever tested the upper of the\nshoe is a flat knit upper just has this\nsort of sock like fit to it really quite\nnice midsole we've got this dual density\nfoam the top half under the foot being\nthis really lightweight racing peber\nthat hok like to use and then below that\nwe've got that super critical EVA foam\nfor that added durability yes there is a\ncarbon plate in the shoe it's really for\nmore stability than that all out speed\nit's sort of this H shaped carbon plate\nwell bit more like the X I suppose an\nx-shaped carbon plate that the shoe has\non the outs soole we've got this High\nabrasion rubber outsole there are no\ndifferent widths available for this shoe\nwhich is just really quite annoying to\nsee cuz H are normally good with that\nbut I just don't think they're doing\nwider wits in the carbon plated shoes at\nthe moment I'm not sure why but\nhopefully we'll see them developing that\na little bit further into the future\nwider footed Runners you're probably\ngoing to avoid this one narrow footed\nregular footed wi width people will be\nfine there are different men's and\nwomen's versions available and as I said\nit was true to size for me right let's\nget St into all of the likes my first\nlike with the shoe is it's just so much\nfun to run in it's just a real laugh of\na shoe something that doesn't take\nitself too seriously there's so much\nBounce from this energy saving foam it\nalso does become even more lively after\nthe first couple of runs this shoe it\njust sort of comes to life after around\nabout 20K or so of training the the heel\nslip issues from that Old Bondi are\ncompletely gone I just couldn't run in\nthat last shoe at all for heel slip\nissues this one that's all gone really\nnice heel counter at the back of the\nshoe here no heel lock lacing needed for\nme no slip at all so yeah a really nice\nmuch more fun shoe to run in than the\noutgoing model my second like with the\nshoe is it's just now really really\nsmooth The Rocker at the front of the\nshoe just enables a really silky\ntransition through that foot strip you\njust cover the ground with minimal fuss\nhere it's really happy just cruising\nalong a round about marathon pace or\nslower and doing all of that hard work\nfor you the foot as I said felt really\nsecure really good lock down there's\nthis strap that sort of runs to keep the\nmidfoot really locked down as well and\nthat just works really well lovely\npadding here in the tongue at the front\nof the shoe really you can wear the shoe\nfor a very long time super comfortable\nno hot spots no blisses no issues with\nanything like that my third like with\nthe shoe and I have to disagree with\nthat one star review from the start of\nthe video I think the shoe is really\nwell put together really good build\nquality and it feels like a quality\nproduct personally I don't really like\nthis aqua fresh type colorway let me\nknow your thoughts down in the comments\nthe upper is just really comfortable as\nwell and surprisingly good breathability\nin the shoe didn't have any overheating\nissues and getting a good airf flow\nthrough to look at it you wouldn't think\nthat would be the case but had\nabsolutely no issues and I particularly\nlike the extra strength thing they've\ngot at the front of the shoe here this\nis going to really help with that\ndurability I think this this what shoe\nwill last a very long time at the key\nwear points at the front of the shoe and\naround the heel area here it's just\ngoing to hold out really well it feels\nlike a really good quality well put\ntogether product and my fourth like here\nwith the shoe is yes of course this shoe\nis primarily designed for running with a\nplate and these high-end racing Foams\nhere but we always get a lot of people\nthat watch our Hoka reviews that aren't\nRunners and they just want a nice comfy\ncasual shoe and this has been really\ncomfortable for me for wearing casually\nout and about here in London it's been\ngood for wearing for long period of time\ntraveling around when you just want that\nultimate pillow like Comfort the high\nstack of the shoe does take a little bit\nof getting used to because as I said you\njust feel so much taller and the plate\nin the shoe does help with that\nstability as well if you're just static\nor maybe standing around all day you're\nin a type of work environment where you\ndo need to be standing for long periods\nof time and although yes it is very\nexpensive it does work really well for a\ncasual shoe as well well let's get stuck\nin to my dislikes my first dislike with\nthis shoe is just that all out bulky and\nheavyweight nature of it coming in for\nme at nearly 400 G per shoe it really is\nquite crazy and yes you really do notice\nthat out on the run it's looking after\nyour legs quite nicely and it has got a\nlot of positives but the negative side\nof that is it's just in this massive\npackage my second dislike with the shoe\nis it just has that limited type of use\nit really excels at marathon pace easy\npace and Recovery drug Pace it likes to\ngo out for those relaxed runs to look\nafter your legs but it's really hard\nwork if you want to pick up the pace\nanything faster than marathon pace in\nthe shoe due to its weight and the plate\nreally doesn't add an awful lot speed\nwise in the shoe it's really primarily\nthere for that stability so if you want\nto be thinking that can I do it\neverything in the shoe 5Ks 10ks half\nmarathon speed workor thresholds you\nreally do not want to be doing that in a\nshoe like this this is something that is\njust happy plotting along ticking off\nthose CS munching those Mars just don't\nask it to go very fast and then my third\ndislike with this shoe it's just as I\nsay in the US and EU quite a high price\nfor a very specialist type shoe so who\nshould be looking at the hoker skywood X\nbut it's a really good option for any\nheavier Runners out there who can\nappreciate that extra stack height with\na shoe and that plate underneath as well\nthis foam here is never going to bottom\nout or just that really good solid\nmarathon training shoe for people that\nmaybe doing some easy Pace marathon pace\neasy Pace on their long runs it's really\ngoing to acceler at things like that or\nsimply for some that just wants a nice\ncomfy shoe for their running isn't\nworried always about how fast they're\nrunning just wants to put something on\nthat's dependable happy joyful bouncy\nexciting just when I go out there and\nenjoy their runs and it's a really good\noption to look out for because I'm all\nfor that coming up next we've got our\nbest long run compilation video that\nwill be up here that'll actually in a\nfew days so it might not be live there\nyet but it will be in a few days so\ncheck out that there and this shoe will\ndefinitely feature in my best long run\nshoe option that's it guys keep on\nworking hard let me know your thoughts\nall about the sky X keep on getting done\nand we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

balance's\nbestselling running shoes here all of\nwhich I bought 100% with my own money\nand tested them out so I can give you\nthat completely 100% honest impartial\nand unbiased review which we always do\nhere on the channel going through the\npros and cons of each shoe to help you\nwith your buying decisions at the end I\nchat through my favorites because\nthere's one here that really stood out\nand thank you for everybody that checks\nout my website benp parks.com and\nsupports the channel here to people that\nliking sharing the video subscribing to\nthe channel and checking out the best\nrunning hats the best technical gear and\nawesome training plans which you sell on\nbenp parks.com links to everything down\nbelow and that's what allows us to keep\nmaking these videos here on the channel\nso thank you so so much for the support\na lot of people obviously ask about Tru\nto size I just want to say I got all of\nthese New Balance shoes in my regular UK\nsize 12 and they were all really good\nand fitted very nicely so they're all\ntrue to size for for me right let's get\nstuck in with the shoe starting out with\nthe cheapest finishing off with the most\nexpensive so starting out with the New\nBalance 880 this is the brand new\nversion 14 with an updated mids and\nupper here now there's kind of Two Shoes\nin this range you got the 880 which is\nfor the neutral Runners out there and\nyou've also got the 860 which is the\nstability version of this shoe this is\nyour classic everyday shoe that can do\neverything pretty well good for doing\nall sorts of different types of running\nthis sent me back one\n140 here in the UK stack height around\nabout 30 mil stack height at the back 8\nmm drop overall Weight Wise we're\ntalking 312 G for me in my UK size 12\nfor the mids so we've got new balances\nFresh Foam X here big chunk of that\nthere's no carbon plate in this shoe but\nthere are plenty of wide options\nstandard wide and extra wide here now\nwhat I really like about the shoe my\nPros my likes super durable outso in the\nshoe this is going to last you a long\ntime on your runs it offers some really\ngood traction as well also a very\nversatile ride and a really good one\nshoe option super comfortable right out\nthe box great cushioning just the right\namount for all sorts of different types\nof runs you got a good amount of ground\ncontact feel without that Max stack kite\nthing I'm feeling a bit numb out there\nnow what I didn't like about the shoe it\nis it does run a little bit narrow so if\nyou're someone that does have a wider\nfoot definitely get the wide or the\nextra wide but all in all I've really\nenjoyed putting some Mars in the shoe\nand I'll be putting plenty more in as I\nbuild up towards my next marathon moving\non we've got the rebel version 4 this is\na hell of a lot lighter this is your\nlightweight daily trainer perfect for\nSpeed work 5Ks 10ks up to half marathon\ndistances and also say training for\nmarathons as well I wouldn't personally\nwant to use this for a Marathon distance\nwe'll come on to perfect shoes for that\na little bit later on price-wise\n\u00a340 stack height 30 mil at the back of\nthe shoe 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise\n242 G super lightweight midsole here\nwe've got some fuel cell foam peber 20%\nand EVA foam 80% so I blend of the two\nclassic Foams there's no plate in this\nshoe and there's also no wide option now\nwhat I really liked about this shoe it\nis super lightweight and really great\nfun to run in it really brings a big\nsmile to your face it's very Lively also\nreally good on the width option here\nthere aren't other wide options you got\nplenty of space up front here on the\nstandard shoe it's very versatile and\nalso fantastic value \u00a3140 for a shoe\nlike this that can do so much and it\nreally is one of the best value shoes\nthat you can get on sale today also I\nthink it looks really good as well let\nme know your thoughts down in the\ncomments now what I didn't like about\nthe shoe I did get a bit of heel slip\nand a bit of heel rubbing little\nblisters starting to develop at the back\nof the shoe on my first few runs did\nsome heel lock lacing and that went away\nso overall another shoe that I've really\nenjoyed running and I'm looking forward\nto keeping in my rotation moving on on\nto the more version 4 shoe I don't\nactually have any more because I had so\nmany happy Mars in it and it's now a\nlittle bit worn out this is your max\ncushion long run super soft super\nsquishy recovery run shoe the type of\nshoe you want to put on when you want to\nlook after your legs this shoe sent me\nback\n\u00a340 stack Co at the back 34 mil with a 4\nmm drop overall so a little bit flatter\nhere Weight Wise it is a little bit on\nthe heavy side 353 G for me in my UK\nsize 12 mids salt we've got got Nik Nike\ndefinitely not Nike we've got new\nbalances fresh f x midsole there's no\ncarbon plate in the shoe and you can\nalso get two wide options here just your\nstandard or your wide what I liked about\nthis shoe it's super stable given how\nsoft it is so sometimes with the squishy\nshoes you can feel a lot of instability\nespecially when cornering this is nice\nwide platform super stable really roomy\nand wide fitting as well super soft\nsquishy ride it ticks that Comfort box\nreally really well terms of what I\ndidn't like it is just a bit bulky and\nheavy and just doesn't handle speed very\nwell it's not really built for that sort\nof thing but it's really not the type of\nshoe you could just have one shoe and do\nall your runs in it this is a dedicated\nslower Pace easy recovery run shoe\nmoving on to one of the oldtime classics\nfrom New Balance the 1080 currently at\nversion 13 you can also get the vongo 6\nwhich is their stability version so the\n1080 neutral shoe vongo 6 stability\nversion the shoes are fairly similar\nthis do premium everyday shoe price-wise\nlittle bit expensive \u00a360 here for the\n1080 stack height 38 mil at the back of\nthe shoe 6 mm drop overall coming in at\n323 G for me midsole we've got new\nbalances Fresh Foam X again there's no\ncarbon plate in the shore no plate of\nany description there are also plenty of\nwide options you got your standard your\nwide and your extra wide what I really\nliked about it Supreme levels of comfort\ndefinitely one of the most comfortable\nshoes you can buy on the market at the\nmoment moment and it's also a really\ngood shoe for your walking or anyone on\ntheir feet all day really wellb built\nshoe as well good quality upper here yes\nit's a premium product but you can\nreally feel that in how well the shoe\nhas been built what I didn't like about\nthe shoe the standard width is a little\nbit on the narrow side little bit high\nprice point here as well for me I just\nfound it a little bit too soft and\nunstable and it really is no longer that\ndoit all shoe cuz now with it's so soft\nit really is that only easy and Recovery\nrun shoe so if you're the type of person\nthat wants the ultimate soft and\nsquishiness then B check out the 1080\nbut a better daily option for me I think\nis the 880 right let's move on to\ngetting a little bit more expensive\nagain to the super comp trainer getting\nsome real speed into the mix now so the\nsuper comp trainer I really love this\nshoe when I had it in earlier this year\nthis is for your fast training runs\nspeed sessions long marathon training\nsessions and also racing here as well we\nnow got a plate in the shoe not the\nstiffest plate but a kind of plate you\ncan use everyday a premium everyday shoe\nhere price-wise a bit on the expensive\nside \u00a3210 for this stackwise 40 mil at\nthe back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall\nweight 326 G for me midsole we've got\nnew balances fuel cell foam plate wise\nyes we have now got a carbon fiber plate\ncarbon carbon fiber plate in the shoe\nand there is no wide option here what I\nreally liked about the shoe it was\nsupremely comfortable a lot of padding\naround the back of the shoe around your\nanle really good lock down in there no\nslipping around no hot spots or anything\nlike that and with a plate in the shoe\nit's fast as well and I really think\nit's right up with the most comfortable\nfar shoe that you can buy anywhere on\nthe market at the moment and also a\nreally good entry level option for\npeople looking to try out a carbon\nplated shoe for the first time so it's\nalso a really good option for that mid\npack type Runner or back of the- pack\nRunner that wants to have a far shoe on\ntheir feet but running their marathons a\nlittle bit longer than some other people\nout there so what that really Supreme\ncomfort to get them through the race\ndefinitely one of my favorite shoes that\nI've run in this year so well worth\nchecking out and what I didn't like\nabout the shoe yeah it cost me a lot of\nmoney basically a little bit on the\nexpensive side but you're getting a\npremium product here and finally in the\nlineup today we've got the supercom\nelite version 4 currently this is New\nBalance allout Flagship super stiff fast\ncarbon race shoe new Balan is Super Shoe\nthat long distance specialist perfect\nfor half marathons we can use this for\nany distance really but for a lot of\npeople this is a half marathon and\nMarathon shoe price-wise oh this was a\nlot \u00a3260 I've just spent on this shoe\nstack height 40 mil at the back of the\nshoe with a 4 mm drop overall Weight\nWise 286 G for me and my UK size 12\nwe've got the fuel cell midsole 100%\npeber and a fulllength carbon plate\nrunning through the shoe and there's no\nwide option here now what I liked about\nthe shoe as I've said quite a lot today\nin this video very very comfortable\noverall really like like what new balets\nhave done with their Phantom fit upper\nit's extremely bouncy very poppy but not\ntoo stiff like some carbon shoes can be\nit's another good entry level point for\nsomeone that wants that that all out\nrace shoe as well that hasn't maybe run\nin some carbon plated shoes before and\nis certainly a very fast option out\nthere I've really enjoyed taking this up\nto some of my allout Paces at the moment\nI didn't actually have any heel slip\nissues in this one I was using the heel\nlock lacing on the front as well just to\ncombat that because the stru strcture is\nvery similar to The Rebel version 4 what\nI didn't like about the shoe the\ntongue's just a bit weird it's just a\nlittle bit on the short side with that\nHill lock lacing it doesn't leave much\nbut just about being okay and it's just\na little bit on the heavy side but as I\nsay I really like the Comfort levels the\nshoe offered and for someone landing on\nthe midfoot as well and just rolling\nthrough a really nice rocker through the\nshoe a very fast option so here's my\nfinal thoughts on the New Balance range\nthe most comfortable option the super\ncomp trainer the best everyday option\nthe eight 80 the best for allout Speed\nand Marathon racing definitely the elite\nV4 the best value shoe here the rebel\nversion 4 the best option for Walkers\nhikers being on your feet all day than\nthe 1080 and out of all of these shoes\nmy standout one was surprisingly I'm\nsure somebody would be surprised was the\n880 it just a really good classic daily\nshoe I just put it on it got the job\ndone no fuss really comfortable great\nlock down good breathability good amount\nof speed you can get in the shoe as well\nwell you can feel a little bit of the\nground and it was just one that caught\nme out and a really nice enjoyable ride\nin the shoe and going be racking up some\nmore training miles in this one without\na doubt so thanks for following along\nguys hope you enjoyed the video we'll\nlink to the full playlist of these\ncomplete overviews down below let us\nknow what you'd like to see coming up\nnext maybe on or added us potentially\nlet us know down in the comments up next\nwe've got the most comfortable shoes for\nall of your runs up here that's it guys\nkeep on working hard keep on done and\nwe'll see you very soon

  "text": "as a new Runner coming into the sport\nbuying your first pair of shoes can be\nextremely overwhelming is it a case of\nthe more expensive the shoe the better\nit's going to be what does all that\nrunning shoot jargon actually mean of\ncourse it's a lot to take everything in\nbut today we're going to make it super\neasy to help you narrow down your search\nwe've got six different options and two\nbonus pairs at the end so stay tuned for\nthat to really give you a good head\nstart on your running Journey as with\nall the videos here on the channel I've\nbought these shoes 100% with my money\ntested them out myself there's nothing\nsponsored nothing gifted nothing like\nthat at all or we ask if you get benefit\nout of our videos to hit that like\nbutton leave us a comment down below\nshare the video and of course check out\nmy website benp parks.com where we make\nand sell the best running hats and\nTechnical gear in the world so what are\nwe looking for in our first pair of\nrunning shoes well we want something\nthat's going to be nice and versatile\nsomething you can run on the roads or on\nthe treadmill something that's going to\nbe of course very very comfortable out\nthe box long lasting and we want some\ngood value for money here as well so you\nmight have heard this term a neutral\nrunning or a stability running shoe and\nwe need to work out what type of shoe is\ngoing to best suit us it's a rough guide\nabout 80 85% of people are neutral\nRunners and about 20 15% need a\nstability shoe with their running the\nbest thing you can do with this is go to\nyour local running shop where they can\nput you on a treadmill analyze your gate\nand see how you're moving and tell you\nif you're going to need a stability sh\nbut as a Rough Guide if you do have\nparticularly flat arches then you may\nbenefit from a stability shoe but if you\nhave normal or high archers then opt for\na regular normal running shoe we'll link\nsome resources down below if you want to\ndo some testing of this at home before\nyou go out and get yourself a pair so if\nyou have bought your pair of shoes\nonline and they've come how do we know\nif they fit correctly it's a rough guide\na rough rule of thumb should we say you\nshould have about a thumb's width at the\nend of the shoe between the top of your\nbig toe and the end of the shoe you\ndon't want to have your toes right up\nagainst the shoe when we run our feet\nwould expand a little bit again if you\ncan get into your local running store\ntest out a few pairs they're going to\nmake sure they fit properly some online\nretailers do allow you to use use the\nshoe test it and send it back if it's\nnot quite right so always check out the\nterms and conditions with where you're\nbuying your shoes from there's a couple\nof terms I'll be chatting about today\ndrop and also stack height starting out\nwith stack height well that is basically\nfrom where your heel would sit at the\nbottom of the shoe the distance between\nthat and the ground so that is going to\nbe around about this figure here the\nhigher the number with the stack height\nthe more foam the more man of cushioning\nthe other thing we're going to have a\nchat about is drop and that is basically\nthat figure there that stack height the\ndifference between that and then the\nstack height at the front of the shoe so\nmost running shoes have around about\nsort of four up to around about 12 mm of\ndrop it just tilts the foot forward a\nlittle bit barefoot running shoes or if\nyou are running without any shoes on at\nall that would be 0o mm drop that is\ngoing to be flat on the ground but it\njust takes a little bit of pressure off\nthe carves it tilts the body for a\nlittle bit helps us to get the feet\nnicely moving under the body as well\nright let's start out with my top\nrecommendations for beginner Runners\ntaking into account everything we've\nsaid before we're going to go through\nthese shoes starting at a a low price\npoint and finishing at a higher price\npoint and at the end I'm going to go\nthrough my favorite one of these and\nit's not the most expensive and Chad\nabout a really good stability and Trail\nshoe option for beginners so starting\nout with my first recommendation the\ncheapest one here the Reebok flight ride\nversion five round about \u00a385 no one's\ngoing to pay that I think I paid \u00a355 for\nmy first pair of these the stack height\n27 mil 8 mm drop overall true to size\nfor me there's no different widths\navailable now what I really like about\nthis shoe with the recent updates has\nbecome a much more comfortable and\nstable shoe really good versatility at\nall sorts of different distances very\nhighly durable outsole to the shoe as\nwell so really last and just fantastic\nvalue for that price point one of the\ncheapest shoes out there but also a\nreally really good option also very nice\nlightweight feel for the shoe as well\ndoesn't feel like you're carrying around\nloads of extra unnecessary weight now\nwhat I didn't like about the shoe it\njust takes a little bit of breaking in\nthat foam takes about 20 mi to soften up\nget nice and squidgy but after 20 mi it\nreally starts to come to life so yeah\nthese shoes are a little bit more on the\nfirm side that stack height little bit\nlower than a lot of other shoes but you\nlike a little bit more ground contact\nfeel then this can be a really good\noption to go for moving on to around\nabout 110 L for the pummer velocity\nNitro version three this new version has\ncome out recently I think I paid around\nabout 85 for these off start Fitness\ndrop 10 mm in the shoe 36 mm stack\nheight at the back of the shoe and yes\nthis was true to size for me and you can\nget this in a wide version if you get it\noff the pummer website what I really\nliked about the shoe again super\ncomfortable the Nitro foam that Puma\nusing in the shoe is really fun and\nbouncy and it's just really versatile at\nall sorts of different distances the\ngreat fantastic grip you get on the\nbottom of the shoe this pumer grip this\nrubber out soole fantastic in the wet\none of the really best wet weather\nrunning shoes that you can buy for any\ndifferent price point at the moment and\nthe durability of this shoe will last so\nlong in terms of dislikes for this shoe\nis a little bit on the narrow side so if\nyou have a slightly wider feet then\ndefinitely check out that wider version\nright moving up to a slightly higher\nprice point now the main difference\nbetween the shoes we've been talking\nabout and these ones is these are going\nto be a little bit more stable little\nbit more cushioning and they're going to\nbe slightly more durable as well some\nslightly better materials that they're\nmade with although really the Puma shoe\nwe've just talked about really does\nperform as well as these next two shoes\nstarting out with the hoker Clifton 9\none of the absolute Classics of the\nRunning World now in its ninth version\nmy shoe sent me back \u00a3130\n5 mm drop with the shoe stack height of\na 32 and it was true to size for me I\ncan make this in a wide variety of\ncolorways they also make it in the\nstandard width and the wide width as\nwell now what I really liked about the\nshoe is it was really nice and\nlightweight but still offering a really\ngood amount of cushioning Under Foot\nsuper comfortable very breathable and\nthe foot feels really secure no blisters\nno hot spots what I really didn't like\nabout the shoe is it's now just slightly\ndated the foam of the shoe is just\nslightly dated it really needs ping up\nwith a new update it doesn't feel too\nsquishy but maybe some people will like\na slightly firmer ride and this is is\nhooker's bestselling overall Ru and also\nthe hok of Clifton is probably the most\nlike fashiony shoe here Tik tokers\ninstagrammers absolutely adore the\nClifton 9 for casual as well now if you\nlike the style of the hooker shoe you\nmay want to check out the Max 6 which\njust has a slightly better quality foam\nin it to run in but it's just not quite\nas durable moving on to one of my\nabsolute favorites from last year when I\npicked this shoe up in New York at the\nNew York Marathon Expo was the aex Nova\nblast verion floor version two version\nthree were absolute Classics and version\n4 aex really delivered again now I paid\n$140 for this at the Expo around about\n\u00a3135 8 mm drop in the shoe stack height\n41 and A2 it wasn't true to size for me\nI had to go half a size down what I\nreally liked about this shoe nice and\nlightweight nice and cushioned the Eco\nfoam that aex used in the shoe is really\ngood fun to run in it's engaging it's\nresponsive Ive and just super\ncomfortable overall again no hot spots\nno blisters so much padding around the\nankle and at 135 really fantastic value\nfor the quality of the materials and the\nquality of the product when you feel it\nin your hand you're running along with\nit it really is a great value what I\ndidn't like about the shoe it's just not\nfantastic in wet weather it has asexy\nslightly lower density foam which should\nbe really nice and grippy and it works\nfantastic in the dry but in the wet it's\njust a little bit slippy but nothing to\nworry about too much as long as you are\na fair weather Runner right moving on to\nsome higher price point options here and\nnow we're starting to pay for a little\nbit more Tech some softer more\nresponsive Foams and just that extra\nlevel of allout comfort and the next\nshoe we're going to have a chat about\none my most comfortable shoe of all time\nin a recent video we did we'll link to\nthat one up there and that is this the\naex Joe Nimbus version 26 which sent me\nback \u00a3180 run $160 or\n\u20ac200 drop of 8 mm in the shoe overall 42\nmil stack kite a load of phone to look\nafter those in joints and muscles when\nyou're out on your run true to size for\nme three different widths available in\nthe shoe the standard width which is\nactually pretty good I was absolutely\nfine with that wide or extra wide what I\nreally like about this shoe is it's just\nsimply the most comfortable shoe that\nI've ever worn from my running the foam\nis so soft underf fooot and the upper is\nreally really stretchy as well super\nsupportive at the back again loads of\nreally nice padded foam to look after\nyour feet no rubbing anywhere in the\nshoe no blisters no hot spots or\nanything like that and it really is a\nshoe you can just put on and absolutely\nforget about when you're going out of\nthose nice easy jogs this really is a\njoy to run in the dislikes with a shoe\nlike this because it is so soft and\nsquidgy underf fooot is a little bit\nharder to pick up the pace for some\nfaster running it's also a little bit on\nthe expensive side as well but if you're\nlooking for the most comfortable shoe to\nstart your running Journey then this one\nis definitely one to check out right\nmoving on to the most expensive shoe\nhere \u00a3210 for the new balanced fuel cell\nsuper comp trainer version 2 this is\nalso really highly rated in my\ncomfortable shoe video in terms of drop\n6 mm drop in the shoe stack height 40 mm\noverall this was true to size for me and\nthere are no different widths available\nas you might be able to see just through\nhere and if I click on it it has a piece\nof carbon that runs through the shoe\nthat just helps and assists us with our\nrunning and I think for a beginner\nRunner that wants to have a look at some\ncarbon shoes this is a really good entry\npoint into the market what I liked about\nthe shoe yes Supreme comfort with the\nshoe had absolutely no issues really\ngood for someone that's potentially\ntraining for their first marathon eats\nup those miles on those Long training\nruns it's very stable as well and the\nfoam is super bouncy it's really fun and\nengaging it puts a smile on your face as\nyou run along it really makes you want\nto run really really fast as well no\noverheating issues at all really nice\nbreathable upper the upper part of the\nshoe good air flow going through there\nas you run it's just a really good\noption if you potentially want to do\nsome races in the future or push your\npace a little bit more it is slightly on\nthe heavy side and I can't deny it over\n\u00a3200 is definitely on the expensive side\nif you've got that sort of money that's\nfantastic and this shoe will really not\nlet you down right we've got two more\nshoes to have a chat about the first one\nis a beginner Runner that's looking for\na stability shoe I'd really recommend\nhaving a look at the Brooks Adrenaline\nGTS which stands for goto support that\nsupportive element version 23 now this\nshoe sent me back\n135 35 mil stack at the back 12 mm drop\nit was true to size for me and in true\nBrook style they offer this in four\ndifferent widths available what I liked\nabout the shoe super durable this shoe\nwill last a long time and the stability\nelements of the shoe just to keep that\nArch nice and supportive on the inside\nthey are there but they're not too\nintrusive you don't really notice them\ntoo much it's just an absolute classic\ndaily option really good price point for\nsuch a longlasting shoe as well what I\ndidn't like about the shoe the Pham was\na little bit hard to start with but it\nreally does soften up over time so don't\nworry about that too much and last but\ndefinitely not least my favorite\nbeginner shoe for someone going out on\nthe trails this is perfect for someone\nthat doesn't want to do all of their\nrunning on the roads maybe live out in\nthe country side do a little bit of\noff-road running through Parks Forest\nGrass or maybe you live up in the\nmountains already and you want to\nexplore some Trails do some hiking or\nsome running on those Trails something\nthat has a little bit of extra grip for\nthose rougher surfaces my girlfriend has\nrecommended these shoes to me because\nshe is a far better Trail Runner than I\nam and it's the hoker quite a smelly h\ntaking it off H got speed goat version\nfive I've done many miles in my version\nof this as well but I thought it really\nnice she put some footage of Sarah now\nrunning in this shoe round UTMB now this\nshoe set had back \u00a340 4 mm drop overall\n38 mm stack height and it was a true to\nsize for her as well on the official\nHoka website they do offer lots of\ndifferent widths available and the\ngortex waterproof version if you're\ngoing to be doing a lot of winter\nrunning now what Sarah really liked\nabout the shoe and I I would definitely\nagree with her the viam outsole is\nreally grippy on this shoe vibr are a\nseparate company that makes them\noutsoles and their own shoes as well and\nyou're going to get some really good\ngrip in all sorts of different weather\nconditions here it's also super\ncomfortable for very long periods of\ntime Sarah ran the hold of UTMB in this\nexact pair of shoes so around about 40\nodd hours of continuous running and\nHiking through the mountains in the shoe\nand gave her absolutely no issues\nwhatsoever it's super lightweight and\nvery breathable as well some dislikes\nthe not fantastic for their durability\nsome people have had some upper issues\nwith toes poking out the side and also\nthe regular normal version of the shoe\nreally is definitely on the narrow side\nso if you have a particularly wide foot\ndefinitely check out the wider options\nhere now if I had to choose one shoe to\nrecommend above all of the others as\nwe've chatted here today I think I'd\ndefinitely go for the aex Nova blast\nversion 4 or if money's a little bit\ntighter then definitely look at the Puma\nthey're my two standout shoes for\nbeginner Runners so now you know what\nshoes to go and buy let us know how you\nget on with them but you're also going\nto want some really good beginner\nrunning tips well I've got you covered\nthere that video is coming along next\nwith my very best Runner Tips click up\nhere for that well guys keep on working\nhard keep it done we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

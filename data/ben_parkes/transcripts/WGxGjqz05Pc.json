  "text": "do you want to run faster without adding\nmore mileage to your training maybe\nyou're prone to injury when you try to\nincrease your mileage or you're juggling\na busy shedule and just can't find the\ntime or perhaps you're a bit like me at\nthe moment hitting the limit of what\nyour body's capable of each week so\nyou're looking for some other smarter\nways to perform at your best whatever\nyour reason today I'm showing my\nUltimate Guide to improving your speed\nwith no extra miles required starting\nout we're going to have a chat about\nimproving your form efficient running is\nreally like a secret superpower if you\ncan get from point A to point B as\nefficiently as possible we can get there\nfaster using the same amount of energy\nlet's have a quick chat about some of\nthe basics with good running form\nfirstly let's talk about posture we want\nto feel like we're nice and Tall\nshoulders relaxed head up and leaning\nforward from the ankles and not from the\nhips giving ourselves a nice forward\nlean secondly having a chat about the\narms your arm should swing naturally\nbeside you you don't want them to be\ncrossing over in front of your body as\nthis means a lot of wasted energy\nthrough our body twisting and having to\nstabilize that thirdly having a quick\nchat about Cadence and aiming for around\nabout that 170 to 180 steps per minute\nthis is really going to help us reduce\nthat over striding decrease our contact\ntime on the ground but how do we\nactually put these things into practice\nI'd really recommend choosing one run a\nweek to really dial down and focus on\nyour running form if it's Cadence you\nwant to improve at the time then I'd\nrecommend getting a metronome app or if\nyou've got a Garmin and I think corus do\nit you can have a metronome on that\ndevice as well and it will beep in time\nwith the Cadence that you're aiming for\nif you've got a Cadence of around about\n160 for example then maybe build that up\nto 165 for a few weeks and then build it\nup to that 170 for a few weeks don't\njump up too quickly going up about five\nsteps a minute increments at the time\nlet your body adjust it does take a\nlittle bit of time another little handy\ntip here that I really like to implement\nwhen I was really trying to work on my\nCadence is to work on that arm Drive\nincrease the speed that you're swinging\nyour arms as you run and your feet\nshould naturally FL as well right moving\non let's have a chat about giving each\nrun a purpose this is what so many\nbeginner Runners really struggle with\nmore advanced Runners will be mastering\nthis so if you are more of a beginner\nRunner take note here if you're the type\nof person that does the vast majority of\nruns all at the same Pace you saw some\ngood gains when you started running and\nthey're most likely hitting a plateau\nand you're really struggling to get\nfaster and build more speed there's\nreally a couple of different things that\ncould be going here you may well be\nrunning the vast majority of runs too\nfast really opening yourself up for the\npotential of getting injured or you\ncould be doing a lot of your runs really\ntoo easy and building a good base which\nis fantastic but you're not adding that\nspeed into your routine so you're not\ngetting faster so it's really important\nto learn to run at a range of different\npaces and intensities so I just want to\ngo through a few examples here I've got\nthree different examples three runs a\nweek four runs a week or five runs a\nweek just to demonstrate what I mean by\nthis range of Paces that we want to\nbuild in our routine starting out\nsomeone running three runs a week the\nfirst run of the week most likely to be\na interval speed session the alltime\nclassic 6x3 minutes we're going to doing\nour reps here at that 5K pace so tick\nthat one off nice 5K pace for bu routine\nthe second run of the week most likely\nto be a shorter but a very much sort of\neasy run Pace to get our legs nicely\nrecovered at the weekend a longer run\nagain that easy run pace so not a load\nof different Paces there really for\nbeginner Runners around three times a\nweek we've got easy run pace and that 5K\nPace Building that in throughout the\nweek as we progress a little bit up to\nfour runs a week we're now going to be\nadding in a tempo run into our week as\nwell around about 20 minutes at around\nabout our 10K to half marathon pace\nthat's another Pace we've now built into\nour week take that one off up to five\nruns a week now more experienced Runners\nwe're now probably going to add another\neasy run into our week so another tick\nthere for some more easy pace and then\npotentially adding some strides at the\nend of that run around about that sort\nof 3K pace something like that when\nyou're really sort of opening up the\nlegs building some really good strength\nand working on our running form so\nthat's another Pace tick add that one in\nthere and then during our long run we\nmight add some marathon pace blocks in\nthere for example so that's a marathon\npace tick into the routine as well there\nif you want some real guidance on your\nPaces the type of Paces you should be\ndoing a lot of these runs out we've got\na completely free pacing chart I'll put\nit up on the screen now and we'll link\nto it down below just go to the website\nhit download it will just appear on your\ncomputer absolutely free of course and\nstart building some different Paces into\nyour routine and I'm guarantee you'll\nsee your Fitness really improving both\nthat endurance and that speed as well\nnow maybe you're the type of Runner that\ndoesn't love doing speed sessions maybe\nyou're a bit more of an older Runner\nfavors running on Hills rather than\ngoing that all out paac whatever the\nreason we can also look at doing some\nHill reps in there to replace that speed\nsession or you can just get a mix some\nweeks of speed session some weeks we're\ndoing hill sessions not everyone's got\nHills available to them but if you have\nthese are fantastic running up pills\nreally help strengthen our glutes our\nhamstrings our calves also help building\non that running form as well getting\nthat nicely landing on our midfoot which\nis really a lot easier to do as we're\nrunning uphill so what I recommend a\nvery basic guide to my Hill runs here\nfind a hill with a moderate incline\ndon't worry too much finding that\nperfect Hill something around 4 to 6% is\ngoing to be really good for doing hill\nreps run up the hill of that steady hard\neffort for around about 30 to 60 seconds\nsomewhere in that range is going to be\nreally good focus on driving those knees\nup and pumping your arms as I said to\nreally help build that Cadence as well\nand then jog or walk back down to the\nstart make sure our heart rate is now\nnicely recovered at the bottom of the\nrep start with around about four to six\nreps then work your way up to around\nabout 8 to 10 reps definitely build into\nroutine if you can if you got those\nheels there this is really going to help\nget some more value out of your weekly\nmileage moving on to have a chat all\nabout recovery in order to train hard\nand Implement these more intense\nsessions into our week you need to be\nable to recover a lot better as well\nmake sure you're stretching those major\nmuscle groups after your runs so your\nhamstrings your carves and your quads as\nwell we've got a full cool down routine\nthat you can follow along to it really\njust takes a few minutes but it's going\nto make a big difference when it comes\nto getting ready for your next run I'd\nreally recommend using a foam roller as\nwell if you can for some more intense\nself massage sessions potentially in the\nevening or a massage gun to release any\nsort of tight spots you've got as well\nbut as always with these things use some\nfollow along guides on YouTube to make\nsure you're using them in the most\nefficient way possible doing things also\nlike yoga to improve your mobility and\nstrengthen those stabilizing muscles are\nreally good with running as well again\ncheck out someone like Adrienne on\nYouTube do some of those follow along\nroutines and then finally refuel after\nyour runs with that recovery Shake as\nlong as you're getting around about that\n3:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio it\njust kickstarts that recovery process to\nhelp rebuild those muscles and then\nfinally of course getting some really\ngood sleep is going to make that all\nimportant difference as that's when our\nwhole body is repairing to come back\nstronger the next day now you may have\nheard of the term cross trining getting\nsome alternative different types of\ncardio there's no doubt about it but\nrunning more really is the best way of\nadding running Fitness but as we said at\nthe start of the video that's not going\nto be available to everyone we can't\njust keep running more and more we all\nhave those limits so we can look at\nother ways of adding that cardio Fitness\nwith things like cycling ellipticals and\nswimming as well to build that endurance\nthat speed and that V2 Max even more but\nbecause the impact of these types of\ncross train activities is so much less\nthan with running our heart rate zones\nare also different for these activities\nas well so to get the same intensity and\nthat effort we need to spend a bit more\ntime doing them than we would if we were\nrunning you can't simply replace a 30\nminute run with a 30-minute elliptical\nand expect to get the same sort of\neffect so for example my sort of Rough\nGuide with this one that I use in my own\ntraining so if I'd like to add an extra\n60-minute run into my week this would\nroughly mean spending around 2 hours on\nthe cross trainer with where my own\ntraining is at the moment I've taken out\na couple of double run days which I'd\nusually like to do and I could do them\nquite well a few years ago so i' have\ntaking out two 30 minute runs throughing\nthe week and replacing them with two\n60-minute sessions on the lip it's also\npossible to add some extra intensity\ninto our week if that's what you want to\nbuild in similar to our run sessions we\ncan do these on the cross trainer or the\nbike as well just by increasing the\nresistance of the machines so using our\nearlier example of that 6x3 minute\nsession really quite easy to do this on\na cross trainer just increasing the\nresistance for those 3 minutes and then\ndial it back down again for the recovery\nbikes are really good to replicate some\nof our longer more sustained efforts I\nfind as well so if you're looking to add\nmaybe a 20 minute Tempo into your\nroutine but don't want to do that via\nrunning then doing this 20-minute Tempo\non the bike is definitely something that\nis possible if you want to look at a\ncouple of elite athletes and have some\ndeep Dives on some podcasts and some\ninterviews with them Jess Stenson in\nAustralia doing a lot of her cross\ntraining on the elliptical or a famous\nexample here in the UK well he actually\nlives in the Netherlands now Jake Smith\ndoes a lot of again cross training on\nthe cross trainer using the assault bike\nas well and has also done a lot of\nstrength training in the last couple of\nyears as he's been quite an injury-prone\nathlete recently but it's really\nstarting to pay dividends as he's coming\nback into some really good form at the\nmoment and then building on that little\npoint there from Jake Smith while this\nis definitely going improving our\ncardiovascular system we're not getting\nthat resistance back up from the road\nthat we need so we also need to be doing\nsome strength training as part of our\nroutine to get our legs strong or even\nstronger so we can cover the ground in a\nmore efficient way as well as we touch\non the start so let's have a chat all\nabout strength training so strength\ntraining is so relevant at the moment so\nmany of our Elite Runners are building\nthis into routine by building our\nmuscles especially our legs and our core\nto create more power with each stride\nagain we're just going to get it from\npoint A to point B more efficiently\nagain this becomes even more important\nas we age so so if you're in that 30\nplus 40 plus 50 plus age category for me\nit's now complete non-negotiable I have\nto be doing this if I want to keep my\nrunning fast and serious and relatively\ncompetitive so I'd really recommend\nfocusing on some key exercises the\nthings I'm focusing on at the moment are\nsquats and lunges these are going to\nTarget those glutes those quads\nhamstrings as well these are the three\nPowerhouse muscles of running and then\nalso focus on some good core exercises\nsome planks some bridges why it's so\nimportant to strengthen that core during\nthe back end of races especially running\nfor sort of suffers they become fatigued\nas muscles fatigue and our upper body\ncan be moving around all over the place\njust wasting so much energy here that\nstrong core will keep everything tore\nand just allow us to move in the most\nefficient way for as long as possible so\nagain how do I recommend putting this in\npractice how do I put this into practice\nputting a short circuit together a lot\nof these things you can simply do at\nhome doing things just something like 10\nsquats 10 reverse lunges 10 Bridges and\nthen a 30second plank if you're new to\nstrength training like this do two to\nthree rounds of this and then over time\nbuild up to five to six rounds again as\nyou progress add some weights add some\nkettle bells to these routines so there\nwe have it getting faster isn't all\nabout running but as I said throughout\nthis video running really is the best\nway we can be doing this but it's not\nalways available to everyone there's\nlots of other things we can be doing on\ntop of that mileage once we've maxed out\nthat mileage all these other things come\ninto play so we can become a better\nfaster happier stronger Runner overall\nlet me know which tip you're going to be\ntrying first any tips you'd like to\nshare with the running Community down\nbelow next up we've got a video all\nabout how to improve your running form\nso go and check that one out over here\nthat's it guys keep on working hard keep\nwork done I'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

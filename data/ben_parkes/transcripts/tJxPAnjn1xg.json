  "text": "you've gone through months and months of\ntraining done countless miles and now\nthe big day is finally here you'll no\ndoubt be nervous and a little bit\nstressed about the day ahead especially\nif you're running your first marathon\nand not knowing what to expect well\ntoday we've got a full race day\nstepbystep guide to get you from the\nstart to the finish with full time\nstamps throughout the video to help ease\nyour nerves and get you pumped up for\nthe great Marathon that we know you're\ngoing to have so with 2 to 3 hours to go\nwe're going to wake up get out of bed\nthe first thing I like to do is check\nthe weather for ask is it going to be as\nexpected is it all good do we need to\nmake any last minute changes it's likely\nthat you won't have slept that great but\ndon't worry about this it's happened to\nme so many times and so many other\nthousands of Runners around the world it\nreally doesn't make too much difference\njust get up and get your breakfast down\nyou that's the most important thing we\nshould be doing in the morning for me I\nlove to have a bagel or two Bagels\npeanut butter and jam now you might not\nbe feeling like eating too much at this\ntime of day most likely due to some\nnerves and you might be just a little\nbit earlier than you'd normally be\nhydration here is also equally really\nimportant for me I'm trying to have\nabout 1 and 1/2 to 2 L before the race\nthis is usually for me about 2/3 of my\nvolume out having in a sporty\ncarbohydrate drink something like a\nMorton 320 or a Precision hydration carb\nmix and then for the other third in a\nseparate bottle I'll have some\nelectrolyte fluids in there as well I'll\nbe sipping on these drinks throughout\nthe whole morning all the way up to the\nstart line and then while I'm sipping on\nmy drinks I'm getting all of my race day\nkit ready as well I I've laid it out all\nnicely the night before and then's\ndouble checking I've got everything have\nI got my number have I got my pins to\nput my race number on have I got my\ntiming chip as well my Watch My Shoes my\ncap my singlet and my socks then there\nmight be some other little bits and\npieces that you going to need as well\nthat you can take off your checklist\nthings like headphones if you're going\nto be using those your gels how you\ncarrying everything your pack or your\nwaistband plasters body Glide your\nmobile phone just get all of this into\nyour drop off bag that you're going to\nbe taking to the store D line and also\nat this time of day you want to be\nthinking post race as well maybe a\nlittle snack for when you finish the\nrace you can get something down quite\nquickly for me I like to put a recovery\nshake mix in there some powder that's\nready to go also some flip-flops because\nmy feet will probably swollen up a\nlittle bit during the race flip-flops\nare usually the most comfortable thing\nand then really the most important thing\npostr is some warm clothes your body is\ngoing to be pretty trashed after the\nmarathon and keeping warm is just a\nlittle bit harder marathons tend to not\nbe at the warmest time of year as well\nso nice big Puff jacket to put on after\nthe race moving on about about 1 to 2\nhours to go we're probably in a car\nwe're on a train we're on a subway\nheading to the race village where the\nstart of the marathon will be this\nreally is now the time to focus on what\nis coming up think back over all the\ntraining that you've been doing\nreiterate your why what has got you to\nthis moment why are you doing this we've\nall got our own personal reasons go\nthrough your a b and c goals as well be\nso proud of yourself you've made the\nstart line that is a massive achievement\nto do two in long distance running now 1\nhour to go we'll hopefully arrived at\nthe race Village I personally like to\nget there a little bit earlier than that\nwhat I really like to do first is one\nfind the toilets go to the loot and then\nfind where I'm going to be dropping my\nbag off because that's a real stressor\nfor me there'll be big bag drop places I\njust like to pinpoint where those two\nthings are that's all I'm focused on for\nthe next hour or so pre-ra make sure\nyou've bought your own L roll as well\njoin the back of the L queue or the\nPorta poty L as soon as you get there\nand come out the L and then maybe go\nstraight to the back of the queue again\nbecause by the time you get to the front\nof it you're going to need to go a lot\nof pre-ra nerves a lot of people are\ngoing to be needing to go to the L more\nfrequently than you might regularly be\ndoing because you're going to be\nnaturally quite nervous about what is\ncoming up now is a good time to get the\ngels out of your bag get your pack on or\nyour belt on get everything in there\nthat you're going to be taking through\nthe race for me I need to get my camera\nand my GoPro out and put that in my\nwaistband as well then now it's time to\ngo and check that bag in and make sure\nyou've taken a nice warm item with you\nthe sweater something you're going to\ndiscard on the start line just to keep\nyou nice and warm most races will then\ndonate these clothes so don't feel too\nguilty about chucking something away\nright the nerves are going to be rising\nabout 30 minutes to go before they off\nfor me carrying on sipping on my sports\ndrink getting a banana down is something\nI really like to do just helps settle my\nstomach a little bit as well and also\nperson in some Road Racers like to take\na little em modium tablet again just to\nhelp s my stomach I do not want to be\ngoing to the L during the race that's\nnot what I'd recommend everybody to do\nbut it's just something that works for\nme and I've always done it it's also now\ntime to start to think about having a\nlittle jog around and getting ourselves\nnice and warmed up dynamic stretches and\ngoing for a little jog this is a really\ngood time to do this when we're our\nCorrals or our starting pens we're not\ngoing to be able to do that it's going\nbe very busy in there for me it's\nusually about about 5 to 10 minutes of\nvery slow jogging just getting\neverything moving and nicely warmed up\nand then lots of dynamic stretches my\nleg swings opening and closing the gate\nand also a good time to check while\nwe're doing our warming up how are our\nshoes feeling are they too tight are\nthey too loose hopefully they're just\nright but now is the time to readjust\nour lacing and making sure we've got a\nreally good solid lockdown we don't want\nto be having uncomfortable slipping\nshoes just as the race starts the more\nimportant the race for me the more times\nI double knot or triple knot or\nquadruple knot my laces Valencia ran I\nthink I did five different knots with my\nlaces they were never coming undone so\nmake sure your shoes feel nice and\nsecure it's time to head to the start\nline and get yourself in that start line\npen then around about 8 to 5 minutes to\ngo I like to get my GPS watch locked on\nnice and early with the amount of people\naround looking for GPS you want to get\nthat locked on nice and early I think\nthe garments don't time out for about 10\nminutes so got about 8 minutes to go I\nlike to get that nicely locked on ready\nto go time to ditch that warm layer\nmaybe have a chat to a few other people\naround you just keep your nerves in\ncheck and then before you know it's the\nrace start thousands of people crossing\nthe start line including you offer an\namazing adventure for maybe the next two\nif you get dry three four five 6 7 hours\nwhatever it's going to be wishing you\nthe very best of luck now these are my\ntop tips for what you should be doing\nduring the race the first one as we\nstart know your Paces be patient ignore\nwhat everyone else around you is doing\neveryone's going to have their own goals\nso many people go off far too fast at\nthe start of the race and don't get\nsucking into their Pace or suddenly\nthinking you can go 30 minutes faster\nthan you've actually prepared for if you\ndo suddenly decide to go off way quicker\nthose last 6 miles are going to be\nreally really horrible around about 30\nminutes into the race you should be\nnicely settled in and feeling quite\nrelaxed hopefully the rad have got a\nlittle bit quieter because it can be\npretty chaotic at the start of marathon\nraces this is really when you're going\nto start to think about having your\nfirst gel we recommend taking something\naround about every 30 to 40 minutes\nduring the marathon but whatever you've\ndone in training whatever gels you've\nbeen using in your training for me it's\nnormally a Morton gel or Precision\nhydration gel but only use what you've\nbeen practicing with in your training\nthings are probably going to be\nhopefully feeling very comfortable at\nthe stage as still don't be tempted to\ngo any faster you really should be\nrunning it at your goal Pace or slightly\nslower than your goal Pace at this point\ndon't get stressed out about it too much\nit's all part of the plan now in terms\nof water stations my goal is always\nlittle and often don't go try and\ngulping or glugging massive loads of\nwater at each station that's going to\nslow you down it's going to really feel\nquite uncomfortable as well so to just\nsip little and often now one of the most\nimportant sections of the marathon is\nhalfway to 20 mi keep ticking off those\nsplits I like to focus on simply the\nparticular K or the particular mile that\nI'm running in I just focus on that on\nmy watch lap pace for the particular K\nor particular Mark and I'm now I'm\nstarting to think about picking up the\npace a little bit gradually as well and\nmaking back some of that deficit from\nthe first half the race gels might have\nbecome a little bit harder to get down\nnow but you really got to work on\ngetting those down and no doubt by this\nstage of the race you'll have probably\nstarted to run in a little group of\npeople around you maybe you're in a\npacing group as well which we'd always\nreally recommend just look around you\ntake it all in what you're doing is\nabsolutely amazing running a marathon\nand just give yourself a little mental\npat on the back and just say you can do\nthis push on and keep ticking off those\nsmiles and now we've approached the\nhardest part what all of this is about\nwhat makes the marathon so amazingly\nspecial the final six miles but why it\nmakes it special because it's so\ndifficult but don't worry you done the\ntraining set won't be too bad some\npeople say this is the real halfway\npoint of the race and it really is in\nterms of effort the first 20 miles and\nthe last six miles effort wise they're\nprobably going to be around about the\nsame think of your Mantra think of your\nwhy focus on the runners that are up\nahead of you and if you paced your\nMarathon quite well you're going to\nstart to pick those people off just keep\ntrying to push the pace as much as you\ncan and it really does feel very good\nwhen you start overtaking people towards\nthe back end of a marathan one of the\nnicest feelings in the world but yeah\nsorry to those people they should have\nwatched more of my videos and Pac it a\nlittle bit better some Runners like to\nthink of their loved ones at this stage\nas well and dedicate one of the last six\nMars to each one of those people just\nfocusing on them in your mind and it\nreally will just help to Spur you on but\nessentially you're trying to hold it\ntogether you can do this you've trained\nfor it and you can get it done whatever\nyou've got left in the tank now is the\ntime to empty it take in the atmosphere\nand the crowds maybe it's time for a few\nhigh fives to pump yourself up and get\nthat Marathon done and then before you\nknow it you'll be crossing the finish\nline hands in the air you are now a\nmarathon finisher or multile Marathon\nfinisher get your medal get a bottle of\nwater whatever else they're giving out\nto rehydrate start getting that recovery\nprocess done as soon as possible but\nreally take a moment to recognize what\nyou've just done what you've achiev you\nare amazing and now you're going to have\nan amazing story to tell all of those\nloved ones around you for the rest of\nyour life about this incredible\nachievement you've just done then it's\ntime to go and collect your bag put on\nthose warm clothes meet your friends and\nfamily potentially go out for some food\nwhatever you fancy it really doesn't\nmatter and then finally take some photos\nremember this moment get your medal\nphotos you may not feel like being up\nthere smiling straight away but future\nyou will really appreciate then of\ncourse finally get that run up on stra\nand show everybody how amazing you've\nbeen then in terms of the rest of the\nday and maybe the days after it's really\nimportant just to keep mobile keep\nwalking around keep hydrating through\nthe afternoon and the evening then yeah\nobviously you're going to travel back\nhome to a hotel wherever you're staying\nget a good shower just chill and relax\nin the sofa you might not be feeling\nthat hungry a lot of people don't it's\namazing how much you think of having a\nmassive pizza or bowl of pasta when you\nfinish the race and then you actually\nfinish it you lose all your appetite I'm\nnot sure what that's all about but it's\nhappened to me many times but probably\nby dinner you're going to have a pretty\nraging appetite and then get yourself\nsome good sleep again it's really odd\nafter a marathon for me I really don't\nsleep very well your body's just going\nthrough a massive recovery process You'\nprobably got a bit of an elevated heart\nrate a little bit warm and things like\nthat so you might not sleep very good\nstraight after the race but don't worry\nyour body will get back to normal pretty\nsoon so yes you've been amazing but what\ncould make you even more amazing uh is\nto have a much better stronger mental\ngame which is so important with Marathon\nrunning so that video is coming up next\nall the mental tips and tricks to help\nyou exceed it your marath that's just up\nhere keep it working hard guys keep down\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

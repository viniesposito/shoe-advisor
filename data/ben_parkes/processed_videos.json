everybody else of course if\nyou are a sub 39 minute runner in the\nlast year or so as a man or a sub 45\nRunner as a woman you can race with the\nelites here on the start in this\nseparate event that happens just after\nwhat they call the International Event\nso I actually bizar did have a\nqualifying time because I did how to run\na sub 40 10K video so could use that to\nenter this event but I we

      "text": "this year I spent \u00a3\n7,952 buying running shoes to be able to\ntest here on the channel to give you\nthose completely honest unsponsored\nreviews and that's about just over\n$10,000 for our American friends and of\nall the pairs I've tested along the way\nthere have been some absolute bangers\nout there that I've really enjoyed and\ncarried on using after the videos have\ngone up from that initial testing so\nthat's what this video is all about the\nbest of the best all the shoes that we\nbuy here on the channel to review and\ntest I buy 100% with my money so just\nwant to say a massive thank you this\nyear to everyone that supports the\nchannel likes our videos comments on the\nvideos checks out my website benp\nparks.com buys running hats technical\ngear our festar rated plans I love\nhearing all about your stories your\nsuccesses with the kit and the plans and\nthe videos as well so thank you so so\nmuch so in this video we're going to be\ngoing through the best daily the best\nspeed shoe the best race shoe the best\nMax stack recovery shoes the best long\nrun shoes the best budget shoes the most\ncomfortable shoes the best for heavier\nRunners the best for beginners and then\nfinally the best overall so make sure\nyou stay tuned for that feel free to\nmove the slider around in the video\neverything will be timestamped so\nstarting out with the best daily shoes\nand the Nova blast 5 but what's a daily\nshoe all about these really are shoes\nthat do it all pretty well great for\nthose daily Mars for people that just\nwant to maybe just have one shoe in\ntheir rotation or it's going to be a\nstaple of a big shoe rotation as well\nthe shoe where you're clocking up most\nof your miles and this was a late entry\nthis year it's only just come in the\nnumber five Nova Blast from aex set me\nback\n\u00a335 a 41 mil stack cut at the back 8 mm\ndrop overall 300 G so nicely on the\nlight side new updated midsole with the\nFF blast Max sizing wise what worked\nbest for me was going half aze down\nright starting out with my likes a\nreally smooth stable ride with this one\nit's very bouncy it's very cushioned it\nlooks after the legs well on those\nlonger runs a true daily trainer the\nshoe's really comfortable at lots of\ndifferent speeds second like really good\nvalue at this price segment it's well\nput together good build quality as well\nand should last a decent amount of time\nthird like comfort with the shoe again\nreally good I'm really liking the new\nlacing system they've got on the Nova\nblast 5 giving a really good solid\nlockdown and again with this partially\nusted tongue in there that's not moving\naround and providing any irritation it\ndoes feel a little bit wider up front\nhere so if you've got a wider foot\nyou're going to Rejoice here a little\nbit of extra material just really comfy\nstraight out the box and some good\nbreathability as well my next like is\nyou've just got a lot of cushion here\nversus the weight of the shoe sho's\nquite nice and lightweight but you've\ngot lots of chunky foam here to look\nafter the legs it feels really\nlightweight on your foot as well so\nkudos for aex for getting this around\nfor me around about 300 G my fifth like\nis the true versatility of this shoe\njust very easy to run in no fuss really\nsimple and again really easy for me to\nrecommend it just gets on does the job\nno matter what distance or Pace is on\nthe plan it's going to look after you\npretty well in terms of what I don't\nlike about the shoe the dislikes the wet\nweather grip real shame at this time of\nyear as well it's just surprisingly not\ngood the version four of this was\nequally as bad and unfortunately they\nhaven't changed the compound of the\nrubber on the bottom you might be\nslipping around a little bit with this\nshoe in the winter but in the dry and in\nthe summer you're going to be all good\nso in summary the Nova blast 5 one of\nthe best all rounders out there a really\ngreat shoe at this price point whether\nyou're going to get your bolt training\nin or you just want one shoe in your\nrotation to do at all if you are worried\nabout that winter grip let's have a chat\nabout the aded ass Boston that's coming\nup next so my next best daily shoe of\nthe year is the Adidas Boston version 12\ngot some really good winter grip on the\nbottom of here so you don't need to\nworry about sliding round without us\nthis fantastic Continental grip but this\nshoe sent me back\n\u00a3140 38 mil stack out at the back 7 mil\ndrop overall for me 318 G little bit\nheavier than the Nova blast but still\nnot too bad midso wise we've got a layer\nof the ultra light light strip Pro added\nasses at premium foam and then a layer\nof the light strip 2.0 Eva and it's also\ngot some glass fiber infused energy rods\nin here kind of like a play added as his\nversion of a plate with these rods that\nrun through the shoe sizing wise these\ndo come up a little bit big for me I\nordered my usual UK size 12 had a bit\ntoo much room at the front of the shoe\nprobably due to the very minimal amount\nof padding at the back of the shoe but\nyeah that's just me I'd recommend going\nhalf aze down right let's have a chat\nabout my likes starting out with that\nexcellent grip that Continental rubber\noutsa really fantastic for wet weather\nthe second like here it just delivers\nthat fun engaging ride it's really happy\nto pick up the pace probably a little\nbit more than the Nova blast because of\nthose rods you've got running through\nthe shoe the ride feels surprisingly\nfast it feels like you spent a lot more\nthan 140 to get the kind of speed that\nyou'll be able to pull out of this shoe\nthis update here bought that slightly\nwider base so stability again\nsurprisingly good in the shoe this is a\nshoe I could definitely see someone\nracing a 5k all the way up to a Marathon\ndistance so true versatility and then my\nfinal like with the shoe it also feels\nnice and lightweight on the foot the\ncushion really helps with those longer\nruns and as say pretty wide in the upper\nwhich is really good for an anad shoe\nnormally they do come in very much on\nthe narrow side but the Boston don't\nneed to worry about that plenty of space\nup front in terms of dislikes with the\nBoston just that minimal padding around\nthe heel that's just kind of what you\ngot with this update it didn't cause me\nany problems i' just like a little bit\nmore Comfort there for my longer runs\nsome people might get some heel slip and\nthe tongue is just a little bit on the\nshort side so you can't do that heel\nlock down lacing I didn't have any\nissues with it it just something that\nmight well happen but in summary with\nthe Boston just a great all round daily\nshoe it's got that more assisted ride\ncompared to something like the Nova\nblast it's not quite as comfortable as\nthe Nova blast but it's definitely\nslightly faster and you're going to pick\nup the pace a little bit more with the\nBoston but if you do want to pick up the\npace a little bit more than that let's\nhave a chat about the best speaches of\n2024 right we've got a couple of speed\nshoes to chat about now some very\ndifferent types of speed shoes as well\nthese are for when you want a nice\nSnappy fast shoe for doing some of your\nworkouts in for your faster efforts your\ntempos or your thresholds or maybe some\nshorter races as well although really\nyou can do a lot of different racing in\nthese shoes there really are those shoes\nthat are just that one down from the\nallout Super Shoes starting out with one\nof my very best shoes of the Year stay\ntuned to see if it makes the best shoe\nof the year the Nike Zoom Flight version\n6 this has been an absolute joy to run\nin this set me back\n\u00a315 really big maximum stack cut at the\nback 42 mil so just over that legal\nlimit 8 mm drop overall Weight Wise\ngetting a little bit heavier now\n322 G midsole wise we've got a couple of\ndifferent Foams here on top we've got a\nnice layer of Nike's Flagship zoomx\nmidsole and then underneath we've got\nthis EVA foam which Nike called the sr2\nfoam that's a little bit firmer but adds\na little bit more stability and also\nsome really good durability and support\nin there as well there is a carbon fiber\nPL PL in the shoe Nike call that a fly\nplate and that sandwich between those\ntwo layers of foam and this was true to\nsize for me right let's chat about the\nlikes there's quite a few to get through\nhere the first one being the comfort\nthat this shoe offers really fantastic\nthe heel counter lock down really good\ngood amount of padding at the back of\nthe shoe so you feel nice and secure no\nissues with any sort of slipping good\namount of width up at the front of the\nshoe as well really comfortable for\nthose longer runs could certainly run up\nto a Marathon distance in this shoe it\njust has that all day Comfort feel about\nit second one speed wise I've been\nreally surprised at the speed I've been\nable to extract from the shoe version\nfive the one before this was super\nchunky really heavy this one is lighter\nand it just feels and is a lot faster as\nwell the rocker at the front of the shoe\nhere just gives a really smooth\nfootstrike really smooth turnover and I\nactually found myself always looking\nforward to the next rep the midsole\nmashup that you've got here with those\ntwo different Foams it's just really\nresponsive and so so bouncy you really\nfeel like the shoe is just propelling\nyou forward you could Cruise along at\nthose Marathon effort Paces for a very\nlong time the plate isn't super stiff\nyou don't really notice it too much and\nit really helps with that stability in\nthe shoe as well and I'd really say this\nSho is only slightly slower for me\nversus my alphafly and my vapor fly and\nthey're much much stiffer and of course\nmuch more expensive as well my third\nlike with this shoe is just the True\nValue at this price point it appears to\nbe really quite well well built and\ndurable the out soole really really good\ngreat grip on this outs soole is just\nnot wearing at all at the moment and I\nwas carried on running the shoe well\nafter 100 miles which is really\nimpressive given the amount of fast\nrunning I haven't done too much jogging\nin this shoe most of the time I've been\ndoing my speed sessions those fast\nrunning efforts as well and carbon\nplates at this Price Point again pretty\nhard to find odd that Nike have kind of\npric this very competitively but I think\nthey thought they've got a real winner\non their hands here they've got to\nlaunch this with an attractive price\npoint to real sort of say their back on\nthe scene and a lot of people check up\nand notice just how good this shoe is at\nthat price point but as I say it's not\nall likes a couple of dislikes three\ndislikes to go through actually the\nfirst one with this waffle outsole\nNike's waffle outsole is just a little\nbit noisy again it's just something to\nnote here if you run by yourself it\ndoesn't matter but if you're a little\nbit self-conscious it might be a little\nbit noisy but you're getting some really\ngood grip in the shoe there as well the\nrear stability it's just a little soft\nat the back of the shoe that might put\nsome heel Strikers off for me I'm a\nmidfoot or 4ot sort of Striker so I\nhaven't really had any issues there and\nthirdly I don't know let me know what\nyou think down in the comments it's just\nnot the prettiest shoe again does that\nmatter if we're running fast let me know\nyour thoughts but in summary a really\ngood option for anyone training for a\nfull Marathon or a half marathon to do\nthose speed workouts those longer run\nworkouts with those race Pace blocks in\nalso a good option for racing for people\nthat don't want to break the bank and\nspend 200 plus 250 I think the alpha FES\nare \u00a389 and absolutely crazy that's not\navailable to everybody so again a really\ngood option for a significant amount of\nchange just a great value shoe a lot of\ntech and a really good price point right\nlet's look at something a little bit\nmore lowkey which was the socy Endorphin\nspeed 4 so I got the socony shoe in In\nThis Very vibrant colorway earlier on\nthis year used it a little bit through\nthe summer there's a much lower stack\nheite lot more ground feel you're going\nto get in this shoe compared to the Nike\nbut starting out I paid \u00a3180 for this\nshoe little bit on the expensive side\nfor this segment stack cut at the back\n36 mm 8 mm drop overall weightwise a lot\nlighter though 285 G really can pick up\nthe pace so well in this shoe we've got\nsoers power run PB foam here a nylon\nplate so it's not too aggressive not\nlike that full stiff carbon plates that\nyou get sizing wise this was good this\nwas true to size for me starting out\nwith my lik's really versatile shoe I\nactually put this shoe in my sort of big\ndaily recommendation because you can jog\naround in the shoe just as much as you\ncan pick up the pace in the shoe as well\nso it kind of goes between the two\ncategories you could easily go out for\nan easy run with stries Tempo runs track\nsessions and even races for me i' say up\nto a half marathon personally wouldn't\nwant to do a marathon this I'm sure some\npeople have but for me up to a Half\nMarathon distance I just personally want\na little bit more cushion in the Foams\nthere for a Marathon distance and then\nI'm really liking the plate in this shoe\nit's not super aggressive it feels\nreally nice at those easy running Paces\nso for your warm up and cool down and\njust jogging around between reps as well\nfeels super comfortable there and my\nsecond like with the shoe we've got a\ntouch on it because it's so lightweight\nit's Nimble it's Snappy but also really\nstable as well just got that fast\nengaging ride good ground feel for those\npeople that like a little bit more\nground feel that's what you're going to\nget in their shoe for a fast park run\nfantastic grip on the bottom of the shoe\nas well good stability in the corners it\nthe lock down it holds your foot nicely\nin place but let's have a chat about a\ncouple of dislikes for some people this\nis going to be a little bit too firm I'd\nrecommend then going for that Nike\noption if you want that super soft super\nbouncy super squishy responsive type\nshoe go for the Nike if you want a bit\nmore ground contact feel again it's\nstill responsive and it's still py but\nyou just don't have as much sort of\nrange of motion in the cushion you don't\nsink into the foam as much with this\nshoe so there maybe a dislike maybe a\nlike I never know what to say in these\nthings it depends what type of shoe\nyou're after but because of that flip\nside I think it's probably a little bit\ntoo firm for that Marathon distance for\nme I'd like a little bit more cushion in\nthere so better suited this shoe 5Ks\n10ks half marathons you're going to\nreally enjoy that lightweight nature of\nthe shoe but in summary who do I\nrecommend the sakon Endorphin speed 4\nit's a really great option for someone\ndoing a lot of speed work a lot of\ntempos lot of thresholds anyone looking\nfor that lightweight shoe that isn't\nprobably going to be into their\nmarathons too much or anyone just\nlooking for that lightweight Snappy shoe\nthat they can really pick up the pace\nand run very fast with a high Cadence in\nas well but probably just steering away\nfrom those super long runs or that\nmarathon training right let's have a\nchat about the big Racing shoes of the\nYear those Super Shoes starting out with\nthe shoe that I think I've raced three\nmarathons in this year which is the very\nlovely Nike fly version 3 so this set me\nback\n\u00a3285 I probably bought it on sport shoes\nwith a bit of a discount code but that's\nthe RRP anyway stack C at the back right\nof that legal limit 40 mm 8 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise a staggering 269 G\nso lightweight for the volume and the\namount of foam in this shoe mid wise\nwe've got a full chunk of Nike Zoom X\nfoam here two Air Zoom Pods at the front\nof the shoe and a carbon fiber plate\nthat's running throughout the shoe as\nwell sizing wise all good here this was\ntrue to size for me starting out with my\nlikes it's just a super smooth ride that\nyou're getting in alphafly version 3\nversus 1 and two 1 and two were just a\nlittle bit clunky this one is so much\nsmoother through the footstrike it's\nvery lightweight especially given the\nsize and the bulk of the shoe if you are\na heel Striker this shoe again is going\nto be a lot smoother than vers version\none and version two my second like\nthey've just dialed up that Comfort\nagain in version 3 just a little bit\nmore the breathable upper you're getting\nso much air flow through this shoe\nyou're getting a really good solid\nlockdown with this fly knit upper it\njust hugs the feet so well just like\nyou've got an extra pair of socks I've\nhad absolutely no issues with any\nblisters any hot spots or anything\nuncomfortable at all no discomfort\nduring any of my marathons or training\nruns and I did have plenty of issues\nwith the alpha 5 1 and version two\nespecially just here on the inside it's\njust a little bit too built up and I was\ngetting some rubbing and irritations\nthere for me that's definitely gone away\nwith version 3 just finding a little bit\nfaster than the first two versions and a\nlittle bit more comfort as well my third\nlike with the shoe is just the\ndurability that this one offers I think\nI did my review of this shoe after 250\nmiles and I was just really surprised at\njust how Poppy the foam was holding up\nhow popular the airpods were it just\nwasn't slowing down even after those 250\nMI of course I was getting a little bit\nof wear as we're now getting on this\npair here and I've done about 100ks in\nthis shoe that's always going to happen\nbut it just didn't feel any slower when\nI had a brand new pair on one foot and\nmyly older pair on the other they both\nfelt really surprisingly good I really\nthink most people could get about 3 to\n400 miles of good happy training miles\nand racing miles out of this shoe and\nreally don't listen to all the\nmanufactur saying you're only going to\nget 100 good K they just want you to buy\nmore shoes they really do last a long\ntime this dislikes really still a little\nbit on the noisy side I'll put some\nfootage of me running the mabor marathon\nhere going through the park you can just\nhear the shoe again if you're a little\nbit self-conscious they're a bit Slappy\nthat's just what you get but they're\nsuper fast my second one they're still a\nlittle bit on the narrow side through\nthe midfoot so if you have got a\nparticularly wide foot through that area\nyou might still be getting a little bit\nof irritation but those tweaks they made\nwere all good for me and then yeah just\nthe price this is pretty much the most\nexpensive running shoe you can buy I\nknow added have got their one at \u00a3400 I\ndon't think anyone's really entertaining\nthat you've really got to be an elite\nathlete to get the most of that anyway\nbut nearly \u00a3300 the alpha fly it's just\na lot of money but for me it's the\nfastest shoe that I've run in this year\nespecially over those half marathon and\nMarathon distances but I didn't do all\nof my races in this shoe we did actually\nreach for another shoe just here that's\nbeing pass to me done a lot of training\nMars I actually ran New York marathan\nlast year in this shoe but this is still\nthe current shoe from Nike and I ran\nLondon marathon in this shoe and I ran\nBoston Marathon in this shoe earlier on\nthis year pricewise this sent me back\n\u00a3240 stack kite I said we going the\nwrong way around Stack kite 40 mil stack\nat the back of the shoe 8 mm drop\noverall and Weight Wise are very nice\n252 G so it's a little bit lighter than\nthe alphafly but it's a lot lower volume\noverall we've got Nike zoomx from\nmidsole and we're getting that all\nimportant carbon fiber plate and this\nwas true to size for me well let's have\na chat about the likes of the vaporfly\nstarting out it's very very fast because\nit's a little bit lighter than the\nalphafly it just feels a little bit more\nSnappy you're getting loads of\nspringiness and responsiveness from the\nplate in the shoe it gives a really\nengaging ride as well it really feel\nlike the shoe is out there working for\nyou it's also very comfortable probably\nthe most comfortable racing Super Shoe\nthat I've ever probably it is the most\ncomfortable racing Super Shoe that I've\never run in so many of the Super Shoes\nin this category are very aggressive\nvery stiff and pretty uncomfortable as\nwell with minimal padding but again this\nshoe it just works it's super\nlightweight so it doesn't have a lot of\nexcess materials in here but for me it's\njust been comfortable right at the box\nand I think I've probably must have done\naround about 600 K in this shoe so far\nand it's been comfortable through every\none of them and also with this shoe it's\nreally the most versatile Super Shoe I\nthink out there at the moment for me I\ncould run 5Ks 10ks half marathons and up\nto the Marathon distance with the alpha\nflly because it's a bit heavy a bit more\nof Cruiser it doesn't have that sort of\nturn of pace because it's a little bit\nheavier but with this you're getting\nthat I really feel the airly is better\nit just lasts longer it looks after your\nlegs a little bit better in the Marathon\ndistance but for the shorter distances\nthis is where I'm going this is where\nI've been using this shoe just an\nabsolute joy to running and it's also\nsignificantly cheaper than the alpha as\nwell dislikes with this shoe I really\nfeel the shoe's best at your race Paces\nit's not the best shoe to be running\nagain no super shoes really have that\nsort of ability to run around jog\nrecovering easy run Paces in so maybe\nI'm being a little bit harsh there but\nthese shoes are so comfortable and so\nPoppy and so much fun at your race Paces\nnot a shoe to be walking around in or\njogging around in or anything like that\nbut in summary slightly more versatile\noption than the alphafly better suited\nto those shorter race distances 5Ks 10K\nhalf marathons with the alphafly is just\na little bit more Marathon specific and\nvaporfly just a little bit more on the\ncomfortable side and obviously a little\nbit cheaper as well but once we've done\nour races then it's all about Mac stack\nand Recovery shoes to look after those\nlegs so let's come on to our first entry\nin the video from Puma now I really\ndidn't think I would enjoy this type of\nshoe but I found myself reaching it so\nso often these are kind of my Monday run\nshoe after a big Sunday session just to\nhelp my legs recover and look after the\nreally well or whenever I've just going\nout for a very long run for a 30k run or\nsomething like that this is the type of\nshoe I really like to take on those runs\nwhen I'm not going to be picking up the\npace so starting out with the Puma mag\nMax Nitro quite an expensive shoe here\nespecially for Puma\n\u00a3170 stack height a massive absolutely\ncrazy 46 mil stack at the back of the\nshoe 8 mm drop over allil and as you\ngoing to see with the both these shoes\nhere a little bit on the heavy side\nobviously for the banner bulk in them to\nlook after your legs\n366 G mids soole we've got Puma's ful\nlength nit TR foam midsole and the\nsizing was true to size for me lik wise\nwith this shoe Ultra grippy pumer grip\non the outsole been fantastic especially\nas I've got this shoe during the winter\ntime it just hasn't let me down once\nmany people now say that pumer make the\nbest grippy outso on their shoes and\nthis one I can't disagree with that it's\nbeen fantastic also surprisingly stable\nYou' got to have confidence in the\ncorners when it comes to these Mac stack\nshoes people worried about rolling\nthings like that but this shoe you\nhaven't got to worry about that the\nstability in this shoe from the phone\nbecause it's slightly more on the dense\nside here so you don't feel like you're\nwallowing all over the place this is a\nlittle bit firmer than most people might\nimagine it doesn't have that super soft\nsuper squishiness stay tuned for the\nnext shoe if that's the type of thing\nyou're looking for but it's got that\njust right amount for perfecting that\nlong run performance and touching on\nthat stability as well your feet\nactually sit slightly below the top\nlayer of the Mido it's has this almost\nlike sort of V running through the\nmiddle of the shoe so they just stay so\nfirm and so planted in the shoe don't\nworry that doesn't sound comfortable but\nit really is and then the energy return\nfrom that microfoam Mido surprisingly\ngood and you can pick up the pace a\nlittle bit more in this shoe then you\nmight realize again it's not going to be\nthe shoe you're going to be watching\ndoing your speed sessions they are very\nbouncy for sure but you really don't\nnotice this bulk and the weight quite as\nmuch as you might imagine but touching\non a couple of dislikes with the shoe\nagain slightly expensive for a puma shoe\nusually offer some really good value the\nprice point of the shoe it's fine it's\njust not the usual Puma sort of value\nfor money that they're offering and\nsecond it's just a little bit on the\nnarrow side but if you got pretty\nstandard to all narrow feet you're going\nto be absolutely fine but wif footed\npeople should avoid you'll be all right\nin the next one though so summary of the\nPuma mag Max Nitro just very wellb built\nlonglasting shoe it's going to absorb a\nlot of that impact on those slower Pace\nrun those recovery runs or those long\nruns where you're going out all easy and\njust really great grip on the bottom of\nthe shoe so you don't need to worry in\nthese winter months also very stable\ngood for heavier Runners here and we\nhave got a section all for heavier\nRunners coming up later in the video but\nif you want something a little bit more\nsuper soft super squishy then have a\nlook at the hoker skywood X this is just\ncrazy I feel like an absolute giant\nwalking around in the shoe and running\naround in the shoe you need to check\nBridges when you're running through them\nbut anyway this is the Hocus skywood X\nsent me back\n\u00a385 48 48 mm stack height at the back of\nthe shoe they've got absolutely no\nground feel in the shoe whatsoever you\ngot a 5mm drop overall\n378 G which I'm pretty sure is the\nheaviest shoe I've ever reviewed but\nit's the type of shoe where it doesn't\nmatter too much no one's really\nconcerned about the weight of the shoes\nin this category here midso wise we've\ngot two layers of midso foam here one\nlayer of hok's Premium super soft peber\nfoam and then one layer of their super\ncritical EVA foam for that durability so\nthis soft foam with the peber for that\nsquishiness that softness that bounce\nEva for that durability so it lasts a\nlong time and we have got a carbon plate\nrunning through this shoe that's not\nreally in there for any speed it's in\nthere to help with that stability with\nthis amount of foam you'd just be like\nalmost like you're drunk C there\nwallowing all over the place it just\nbinds that all together to give a nice\nstable ride sizing wise it was true to\nsize for me now what I really liked\nabout the shoe let's have a chat about\nthose likes it's fun it feels really\nquite smooth despite all that bulk in\nthere I think that carbon plate is just\nhelping with that smooth ride and it\nalso feels pretty good quality as well\ngreat for longdistance walking or anyone\nbeing on their feet all day as well for\nme it's been the shoe I'm just reaching\nfor my legs are really tight I'm just\nenjoying that squish that softness that\nthis phone provides it's also very much\non the comfortable side again as you'd\nwant for this type of shoe good lock\ndown no hot spots or any blisters like\nthat really nice support at the back of\nthe shoe dislikes with this shoe it's\nreally hard but it's just obviously it's\nheavy and it's bulky it's the heaviest\nshoe I've ever worn it' be nice if they\ncould strip out just a little bit of\nthat weight but we've got some good\nrubber on the outside here again\nabsolutely no problem running in the\nwinter with this this out soole so yeah\nit's hard to really pick these apart and\nsay these shoes they're too heavy\nbecause they always going to be really\nyou just got to bear that in mind when\nyou buy them they might feel a little\nbit on the heavy side let's a little\nsummary chat about the skyex as with the\nPuma it's been really good for those\nrecovery jogs the Mac stack that really\nsoft foam looking after my legs when\nthey're just feeling a little bit\nbattered on those Monday mornings the\npummer got a little bit more firmer feel\nto it that's the shoe I'd be reaching\nfor for my long all easy runs the sky X\nagain you can run long in it of course\nyou can but it's really a lot softer a\nlot squishier a lot more compression\nyou've got going on here but still it's\nreally stable and just really good fun\nto run in right let's have a chat out\nsome more dedicated long run shoes when\nwe're doing that marathon training\nsessions we're going out for long steady\nefforts picking up the pace over the\nlong runs starting out with one of the\nshoes that's definitely a contender for\nsure of the year so much lighter than\nthose last ones the absolutely lovely as\nsuper blast version 2 this is my second\npair luckily I've managed to secure four\npairs this year but you've really got to\nknow what you're doing when to log on to\nwebsites to buy them because it's the\nmost in demand shoe this year without a\ndoubt this shoe sent me back 200 stack\nat the back of 45 mm but an 8 mm drop\noverall weightwise so lightweight 288 G\namazing for the amount of foam you're\ngetting midsole we've got mostly asx's\nFF turbo foam which is classic most\npremium foam this is what they put in\nall of their high-end ra shoes there's\nno plate in this shoe and then sizing\nwise I did go half a size down I went\nhalf size down in version one and again\nin version two I did get two sizes when\nI first bought version two to see if\nthey corrected the sizing but nope still\nwent half a size down and it was\nabsolutely fine right likes with the\nshoe it's just so so versatile I\ndefinitely could have put this one in\nthe daily shoe category as well but long\nruns where this shoe really sings a shoe\nthat really can do it all Races speed\nwork easy runs long runs this shoe could\nfeature in any of the categories in this\nvideo and it's also so comfortable as\nwell this is the shoe that I reach for\n90% of the time when I'm not testing\nother shoes second light with this shoe\njust so lightweight it's just amazing\nyou can pick up the pace so well in this\nshoe if you're just out there and you\nthink I fanty having a bit of fun today\non easy runs you want to do some strides\nor just think I'm going to do a bit of\nan impromptu fart Le if you are doing\nsome marathon training long runs with\nsome 5K marathon pace blocks in it can\ndo it all it's so versatile and also yes\n\u00a3200 for a non-plated shoe is expensive\nbut it's been so durable for me as well\nit's holding out surprisingly well we\ncan easily get 1,000 k out of this shoe\nno problem at all 600 miles if you're a\nlittle bit heavier probably a little bit\nless a little bit lighter potentially a\nlittle bit more as well but really\ndurable the upper is holding up\nfantastically well this is what it looks\nlike after this is probably around about\n600 K I've got in the shoe plenty more I\ncan do in this one dislikes wise just\nsuper hard to get hold of and yes it is\na little bit more expensive but the\nversati makes up for that also just have\na quick chat about the grip on the shoe\nI haven't actually got this on my notes\nhere but after the Nova blasting with\nthe grip problems the grip is not too\nbad on this aex have a different\ncompound of rubber on the bottom of\ntheir shoe and it's okay you're going to\nbe all right in the winter I wish they\ntake it off here put it on the Nova\nblast Mak it such a better shoe it's not\nthe best don't don't get me wrong you\nknow it's not like the Puma grip or the\nAdidas Continental grip but it's okay\nyou get by you don't need to worry about\nit it was a really good upgrade on\nversion 2 versus what they had on\nversion one but in summary a lightweight\nMax cushion shoe that can handle every\ndifferent type of run brilliantly\nexpensive but it's so much damn fun and\nit will last a long time as well\ndefinitely a contender for sh of the\nYear stay tuned for that\nright let's have a chat about another\nlong shoe surprisingly even more\nexpensive than the super blast but\nyou're getting a plate in here and\nthat's the shoe I had in over the summer\nthe New Balance SC Trainer version 4 the\ntrainer version that goes with the SC\nElite a shoe I didn't really enjoy but I\nreally enjoyed the trainer version so\nmuch more comfortable and just a good\nall round training shoe but anyway this\nset me back a quite staggering \u00a3230 it\nreally is probably the most overpriced\nshoe here but I've really enjoyed it 40\nmm stack height at the back of the shoe\n6 mm drop overall\n325 gam so what's that a good 40 odd G\nheavier than the super blast and you\nreally do notice that difference midso\nwise we've got a mix of peber and Eva\nFoams here from New Balance just a good\ncompromise and that softness that\nresponsive and getting that durability\nin the shoe as well and then that carbon\nfiber plate in here which is a little\nbit on the stiff side but not too bad\njust adding a little bit of rigidity and\nstability sizing my TR size for me likes\nwise with this shoe just really\ncomfortable straight out the box\ncomfortable on those long runs just for\nthose time on feet again when you want\nto pick up the pace during those long\nruns this is an ideal as New Balance say\ntraining shoe for those marathons those\nhalf marathons and it's a really great\nvalue shoe if you live in America for\nsome reason this was so much cheaper in\nthe states for any people from Europe if\nyou're going to America then definitely\nlook at picking up this shoe you're\ngoing to save a good amount of money if\nyou're out there dislikes just the price\nreally that's the only thing I can silly\nsay if you're in the UK or Europe and I\nthink in Australia it was absolutely\ncrazy and it's quite hard to recommend\nso this recommendation really is just\nfor our American friends only but if you\ngot the cash and you want to spend it\nher might to stop you it's been a really\ngood trainer for those long runs a\nslightly softer option than the super\nblast some people find the super blast a\nlittle bit on the firm side I actually\nquite enjoy it without amount of\nfirmness but if you want a more of a\nsofter ride again this is the type of\nshoe you should be looking at it's also\na dam easier to get hold of than the\nsuper blast which is permanently out of\nstock right not everyone's got this\ncrazy amount of money to spend on shoes\nso let's have a chat about some good\nbudget options out there we've got a\ncouple of really good options perfect\nfor anybody starting out in the sport or\nanyone looking just to save a few\npennies and just want to get some really\ngood value and durability out of their\nrunning shoes as well starting out with\nthe anadas S SL2 one of my most\nsurprising shoes of the Year this sent\nme back just an amazing \u00a3110 that I\nthink I even got this one special for\n\u00a397 when I actually bought it 36 mm\nstack height 9 mm drop overall\nweightwise so lightweight\n287 G we've got a layer of Adidas's\nsuper premium light stripe Pro and then\nthat sandwich between two layers of\ntheir more durable Light Strike 2.0 foam\nso you're getting that durability with\nthat foam a little bit of Poppin with\nthe Adidas light stripe Pro sandwich\nbetween them and unsurprisingly you're\nnot getting plate in the shoe at this\nprice point these do run a little bit\nsmall so I definitely recommend going\nhalf a size up here I got my normal size\nand they were just about okay but if I\nwas getting them again I would\ndefinitely go half a size up my likes\nwith the shoe it's lightweight it's\nSnappy and it's good fun it brings a\nsmile to your pace when you run and\nthat's what running should be all about\nthe midso off is that really engaging\nride and a really good turn of speed\nyou're getting here of course it's not\nas fast as the shoes with those rods and\nthose plates or full length of the\npremium Foams as well but it's still\npretty good it holds its own weight\nsurprisingly well it's punching above\nits weight I should say surprisingly\nwell my second like with the shoe just\nof course the Great Value that this shoe\nis offering usually Foams at this price\npoint are just so dull and hard and just\nunengaging and normally I can't wait to\nget them off my feet with this one I\nactually enjoyed it and I carried on\nusing it cuz I couldn't believe just how\ngood it was add as for some reason\nputting that layer of the most premium\nfoam in the shoe has really just bought\nit to life it's made such a difference\nwith this shoe it's so good to see ad\nputting that into their entry level\ngetting people interested in the brand\nso many people are going to try this\nshoe because of the price point get them\ninterested in the brand and then they\nwill spend a little bit more potentially\non the Boston and all the pros\nlater down the line as well so it's a\nreally good move I think from Adidas and\nthirdly really good durability with the\nshoe the outsole you're not getting the\ncontinential grip but the out soole was\nsurprisingly good good amount of grip\nfrom Adas own rubber on the bottom of\nthe shoe and then touching on a few\nlittle dislikes here it might definitely\nbe a little bit too narrow for some\npeople average to narrow size footed\npeople you're going to be okay but if\nyou got a wide foot I'm afraid this is\ngoing to be one to avoid also it's a\nlittle bit unstable in the Corning just\nbecause of how narrow it is but overall\nan excellent value shoe here for a lot\nof people when they starting out or a\nlot of people that are just a little bit\nmore budget conscious out there you're\ngoing to be able to get the vast\nmajority of your training done in this\nshoe which at this price point is really\nfantastic but there was another really\ngood Contender out there early on this\nyear and that was another shoe from Puma\nwhich was the velocity Nitro version\nthree so this shoe sent me back\n\u00a310 36 mil stack at the back of the shoe\n10 mm drop overall Weight Wise\n336 G midso we have pummer standard foam\nhere they Nitro foam and there's no\nplate in this shoe the sizing was true\nto size for me starting out with the\nlikes with the shoe just really\ncomfortable right from the off lots of\npadding in this shoe the laces hold the\nfeet in position really quite nicely\nsecondly surprisingly again really quite\na versatile shoe the Nitro foam is fun\nand bouncy it's a good all round daily\ntrainer and you can definitely run at\nlots of different Paces in this shoe\nthird like really good grip the pumer\ngrip as we said earlier with the magmax\nabsolutely fantastic also really good\ndurability regardless of the price this\nis a really good solid winter option and\nthen fourth like you've got to talk\nabout the price here as we did with the\nSL2 it feels a lot more expensive than\nit actually is really surprisingly good\nbuild quality with the shoe as well you\ncan also pretty much always get the shoe\na lot less than RRP so just absolutely\nmind-blowing value dislikes wise the\nstandard width again unfortunately with\nboth these budget shoes they are a\nlittle bit on the narrow side but\noverall with the Puma just a really good\nvalue shoe massively underrated\nmassively underpriced as well in my\nopinion as I say you can usually pick\nthese up for a lot cheaper than RRP very\nsimilar to the Adidas but a little bit\nmore on the firmer side little bit more\nground contact feel you're getting in\nthis one so if you want a budget shoe\noption a little bit more squishy softy\nbouncy go for the Adidas a little bit\nharder a little bit more ground contact\nfeel but a little bit more responsive\nthen look at going with the Puma Right\nMoving On Let's have a chat about the\nmost comfortable shoes of\n2024 when speed isn't everything you\njust want something to cruise along with\nto look after your feet just wrap them\nup in some cotton wool in the most\ncomfortable package that there is then\nthese are the shoes that will do that\nfor you so starting out with the aex GEL\nNimbus 26 in this very vibrant canary\nyellow colorway that I had earlier this\nyear the purpose of this shoe just those\neasy runs and those recovery runs a\nlittle bit on the expensive side this\nsent me back\n\u00a380 although there are a lot of deals on\nthis shoe at the because version 27 is\ndue out sort of early part of q1 of 2025\nstack cut at the back 42 mm stack kite 8\nmm drop overall Weight Wise little bit\non the chunky side 373 G for me in my UK\nsize 12 midso wise we've got asx's FF\nblast Eco plus and sizing wise it was\ntrue to size for me now starting out\nwith the likes it comes in three\ndifferent widths Hallelujah for those\nwider footed people standard wide and\nextra wide as well the upper super\ncomfortable super soft very stretchy\ntongue as you can see in the video here\nUltra breathable everything about this\nshoe has been engineered to be\ncomfortable it's actually marketed as\nthe most comfortable running Sho of all\ntime it's quite hard to disagree with\nthat but it gives a really nice lock\ndown here no overheating no hot spots no\nblisters or anything like that to worry\nabout dislikes wise again it's just not\ngoing to be the most versatile type of\nshow there really ideally this is dialed\nin for those slower Paces those recovery\nrun Paces easy Pace runs just when you\nwant to go out and just have something\nthat just going to look after your feet\nreally nicely there's not much pop in\nthis shoe so don't expect to be picking\nup the pace too much of course if you\nneed to you need to run for a bus you\ncan of course you can but it's not going\nto be the type of shoe that you're going\nto want to have on those for races or\nspeed sessions or anything like that if\nComfort is your main priority then look\nno further than this shoe this was my\nrecovery shoe for the definitely for the\nfirst half of the year before I got the\nskywood X in and the Puma magmax and\nthen I sort of went a little bit more\ndown that route but one shoe from New\nBalance that's just being handed to me\nnow was the New Balance Mo version 5\nthis is definitely I think this is going\nto be the softest squishiest shoe I have\never run in the foam here is absolutely\nridiculous you'll be melting into the\nfoam and into the road as you run along\nthis one this shoe for me is just simply\npurpose wise all about recovery and\nlooking after your legs you really can't\npick up the pace too much in this one\nprice-wise 140 so not too bad as they go\nSt Co at the back we've got 44 mm of new\nbalan's Fresh Foam x midsole 4 mm drop\noverall 374 G all these shoes are around\nabout the same sort of weight in this\ncategory Fresh Foam X mids sole here\nextra soft extra plush this really does\nfeel like you're running along with\nmarshmallows under benath your feet this\nwas true to size for me now likes with\nthis shoe very comfortable but also very\nvery soft a great option not just for\nrunners but for anyone wanting all day\nComfort out there people that might be\nwalking Long Way working retail working\nin a medical envir anything where you're\ngoing to be on your feet all day this\nwill really look after your feet\nfantastically well second like with a\nshoe just a really good width and good\nsurface area on the bottom of your feet\nas well so do feel surprisingly stable\nin them you can have a little bit of\nconfidence in the corners but you will\nbe sort of tipping a little bit over to\none side with just how soft this foam is\nyou've also got a really nice rocker at\nthe front of the shoe is a very nice\nsmooth ride in terms of dislikes with\nthis shoe the upper is quite thick\npotentially some breathability issues\ngetting some air flow through the shoe\nthere that's not really going to affect\nanyone at the moment but in the summer\nit might well do and really this is just\nan easy and Recovery run shoe only as\nwith the Joe Nimbus the foam is really\nso soft so you're not really going to to\npick out the pace too much in this shoe\nbut this one is even softer Joe Nimbus\nvery soft this one very very soft the\nsoftest shoe I've ever had the pleasure\nof running in but perfect for someone\nthat loves that soft marshmallowy\nfeeling in a shoe \u00a340 cheaper than the\ngel nimus so that's not bad too right\nlet's have a chat about heavier Runners\nso we put a video earlier out this year\nall about the best shoes for heavy\nRunners and it did really well so thank\nyou to everyone that checked that one\nout just perfect for Runners looking for\na little bit more protection from the\nroad some Foams that aren't going to\nbottom out and some good extra\ndurability because there a bit more\nForce going through the shoes here so\nthey would last a long time we've\nactually had some really good options\ncome to the market and these are our top\npicks the first one being Nike zoomfly\nversion six that's right at the bottom\nour P but this shoe we had here we'll\nput the time stamp for when this appears\nearly on so definitely check that one\nout as well as the Puma mag Max two\nreally good options there for heavy\nRunners again we'll put the time stamps\nup on the screen now but another really\ngood option out there for heavy Runners\nis the Brooks Glycerin Max which we had\nin through well actually quite recently\nin the Autumn and I really enjoyed\nrunning in the shoe perfect for those\neasy runs those recovery runs and also\nthose long runs as well this shoe sent\nme back\n\u00a380 45 mil stack at the back of the shoe\n6 mm drop overall Weight Wise again all\nkind of roughly the same\n375 G we've got Brooks's DNA tuned\ncushioning two different types of\nnitrogen density within this foam got\nsome larger cells at the back of the\nshoe perfect for those soft little Airy\nsort of Landings and some smaller cells\nat the front of the shoe just for a\nlittle bit more of a poppy toe off\nthrough that foot strike and sizing wise\nthis was good this was true to size for\nme so what did I really like about the\nshoe the first one being it's very\nsmooth and stable through the footstrike\nthe mids soole is a little bit firmer\nthan you might expect quite super blast\ntype feeling with this shoe but this is\nso much heavier Unfortunately The Rocker\nat the front of the shoe is really nice\nand smooth just helps with that\ntransition through the foot strike and\njust helps disguise the weight of the\nshoe really quite well second light with\nthe shoe comfort-wise again really good\nhere so much cushioning around the heel\nreally giving a really nice lockdown\nthird like with the shoe it's just very\nwell put together a really good quality\nshoe something you always do expect from\nBrooks and my fourth like with the shoe\nit's really good in larger sizes some\nheavier Runners bigger people bigger\nframed people this goes all the way up\nto size 14 and have a really good\ngenerous width at the front of the shoe\ndislikes with this shoe it's really\nideally only good for that easy Pac\nrunning heavier Runners if you want a\ngood race shoe look at this one or the\nalphafly as well but the zoomfly 6 and\nthe alphafly be perfect for some heavier\nRunners that want that allout speed Tu\nbut those daily miles this is where\nyou're going to be getting a lot of your\ngood training in so in summary with the\nBrooks that 45 mil stack kite really\ngood op option for those heavy Runners\nyou're not going to be bottoming out\nthis foam here and it's definitely going\nto last a long time as well some really\ngood durability really liking the rubber\nthat Brooks have put on the bottom of\ntheir shoe again some good winter grip\non there as well and the fact that it\ncomes up in some larger sizes as well\nand that decent width means it's a\nreally nice option right let's have a\nchat all about best shoes for beginners\nif you're new to running and looking for\nyour first pair of running shoes you\nwant something that's going to be really\nnice and versatile something you can run\non the roads run on the treadmill maybe\na little bit of light trail out there as\nwell lots of different paces and\nsomething that's course going to be\nreally nice and comfortable and off some\ngood longlasting value as well you're\nprobably not at this stage so dedicated\nand invested in the sport to have a big\nshoe rotation or anything like that so I\nthink the best options here would be\nlooking at something like the novablast\nversion 5 it just ticks so many boxes\nfor that doit all shoe at a pretty good\nprice point as well for people that\ndon't want to break the bank again we'll\nput the time stamp for this one so you\ncan go and look at the full review there\nanother great option at that even\ncheaper price point the Adidas SL2 again\ntime stamp is up on the screen now go\nand check that one out there again both\nthese shoes really good price points\nreally good versatility they're offering\nyou can get so many of your runs done in\nthem and potentially have a good race in\nthem as well it's really going to get\nyou invest in the sport with some good\nquality kit that's going to last a long\ntime we do have a dedicated full video\nwhich we made before these shoes\nactually came out so you want even more\noptions on some good beginner shoe\noptions then we'll link to that down\nbelow and up here as well right here we\ngo the best of the best the best overall\nsection of the video before we get stuck\ninto that let me know down in the\ncomments what has been your best shoe of\nthe year what shoe have you bought and\nit's really bought a smile to your face\nshare and help out the running community\nand let everybody scroll through the\ncomments and see some great options out\nthere as well I think the second best\nshoe the runnerup shoe of the Year for\nme has been the Nike Zoom Flight version\nreplaced a quite frankly terrible\nversion 5 in my opinion this one I got\nit in and I just wasn't that excited to\ngo out for running it and as soon as I\nput it on as soon as I started in those\nearly CES I was like there's something\nvery very special going on with this\nshoe I quickly got over the slightly odd\nquirky looks with it and I say I've done\nso many training sessions a lot of the\ntime I've just put this shoe on instead\nof my Alpha F instead of my vapor fly\ndon't want to put 20 miles on that and\nI've just been amazed at how fast this\nis amazing how fun it is we've had some\nreally good times together so that's\nbeen my runner up shoe of the year but\nyeah maybe a little bit predictable and\nmaybe a little bit more a little bit\nboring I don't know but this oh Sarah\njust smashed the microphone hopefully\nyou can still hear us now but yeah I\nreally can't say anything other than the\nsuper Blast 2 for my shoe of the year\nunfortunately with the availability\nissues it is still hard to get a hold of\nbut it's so light it's so much fun and\nit is that shoe that if I could just run\nin one shoe for the rest of my life then\nthis is what it would be it travels with\nme wherever I go if I can only take one\nshoe on a plane on a trip or on a train\nthis is the shoe I'll be taking it's\ncomfortable to wear casually and just\nwhatever you do in it it just delivers\nan amazing fun engaging responsive ride\nand it just makes me feel quite happy so\nthat's my shoe of the Year let me know\nyour shoes of the Year down in the\ncomments below hope you've enjoyed the\nvideo got so much shoe content coming up\nin 2025 really excited planning those\nvideos out and finally thank you for\nmyself and Sarah everyone that supports\nour videos so I hope you've enjoyed it\nthat's it guys keep on working hard keep\ndone I'll see you in the next one",

      "text": "this is the Adidas Evo SL inspired by\nthe record-breaking Ultra lightweight\nFlagship racing shoe the pro Evo 1 which\ncost an eye watering\n\u00a3450 they look pretty much identical\nthey've both got the same foam in them\nthe same stack height and the same drop\nas well except this one here cost an\namazing\n130\nA320 saving it exists as a more\naffordable daily and racing option and\nthere's been a lot of hype around this\nshoe I'm sure you've seen it that's\nprobably why you're watching this video\nwith Adidas launching this shoe via a\nballot a few months back and now it's\nfinally on General sale we're going to\nsee what all the fuss is about but as\nalways I bought this shoe 100% with my\nown money to give you that a completely\nunbiased unsponsored unfiltered review\nThanks so much to everybody that\nsubscribes to the channel likes the\nvideos share the videos as well and\ncheck out my website Ben parks com we've\ngot the most amazing running hats and\nTechnical gear and five-star rated\ntraining plans to help you on your\njourney right let's get stuck in\nstarting out with the facts and figures\nthe purpose of the Adidas Evo SL this is\na lightweight daily shoe for Speed work\nthreshold sessions and racing I'd say up\nto a half marathon some people have\ndefinitely run a marathon issue I think\nwith my legs I'd rather have something a\nlittle bit more plated in there to get a\nlittle bit more assistance but you\nprobably could run a marathon it if you\nreally wanted to price-wise this set me\nback\n\u00a330 it was \u20ac150\n50 Australia and Canada we're not sure\nwhen it's coming out in those countries\nyet stack cut at the back 39 mm stack 32\nmil stack at the front and a 7 mm of\ncourse drop overall weightwise this is\nincredibly lightweight just\n267 G for me in my UK size 12 it is a\nneutral shoe and with the upper of the\nshoe we have this wov mesh it's\nincredibly lightweight a little bit\nfragile potentially we'll come on to\nthat a little bit later on the midsole\nof this shoe that's where all the fuss\nis about we have a complete fulllength\nmidsole here of Adidas's light strip Pro\ntheir most premium foam that you get in\ntheir 200 plus Super Shoes and that's\nwhat everybody is raving about at this\nprice point of \u00a3 130 you just don't see\nthings like that there is no plate in\nthis shoe or any carbon rods or anything\nlike that there is a very small plastic\nshank in the middle of the shoe which is\njust there to help that stability given\nthe amount of foam in the shoe but as\nfar as I'm concerned that's not doing\nanything to Aid your speed or Aid your\nperformance or help you run faster it's\npurely there for that stability then\noutso wise we've got Adidas's\nContinental grip on the bottom of the\nshoe their sort of winter version here\nthe rubber at the back of Che is a\nslightly different compound but yeah so\nfar I've been running it in UK winter\nand it's pretty good it's definitely on\nthe thin side it might not really\nlasting that long it's not as good as\nsay the grip that you get on the Boston\nwe'll chat on that a little bit later on\nbut it's okay there are no different\nwidths available added shoes are\ngenerally on the narrow side but these\nshoes actually very accommodating a lot\nmore accommodating than you might expect\nfrom an adash shoe people with very\nnarrow or very wide feet probably\nwouldn't give this a Miss but if you're\nin that nice middle ground you're going\nto be absolutely fine in the shoe there\nare different men's and women's version\navailable it was true to size for me\nright let's have a chat all about these\nlikes and see how good this shoe really\nis my first like with this shoe is just\nthe sheer Simplicity that it offers it's\nsimple it's fast it's lightweight and\nit's fun I mean what a great combination\nthat is being so lightweight with this\nsuper foam that you've got here as well\nit's a very very fast shoe for that non\nplated or nonassisted type of ride it's\na great daily option and a great\ntraining shoe for those people that\ndon't want to be using plates or don't\nwant using plates too much in their\ntraining the Mido here is just fantastic\nthe light strip Pro foam is just one of\nthe best out there without a doubt it's\nbouncy and it's responsive it's just\nlike that puppy that always wants to go\nout and play it's always saying run\nfaster run faster moving on I want to\nhave a quick chat about the value that\nthis shoe is offering to get that 100%\nLight Strike Pro which this is that that\n100% peber it's not a watered down\nversion of their super foam this is the\nproper full blend that you're going to\nget on those high-end performance shoes\nand this foam is also renowned for its\ndurability as well it lasts a long time\nyou're going to get a lot of Mars out of\nthis shoe the out soole I find is\nworking pretty well as well as I just\nmentioned it's certainly on the thin\nside it is such a lightweight shoe so\nthey have had to cut down you can't put\na thick out soole here that's going to\nhave the most amazing winter grip\nbecause then it's just going to add to\nthe weight so know the limitations of\nthis shoe but it's definitely one of the\nlightest shoes I've ever run in and I\nthink this package for\n\u00a3130 is absolutely fantastic moving on I\nwant to have a chat about the extreme\nversatility of the shoe I'm not sure\nyou'd want to run a marathon I know\nplenty of people have for me I'm going\nto pick up something with a big carbon\nplate in there if you want to you\ndefinitely could do but where I think\nthis shoe really shines in those\nslightly shorter distances those 5Ks\n10ks and half marathons I've taken this\nshoe up to 3 minutes a kpace as you can\nsee on the screen now not for very long\nat the moment but just doing some faster\none minute reps there and then jogs\nright down to 5 minutes 30 a and it\nfeels really comfortable at both speeds\nthe upper is really breathable as well\nmaybe a little bit too breathable\npotentially you want to make sure you've\ngot your winter socks on at this time of\nyear in this shoe and then my fourth and\nfinal like is just that fantastic\ncushioning and the energy return and\nfantastic cushioning that that this\nlight stripe Pro is offering this shoe\nis fast it looks fast it feels fast and\nit is fast as well with this big rocker\nthat you have at the front of the shoe\ncombined with this foam and that\nlightweight nature of it it's a shoe\nthat it really is happiest at speed\ncovering the ground really quite\nsmoothly it's such a Smooth Operator\nthis shoe and this is where this shoe\nreally comes alive for me I know I just\nsaid it's really versatile you can jog\nin it you can run easy in it but it's\nreally best once you start to pick up\nthe pace those tempos those thresholds\nthat's where this shoe really starts to\nshine I think most people would want to\nuse this as that daily sort of training\nshoe for Speed sessions potentially some\nlog run sessions in there when you want\nto be running pretty fast right let's\nwhip through those dislikes starting out\nwhen I have a chat about the laces and\nthe tongue the tongue is just a little\nbit on the short side if you want to do\nsome heel lock lacing you can just about\nbut it's really not going to work out\nvery well and it also so does move\naround it would have been nice to just\nadd a little bit of material to make\nthat tongue a gusseted tongue it would\nhave just held it in place so much\nbetter the it just moves around and it's\nsimply Too Short the laces on this shoe\nagain they try to make them as\nlightweight and skinny as possible they\njust feel really cheaply B they just\nlike the kind of laces you get in like a\n10B sort of shoe in Primark or something\nabsolutely nothing special at all and\nthen moving on to this whole like draw\nthing and this hype thing these micro\nlimited releases all to increase that\nhype the big social media Buzz all that\nsort of playing on that fomo youve got\nto get in now or you're going to miss\nout and then people do miss out and the\nnext drop comes in a little bit bigger\nand then that all sells out but is it\nworth that hype well it's a nice shoe\nI've really enjoyed running it but the\nhype is absolutely crazy and of course\nsome people are going to feel a little\nbit disappointed I think a lot of people\nare going into this thinking this is the\nbest shoe of all time it's a good shoot\nit's just a running shoot though and\nthen finally my fourth dislike with the\nshoe it's just a little nitpicky sort of\nthing about the upper it really doesn't\ngive the best lock down compared to some\nof the other offerings out there again\nknow what you're getting into with this\nshoe it's a very lightweight type of\nshoe there's not a lot of material up\nhere in the upper if you're going to be\ndoing some sharp Corners you're going to\nbe racing at Park run and things like\nthat you might find your foot is just\nsort of rolling across to the side a\nlittle bit other options around like the\nSL2 or the Boston they're a lot more\nsort of durable a lot more chunky keep a\nlittle bit heavier little bit more to\nthem your foot is definitely being held\nin place a lot better with those shoes\nso let's have a little chat about those\nshoes now so I think a lot of people are\npotentially in the market for this but\nthey might be thinking should I save\neven more money and get the SL2 or spend\na bit more money and get the Boston\nlet's have a chat about those two now so\nthe SL2 20 cheaper than this shoe again\nfantastic value really all three of\nthese shoes offer a fantastic value it's\n20 G heavier but again still pretty\nlight weight weight has a small layer of\nthe premium foam the foam you're seeing\nin this shoe here but it's sandwiched\nbetween two layers of far more Durable\nfoam so again should be very hard\nwearing and Lasting a little bit longer\nyou're not getting the Continental outs\nsoole and you're also slightly lower\nstack height there as well as we've just\ndiscussed the lockdown on the SL2 just\nholds your foot in place a lot better\nbut the evos is a lot more responsive\nfar better energy return you're getting\nin the shoe and that much more\naggressive rocker at the front of the\nshoe as well really a lot smoother ride\nto run in I'd view the SL2 is a great\ndaily Workhorse to do everything in\npretty well it's just going to last and\nit's going to put up with good weather\nbad weather you just abuse it and get a\nlot of good value out of it the Evo SL\nhere a great value shoe if you want to\ngo fast and feel fast but it's probably\nnot the kind of shoe you're going to\nreaching for every single day out there\nyou're going to want to partner it up\nwith something like the SL2 potentially\nand then have a quick chat about the\nBoston \u00a310 more expensive quite a bit\nheavier than the shoe although again\npretty good Weight Wise 318 G for me in\nmy UK size 12 again you've got two\ndifferent types of foam in that shoe the\nLight Strike Pro and the 2.0 EVA foam\nagain just for some durability with that\none plus now you're getting those energy\nrods in there as well for a much more\nassisted ride and a really very\nhardwearing very grippy Continental\nrubber outso with that shoe the Boston\nis going to be a little bit better at\nthose long distances it's a lot more\ndurable should be a lot lot longer\nlasting as well very dependable shoe\noverall right let's have a chat about my\nconclusions and my final thoughts does\nit live up to the hype well the hype was\nabsolutely insane let's be honest I\ndon't think anything could live up to\nthat amount of hype but it's a good shoe\nno doubt about it it's a good solid shoe\ndefinitely a lot better than some of the\nstuff we've seen this year would I\nrecommend it very much so but be aware\nof those limitations it's a lightweight\nshoe it's got a lot of stuff stripped\nout of it but you can have a lot of fun\nin here the phone will look after you\nreally well and it will really bring a\nsmile to your face when you start to\npick up the speed but you'll probably\ngoing to want to ideally pair it with\nsomething a little bit more durable as a\ndaily option alongside it and then just\nput this one when you just want to go\nout and have some fun your legs are\nfeeling fresh or you've got a really\ngood speed session or a long run session\nor whatever type of session to do but\nthat's where I'll be using the shoe when\nI want to have some fun and run fast in\nit so if you want to check out my full\nAdidas SL2 review check out that video\nout here if you want to check out my\nbest shoes of 2024 video check that\nvideo up down here and that'll be up in\na couple of days so it might be blank at\nthe moment but it will be there in a few\ndays time that's it guys let me know\nyour thoughts on this shoe what do you\nthink about it what do you think about\nthe hype are you getting it have you got\nit are you going to be running it I'd\nreally love to catch up on your thoughts\ndown in the comments that's it guys keep\non working hard keep done I'll see you\nvery soon in the next one",

      "text": "over the last few years the aex nov last\nhas really established itself as one of\nthe best daily trainers on the market so\nmuch so that this is now one of the most\nhighly anticipated launches of the year\nlast year I found myself recommending\nthe version 4 time and time again for it\nsimple no fuss Approach at a really good\nprice point as well so will aex continue\nthis winning streak with this version 5\nor will version 4 be the best one to\nstick with I managed to buy this very\npair at the Valencia Marathon Expo a few\ndays before the official launch event so\nsome good time to put this through its\npaces and see what it's like and of\ncourse I bought this 100% with my own\nmoney as we do here with all the shoe\nreviews on the channel to give you that\ncompletely honest unbiased unsponsored\nreview thank you so much to everyone who\nlikes comments and subscribes to the\nchannel and checks out my website benp\nparks.com you can find awesome running\ngear running hats and those five star\nrated training plans right let's get\nstuck in the review of the aex overl\nversion starting out with all of the\ndifferences between this and the\noutgoing model so with version 5 we now\nhave a new midsole foam this is asx's FF\nblast Max version 4 was the FF blast\nplus Eco it's now a little bit softer\nthan the outgoing model and also a\nlittle bit of a lighter foam as well aex\nhave also updated the upper to the shoe\nwith this new engineered jackard mesh\nupper pretty breathable we'll come on to\nthose points later on and also on the\nbottom of the shoe we've got the same\nout so material as the outgoing version\njust an updated pattern an updated\nplacement of those rubber pads on the\nbottom of the shoe Weight Wise with the\nshoe pretty much the same as the outgo\nmodel some people have got a pair\nslightly lighter some people slightly\nheavier when I weighed it it was 2 G\nheavier but basically exactly the same\nthe stack and the drop again identical\nand the price they've kept that a really\ngood price point here from aex at\n135 so let's move on to all of the facts\nand figures so the purpose of the\nnovablast version 5 this is your premium\ndaily trainer a shoe that can do all\ndifferent types of runs at a kind of\nthat 7 to 8 out of 10 not perfect at any\nbut you just go out there with a nice\none shoe rotation it will do them all\npretty well it's certainly possible to\nuse this for some longer runs as well\nprice-wise this shoe sent me back\n\u20ac150 because I ought it in Spain but in\nthe UK it's \u00a3135 $140 $240 Australian\ndollars Canadian dollars is not out in\nCanada at the time of filming stack code\nat the back of the SHO\n41.5 mm with an 8 mm drop overall Weight\nWise as I said pretty much identical 302\nG for me in my UK size 11 1/2 on this\nparticular shoe really quite nice and\nlight there in terms of that neutral\nstability this is a neutral shoe the\nupper we've got this technical jackard\nmesh upper midsole the FF blast Max\nthere's no plate in this shoe but it's\nreasonably stiff and on the outside of\nthe shoe we've got asx's aha low density\nrubber here which is not great we'll\ncome on to that in the dislikes later on\nthere are no different widths available\nthere are different men's and women's\nversion as well with lots of different\ncolorways we'll put them up on the\nscreen now I can't even remember how\nmany they are but there's quite a lot at\nofficial launch let me know what your\nfavorite one is down in the comments and\nthis wasn't true to size for me I did go\nhalf a size down the same size I get in\nthe super blast the same size I got in\nversion four of the shoe right let's\nhave a chat about all of them likes and\nthere's quite a few my first like with\nthe shoe is super stable smooth ride\nit's bouncy and it's cushioned as well\nit just looks after your legs really\nwell on those long runs a really true\nversatile do it all daily trainer I\nreally like the rocker at the front of\nthe shoe it just is so smooth through\nthat foot strike it wants you to pick up\nthe pace a little bit but this is happy\njust cruising along that easy Pace\neating up those mares yes the foam is a\nlittle bit softer we'll come on to that\nbut it's responsive enough if you want\nto pick up the pace you are going to be\nable to my second like the sheer value\nthat this shoe is offering in my opinion\nthis is the best shoe in this price\nsegment \u00a31 135 is really good aset could\nhave definitely put that up by5 or10 and\nI think people would have still bought\nit so kudos to them for keeping version\n5 at that price point just really well\nput together shoe really good build\nquality and yes \u00a325 cheaper than sort of\nNike equivalent shoe with the p plus so\nexceptional value at this price point\nthird like with the shoe Comfort the fit\nand the lock down is very similar to\nversion four we've got a new lacing\nsystem two different types of lacing up\nthe front here we've got a partially\ngusseted tongue as well that stays in\nplace really nicely that's not moving\naround at all it certainly feels a\nlittle bit wider than the outgoing well\nit is a little bit wider than the\noutgoing model but I've had no issues\nwith any heel slipping any hot spots any\nblisters or anything like that there's\nreally no need to use the lock down\nlacing but if you want to these laces\nare more than long enough to do that\nthere's a good amount of breathability\nin the new upper as well got a good air\nflow through here as I'm testing this\nthis is the middle of the winter in the\nUK we're not worried about overheating\nbut if you are in a warmer climate I\nthink you're going to get some good air\nflow through in this upper and at the\nback of the shoe the heel just the right\namount of softness the right amount of\npadding that you're going to want in a\ndaily shoe my fourth like with this shoe\nis the amount of cushion you're getting\nversus the weight now one of the big\npopular shoes of the year the super\nblast people can't believe how light it\nis for the amount of Stack height the\namount of cushioning you're getting in\nthat shoe this is very very similar this\nis a lot softer than the super blast\ndefinitely not a competitor or a\nplacement for the super blast or\nanything like that but just the amount\nof cushioning you're getting with a shoe\nfor the weight of the shoe as well is\nreally quite fantastic it is lightweight\nit also feels lightweight for me a shoe\naround that 300 grams is what I really\nlike to look for the super blast does\nthat fantastically well this is just a\nlittle bit heavier than that but still\nreally nice and light and my fifth like\nwith the shoe it's just the versatility\nthat it offers it's very easy to run in\njust no fuss at all give me absolutely\nno issues it just gets on and does the\njob no matter what's on the plan or what\ndistance you need to go out and do you\nhappily take this from anywhere from a 2\nor 3K jog all the way up to 30 40K long\nrun this is going to lock after your\nlegs really well you can use it for some\nspeed sessions some threshold sessions\nsome Park runs of course there's better\noptions out there but if you rock up to\nthe sessions you got this on your feet\nit's not a bad thing and you just get\nyour run down absolutely fine but as\nalways here on the channel we will talk\nabout those dislikes with the shoe so\nlet's come on to those now the first\ndislike with the shoe and it really\nunfortunately carries on I actually\nthink it's a little bit worse even than\nthe version 4 model is the wet weather\ngrip with aex I don't know what's going\non with the shoe it's something that\neverybody knows about surely they know\nabout they've kept the same rubber it's\na slightly different pattern on the\nbottom of the shoe but this is really\nquite slippy I've taken it out a few\ntimes in the evenings around which it's\na bit wet a bit of moisture on the floor\nabout 8 9:00 at night and you're just\nsliding around all over the place I'm\nnot going to be running in this shoe in\nthe wet weather this for me is going to\nbe something I'm only going to use in a\nnice dry environment hopefully the TR\nversion which is their trail version of\nthe shoe which is normally a really good\nwinter running option will be along soon\nthere's no talk about that at the moment\neverything's identical the upper the mid\nsole it's just a different bottom of the\nshoe and it's a really good winter\nrunning option but for me this the grip\nis just surprisingly bad for how good\nthe rest of the shoe is just another\ncouple of things to have a chat about\nthey're just observations there might be\nlikes they might be disliked I'm not\nsure which Camp they fit into you let me\nknow how they affect you but the first\nthing to have a chat about is the foam\nthis is certainly a lot softer than the\noutgoing model but it's got a good\namount of response and a good amount of\nBounce in here as well you do get used\nto it quite quickly so if you enjoyed\nthe slightly firmer ride of version 4\nthen that's probably going to be one to\nstick with if you are looking for a\nlittle bit more of a softer ride that's\ngoing to absorb the impact a little bit\nbetter but still give you that\nresponsiveness and that Poppin that\nbounciness then this is going to be a\nreally welcome upgrade for you my other\nlittle observation here is the width\nwith the shoe the fit is going to be a\nlot better for wider footed Runners it's\ndefinitely on the wide side now they're\nnot releasing this as far wear in a wide\noption but if you have a particularly\nnarrow foot this might be too wide for\nyou and it might be one to avoid so\nlet's move on to my conclusions and\nfinal thoughts do I recommend this shoe\nI really do I've enjoyed putting some\nearly Mars in this shoe yes I probably\nlike the slightly firmer ride of version\n4 and I would say if you really like\nthat then go and buy another version 4\nbut more than happy with the slightly\nsofter ride that this one's giving is it\nworth the upgrade well probably\npersonally no because I like that's like\nthat slightly fair right but I would\nstill recommend it for the vast majority\nof people so who should buy the Nova\nblast version 5 someone looking for a\ngreat onoe option this is why this shoe\nabsolutely sings someone doesn't want to\nspend hundreds of pounds buying a big\nshoe rotation that's what one shoe\nwithout breaking the bank to do it all\nreally well and that's why I've always\nfind myself recommending the Nova blast\ncuz it just ticks that box so well for\nme it's the best shoe on the market\ncurrently offering that so will I be\nkeeping this shoe well I think 100% yes\nI don't always want to put the mileage\non my super brass 2 and this shoe is\njust perfect for those shorter those\nmedium type runs it's got enough pop in\nit for suddenly fanasy picking up the\npace doing a bit more of a fart Leck run\nwhen I'm out there doing some faster\nsurges this has got me covered so let me\nknow your thoughts on the ASX no last\nversion 5 down in the comments what do\nyou think about it are you getting it\nare you interested in it have you tried\nit help out the community and let every\nknow your thoughts we have got the\nAdidas Evo SL coming in very soon we\nhave some comparison videos with that\nthe novablast 5 and also the super Blast\n2 they're going to be over on the second\nChannel very soon and the full added as\nevsl review will be dropping here in a\nfew days so get subscribed to that\nthanks very much everybody please check\nout my website benp parks.com and keep\non working hard keep on getting it done\nand I'll see you very soon in the next\none",

      "text": "2024 has been a really strong year for\nrunning shoes I've Loved buying and\ntesting the latest offerings from all of\nthe big Brands and I've seen some really\ngreat shoes that have really surprised\nme with what they were offering the bar\ngets higher and higher each year and the\nability to stand out gets that little\nbit harder well today I've got my top\nthree shoes that have really surprised\nme and overd delivered on what I was\nexpecting them to do and of course as\nalways here on the channel I've got a\ncouple of other options that I was\nreally pumped up and really excited for\ntheir latest updates and then were just\na bit of a let down so definitely worth\navoiding as with everything we do here\non the channel I bought all of these\nshoes 100% with my own money to give you\nthat completely honest and biased review\nif you're watching this video in the\nfirst few days then it will be our Black\nFriday weekend we're having a big Black\nFriday sale a sale we like to do every\nyear we're offering a huge 20% off\neverything sitewide all our running hats\nour technical gear our long sleeves our\ncasual gear our hoodies and our fstar\nrated training plans so if you fanc\ntreating yourself bf20 at checkout will\nget you 20% off thank you so much to\neveryone that supports the channel and\nallowing us to buy these shoes test\nthese shoes and give you those\ncompletely honest and partial reviews it\nmeans so much to myself and Sarah right\nlet's start out with a couple of the bad\nones the first one being the Nike\nPegasus version 41 41 years to hopefully\nget this right but it's still not quite\nthere I super pumped what I heard this\nnew version was coming out with an\nupdated foone a better upper and I\nthought finally Nike going to release a\ndaily shoe that is going to be a\nfantastic running shoe that we can\nrecommend but sadly it really did fall\nshort as I say this is Nike's classic\ndaily trainer at what they deem is more\nof that affordable price point stack out\nof the back 37 mil 10 mm drop overall\nthey whacked up the price unfortunately\nas well now costing \u00a31 130 definitely\nnot that entrylevel budget sh anymore\nbut in that sort of Middle Ground here\nwith some really stiff competition\nWeight Wise a little bit on the chunky\nside 340 7 G mesh this engineered mesh\nupper which to be fair was actually not\ntoo bad the updated midso which is\nreally what I was hoping to get a little\nbit of Zoom X in here would have been\nnice but no it was just the react X\nmidsole keeping those airpods in there\nthe ride is still pretty harsh and firm\nwhat is really good is the outsole\nreally good waffle outsole very\nhardwearing and it was true to scis of\nme and it was really good to see they\noffered it in a wide fit as well now\nthere's no doubt about it the react X\nfoam update here was a a lot better than\nversion 40 we've got a bit of extra\nstack in this shoe as well it's a\nslightly softer ride but it's still\npretty harsh out there upper really\nreally good good lock down really good\nComfort shoe nice wide toe box and a\nstable ride with the shoe as well and as\nI just mentioned fantastic durability\nwith this shoe but kind of where this\nreally fell short for me was just that\nbig price hike there just much better\ncompetitors out there at this price the\nNova blast the Mac Nike's very own Vero\na much better running shoe and only a\nsmidge more in price here and they're\njust far better running shoes overall\nbetter Foams far more responsive this is\njust really quite slow these airpods in\nthis foam is just doing just very little\nwork for me and I'd much rather be out\nthere in one of those other offerings\njust minimal energy return not much\nbounce with this one and it just has\nthat feeling of feeling quite dead\nunderfoot for me it quickly became a gym\nand Casual shoe only and I spent a lot\nof time in casually really comfortable\ngoing to the gym walking around town\nwhatever traveling around really good\nshoe for that sort of thing and of\ncourse you can go for a running if you\nhave to but it's definitely not the one\nI would be picking it's going to be\nreally interesting to see what happens\nnext year with the shoe can Nike really\ncall this a running shoe anymore the\nvomero that Nike offer is just so much\nbetter yes it's a little bit more\nexpensive it's a real sleeper of the\nrange V get version 18 here on the\nchannel hopefully come around about\nJanuary time in for a review so get\nsubscribed for that but that's where\nI'll be putting money for a Nike daily\nshoe the Pegasus plus is a little bit\nmore expensive yes it has that full\nzoomx midso which is really good also\nfantastic Comfort option and I sure I'd\nrecommend it has that good ground feel\nthat you get with this but it's got that\nresponsiveness and that Popp so again a\nmuch better option but I fully admit\nNike can't really win with a shoe I\ndon't know what Nike's bestselling shoe\nis but it could well be this one so many\npeople just want a Dependable shoe they\ncan work casually go to the gym go to\nthe shops do a couple of runs in a\nweekend and it would be fine and they're\nnot that worried about how far fast they\ngo and it does that but in 2024 for me\nthis just does not cut it as a running\nshoe anymore and definitely not since\nthe price T at least when it was around\nabout100 you can say well it's really\nnot too bad at that price point but now\nit's up here go verom Mero go M go Nova\nblast in this price range or if you\nreally do want to get this then just\nknow that it has its drawbacks with it's\nrunning you can't really pick up the\npace you certain want to be racing it\nthe thought of racing a marathon\nsomething like this would be absolutely\ncrazy but yeah good looking shoe for the\ngym and that occasional runin if you\nreally want to you can get it done I've\njust purchased the gortex version of\nthis Sarah's just kindly passed to me\nyou give me the wrong side I like to\nhold it here we'll hold it that way\naround the gortex version which I'm not\nexpecting much from but yeah it could be\na good winter daily training shoe some\nreally good Nike storm tread on the\nbottom there right coming in from the\nside the next one here which is a lovely\nlightweight shoe and I really wanted to\nlike this this is the Hoka ringcon\nversion 4 I was a big fan of the first\nthree versions of Hoka ringcon again a\nreally good budget offering in one two\nand three something I'd really like to\nrecommend to people getting into the\nsport or someone that wanted that\nuptempo lightweight trainer to do some\nsessions in a ringcom was a really good\nbet at a fantastic price point but for\nme version 4 just has not delivered a\nspectacular fail when you're comparing\nit to the earlier three versions how\nhooker really Market the ringcon it's\njust that entry level beginner daily\ntrainer or for more of an advanced\nRunner that's going to build a big\nrotation or something something you can\ncan definitely do a lot of speed working\nand things like that shorter distances\n5Ks 10ks and half marathons at most\nstack cut at the back 33 mil with a 5 mm\ndrop set me back around about 100\u00a3 110\nfor this super lightweight that is one\nthing that's definitely going for this\nshoe just 280 G for me in my UK size 12\nwe've got this jackard mesh upper here\nreally not too bad but not too great\nwe'll come on to that in a bit the\nmidsole with this shoe this is really\nwhere it's starting to let the side down\nthis injection molded Eva mids sole yeah\nit's hard to get an exciting midsole\ndefinitely at this price point but\nunfortunately it has a real dead feeling\nout soole it kind of doesn't really have\na rubber out soole it's this purple\nsection at the bottom of shoe here it's\njust this mix of this rubberized Eva\nblend sizing was Dreadful in the shoe\ndefinitely it runs very very small go at\nleast half a size up I think I'd\nprobably go a whole size up in the shoe\nit comes in much shorter than my other\nhookah shoes and other brands as well so\nas I said I was really excited when\nversion for was coming out that wallet\nfriendly price it was a shoe I'd always\nfind myself recommending to other people\nanyone getting into the sport or just\nsomeone looking for that lightweight\nSpeedy simple shoe without a plate just\nwanted that more traditional ride and\nthat's what it offered that lightweight\nengaging ride decent size toe box at the\nfront of the shoe as well and it meant\nyou could run longer in the shoe and it\nhad a good sort of that spacious upper\nunfortunately that's kind of all gone\nwith version 4 so where does version 4\nfall short for me well the foam is now\nvery stiff and very firm as well the\nsizing as I say just way off you need at\nleast to go half a size up maybe even a\nfull size and the fit is definitely a\nlot narrower than version 3 and it's\nreally on the narrow side hooker shoes\ntend to be a little bit on the narrow\nside and there's just not enough room in\nthe tow box here there's just not enough\nheight in the toe box there's not enough\nwidth in the toe box it's just a very\nnarrow fit I know this shoe came in\nsmall even if it was exactly the right\nsize and I had gone half a size or full\nsize I still just feel this is a very\ncompact space so getting some heel slip\nin the shoe the lock down just is just\nnot great as standard you can actually\njust slide them off completely easily\nwhen they are well I could and I tied\nthem up quite tight and you can just\ntake them straight off whenever I do get\nsome heel sh with a shoe I'd always try\nthat heel lock lacing that you can do if\nyou see me doing on the screen here just\nto get a much better lock down but the\ntongue is just so weirdly short on this\nshoe that you can't really you can just\nabout do it it did cure the heel slip so\nit does work but I say the tongue is\njust so short the ring con has never\nbeen a shoe that has been now for\ndurability they've never had a rubber\nout so on here they get rid of it to\nmake it nice and lightweight and I do\nappreciate that it's really good to have\nthat nice lightweight feel but just know\nwith something like this you're not\ngoing to get very good durability which\nI think a lot of beginner Runners and\npeople at this sort of price point\nthey're just looking for that good value\nfor money just unfortunately don't\nexpect this to last very long but it's\nnot all bad there are a couple of good\nthings with this shoe to have a chat\nabout it is lightweight and when you get\nup to speed as you can see here here I'm\nrunning around about 320 A K Pace it\ndoes feel really nice and smooth some\npeople are going to like that extra\nstiffness and firmness and it does\nreally work at speed but just other\nPaces easy Pace recovery Pace slower\nPace running it's just a bit clunky just\na bit wearing just a bit grating just\nwith How firm it is but when you really\nwant to engage it and pick up the speed\nit actually is quite Pleasant to run in\ndare I say so who could this type of\nshoe work for as say if you're an\nexperienced Runner you're building up a\nbig shoe rotation this could work it's a\nnice Tempo shoe it's light and it's\nsmooth at speed but as an entry level\nall round shoe it's really really misses\nthe mark for me if you want to stick in\nthe hoker range you much better looking\nat the Mac which is so much better at\nall Paces much better out soole so much\nmore comfortable or even the Clifton\nwhich isn't the best shoe in the world\nbut it's got fantastic durability with\nthat shoe as well there are much better\noptions if you only got around1 to spend\ntry and get a Mac or a Clifton on\ndiscount or something like that that's\ngoing to serve you much better but I'm\nnot just criticizing it because the\nprice point it's cheap and H have to\nhave some cheap materials at this price\npoint because Adidas delivered an\nabsolutely stunning shoe this year when\nthey bought out the SL2 it was so good\nwhen I had it earlier in this year just\nthat classic daily trainer from Adidas\nmuch more of affordable price point than\nthe Boston 36 mil stack height 9 mm drop\noverall I think I paid just High 90s for\nthis shoe against an RP of around about\n110 super lightweight 287 G for me and\nreally enjoyed picking up the Pace in\nthe shoe because of that lightweightness\nlovely engineered mesh upper pretty\nbreathable there as well midso this is\nwhere the shoe really starts to come\nalive you got a lovely layer of the\nLight Strike Pro Adidas's premium foam\nhere for that responsiveness that\nbounciness that Popp and it's sandwiched\ntogether between two layers of the Light\nStrike 2.0 for added durability to make\nsure it lasts outs soole we haven't got\nAdidas's famous Continental grip here\nbut you've just got Adidas's standard\nrubber out soole and it was pretty damn\ngood good and very good at this price\npoint sizing rise it did run a little\nbit small as well if you're un sure go\nthat half a size up for me my UK size 12\nit was just about okay but I'd really\nRec going half a size up so what I was\ngenuinely so surprised about this shoe\nis I sort of get the impression a lot of\nManufacturers just don't really care\nabout their entry level shoes anymore\nthey just want every spending as much as\npossible going for that mid-range that \u00a3\n150 for that doit all type of running\nshoe but Adidas s of ripped up the rule\nbook there and they gave us really \u00a3150\nver of value for \u00a3100 in my opinion\nAdidas are really quite renowned for\ndelivering some good value out there and\nthis one is an absolute Blinder the\nversion before this the SL1 was just\nwhat you'd expect for an entry-level\nrunning shoe hard foam cheap materials\nand just a bit boring and Bland so I\nreally was not expecting much when we\ngot the SL2 in but it was a huge\nImprovement pretty much exactly the same\nat Price Point as well and when I was\ntesting the shoe and running along in it\nI just had to keep reframing my\nreference point of I bought this shoe\nfor less than 100 00 that's absolutely\ncrazy so the standout features of this\nshoe that layer of that all premium foam\nin here at this price point just does\nnot happen usually Foams in this price\npoint are so dull and unresponsive but\nwhat added us have done with sandwiching\nit together between that Durable foam\nand then that Poppy foam in the middle\nit's just a combination that works so\nwell and the fact they've managed to do\nall that and still really decrease the\nweight of the shoe now for me at 287 G\nagain really surprising but really good\nto see as well also what I was really\nsurprised about was just how good that\nadded ass grip was oh it would be nice\nto see the content of grip you can't\nhave everything for \u00a398 just in the\ncornering felt really nice and I could\nreally trust it and also the versatility\nof this shoe you can do everything in\nthis shoe I'd happily race in this shoe\nI'd have to use some reps in the shoe\nI'd have to use some thresholds some\ntempos some easy runs some recovery runs\nit will do it all pretty well I\npersonally wouldn't want to run a\nmarathon I'd rather have some plates in\nthere and spend a little bit more money\nand have a shoe that's going to look\nafter my legs a little bit better and be\na little bit more responsive in those\nvery long runs but yeah you really can't\ngo wrong I really think for a lot of\npeople this is a really good daily shoe\nwithout breaking the bank yes if you\nwant to spend a bit more and have the\ntech and some of the things like the\nBoston has then yeah no problem doing\nthat at all but if you're just looking\nfor that daily non nonsense shoe this is\nwhere the SL2 comes in so who is the SL2\nbest for well someone looking for that\nbudget friendly shoe they can wear on\ntheir shorish runs in their training 5K\n10ks half marathons training for those\ndistances racing those distances you'll\nbe absolutely fine if you got a\nparticularly wider foot it's probably\ngoing to be one to avoid right we're\nback to hoker they did provide a really\ngood shoe this year so we better get\nstuck into that now it's the skywood X\nwe got the skywood X in earlier on this\nyear and I really was not expecting much\nversus the ringcon for example when I\nsuper hyped for it because the version\nbefore have been really good and that\nwas a bit of a let down this one the\nshoe that came before the Bondi X it now\ngot renamed to Skyward X was so bad one\nof the worst shoes I've ever reviewed\nhere on the channel this thing came in\nand absolutely delivered a fantastic\nshoe really enjoyed running it really\nsurprised with how good it is and I've\njust kept going out in it for those easy\nthose recovery runs or those long runs\nwhen I just want to look after my legs\nso this set me back\n\u00a3185 so yeah a little bit on the\nexpensive side the purpose of shoe like\nthis long runs easy runs and Recovery\nruns stack kite an absolute whopping 48\nmm stack kite 5 mm drop overall the high\nstack height shoe I've ever reviewed\nhere on the channel Weight Wise yeah\nit's a big shoe no doubt 378 G for me in\nmy UK size 12 the upper of the shoe\nwe've got this flat knit sort of a bit\nof a sock likee upper at the front\npretty breathable not too bad midso wise\nwe've got this Jewel layer of peba and\nEva Eva for that durability peba for\nthat responsiveness that Poppin that\nbounciness there's a lot of bounciness\nin this shoe outsole wise these yellow\npads here on the bottom of the shoe that\nhigh abasan Rubber outsole and it's it's\nwearing pretty good so far I'm up to\nabout 80 mil in this shoe 0 very happy\nmiles I must say and the sizing was true\nto size for me so why was this shoe a\nbig surprise well I say it replaced the\nBondi X which was just a really bad shoe\nin my opinion one of my personal worst\nthe bonday X was such a weird\ncombination of out ofd Foams with a\ncarbon plate on a shoe that was just\nrenowned for very very easy days really\nhad some bad heel slipping issues as\nwell and he just felt really dead and so\nreally no purpose for anyone and then in\ncomes the Skyward X this whole new\ncomplete redesign with the shoe massive\nstack kite which is absolutely crazy and\ndespite the waking bulk it's really fun\nto run in it's also super soft and plush\nas well there's a lot of travel in the\nfoam here thank goodness they put that\ncarbon plate in there that's not really\nfor allout Speed it's adding a lot of\nstability in the shoe which is\ndefinitely what it needs with this\namount of foam and it otherwise you'd\njust be wallowing all over the place so\njust a combination that holds it all\ntogether really quite well and this shoe\nis supremely comfortable as well had\nabsolutely no issues in this shoe\ndefinitely been using it for my second\nrun of the day or some like a Monday\nshoe when I've had a Sunday long run and\nwhen I go on a Monday and just look\nafter my legs this is the shoe I've been\nreaching for legs feeling like they're\nrecovering as they're going along with\nall of that foam absorbing the impact\njust looking after them really really\nwell so who is the Hocus skyex best for\nit's definitely great for heavier\nRunners anyone that's worried about\nbottoming out foam and things like that\nyou're really not going to do that in\ntheir shoe good for those slower runs\nanyone wanting to run a very long way at\na nice casual easy run pace and just\nwants that super comfortable soft shoe\nto look after their legs for a very long\ntime I really think there's not much\nbetter out there at the moment than the\nsky deex massively surprised me bought a\nsmile to my face and really delivered\nand finally here on the list we have the\nNike zoomfly 6 another really surprising\nshoe replacing the zoomfly 5 which I\nreally did not rate zoomly 6 came out\nand I was like oh do I have to but this\nhas been an absolute Joy I've just put\nmy 100 M review up of this shoe and yeah\ngave it a lot of High Praise as well so\nthe purpose of the zoomfly 6 this is\nyour everyday race shoe a training shoe\nto their top end racer like the training\nversion of the alphafly for Speed runs\nfor long runs you do some sessions your\nTempo your thresholds you can even go\nfor an easy jog in it it's not the best\nshoe for that easy and Recovery jog it's\nreally one you want to put on your feet\nto go fast to get your workouts done in\nand you can rock up on race day and have\na really good time as well stack cut at\nthe back 42 mil and an 8 mm drop overall\nprice-wise \u00a3 1555 pretty damn good Nike\noffering some good value here weightwise\n322 G not heavy but not light either\njust sort of nicely in the middle upper\nwe've got this two layer wov mesh upper\nmidsole wise we've got a zoom X layer of\nmidsole which is exactly the same foam\nthey put in their high-end ratio shoes\nthe VAP flies and the outfly that layer\nof zoomx Mile for that responsive that\nPopp then a carbon plate and then an Eva\nlayer underneath that again Eva for that\ndurability and the carbon plate in there\nwhich you can't feel too much but it's\ndefinitely providing a lot of Popp as\nyou run along outso wise again really\ngood a nice solid layer of waffle here\nwhich I really appreciate they could\nhave definitely skimped on this and made\nthe shoe a bit lighter but this is a\ntraining shoe it's not all about that\nlightweightness with your training\nfantastic grip really good durability\nafter 100 miles in their shoe and the\nsizing was true to size for me so why\nwas this a big surprise but I say the\nzoomfly 5 was just a bit of a flop shoe\nfor me and I'm guessing for Nike as well\nbecause I didn't see any positive\nreviews really about it maybe one or two\npeople it kind of worked for some\nheavier Runners out there because there\nwasn't much choice but it was just so\ndead I had a lot of foam in it and I had\na carbon plate in it but incredibly\nheavy as well I really feel like they\nlistened to a lot of the feedback with\nwhat people are wanting on a shoe like\nthis they've got rid of that hard D\nrecycled foam and replaced it with a\nhuge slab of the Nike's premium zoomx\nand the Eva for that training durability\nas well made it 10% lighter so I was\nreally surprised when I unboxed this\nshoe despite not thinking it was the\nprettiest shoe in the world I was really\nexcited to get on my feet and it really\ndelivered the standout features for me\nreally good value \u00a3 155 for a shoe this\ngood is fantastic to have that premium\nfoam and the carbon plate at at this\nprice point is pretty rare and then when\nyou compare it to something like the\nPegasus plus which is even more\nexpensive this without that carbon plate\nit really is that training shoe for the\ntype of people want a bit more ground\ncontact feel and don't want that plated\nride in there but again it's a lot more\nexpensive than this this is why this is\ndelivering so much value for me\nspeed-wise incredibly fast I've been\nwearing this for most of my interval\nsessions and my long run sessions I've\nreally been surprised at the pace I'm\ngetting versus the effort that I'm\nputting in of course the alphafly is\ngoing to be a little bit faster but I\ndon't feel like oh I wish I was out here\nmy Ally because I'm saving a lot of\nmoney by not wearing out the alha Flies\nbut this shoe's just been super\ncomfortable as well I'd happily run a\nmarathon in this shoe and you don't want\nto spend the big money on those V flies\nAl flies you can happily get a marathon\ndone in their shoe in comfort knowing\nthat you've got something that's just\n90% as good as something like the vfly\nairly and save that 100 plus pounds so\nwho is the Doom fly 6 best for anyone\nlooking for that durable comfortable\nshoe they can wear for their speed work\nthose longer runs and also races when\nthey don't want to break the bank with\nsomething like the super shoes that we\ndo see nowadays or if you do have a pair\nof those Super Shoes and you don't want\nto wear them out too much in your\ntraining this is a great trainer option\nyou can save those very best ones for\nrace day so that's my list of my most\nsurprising shoes of 2024 the good and\nthe bad let me know your ones down in\nthe comments below we've got our\ncomplete biggest best shoes of the

can't find the\ntime or perhaps you're a bit like me at\nthe moment hitting the limit of what\nyour body's capable of each week so\nyou're looking for some other smarter\nways to perform at your best whatever\nyour reason today I'm showing my\nUltimate Guide to improving your speed\nwith no extra miles required starting\nout we're going to have a chat about\nimproving your form efficient running is\nreally like a secret superpower if you\ncan get from point A to point B as\nefficiently as possible we can get there\nfaster using the same amount of energy\nlet's have a quick chat about some of\nthe basics with good running form\nfirstly let's talk about posture we want\nto feel like we're nice and Tall\nshoulders relaxed head up and leaning\nforward from the ankles and not from the\nhips giving ourselves a nice forward\nlean secondly having a chat about the\narms your arm should swing naturally\nbeside you you don't want them to be\ncrossing over in front of your body as\nthis means a lot of wasted energy\nthrough our body twisting and having to\nstabilize that thirdly having a quick\nchat about Cadence and aiming for around\nabout that 170 to 180 steps per minute\nthis is really going to help us reduce\nthat over striding decrease our contact\ntime on the ground but how do we\nactually put these things into practice\nI'd really recommend choosing one run a\nweek to really dial down and focus on\nyour running form if it's Cadence you\nwant to improve at the time then I'd\nrecommend getting a metronome app or if\nyou've got a Garmin and I think corus do\nit you can have a metronome on that\ndevice as well and it will beep in time\nwith the Cadence that you're aiming for\nif you've got a Cadence of around about\n160 for example then maybe build that up\nto 165 for a few weeks and then build it\nup to that 170 for a few weeks don't\njump up too quickly going up about five\nsteps a minute increments at the time\nlet your body adjust it does take a\nlittle bit of time another little handy\ntip here that I really like to implement\nwhen I was really trying to work on my\nCadence is to work on that arm Drive\nincrease the speed that you're swinging\nyour arms as you run and your feet\nshould naturally FL as well right moving\non let's have a chat about giving each\nrun a purpose this is what so many\nbeginner Runners really struggle with\nmore advanced Runners will be mastering\nthis so if you are more of a beginner\nRunner take note here if you're the type\nof person that does the vast majority of\nruns all at the same Pace you saw some\ngood gains when you started running and\nthey're most likely hitting a plateau\nand you're really struggling to get\nfaster and build more speed there's\nreally a couple of different things that\ncould be going here you may well be\nrunning the vast majority of runs too\nfast really opening yourself up for the\npotential of getting injured or you\ncould be doing a lot of your runs really\ntoo easy and building a good base which\nis fantastic but you're not adding that\nspeed into your routine so you're not\ngetting faster so it's really important\nto learn to run at a range of different\npaces and intensities so I just want to\ngo through a few examples here I've got\nthree different examples three runs a\nweek four runs a week or five runs a\nweek just to demonstrate what I mean by\nthis range of Paces that we want to\nbuild in our routine starting out\nsomeone running three runs a week the\nfirst run of the week most likely to be\na interval speed session the alltime\nclassic 6x3 minutes we're going to doing\nour reps here at that 5K pace so tick\nthat one off nice 5K pace for bu routine\nthe second run of the week most likely\nto be a shorter but a very much sort of\neasy run Pace to get our legs nicely\nrecovered at the weekend a longer run\nagain that easy run pace so not a load\nof different Paces there really for\nbeginner Runners around three times a\nweek we've got easy run pace and that 5K\nPace Building that in throughout the\nweek as we progress a little bit up to\nfour runs a week we're now going to be\nadding in a tempo run into our week as\nwell around about 20 minutes at around\nabout our 10K to half marathon pace\nthat's another Pace we've now built into\nour week take that one off up to five\nruns a week now more experienced Runners\nwe're now probably going to add another\neasy run into our week so another tick\nthere for some more easy pace and then\npotentially adding some strides at the\nend of that run around about that sort\nof 3K pace something like that when\nyou're really sort of opening up the\nlegs building some really good strength\nand working on our running form so\nthat's another Pace tick add that one in\nthere and then during our long run we\nmight add some marathon pace blocks in\nthere for example so that's a marathon\npace tick into the routine as well there\nif you want some real guidance on your\nPaces the type of Paces you should be\ndoing a lot of these runs out we've got\na completely free pacing chart I'll put\nit up on the screen now and we'll link\nto it down below just go to the website\nhit download it will just appear on your\ncomputer absolutely free of course and\nstart building some different Paces into\nyour routine and I'm guarantee you'll\nsee your Fitness really improving both\nthat endurance and that speed as well\nnow maybe you're the type of Runner that\ndoesn't love doing speed sessions maybe\nyou're a bit more of an older Runner\nfavors running on Hills rather than\ngoing that all out paac whatever the\nreason we can also look at doing some\nHill reps in there to replace that speed\nsession or you can just get a mix some\nweeks of speed session some weeks we're\ndoing hill sessions not everyone's got\nHills available to them but if you have\nthese are fantastic running up pills\nreally help strengthen our glutes our\nhamstrings our calves also help building\non that running form as well getting\nthat nicely landing on our midfoot which\nis really a lot easier to do as we're\nrunning uphill so what I recommend a\nvery basic guide to my Hill runs here\nfind a hill with a moderate incline\ndon't worry too much finding that\nperfect Hill something around 4 to 6% is\ngoing to be really good for doing hill\nreps run up the hill of that steady hard\neffort for around about 30 to 60 seconds\nsomewhere in that range is going to be\nreally good focus on driving those knees\nup and pumping your arms as I said to\nreally help build that Cadence as well\nand then jog or walk back down to the\nstart make sure our heart rate is now\nnicely recovered at the bottom of the\nrep start with around about four to six\nreps then work your way up to around\nabout 8 to 10 reps definitely build into\nroutine if you can if you got those\nheels there this is really going to help\nget some more value out of your weekly\nmileage moving on to have a chat all\nabout recovery in order to train hard\nand Implement these more intense\nsessions into our week you need to be\nable to recover a lot better as well\nmake sure you're stretching those major\nmuscle groups after your runs so your\nhamstrings your carves and your quads as\nwell we've got a full cool down routine\nthat you can follow along to it really\njust takes a few minutes but it's going\nto make a big difference when it comes\nto getting ready for your next run I'd\nreally recommend using a foam roller as\nwell if you can for some more intense\nself massage sessions potentially in the\nevening or a massage gun to release any\nsort of tight spots you've got as well\nbut as always with these things use some\nfollow along guides on YouTube to make\nsure you're using them in the most\nefficient way possible doing things also\nlike yoga to improve your mobility and\nstrengthen those stabilizing muscles are\nreally good with running as well again\ncheck out someone like Adrienne on\nYouTube do some of those follow along\nroutines and then finally refuel after\nyour runs with that recovery Shake as\nlong as you're getting around about that\n3:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio it\njust kickstarts that recovery process to\nhelp rebuild those muscles and then\nfinally of course getting some really\ngood sleep is going to make that all\nimportant difference as that's when our\nwhole body is repairing to come back\nstronger the next day now you may have\nheard of the term cross trining getting\nsome alternative different types of\ncardio there's no doubt about it but\nrunning more really is the best way of\nadding running Fitness but as we said at\nthe start of the video that's not going\nto be available to everyone we can't\njust keep running more and more we all\nhave those limits so we can look at\nother ways of adding that cardio Fitness\nwith things like cycling ellipticals and\nswimming as well to build that endurance\nthat speed and that V2 Max even more but\nbecause the impact of these types of\ncross train activities is so much less\nthan with running our heart rate zones\nare also different for these activities\nas well so to get the same intensity and\nthat effort we need to spend a bit more\ntime doing them than we would if we were\nrunning you can't simply replace a 30\nminute run with a 30-minute elliptical\nand expect to get the same sort of\neffect so for example my sort of Rough\nGuide with this one that I use in my own\ntraining so if I'd like to add an extra\n60-minute run into my week this would\nroughly mean spending around 2 hours on\nthe cross trainer with where my own\ntraining is at the moment I've taken out\na couple of double run days which I'd\nusually like to do and I could do them\nquite well a few years ago so i' have\ntaking out two 30 minute runs throughing\nthe week and replacing them with two\n60-minute sessions on the lip it's also\npossible to add some extra intensity\ninto our week if that's what you want to\nbuild in similar to our run sessions we\ncan do these on the cross trainer or the\nbike as well just by increasing the\nresistance of the machines so using our\nearlier example of that 6x3 minute\nsession really quite easy to do this on\na cross trainer just increasing the\nresistance for those 3 minutes and then\ndial it back down again for the recovery\nbikes are really good to replicate some\nof our longer more sustained efforts I\nfind as well so if you're looking to add\nmaybe a 20 minute Tempo into your\nroutine but don't want to do that via\nrunning then doing this 20-minute Tempo\non the bike is definitely something that\nis possible if you want to look at a\ncouple of elite athletes and have some\ndeep Dives on some podcasts and some\ninterviews with them Jess Stenson in\nAustralia doing a lot of her cross\ntraining on the elliptical or a famous\nexample here in the UK well he actually\nlives in the Netherlands now Jake Smith\ndoes a lot of again cross training on\nthe cross trainer using the assault bike\nas well and has also done a lot of\nstrength training in the last couple of\nyears as he's been quite an injury-prone\nathlete recently but it's really\nstarting to pay dividends as he's coming\nback into some really good form at the\nmoment and then building on that little\npoint there from Jake Smith while this\nis definitely going improving our\ncardiovascular system we're not getting\nthat resistance back up from the road\nthat we need so we also need to be doing\nsome strength training as part of our\nroutine to get our legs strong or even\nstronger so we can cover the ground in a\nmore efficient way as well as we touch\non the start so let's have a chat all\nabout strength training so strength\ntraining is so relevant at the moment so\nmany of our Elite Runners are building\nthis into routine by building our\nmuscles especially our legs and our core\nto create more power with each stride\nagain we're just going to get it from\npoint A to point B more efficiently\nagain this becomes even more important\nas we age so so if you're in that 30\nplus 40 plus 50 plus age category for me\nit's now complete non-negotiable I have\nto be doing this if I want to keep my\nrunning fast and serious and relatively\ncompetitive so I'd really recommend\nfocusing on some key exercises the\nthings I'm focusing on at the moment are\nsquats and lunges these are going to\nTarget those glutes those quads\nhamstrings as well these are the three\nPowerhouse muscles of running and then\nalso focus on some good core exercises\nsome planks some bridges why it's so\nimportant to strengthen that core during\nthe back end of races especially running\nfor sort of suffers they become fatigued\nas muscles fatigue and our upper body\ncan be moving around all over the place\njust wasting so much energy here that\nstrong core will keep everything tore\nand just allow us to move in the most\nefficient way for as long as possible so\nagain how do I recommend putting this in\npractice how do I put this into practice\nputting a short circuit together a lot\nof these things you can simply do at\nhome doing things just something like 10\nsquats 10 reverse lunges 10 Bridges and\nthen a 30second plank if you're new to\nstrength training like this do two to\nthree rounds of this and then over time\nbuild up to five to six rounds again as\nyou progress add some weights add some\nkettle bells to these routines so there\nwe have it getting faster isn't all\nabout running but as I said throughout\nthis video running really is the best\nway we can be doing this but it's not\nalways available to everyone there's\nlots of other things we can be doing on\ntop of that mileage once we've maxed out\nthat mileage all these other things come\ninto play so we can become a better\nfaster happier stronger Runner overall\nlet me know which tip you're going to be\ntrying first any tips you'd like to\nshare with the running Community down\nbelow next up we've got a video all\nabout how to improve your running form\nso go and check that one out over here\nthat's it guys keep on working hard keep\nwork done I'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

      "text": "running a marathon is an amazing\nachievement for any human being and\nwhat's even better than that running a\nmarathon faster than you've ever done\nbefore and setting a brand new PB or PR\ndepending on where you are in the world\nand by the end of today's video you're\ngoing to be armed with loads of tips and\ntricks to get you that time that you\nwant we're going to go through what time\nyou should be aiming for the sessions\nthat help me run a 225 Marathon how to\nPace the race itself and those all\nimportant fueling options as well with\nmy own recommendations for what to do\nright let's get stuck into all of the\ntraining how long should you give\nyourself to train for a marathon well\nwould recommend ideally around 15 weeks\nthat's how long all of our training\nplans are which allow for a proper\nbuildup some recovery weeks those all\nimportant high mileage training weeks\nand then the full taper down before race\nday our beginner plans are just a little\nbit longer at 18 weeks to just give new\nmarathoners a little bit of extra time\nto get ready you can check these out on\nmy website vino.com we'll link them down\nbelow all our beginner plans are\ncompletely free to download during this\ntime you're also going to want to pick a\nTarget race to aim for typically\nmarathons are either in the spring or\nthe Autumn is that's when the weather\ntends to be best for Marathon running\ncomment down below with your favorite\nraces where you may already have your PB\nor PR to give your fellow Runners some\ninspiration of the best races some of my\nfavorites some fast races Valencia\nFrankfurt Berlin Rotterdam London and\nChicago I think there some really good\noptions out there so what's a realistic\ntime to aim for for your Marathon well\nthere's loads of different marathon time\ncalculators on the internet and you can\ninput a recent race time from a\ndifferent Race distance from say a half\nmarathon or a 10K and that will give you\na predicted marathon time based on that\nnow these aren't the most accurate way\nof doing things and they usually tend to\npredict time slightly faster than what\npeople are capable of but it gives you a\ngood of inspiration\na little bit of extra umph to get out\nthere and really hit the training hard\nso if you're not sure we'll link to the\nJack Daniels calculator down below as we\nfeel that's the best one out there but\nsetting a go time is going to look\ndifferent for everybody a lot of people\nsimply just take their current time and\nthen just chip away at multiples of five\nso if you're a 335 Marathon the next\nlogical step is sub 330 this is\nsomething you can adapt as your training\nprogresses you may want to find a goal\nthat's a little bit faster a little bit\nslower just with how well the training\nis going how far during a training week\nshould you be running for various goal\ntimes someone wants to run a sub 5H hour\nmarathon they're looking around about 3\nto four runs a week up to around 30 m in\nthat Peak Week 48 km for a sub four\nMarathon really talking again three to\nfour runs a week now up to around 40\nmiles in that biggest week in that peak\nweek around about 64k for that week for\na sub three-hour Marathon 5 to six runs\na week now up to around 64 mil in in\nthat peak week just over 100 km right\nlet's have a chat all about those all\nimportant long runs arguably the most\nimportant run of the week these are runs\nthat going to help build and improve\nyour cardiovascular system and also get\nthe body really strong to be able to run\nthat 26.2 miles the long runs will tend\nto build up progressively throughout the\nplan and then tap out for the longest\nrun tends to be around about 3 weeks\nbefore race day around about 20 to 23\nmiles or 32 to 37k for that longest run\nnow there are a few different types of\nlong runs that we would recommend\ngetting into your training again these\nall feature in our marathon training\nplans the first one being a fast finish\nlong run this might be a 20m total run\nwith the first 14 miles nice and easy\nrelaxed conversational pace and then the\nnext 5 miles of that run at your\nmarathon gold paast then the final mile\njust a nice easy cool down this type of\nrun is a really good Mar Marathon\nsimulator it gets their legs used to\npushing more towards the end of your\nlong run gets our legs nice and tired\nwhich is how they're going to feel\ntowards the end of the marathon so it's\na really good race preparation type of\nrun the second type of long run I really\nlike is marathon pace blocks this is\nsomething I like to do all the time as I\nbuild up for my races my absolute\nclassic is a 30k long run with three 5K\nblocks at my goal Pace with a 5k block\nbetween them at a nice relaxed\nconversational pace practicing marathon\npace during your long runs will really\nhelp you get comfortable with what it\nfeels like to run at this pace and\nyou'll be able to pace yourself so much\nbetter on the day if you spend a lot of\ntime at your goal Pace during your\ntraining splitting your runup into these\ndifferent pace blocks I find really\nhelps mentally with these long runs as\nwell and then my third type of long run\nI like to do in my training is simply\ngoing out for a long run and doing these\nare just all at your easy Pace just\nbanking the distance getting a good time\non feet long run I tend to do these\nduring my recovery weeks when I'm just\ntrying to reduce that intensity and\nreduce that overall load as well I'd\nalso recommend if you can doing some of\nyour long runs at the same time of day\nas your go race starts it just gets the\nbody used to working at this time and\nthen you can practice your pre-race\nroutine with your breakfast as well for\nme when I'm doing my long runs and also\nmy races as well my pre-ra breakfast is\npretty much always the same of two\nbagels with some peanut butter and jam\nor jelly if you're in America again\ngetting these down around about 2 hours\nto 90 minutes before go time practice\nthis in training there's absolutely no\nsurprises on race day it's also a really\ngood time to think about what you want\nto wear on your race day as well and\nwear this during your long runs and\nmaking sure everything fits together\nreally well what's going to be the most\ncomfortable type of shoe top clothing\nhat and all of that sort of stuff for\nthree four five six plus hours\npotentially out there are those\nlightweight carbon Racing shoes going to\nbe the best option people always ask me\nhow many runs should they do in their\nrace shoes and I'd always say do as many\nas you feel you need to do to feel\nconfident in the shoe choice that you're\ngoing to be making on the race day\nputting a brand new pair of shoes out\nthe box on race day is very very risky\nmaybe slightly less risky if youve run\nin exactly that model before it's not\nsomething I would ever do so please\ndon't do that but at least just go out\nthere spend a little bit of time in\nthose race shoes for a lot of people\nthey're going do a couple of their long\nruns in their shoes and it'll warm up\nbefore the race so you're really talking\nmaybe like 60 70k and they'll be\nabsolutely still fresh as a daisy at\nthat sort of level and you absolutely\nhave confidence that they're going to\nget you through the race really well\nmoving on to have a chat all about speed\nsessions now in order to run a faster\nMarathon we need to get the body used to\nrunning faster than your goal pace and\nthis is where our speed workouts and our\ninterval sessions come in these help\nbuild our fitness to increase that\naerobic capacity your V2 Max basically\nand by improving this it improves our\nbody's ability to deliver oxygen to the\nmuscles we'd recommend setting aside at\nleast one run a week dedicated to your\nspeed sessions more experienced Runners\nwill probably want to get two speed\nsessions in per week we'll touch on that\na little bit later on but here's some\nabsolutely classic examples that you can\ntry the first one being is a progression\nrun around about 10 km of distance the\nfirst 3K nice and easy second 3K at your\nmarathon pace the next 2K at your Tempo\npace and then 2K cooling down my second\nfavorite is something like a 6X 3 minute\nsession running these 3 minute blocks\naround about your 5 to 10K pace and just\ntaking a 2minute very chill jog or walk\nbetween each of those reps we're also\ngoing to want to build in some longer\nreps in here as well another classic\nthat I like to do 3x 8 minutes at Tempo\nPace with a 2minute recovery between\nthose blocks there again with the\nrecovery is just walking or a very very\neasy jog just to get your heart rate\nnice and recovered now lot of people ask\nme should we be doing these on a running\ntrack you can if you want to absolutely\nfine they're great places to train I\npersonally don't I just try save my\nmoney and go out and run on the roads in\nthat sort of environment which is just\nbetter replicating what the race is more\nlikely to be like but wherever you want\nto do them just somewhere safe and\ntraffic free we can uh put a drink down\nand get some fluids on board and some\nnutrition then that's going to be\nabsolutely fine now as I touched on at\nthe start of the section more\nexperienced Runners might want to build\nin a second speed session during the\nweek for example one session that\nfocuses on short reps like that 6x3\nminute sessions on a Tuesday and then a\nsecond session with a more sustained\neffort something like a 20 minute Tempo\nthey're going to have the strength in\ntheir legs and the mileage in their legs\nto be able to add this extra amount of\nintensity into the routine which then\ncombined with those long run sessions\nduring those Peak weeks as well will\nreally help build that Fitness and push\nit up even more right moving on to\nanother absolutely classic to get in\nthere during the week that a lot of\npeople don't know about or they neglect\nbut I say it's really important in there\nand that is running strides strides\nquite simply are burst of around about\n20 seconds of fast running at around\nabout 90% effort so not all out running\nfor a bus just below that these really\nhelped to improve our running form and\nhelp to build some strength as well if\nyou're new to strides I'd recommend\ndoing something like three to four reps\nof this more experienced Runners\nanything up to around six or seven reps\nof this with just a very easy jog or\nwalk in between these strides let's have\na chat about easy runs now the rest of\nour week is going to be made up of\nrunning at a nice relaxed easy run Pace\nthe speed sessions the long runs will\nput a lot of stress on the body and so\nthat's why we're now running at a nice\nlow intensity if every day was a speed\nsession we would get injured pretty\nquickly now I want to recommend for your\neasy run Paces for a sub five hour sort\nof goal Target we're talking around\nabout 1140 to 1245 a mile sub four\nrunners going to be doing that easy runs\naround about 10 minutes a mile to 11\nminutes a mile sub three-hour Runners\naround about 750 to 840 minutes a mile\nbut let's have a quick chat about\nstrength work which is a crucial part of\nany training plan especially important\nfor people during the marathon and even\nmore important for some older Runners\nwe' recommending one day a week to this\nand of course more is great as well but\nas a minimum add something like this to\na current day of easy run training and\nkeep your rest days as rest days that's\nreally really important to let your body\nrecover and adapt during those rest days\nnow we have a strength training routine\nwhich is part of our training plans\nwhich you can add on but it's just a\nvery Basics we'd recommend getting in a\nroutine squats Bridges lunges and planks\nget that into your routine and it's\ngoing to help you running so so much now\nrace J is here we want to think about\nwhat we're going to be doing during the\nrace how are we going to Pace it so many\nRunners make this mistake of going out\ntoo fast and blowing up so having a\npacing plan is really important for me\nthere's two different ways of pacing a\nmarathon either start slightly slower\nthan your goal pace and then speed up as\nthe Run goes on this requires a lot of\npatience and control which a lot of\nRunners really do struggle with\nalternatively and what I personally aim\nto do is simply set off at my go pace\nand hold that all the way through and\nthen final few C just try and pick up\nthe pace a little bit more to come in\njust ahead of my goal time now this of\ncourse will depend on the course you're\ndoing what the route's like if it's\nhilly you might to save some energy for\ncertain Hillier parts of the course\ngoing out hard and banking that time\nreally works there'll be a few examples\nof people that have managed to set new\nPBS and PRS by doing that but I'd always\nsay you probably could have gone faster\nif you Pace it a little bit better and\nstart nice and slowly what I recommend\nis using the lap Pace on your watch\nwhich if you have your laps turned on\nwill then reset every kilometer or every\nMile and just stick to that pace\nthroughout the race now if you got some\nsome bad GPS issues on the course such\nas Canary War through London or at the\nstart of the Chicago marathon you'd have\nto worry about this too much because as\nI say it resets all the time and just\nkeep clocking with your watch looking at\nthat lap Pace as you go on also if there\nare any Paces during the event then you\ncan look out and try and run with them\nrunning some of the pacing groups most\nof these Pace groups are really really\ngood I think in the recent New York\nMarathon for example 95% of the Pacers\nachieve their goal time and help all the\nthousands of Runners out there achieve\ntheir goal times as well Right Moving On\nLet's have a chat about fueling how are\nwe going to fuel the race this is what\nsets the marathon apart from so many\nother races with 5Ks 10ks and even up to\nHalf Marathon distance really you can\nget away with not really fueling much or\nat all during these races but with the\nmarathon you cannot do that so it's\nreally important to fuel regularly\nthroughout the race a mistake a lot of\nRunners make when running the marathon\nis they wait till they get tired before\nthey start taking on some fuel and by\nthat point it's far too late and you\ncan't recover from it so what I\nrecommend is a Rough Guide is 30 G of\ncarbs round about every 35 to 45 minutes\nand do this from the start now of course\nas with all things running it's going to\nvary a little bit from person to person\nso we always stress to practice this\nduring your long runs to find out the\nquantities and the timings that work\nwell for you and there's also so many\ndifferent products so many different\ngels natural gels so many different\ntypes of things you can try during your\ntraining all with different amounts of\ncarbohydrates in them as well different\ntextures different flavors so it's\nreally important to find out what works\nfor you we do have a huge gel taste test\ncomparison video to give you some ideas\nwe'll link to that down below as well so\nmaybe have a check out of that if you're\nlooking for some new ideas of some gels\nthat you want to try out now for\nhydration you'll likely have drinks\navailable every few miles on the course\nbut look this up beforehand all of the\nbig majors and the big races will have\ndrink stations at a bare minimum every\ncouple of Miles most of them is every\nsingle mile out there I'd always say\ndrink little and often if you're thirsty\nhave a drink it's very hard to have an\nexact game plan of trying to get a\ncertain amount of liquid down for me I\njust run through a water station if I'm\nfeeling thirsty I try and get something\ndown and then carry on now if you are\nfeeling a bit dehydrated and you need to\nstop and walk to get some water down\nthat's absolutely fine make sure you get\nthat water down sometimes it is really\nhard running through these things and\ntrying to get a cup and get it down you\nbut as I say if you need just stop for a\nfew seconds just to get it down make\nsure there's no one running up down\nbehind you you're going to block someone\nall of a sudden just get that down and\nthen carry on running now you may want\nto use a hydration vest to keep some\nliquids on you and your gels as well or\nany other valuables during your long\nruns and also potentially during your\nrace as well a lot of people like to do\nthis just so they know they've got\nabsolutely everything on them and\nthey're going to be okay they don't have\nto rely on anybody else out there maybe\nthey've got some special drinks or\nthings like that again I would say not\nevery race allows you to have a\nhydration breast but the vast majority\ndo so just make sure you double check\nfor me when I'm doing my long runs I\nusually just simply like to just leave a\nbottle under a bush come in grab that\ndown the drink get a gel on board as\nwell and then carry on just takes about\n30 seconds out of my long run just to\nmake sure I'm getting that fuel on board\nright a couple more things to chat about\nthe next one being recovery during our\ntraining sleep is so important this is\nwhen our body is going to be making\nthose adaptations to become that faster\nrunner we want it be most likely you're\ngoing to be feeling a little bit tired\nanyway so just keep checking with\nyourself see how you feel try and get as\nmuch sleep as you possibly can for a lot\nof people after their runs they're going\nto want to get a nice recovery Shake on\nboard something with a good mix of\ncarbohydrates and proteins something\nlike a 3:1 mix is pretty standard yeah\ngetting something like that down within\nthat 30 minutes after you run is really\ngood thing as well I'm making sure\nyou're doing a really good solid warm up\nwith some dynamic stretches easing into\nall of our runs before we head out and\nthen some static stretches after our run\njust to look after ourselves the thing I\nwant to have a chat about is just\ntalking to those around you about what\nyou're doing communicate with your\nfriends and family adding this whole new\nthing into what is probably already\nquite a busy schedule can be quite a\nstressful thing chat to people let them\nknow how you're feeling if you've got\nany injuries and pains get some advice\nis no problem at all just to cross train\nfor a few days just while they die down\nI absolutely guarantee that everybody\ntraining for a marathon will have some\nsort of minor injury thing to deal with\nduring their training block yes it's\nquite stressful but get some helpful\nadvice look up some advice on YouTube\nideally get to see someone a physio\nsports massage therapist in person if\nyou can running a marathon is an\nincredibly amazing thing to do also a\nvery hard thing to do so give yourself a\npad on the back for taking time to do\nsome research to improve yourself\nbecause no doubt you're going to have an\namazing time out there as I say running\na marathon is hard but it feels so good\nwhen you cross the finish line knowing\nthat you've had a really good run out\nthere and if you need a little bit more\nguidance on your training then

      "text": "running is simple right just lace up\nyour shoes and go but as easy as it\nseems there are some classic mistakes\nthat can turn your runs into struggles\nstruggles into problems and problems\nmeans you're not going to be enjoying a\nrunning as much as you deserve so today\nwe're breaking down the most common\nrunning slip-ups from doing too much too\nsoon to not hydrating and fueling your\nruns properly I'm going to be showing\nyou exactly how to avoid them to run\nsmarter stay injury free and enjoy your\nrunning even more right let's get\nstraight into this starting out we're\ngoing to be chatting about not fueling\nand hydrating your runs properly this\nwill become increasingly important as\nour runs get longer for everybody out\nthere training for half marathons and\nmarathons and potentially longer than\nthat for your longer runs you want to be\ntaking some sort of fuel throughout the\nrun to keep your energy source topped up\nand running strong till the end so if\nyou're going out for 60 minutes or more\nthen consider taking some gels or an\nalternative fuel whatever suits you you\nshould be taking around about 30 G worth\nof carbohydrates taking this around\nabout every 35 to 45 minutes and this is\nreally why most people struggle on their\nlong runs because they don't fuel early\nenough they wait till they get tired you\ngot to top up these stores early and\noften also make sure you're starting out\nthe Run feeling fueled and hydrated\nbeforehand this of course depends on the\ntime of day for me it's always that\nclassic bagel and then I'm going to be\nrunning about an hour after that\nnutrition and hydration is so much about\ntrial and error what works for for\nsomeone might not necessarily work for\nsomebody else so experiment a lot try\nwith lots of different things and then\ncome race dat it will all click because\nyou know exactly what you should be\ndoing next up I want to have a quick\nchat about running with poor form few of\nus were ever really taught how to run\nand consequently we pick up a lot of bad\nhabits that are hard to unte but there\nare a few basic things we can do to\nconcentrate on improving our form\ngetting ourselves covering the ground in\na more efficient way starting out make\nsure we're not over striding this is\nwhen you land with your foot out in\nfront of you and this is going to create\na breaking force and put a lot of strain\non your joints as well we want to be\nfocused having that foot Landing nicely\nunderneath our Center of mass underneath\nour body which is when we're going to be\nable to absorb that impact nicely and\nthen spring off with the next stride\nwith our posture we want to make sure we\nhave a slight forward lean from the\nankles not from the waist this will\nreally help you to get that correct foot\nplacement that we've just talked about\nabout and then finally our Cadence this\nis the number of steps we take per\nminute as we run newer Runners typically\nhave quite a low Cadence maybe 150 160\nsteps a minute there are lots of ways we\ncan increase this that's all for a\nseparate video we'll link to our Cadence\nvideo up here and down below moving on I\nwant to have a quick chat about strength\ntraining yes it's a bit boring but it's\nso important especially for older\nRunners getting that right balance can\nbe quite hard getting worried you don't\nwant to overdo your strength training\nbecause that might impact your running\nyou're going to get even more achy\nmuscles in those early days of strength\ntraining your body's not going to be\nused to it so you may get some achy\nmuscles you may have to dial down your\nrunning a little bit as your body adapts\nand becomes stronger and then we can\nstart to build the running back in I'd\nreally recommend in those early days\njust one strength session a week will\nhave a really positive impact on your\nrunning it doesn't have to be long or\nsuper intense you can simply do this at\nhome with just some basic exercises like\nsome squats some bridges some planks\nsome lunges and some Cal races you can\neven do a lot of these on the run as\nwell just stop for 10 or 15 minutes and\ndo these when you're out on the run I\nlike to do these always on my easy run\nday so I do an easy run in the morning\nand then my strength training in the\nafternoon as I believe it's really\nimportant to keep those rest days as for\nrest days next up don't do too much too\nsoon now you might be new to running or\ncoming back after an injy sometimes it's\ndifficult to know exactly what you're\ncapable of and it's easy to get carried\naway with maybe running too far too fast\nor too frequently as well or potentially\na combination of all three injuries can\nstart cropping up which forces us to\nhave time off no one wants to be doing\nthat when the golden rule of running is\ntrying to achieve that consistency and\nthat's what's going to make us a better\nfaster stronger happier Runner overall\nnow you may have heard of the 10% Ru\nwhich basically says don't increase your\nweekly volume by more more than 10% per\nweek while this can work for a lot of\nrunners in that middle band from We're\nexperienced Runners they're going to\nramp up far too quickly and for some\nnewer beginner Runners it's not going to\nbe challenging enough so it's all about\nusing that 10% rule as a rough guide and\njust adapting it for where you are in\nyour training and of course it doesn't\ntake into account intensity that we're\nbuilding into our weeks as well so I'd\nreally recommend as you're starting to\nbuild things up in your training just\nchange one thing at a time time\nfrequency or intensity don't go adding\nloads more time to your runs doing more\nruns and doing them faster as well\nthat's going to lead to some injury just\nchange one thing maybe per week and\nbuild it up gradually like that I'd\nreally recommend take recovery weeks as\nwell to let our body adapt that doesn't\nmean of course we can't go for a run\nthis is going to be a week every 3 to\nfour weeks there's going to be less\nvolume during this week and there's\ngoing to be less intensity during the\nweek as well allowing our body time to\nrecover I'd really recommend always\nfollowing a your training plan which we\nhave on the website link down below at\nbenp parks.com all our beginner plans\nare completely free to download it's\ngoing and check those out there's links\nto marathon training plans half\nmarathons 5Ks 10ks Ultra plans all on\nthere with thousands of fstar reviews\nfrom loads of Runners all around the\nworld that have been using our plans for\nyears and achieve some great results and\nthen finally in this section simply\nlistening to your body your body is the\nbest indicator for how well you are\nadapting to your training if you are\nfeeling more tired than normal then rest\nup if you got particularly achy muscles\nthen rest up if your mojo is just a\nlittle bit low lacking is some\nmotivation then rest up which leads us\nreally nicely on to the next common\nmistake which is ignoring pain when our\nbody is telling us that something isn't\nquite right we're so often taught to\npush through pain no pain no gain\nmentality and it's most likely going to\nlead to an injury and some time off from\nrunning if you are getting some pains be\nflexible with your training consider\nyour training plan as a Rough Guide but\ndon't worry if you have to miss a few\nruns here and there just to allow your\nbody to fix that pain that it's\nexperiencing flexibility is so important\nover the long term as we're trying to\nachieve that consistency definitely seek\nsome professional advice if you can\nafford to of course that's not going to\nbe available for everybody but getting\nsome professional advice from a physio\nor even a sports massage therapist and\nthen you will know exactly what to do to\nfix that pain and get it out of your\nlife and get back running stronger so\nmany running injuries can be fixed by\nsimply resting icing heat treatment\nstretching massaging and doing strength\nwork as well so a lot of the time it's\nnot something to be particularly worried\nabout or scared of but get that\nprofessional advice if you can afford to\nif you can't then I always recommend\nchecking out people like Bob and Brad\nhere on YouTube they've got an excellent\nChannel but you've just got to make sure\nyou're 100% sure with that self\ndiagnosis and just build that into your\nstrength routine to get that injury gone\nnext up is an alltime classic everybody\ndoes this I think when they start\nrunning myself included running too fast\npeople head out the door and absolutely\ntear it down the road running far too\nfast and before they know it they've got\ntheir hands on knees thinking this\nrunning lck is really quite difficult it\nputs so much extra stress on our body\ntraining this way and it's really not\nthe best way of running fast in the long\nterm with our running either what I\nalways like to do with my running is\naround about 80% of my training a week\nwill be at a low heart rate a\nconversational Pace Zone 2 heart rate\nzone 2 training however you want to\nphrase it the kind of training at that\nintensity as you're running along you\ncould have a chat with a friend as you\ngo and then the 20% of the week we're\ntalking about some more structured\ntraining some intervals some faster Pac\nrunning some thresholds things like that\nand again a lot of people can be guilty\nof running these too fast as well going\nout to smash their K reps as fast as\nthey can this again can lead to\novertraining as well so if you're really\nunsure about how fast you should be\nrunning download one of our completely\nfree pacing guides and it would just\ngive you an idea of how fast to run your\neasy runs at how fast to run your\nintervals at it's going to be a really\ngood guide that you can take in your\ntraining so why this is so important\nit's going to allow us to build up our\nmileage safely build that endurance\nbuild our cardiovascular system without\noverly straining our body right put your\nhands up if you're guilty of not warming\nup before your runs I am definitely\nguilty of this when I was running in my\n20s I was and then what once you get\ninto your 30s and now into my 40s you\njust can't get away with it warming up\nproperly and getting the body ready for\nrunning especially in the colder months\nas we're experiencing now again it will\nreally help reduce that risk of picking\nup injuries you're most likely to inj\nyourself by pulling a muscle of\nstraining a muscle in those first few\nminutes of a run I know a lot of us are\nparticularly time poor these days but it\nreally does take just 5 minutes of doing\nsome dynamic stretches so things like\nleg swings opening and closing the gate\nsome hamstring stretches are really\ngoing to help you Ease Into The Run\nwe'll link to our complete follow along\nalong warm-up video up here and down\nbelow and then finally I just say ease\ninto your run as well it's a very slow\njog for that first K on my run today my\nfirst opening K was just over 5 minutes\nbut my overall average for the Run was 4\nminutes 26 okay just treat that opening\nK as very gentle very relaxed as you get\ngoing and then you can speed up and warm\nup to the average pace that you want to\ndo for the whole run another one I've\nbeen guilty I've been guilty of a lot of\ndays today it's basically not resting\nenough rest days really are part of our\noverall training this is when we're\ngoing to be making those all important\nadaptations and our muscles can rebuild\nafter the tough training sessions we've\nbeen putting them through in my own\ntraining I always treat rest days as\nfull rest days no cross training no\nstrength training definitely no running\nhow many rest days is going to depend on\nthe individual for me it's always once\nper week now it used to be once every\nabout 12 or 13 days but as we get a\nlittle bit older we need a little bit\nmore rest in our routine when to put\nthese in during the week point it's\nusually a good idea after a hard session\nafter a long run and then also when you\nare having that little bit of chill time\nrelaxing and resting you can be doing\nthat in your rest day sweater or rest\nday te which you can pick out from my\nwebsite benp parks.com we ship all\naround the world and feel free to use\ncode youtube1 for 10% off your order\nnext up we just want to touch on\noveranalyzing everything we're doing\ngetting bogged down in all that we're\ncollecting on our devices there's so\nmany different running gadgets these\ndays analyzing everything we're doing\nheart rate monitors lact tape monitors\nfoot pods there's so much data that can\nbe analyzed and of course it can be\nincredibly useful in improving our\nrunning but equally it can be damaging\nand demoralizing at certain times as\nwell remember with our running progress\nis not linear and it does take time as\nwell you'll always have good days and\nbad days as part of your training and\nthese can't always necessarily be\nexplained we're complex human beings\nthere are so many other factors that can\naffect our running nutrition life\nstresses are mood I always say it's\ncompletely fine to turn these features\noff use them when you feel comfortable\nusing them if your garment is telling\nyou you're unproductive just a few days\nbefore your goal race maybe your heart\nrate is a bit elevated maybe you're a\nbit stressed about everything and then\nit goes and tells you you're\nunproductive it's really not going to\nput you in a very good head space when\nin fact you could be in the form of your\nlife you're just a little bit stressed\nabout about the travel and everything\nthat's going on out there our gadgets\nare only as good as the data that we're\nfeeding into them and we don't always\nknow it's that accurate either so it's\nall about knowing the relationship you\nhave with these gadgets and devices\nthey're not always correct they're not\nalways right they can be but just take\neverything with a bit of a pinch of salt\nand see how do you feel inside and that\nis the most important thing right our\nlast one now is especially important in\n2024 is simply comparing yourself to\nothers or other people on social media\nof course it's really good to follow\npeople for inspiration and ideas\npotentially for your own training but\ntry not to compare your training to\ntheirs how fast they're going where\nthey're running who they're running with\nremember everyone's on their own Journey\neveryone's got different life stresses\nin their life different experience\nlevels you really will never see that\nfull picture on social media apps like\nstraa can be really great for tracking\nyour own progress but it's really\nimportant to keep that ego in check St\ntrying to impress your mates to keep\nyour easy runs nice and easy and of\ncourse as with any social media it's\ncompletely fine to take a break I've had\nto a few times over the years where my\nmental health has not been in a good\nplace to be on social media contrary to\nwhat everybody says the runs really do\nstill count if they aren't on straa or\nyou can just keep them private and go\nback on straa when you feel ready to go\nout there and share your running Journey\nagain there's so much to think about\nhere have I missed any what running\nmistakes have you made over the years\nand how have you overcome them let me\nknow down in the comments and help out\nthe running Community as well please\ncheck out my website benp parks.com and\nfeel free to use that code you 10 for\n10% off anything you fancy there and it\nreally helps to support the channel and\nsupport everything we do that's it guys\nlots of love keep on working hard keep\ndone we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

      "text": "Max cushion shoes have become a really\npopular segment in the running shoe\nmarket recently with loads of options\nnow available and more and more Runners\nchoosing to go for these massive Foams\nthese Max stack shoes are often marketed\nas the shoe that's going to provide that\nultimate Comfort to protect your legs\nfrom the impact of the roads with all\nthat foam underneath us I've personally\nbeen enjoying getting a lot of my runs\ndone in this style of shoe recently so\ntoday I thought I'd break down my six fa\nshoes in this section letting you know\nwhat's different about them all my likes\nand dislikes to help you with your\nbuying decisions when you're looking for\nthis type of shoe and as always with\neverything here on the channel I bought\nall of these shoes 100% with my own\nmoney to give you my completely honest\nunbiased thoughts thanks to everyone\nthat supports this channel by liking the\nvideos sharing them with their friends\nand commenting down below with your\nthoughts on the best Mac stack shoes out\nthere and also everyone that checks out\nmy website benp parks.com we've got\namazing running hat training plans and\nTechnical gear to help you with your\nrunning and feel free to use code\nYouTube 10 for 10% off your next order\nright let's get stuck into all the shoes\nnow we've got six to go through starting\nat the cheapest finishing with the most\nexpensive starting out with a new\nbalance more version 5 I've been\nenjoying this shoe for a few months now\nusing it for a lot of my recovery runs\nwhich is where this shoe is best\nprice-wise this sent me back\n\u00a340 stack kite 44 mil at the back of the\nshoe 4 mm drop overall and coming at\n374 G for me in my UK size 12 a little\nbit on the heavy side as a lot of these\nshoes are on this list today we've got\nnew balances Fresh Foam X midsole extra\nsoft extra squishy very very plush here\nthis really does feel like you've got\nsome marshmallows under your feet and\nfinally it was true to size for me well\nlet's start out chatting about the\nlights with the shoe it was supremely\ncomfortable and very very soft this is\ngoing to be really good if you like that\nvery plush sinking into the foam type\nfeeling with a shoe like this there is a\ngood width to the base of their shoe a\nlot of surface area on the bottom here\nso you do feel surprisingly stable in\nthem given how soft it is as well it's\nalso got a really nice rocker here at\nthe front of the shoe really helps you\nget a nice leg turnover going there and\nthe upper with the shoe provides a\nreally accommodating area at the front\nof the shoe so if you've got wide feet\nyou're going to be good here but there\nis an extra wide option so if you have\ngot particularly wide feet then go and\ncheck that one out and this is a great\noption also not just for runners but\neverybody wanting some all day Comfort\nwhether you're walking working whatever\nyou're doing if you want a shoe for\ntraveling something like that this is\ngoing to provide you that all day\ncomfort with running and everything you\nchoose to do in it dislikes with the\nshoe the upper is quite thick\npotentially some breathability issues\nthere if you are running in the shoe in\na particularly hot climate and really\nwith the shoe this is just easy and\nRecovery runs over this foam is so so\nsoft so you really aren't going to be\npicking up the pace too much in this\nshoe but it's going to look off your\nlegs supremely well out there so in\nsummary with the New Balance Mo version\n5 this is the cheapest shoe here by\nLongway some pretty good value at 140\nperfect for someone that's going to love\nthat super soft super squidgy super plus\ntype ride right moving on let's have a\nchat about a puma shoe coming up next so\nthis is a puma magmax Nitro a very new\nshoe here from Puma their first real\ncontender in this Max stack height type\nof area this is for your easy runs your\nrecovery runs but also your long runs\nyou can go for a long way in this and\npick up the pace a little bit better\nthan you could in the New Balance treee\nthere price-wise quite a lot for a puma\nshoe here\n\u00a3170 stack kite 46 mil absolutely crazy\nat the back of the shoe 8 mm drop\noverall and 366 G for me in my UK size\n12 we've got Pumas Nitro foam midsole\nand the sizing was pretty good here it\nwas true to size for me well let's have\na chat out some of my likes with the\nshoe firstly the outsole with the shoe\nis very very grippy the pumer grip\noutsole is absolutely fantastic a great\nwinter option here many people say\npummer outso are some of the very best\nout there and this one delivers\nfantastically well it's also a good\nstable option here again surprisingly\nstable here in the corners you're not\ngoing to have to worry about rolling and\nankling this one the ility is coming\nfrom this foam it is definitely on the\nstiff side on the dense side so you're\ndefinitely not going to be wallowing it\ndoesn't have that soft marshmallowy\nfeeling that the New Balance had this\none's a lot firmer your feet sit\nslightly below that top level of the\nmidsole so you're getting a really good\nlock down there with this really nice\nupper as well you're also getting a\nsurprising amount of energy return a lot\nof Popp and springiness and\nresponsiveness from this foam here which\nis Puma's highest end foam so you can\ndefinitely pick up the pace a lot more\nthan you expect with a shoe that is\nquite this size you don't notice the all\nthat weight and that bulkiness with the\nshoe as much as you doing some of the\nones that are coming on a little bit\nlater in this video and also the upper\nwith the shoe is really quite nice and\nvery breathable as well if you are\nrunning some hotter climates get some\ngood air flow coming through here\ndislikes with the Puma sadly although\nit's the second cheapest shoe here is\ndefinitely on the expensive side for a\npuma shoe which is really because the\namount of pummer highest end foam that's\nin this shoe it just warrants putting\nthe price up to what it is but it's\nstill cheaper than most of the ones out\nthere so maybe it's a positive at \u00a3170\nshoes are going absolutely crazy these\ndays and then the final dislike it is a\nlittle bit on the narrow side a lot of\nPuma shoes are on the narrow side so if\nyou're someone that has narrow or sort\nof Fairly sanded feet you're going to be\nokay but a wider footed person is\nprobably going to want to look elsewhere\nso in summary with the shoe this is a\nreally great option for someone looking\nfor a very stable firmer and more\nversatile ride than something like the\nnew balance is offering and it's really\ngoing to be suitable for the your easy\nPace your steady Pace your marathon pace\nand your longer runs and you've got the\nbest grip out of all of these options as\nwell so if you're looking for a good\nwinter shoe option this is definitely\nthe one to be going for right going up a\nlittle bit in price now is the aex GEL\nNimbus 26 a shoe I had earlier on this\nyear I used it and then it was time for\nit to be retired and I don't have it\nhere anymore but really enjoyed putting\na lot of a Cas through that shoe the\npurpose of something like the S6 Joe\nnumber 26 this is definitely very\nsimilar to the New Balance here your\neasy and Recovery runs price-wise it\nsent me back\n\u00a380 stack height at the back 42 millim\nand then an 8 mm drop overall weightwise\n373 G for me in my UK size 12 the midso\nwe're getting a lovely Big Slab of the\nFF blast Eco plus to really help absorb\nall that impact from the roads and\nsizing wise it was true to size for me\nstarting out with the lights with the ax\nit comes in three different widths which\nis really fantastic standard wide and\nextra wide so if you're someone that has\na slightly wider foot this is definitely\ngoing to be one of the ones to have a\nlook at the upper is super soft and\nsuper stretchy this gives a fantastic\nlock down Ultra breathable and Ultra\ncomfortable as well it's actually Market\nas the most comfortable running shoe and\nit's really hard to disagree with that\nit came top of the list when I did my\nmost comfortable shoe video at the start\nof this year and I'll link to that up\nhere and down in the description as well\nand I had absolutely no overheating no\nhot spots no blisters or anything like\nthat but as I say it's not all smiles\nwe've got some dislikes to go through\nquickly as well like the more version 5\nat the start of the video the shoe is\nbest at those easy and Recovery run\nPaces the foam isn't quite as soft as\nthe New Balance but it's still very much\non the soft side New Balance very very\nsoft this is just very soft so don't\nexpect to be picking up the pace in this\none too much for me I use this just as\nmuch second run of the day type shoe\nwhen I just wanted to look after my legs\nso in some if Comfort is your main\npriority then this is definitely a good\none to be looking at as I say this is my\nrecovery on shoe that I used for the\nfirst half of this year and it looked\nafter my legs fantastically well plus\nthere's some really good discounts on\nthe 26 now because the 27 isn't far away\napparently right let's move on to the\nnext one we're talking about Brooks\nright this is a new shoe from Brooks The\nBrooks Glycerin Max and I think it's a\nreally nice looking shoe as well let me\nknow what you think down in the comments\nthis is I think one of the best best\nlooking shoes that Brooks have produced\nthe purpose of the glycerin Max this is\nan easy and Recovery run shoe as well\nbut it's going to be really good at the\nlong runs it's a little bit firmer a\nlittle bit more responsive you're\ngetting a little bit more propulsion to\nlook after yourself deep into those long\nruns price-wise\n1880 stack height at the back of the\nshoe 45 mm and a 6 mm drop overall\nWeight Wise\n375 gram midsole with a shoe we've got\nBrooks's DNA tuned cushioning here\nbasically we've got two different types\nof density Foams we've got some larger\ncells at the back for some nice Airy\nsoft Landings and some smaller density\nFoams at the front just to help with\nthat Poppy toe off and you can kind of\nfeel that working in there I'm not going\nto lie sizing wise this was true to size\nfor me right let's start out with the\nlikes now this is the closest feeling\nshoe I've ever found to the best shoe in\nclass here really which is the aex super\nblast version 2 just very very similar\nmid sole feeling that you get with the\nshoe the midsole is definitely a lot\nfirmer than You' expect for a 45 mil\nstack shoe but it's bouncy and has\nreally fantastic energy return as well\nthe rocker at the front of the shoe is\nreally quite pronounced and it gives you\na lovely transition through the foot\nstrike encourages a really good turnover\nso it really helps disguise the weight\nand the bulkiness of this shoe because\nit is a very big shoe here but also with\nso much cushioning and a lot of padding\naround the heel there and this\nengineered mesh upper getting a good\namount of air flow coming through there\nit's a really comfortable ride and as\neverything with Brooks everything I've\never tested really great build quality\nwith this shoe really feels like a very\ngood quality product and durability is\ngoing to be high on a shoe like this\nwe've got a fantastic rubber outso here\nproviding some really good winter grip\nas well right let's move on to chat\nabout a few of the dislikes and what\nreally sets this shoe apart from the\nsuper blast is you just really can't get\naway from the weight and the bulkiness\nin the shoe the superl is nearly 100 G\nlighter which is just of course you're\ngoing to notice something like that and\nyou can just pick up the pace far better\nin the super blast but yeah marathon\npace and slower it's just going to look\nafter your legs really well if you do\nwant to do some speed and some workouts\nin it you're going to get a good extra\nworkout with the extra sort of bulkiness\nand the weight in this shoe so maybe\nit's not all bad but yeah just weight\nand bulk unfortunately do let this shoe\ndown right let's have a chat about the\nsummary with this one this is just a\nreally great shoe for someone is looking\nfor a larger size shoe this goes all the\nway up to a uk14 Brooks offers some\nreally great versatility across a lot of\ntheir line unfortunately they're not\noffering this in wide at the moment\nhopefully that will come soon but the\nwidth in the shoe is surprisingly\ngenerous as well so another good wide\noption there if you have a slightly\nwider foot and if you like a kind of a\nlittle bit more of a firmer feel Under\nFoot then as I say this is going to be a\nreally good option right moving on to\nthe hoker Skyward X the biggest shoe\nhere the biggest shoe I've ever reviewed\n48 mm stack heite at the back of this\nshoe absolutely crazy this is for your\neasy runs recovery runs and longer runs\nas well this sent me back\n\u00a385 here in the UK stack C just said 448\nmm stack height 5 mm drop overall this\nis absolutely crazy you're going to feel\nso tall in this shoe you sit right on\ntop of that 48 mm stack kite you\ncurrently can't feel any of the ground\nweightwise 370 8 G for me in my UK size\n12 midso we've got two different layers\nof foam in this shoe one layer of super\nsoft premium peber foam from Hoka and\nthen one layer of that super critical\nEva for addit durability and you're also\ngetting a carbon plate in this shoe as\nwell which is added in there to add a\nlot more extra stability with this\namount of Stack height and this amount\nof softness that you get in the shoe you\nreally going to need that plate in the\nshoe to hold it all together sizing wise\nthis was true to size for me starting\nout with my likes with the shoe this is\njust really good fun to run in the\nsoftness the stability that the shoe\nprovides and that plate when you pick up\nthe pace it's just an all around fun\npackage it puts a smile on your face it\nfeels really quite smooth through the\nfoot strike despite a lot of bulk in the\nshoe and a lot of weight in the shoe as\nwell it feels really good quality it's a\nvery good build quality here from hoker\nand really great for that long time on\nfeet those long runs or maybe even long\ndistance walk as well it is also very\nvery soft and very Squishy in this shoe\nvery similar feeling to the gel ners 26\nand the more version 5 but that plate in\nthe shoe means it's a lot stiffer than\nthose shoes a lot more stability with\nthe shoe so it's just going to excel a\nlot more as you pick up the past to\nMarathon past and half marathon past\nsomething like that this is now a shoe\nthat some heavier people could\ndefinitely want to consider doing some\nracing in as well they're worried about\nsome of the Foams bottoming out\ndefinitely not going to be the case here\nin terms of dislikes with the shoe I\nkind of feel like I'm repeating myself\nquite a bit today but it's just\nobviously a bit heavy a little bit bulky\nit's the heaviest shoe here today the\nheaviest shoe that I've ever tested here\non the channel but with all that foam\nand those plates they really do look\nafter your legs very very well so in\nsummary there's a little bit more Tech\ngoing on in this shoe with that plate\nhere as to say it's the only one here on\nthis list it's also a lot of fun to run\nin it's quite extreme on the stack\nheight front so if you want a really\nlightweight shoe this is definitely\ngoing to be one to avoid but I've got a\nlightweight shoe coming up now so let's\nhave a chat about the super blast\nversion 2 as soon as you pick this up\nyou know you're picking up something\nvery very special it's so much lighter\nthis was 288 G for me in my UK size 12\nat least 100 G lighter than a lot of\nthose options this is my second pair\nwhich is why I've actually had to write\nnumber two on the back here wore my\nfirst pair out but anyway let's move on\nto sh all of the facts and figures the\npurpose of the shoe like this this is a\nclassic daily shoe you can definely do\nyour long runs you can do your races you\ncan do your easy runs you can kind of do\nrecovery runs it's certainly not the\nbest option out there for your recovery\nruns but it's a shoe that can do\neverything pretty damn well price-wise\ntalking around about \u00a3200 the prices do\nchange a little bit on the aex website\naround about2 200 though stack kite 45\nmm stack kite still a lot of foam you're\ngetting with this shoe here as with all\nthe ones in this video today 88 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise is coming in at 288\nG so around about 90 to 100 G lighter\nthan all the other ones but I did get\nthis in half a size down so that's just\nwhat you need to do in something like\nthe super blast so this wasn't true to\nsize I got half size down so 11 and a\nhalf for me midso wise we've got mostly\nasx's FF turbo plus foam asx's most\npremium foam that they offer in all\ntheir high-end ratio that's what the\nbulk of this shoe is here and then\nunderneath that we've got a layer of FF\nblast foam which is a lot more durable\nthen as usual we've got the rubber out\nsoole here these yellow bets you can see\non the bottom of the shoe just to add\nthat extra grip a big improvement from\nSuper Blast 2 versus one was a lot\nbetter grip but it's still nowhere near\nas good as something like the pummer\ngrip as I say sizing wise I went half a\nsize down likes with the shoe it's just\nso so versatile if you're traveling\nmoving around you can only take one shoe\nwith you this is really for me this year\nand a lot of last year as well this is\nthe shoe I'm always want to be taking a\nshoe that can really do it all Races\nI've raced in this shoe you can do speed\nsessions in this shoe easy runs long\nruns it's super comfortable as well a\nshoe that I reach for about 90% of the\ntime when I'm not testing other shoes\nit's also supremely lightweight as we've\nchatted about and also surprisingly\ndurable I got around about 1,000 very\nhappy ks in my first pair of super blast\nnow I'm on to my second pair I've got\nanother pair ready to go dislikes with\nthis shoe unfortunately still very hard\nto get hold of but as soon as this comes\ninto stock it always sells out within 24\nhours so yes it's very much on the\nexpensive side but the versatility makes\nup for that and the demand clearly makes\nup for that they could certainly put the\nprice up with the shoe and people would\nstill be paying for it it's that much in\ndemand so summary with the super Blast 2\nyes definitely the lightest shoe here\nthe most versatile but definitely the\nfirmest ride this is a shoe that is\ngoing to give you a pretty firm ride out\nthere but it's responsive and I say you\ncan pick up the pace really quite nice\nwith the shoe now some people might be\nasking why you not reviewing the\nInvincible well I haven't got it yet\nversion 4 is due out supposedly this\nyear here we'll be bringing that full\nNike Invincible version 4 as soon as it\ndrops so get subscribed for that so\nlet's go through my final Thoughts with\nthese shoes here starting out with the\nNew Balance definitely the softest\nsquishiest shoe here but also the\ncheapest one as well perfect for someone\nlooking for those super squishy soft\nrecovery runs to look after your legs\npummer the outstanding feature with the\npummer it's got the best grip the best\nwinter running option here and\ndefinitely something you can do some\nlong runs in a little bit more\nresponsive the Joe Nimbus 26 the most\ncomfortable shoe here in the lineup the\nBrooks best for people with particularly\nbig feet with the sizing options that\nare on offer and again you can go long\nin this shoe really nice and responsive\nas well hokus skywood X the most extreme\nthe biggest stack kite a big fan\nfavorite on the channel this year a lot\nof you guys absolutely loving the\nskywood X as we've got a dedicated\nreview all about this one so go and\ncheck that one out and then yeah\nprobably going to be my favorite show of\nthe year the best allrounder most\nversatile lightweight but sadly the most\nexpensive option as well but the one I\nwould definitely recommend\nwholeheartedly above all the others on\nthe list but they're all really good\noptions let me know what you would\nchoose on the list here next video\ncoming up is our best daily shoe options\nyou can see that up here if you want to\nsee that dedicated hocus skyex video\nI'll link to that one down here keep on\nworking hard keep on done we'll see you\nvery soon in the next one",

      "text": "hello every and welcome back to the\nchannel today I'm going to take you\nthrough my top six running drills for\nregular Runners to get you moving better\nget you stronger improve your running\nform and enjoying your running a little\nbit more I've been putting these into my\nroutine for the last few years and I've\nreally seen a big Improvement in my\nrunning form over that time I like to do\nthese at least twice a week before my\nspeed sessions to get everything nicely\nactivated ready to go but let's get St\ninto the first one now before we start\noff it's really important to make sure\nyou're nicely warmed up I'd recommend\ndoing around about 10 minutes of easy\njogging and your regular warm-up routine\nbefore you get going with these you\ndon't want to be going into these cold\nright let's start off with something\nnice and simple in butt kicks these are\ngoing to get your hamstrings fired up\nnicely and help promote that quick leg\nturnover with this one you're trying to\nbring your heels up towards your bum\nunderneath you rather than flecking your\nheels behind you in terms of how long to\ndo this for you're looking for around\nabout 20 to 30 seconds beginners do this\none time intermediate two times and\nadvance three times with just a couple\nof seconds rest between each one next up\nwe've got Carri ochre which is one\nyou'll see all of the footballers doing\nit's great for engaging the muscles\naround your hips and then for that\nlateral movement helps improve our\nstability and coordination too this one\ndoes take a little bit of practice but\nonce you've got the hang of it it's a\nreally good one you're stepping out to\nthe side with one leg and then the other\nleg alternates between going in front\nand then behind so side forward side\nback side forward side back and then so\non walk through it a few times to get\nthe hang of it again we're going to be\ndoing this for around about 20 seconds\nin one direction and then stop and go in\nthe other direction and then consider\nthat one round beginners do this once\nintermediate two rounds and advance\nthree rounds Right Moving on we're going\nto be talking about the straight leg run\nwhich is a great one for encouraging\nthat midfoot strike and gets the quads\nnicely fired up too with this one you're\nkeeping your legs straight and kicking\nthem out in front of you what you want\nto focus on here is trying to stay\nupright and Tall avoid leaning too much\nback on this one we also want the steps\nto be quick and short throwing your foot\ndown into the ground again with this one\nwe're doing this for around about 20 to\n30 seconds beginners one time\nintermediate twice and Advance Runners\nthree times next up we have the walking\nlunge and knee Drive these will really\nhelp us open up the hips as well as\nengaging our lower leg muscles it also\nreally helps to improve balance and\ncoordination since you're spending a bit\nof time on one leg and that's all\nimportant for running because we're\nalways on one leg so you're pulling your\nknee up into your chest and then\nstepping forward into a lunge bending\nboth knees around 90\u00b0 if you do find\nyourself a bit wobbly with these imagine\nyour feet are on train tracks rather\nthan one in front of the other and that\nshould help stabilize you a little bit\nbetter performing these slowly will be a\nlot better than rushing them I'd\nrecommend doing 10 in total with five on\neach leg beginners do this one time\nintermediates twice and advance three\ntimes next up is those high knees an\nabsolute classic for a lot of us over\nthe years this is a great one to get\nyour calves glutes and hamstrings firing\nwhile promoting that good knee lift and\nit also encourages a quick turnover as\nwell this one is quite similar to butt\nkicks the one we did at the beginning\nbut the focus is bringing the knees High\nrather than heels to butt also trying to\nmaintain a nice tall posture when doing\nthese and again we do not want to be\nleaning back here you'll see a bit of PN\nwith this one because again we're doing\nthis for around about 20 to 30 seconds\nbeginners once intermediate twice and\nadvance three times okay five down and\none to go the final one is the strides\nI'd say this is the most fun one we get\nto start running and running pretty fast\nas well this is the one to do now all of\nour muscles have woken up the heart rate\nis elevated nicely and this is a good\none to finish with these are essentially\n20 second bursts of running around about\n90 to 95% effort these will really help\nimprove our Cadence increase our stride\nlength and get those fast twitch muscle\nfibers working the main focus here is\nrunning fast but also staying in control\nand relaxed at the same time this is not\nan allout Sprint I like to roll into\nthese gradually so it takes me about 5\nseconds or so to hit that top speed and\nthen hold that for around about 10 to 15\nseconds before gradually slowing down\nagain take a short rest between each one\njust to get your breath back beginners 2\nto 3 * 20 seconds intermediate 3 to 4 *\n20 seconds and advanced Runners 4 to 5\nby 20 seconds right I'm now warmed up\nI've done my drills and I'm ready to go\nand get my interval session done I hope\nyou found that useful and can integrate\nthis into your routine to help your\nrunning and your running form any\nquestions let me know down in the\ncomments keep on working hard keep on\ndone and I'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

      "text": "I've brought loads of running products\nthis year mainly to review for the\nchannel but also some for my own running\nto overcome some of the little issues\nI've been having throughout the year I\nfound some really great bits of Kit\nalong the way some of which I now use\nevery single day and that's what this\nvideo is all about as with everything\nyou see here on the channel and of\ncourse in this video as well I've bought\nall of these products 100% with my own\nmoney to give you that completely honest\nunbiased impartial review and it also\nmeans we can have a chat about some of\nthe negatives in there as well thank you\nso much to everyone that supports the\nchannel by checking out my website benp\nparks.com with the best running gear and\nalso some amazing five-star training\nplans it really helps us so much with\nwhat we do here and also everybody that\njust likes shares comments on the videos\nand also subscribes as well right let's\nget into the first one now which is a\nbig change I've made with my nutrition\nproducts Morton is out and this one's\ncoming longer time viewers of the\nchannel will know I've mainly been using\nMorton in my races but earlier on this\nyear I listened to to an interview with\na guy called Andy blow the CEO of\nprecision hydration I was really\nimpressed with what he had to say so I\nplaced a big order and I was really\nexcited to test it out and see what I\nthought of the product I've always\nstruggled to get those Morton gels down\nlate on in a\nrace never easy today my body just\ndoesn't want to have it so yeah as I say\nI got these in and I've been using them\nin pretty much all of my races so far in\nthe second half this year so they're\nvegan there's nothing artificial and\nthey're informed Sports tested as well\nthey taste kind of like a bit like a\npeachy yogurt but it's an incredibly\nmild flavor and they've just got that\nsort of yogurty texture to them too I\njust love love this 90 G pouch that's\nsort of three regular gels worth I did\nactually I've just bought a new box of\nprecision hydration gels here from xmes\nthe other day so this is what the\nregular gels look like and then you get\nthese Mega ones here which is as I say\nthree times the size 90 G and that's\nwhat I've been taking out in some of my\nraces as well it's super easy to get\nthese down just unscrew the top and then\nyou can just get it straight in much\neasier than using a regular gel and then\nyou can just take as much or as little\nas you want as you go around and this\nfits in my naked band which I wear\naround my waist really really well but\nif you are using the regular GS which I\nwill probably use in some of my races\ncoming up I just really like because\nthey've got this band here so you really\ncan't Litter with it really important\nfor anyone really but especially TR\nathletes who can get disqualified for\nthat sort of thing yeah you just pull\nthat and it stays attached nicely and it\njust goes down super well I've had\nabsolutely no problems getting these\nWings down late on in a race and really\nactually enjoy having them in my\ntraining and in the races as well on top\nof the gels I actually got some of their\ndrink mix as well I've only used this\npre- run I actually use it before my run\ntoday cuz I had a speed session to do\ntoday it just tastes really good this is\ntheir electrolyte and carb drink mix I\nthink they do one without the\nelectrolytes in as well but I I do sweat\nquite a lot so I've gone for that mix\nthere it just tastes really good it\nmixes really well I've used this a lot\non the turbo trainer inside as well and\nit just goes down really nicely again a\nvery mild flavor to this one the\ncustomer care has been really good as\nwell they offer video chats to help you\nget the right product they offer sweat\ntests I think that's probably only in\nthe UK again to see what type of\nelectrolytes might be good for you the\ntaste is good it's not as sweet as\nMorton and I just don't get sick and\nbored with it especially not in\nsomething like a road Marathon over that\nsort of time and in terms of dislikes\nit's really hard to find I think and I\nhonestly I can't i' be trying to come up\nwith dislikes for this but I've really\nbeen impressed with this product it's\nperforming really well for me performing\na lot better than Morton mainly because\nI can just get it down when it matters\nin terms of alternative to something\nlike prision so many gels and things\nnutrition it's about trying a few out\nsee what works for you I was chatting to\nanother running YouTuber and recommended\nhe tried this out and he said he did and\nit just didn't work for him so that's\njust one of those things but this is\ndefinitely working for me at the moment\nnext up we're talking strength training\nnow I've always been told I'm a very\nquad dominant Runner a little bit weak\non my hamstrings and my glutes so this\nyear I really wanted to set about doing\nsomething about that to improve my\nrunning form improve my strength and get\na lot more power coming through my body\nwhen I'm trying to pick up the pace and\na lot of power comes from your glutes\nand then if you follow my training on\nstraa you might know I actually got a\nhamstring tear right at the start of the\nyear so I was doing a lot of hamstring\nrehab exercises in the gym but I wanted\nto improve my home exercise regime as\nwell so I basically set out to find\nwhat's called a glute ham roller which\nlooks like this I got this from a\ncompany called Mirror fit and there's\nloads of different exercises you can do\nI'm mainly using this to basically get\ninto a bridge position extending my legs\nout and then pulling the roller\nbackwards into towards sort of where my\nglutes are and then pushing them out\nagain this loads up the hamstrings super\nwell it looks really like quite a\ntorturous thing and it is when you start\nbut it's amazing how strong you do get\nafter a few weeks of doing this the\nother main thing I'm doing is really\nimproving my core to support my body as\nI'm running but I didn't just get that\nin I actually also got a new Castle Bell\nbut this is my 24 kg Castle Bell and I\ngot this to really improve my squat game\nas well and I think for runners\nespecially and just everybody really a\nsquat really is one of the best\nexercises you can be doing now it's\ngreat if you've got access to a gym go\nto the gym I'm so time poor a lot these\ndays I like do a lot of my strength\ntraining at home so I've been doing a\nlot of goblet squats with this holding\nthis into my chest and doing those\nsquats like that I'm using the 24 kilo\nwhen I'm feeling quite good I've got my\n16 kilo one down here which I actually\npicked up in the cathlon but what I like\nabout both of these items the're extreme\nHigh Bill quality that you get with them\nboth and they just work really really\nwell I'm definitely feeling a hell of a\nlot stronger by doing this it always\nstores Away really easy just slides\nunderneath our little TV cabinet in\nterms of dislikes make sure you put it\naway afterwards you could easy stand on\nthis thing and it could slide away and\nyou could have quite a nasty acccident\nso it could be potentially dangerous if\nyou leave it lying around your house I'm\nreally kind of proud of myself for how\nwell I've been doing with my strength\ntraining the second half of the Year\nthere're just a few items I've been\nusing check them out we'll link to\neverything down below no affiliate links\ndoesn't benefit me in any way next up I\nbought this lovely little thing this is\nthe Garmin 65 so many people on my straa\nhave been asking me about this basically\nsaying why you got the cheapest garon\nwatch and is it actually any good and\nsurely you should be using something\nlike a 965 or one of the more fancy\nwatches in the range and people are just\na little bit confused so that's why\nwe're doing this video so I picked this\nup in the spring quite soon after it\nlaunch I just paid the full RP I'm\npretty sure I got this on sport shoes\ncouldn't find any discount codes but I\nreally wanted to try out the cheapest\nGaring watch I've been using the epex 2\nwhich had kind of a fancy screen it had\nbeen out for a few years really enjoyed\nit it a really good watch and it had\ngreat build quality but a lot of\nfeatures I just didn't really use in the\nwatch and it was quite heavy it was very\nexpensive it still worth quite a lot of\nmoney so I've sold it now and I wanted\nto see how well I could get on with\nbasically the cheapest Garin watch in\nthe lineup I fully expected to really\nmiss all of the color Maps the Dual Band\nGPS the really good battery life that a\nlot of the higher end models have I\nreally haven't missed any of it to be\nperfectly honest I've used the 165 for\nevery run every race every walk every\nhike I've done done every workout and\nit's really surprised me I've probably\ndone around two 2 and 1 half th000 K and\nthis one of my real pet peeves with\nrunning and running watches and me\nincluded I'm including myself in this is\nthat so many people buy these high-end\nsmart watches \u00a3800 900 \u00a31,000 only to\nuse the most basic features they just go\nfor a run and put it on their stra don't\nuse any of it anyway here's my lights\nfirst thing the screen this AMOLED\nscreen that you get on the entry level\ngarment is really fantastic it's so\nclear it's really easy to read in all\nsorts of different light at night in the\ndaytime in bright Sunshine the graphics\nare really great you can only have four\ndata fields on this some of the more\nfancy ones you can have up to six I've\nonly ever had four on every watch I've\nhad and that's been absolutely fine it's\nso slim and lightweight as well I hardly\nnotice I'm wearing it I really just hate\nhaving things touching my skin I can't\nwear a watch all day anyway I really\nlike the lightweightness of it also it\nhas all the good health Basics things\nthat you're going to need HR V the heart\nrate variability sleeping and napping\ntracking and body battery as well I\ndon't wear it to sleep in so I haven't\nactually been using it for that but it\nhas those features if that means a lot\nto you it's also got the alterer built\ninto it as well which has been\nabsolutely spot on when I've been out in\nthe Hills tracking the elevation the\nbattery life has been surprisingly good\nfor the size of the watch I didn't get\nthe music version I just like to listen\nto music and podcast and Things by my\nphone this watch I'm getting around\nabout 10 to 12 hours over the course of\naround about 12 days as I say I'm only\nwearing this for running actually still\ndo have my uro which lasts for abs like\na 100 odd hours of GPS battery life the\nGPS accuracy has been absolutely\nsurprisingly really good it doesn't have\nthe Dual Band GPS the fancy GPS that a\nlot of the higher end watches will have\nI'll come on to that a little bit more\nin the dislikes I know all of my roots\naround here where I live extremely well\nit's been bang on even running through\nCanary Warf where the skyscrapers are\nagain it tracks as well as pretty much\nany watch is going to around there a lot\nof people have been asking me about the\nnavigation on this because it doesn't\nhave those lovely color Maps it just has\nthe basic breadcrumb navigation because\nthe screen is just so crisp it's super\neasy just to follow that breadcrumb\nnavigation and I actually do take less\nwrong turns with this watch than I do on\nthose couple of times when I was using\nmy uro because with the color Maps it's\njust so overly complicated there's so\nmuch stuff on the screen you got always\nsee where you're going with this it's\njust follow the line and it's really a\nlot more basic but I find myself getting\ncost a lot less using this watch so\nlet's come on to some of the dislikes\nwith the Garmin yes as I say the Dual\npan GPS would be nice they can't give\nevery single watch all of the features\nobviously otherwise everyone would just\nbuy the basic one this watch is sort of\nmain competitor the choros pace 3 does\nget that for roughly the same price\npoint but then with the course you don't\nget this lovely AMOLED color screen so\ndual pan GPS is a big feature for you\nand you've got about this money to spend\nyou don't care about the screen then the\nchorus might be a bit of a better option\nI certainly do have to charge it up a\nlittle bit more than than my regular old\nwatches but charges up so fast anyway if\nit is a little bit low just put on for 5\nminutes I'm going to have more than\nenough to get my run done some people\nmight like the Garment feature which is\ncalled trading Readiness and the load\nmetrics which the 165 doesn't have and\nthere's also no Triathlon settings on\nthis watch you need to go up to the 265\nif you want to get that I've personally\nnever used those anyway the Garmin app\nis getting a bit better and better but\nit's just not the most userfriendly\nthing still after all these years so in\nsummary I've really enjoyed I love this\nlittle thing I'm never going to let this\ngo and I'm using it every day and it's\nso simple to use the price point is\nright and it really will make the\nperfect running watch for the vast\nmajority of Runners absolute five-star\nproduct the next thing which I bought to\nreview which is part of the influencer\nrunning video I think but I've just\ncarried on using it and it's just been\nso good it's this little mini massage\ngun this is the th body one I actually\nbought this on eBay for about 125 the RP\nis a little bit more than that but just\nreally enjoyed it it travels with me\nwherever I go and I just take it with me\nfor pre-run and post run this has helps\nme keep me going if we're doing a lot of\nrunning on our travels but anyway let's\nhave a quick shat about the the body\nthing what do you get with this you get\na nice little travel bag here USB a to\nUSBC you can charge this up with USBC\nand you get three different heads which\nyou can attach onto it basically like\nthat this also goes absolutely fine\nthrough airports and things well this\nonly does every airport I've taken it\nthrough in hand baggage as well so let's\nhave a shout out all the likes I really\nlike the app that you get with this it\nsyncs up perfectly with the device\nbiggest issue with mass drones is people\njust don't know how to use them properly\nso they don't know what to do and it\nends up just of sitting in a drawer or\nthey end up hurting themselves by not\nusing them properly so the app is just\nsuper easy to follow along the USBC with\nthe device is again really good don't\nhave to have specialist charging cables\njust use it with my regular Chargers\ndislikes with this you can certainly get\na lot more pressure with your more\nregular shaped massage guns and yes it's\ndefinitely a little bit more on the\nexpensive side there are some cheaper\nalternatives out there a lot of people\nRave about the Bob and Brad massage gun\nthere are a couple of physiotherapists\nthat have a YouTube channel I'm sure\npretty much every Runner has come across\nsome of their videos so definitely check\ntheirs out if you're looking for\nsomething and of course an actual foam\nroller is a good alternative and way way\ncheaper and probably the best thing we\ncan be doing is getting inperson massage\nif you have the budget for that sort of\nthing so yeah this I've been really\nsurprised it's kept me running it's kept\nmy hamstrings in shape it's kept my hips\nin shape maybe more of an older athlete\nthing as I'm getting a little bit old\nthese days but yeah really enjoyed using\nit right next up I have what's called a\nsports recovery pillow so as I said\nearlier this year I had some hamstring\nissues and some hip issues as well so I\nthought I'm going to get this pillow to\nreally help my hips as I sleep now a lot\nof people obviously recover really well\nduring their sleep for me sometimes I\nwas wake up in more pain than when I\nwent to bed but anyway that's where this\ncomes in basically you put one leg over\nit and it's just going to help keep your\nhips aligned a lot better in reality\nit's kind of just a pregnancy pillow\nrebranded for athletes so they can put\nthe price up a little bit and that's how\nthey definitely got me when we travel my\nbody definitely mythes this but then I\njust use a regular pillow that you get\nin a hotel or air BBE to put between my\nlegs in terms of liks with this thing I\nwouldn't say it has helped me sleep any\nbetter but I certainly I wake up a lot\nless stiff and a lot less pain in the\nmorning and my hip issues have\ndefinitely improved it's really also\nsort of good quality it's comfortable\nand it comes with this easy to remove\ncover as well for when you do need to\nwash it in terms of dislikes of course\nspending \u00a355 on a pillow is absolute\nMadness in terms of Alternatives well\nIkea have one for \u00a39 so maybe we were a\nlot better off going to Ikea and getting\nthat but as I say earlier on this year I\nwas just in a lot of pain and you end up\njust sort of throwing a little bit of\ntoo much money at things and so that's\nwhere this Sports recovery pillow comes\nin we'll link to it down below I\nwouldn't recommend you spend this amount\nof money on it if you having some hip\nissues then look at products like this\nand pregnancy pillows and just type in\nlike sports recovery pillow and see what\nyou can find but yeah it's worked for me\nanother really interesting product I\npicked up at the start of the year is\nwhat is called a slant board to help me\nwith my carves and also my ankle as a\nlot of people know I did break my ankle\na couple years ago it's been a long\nprocess getting it back to full strength\nthis was one of our best products on\nAmazon video but I've been using it so\nmuch since I've also been been using\nthis to work on my car for my Caya\nstrength as well couple of really\nimportant muscles there for runners\nstretching those out nicely at the end\nofi runs it's also been really good at\nhelping me work on my ankle range of\nmotion to increase my ankle dorsy\nflexion what I really liked about this\nthing it's really good quality this one\nit's solid metal it's super easy to set\nup and then slide away again when I'm\nnot using it in terms of dislikes well\nwith that really good metal build\nquality it is definitely on the heavy\nside so not that easy to move around\nonce it's set up you're good to go you\ncertainly wouldn't be want to be\ntraveling with anything like this yeah\nfor me just been really good at helping\nas I say with that ankle strength that\nankle dorsy flexion and stretching out\nthose tired calf and cus muscles as well\nright next up we have some socks a\nreally interesting product I thought a\nlot of you might like to know about this\nas we head into the winter months here\nin the northern hemisphere last year my\ngirlfriend Sarah used some of these Dex\nshell waterproof socks when she ran a\nrace called the winter Downs in December\nyou really couldn't believe how good\nthey were and to be fair pretty much\nevery runner in this race was using them\nhaving wet feet for such a long time in\nthese like more longer distance races or\njust whenever you're going out to get\nyour runs done really can be quite\nuncomfortable and when they get sort of\nwet and all sort of shriveled up a\nlittle bit can be incredibly prone to\nblisters happening and that could be a\nrace ending thing and for me I always\nlike to look for something a product\nlike this to really sort of have that\ngood barrier between your feet and the\nshoes rather than using gortex\nwaterproof shoes which I just find just\ndon't really work that well on my feet\noverheat and everything just gets a wet\nsoggy mess inside so what I really like\nabout these socks you can fully submerge\nyour feet in water and it won't get in\nand you can confidently run through\npuddles bogs streams there's no need to\nalter your stride dislikes with the\nsocks they are quite thick despite being\ncalled ultra thin they definitely are on\nthe thick side you might want to have a\nlittle play around with the shoes you're\nwearing make sure you've got a little\nbit of extra space at the front of shoe\nand what they really do keep your feet\nsurprisingly dry from the outside if\nyou're running them for quite a long\ntime your feet will start to sort of\nsweat they are quite breathable so\nmoisture can escape from your sweaty\nfeet to come out but also after a amount\nof time with a bit of friction your feet\nare inevitably going to get a little bit\nwet so definitely worth checking out\njust really think this is going to be\nthe best thing to keep on your feet if\nyou're going some snow wet conditions\nboggy conditions this is going to do a\nfar better job than some regular socks\nI've be really impressed with them so\nfar let me know down in the comments\nyour favorite running gear of the Year\nwhat's the stuff that you found this\nyear that you've been really impressed\nwith this video coming up here next is\nall of my best running products that I\nfound on Amazon and this video down here\nis testing out loads of running\ninfluencer products as well that's it\nguys keep on working hard keep on\ngetting done thank you all for the\nsupport and we'll see you very soon in\nthe next one",

      "text": "this is the Nike zoomfly version 6\nNike's latest hybrid training and racing\nshoe there's so much hype around the\nshoe with some bold claims about the\nsubstantial improvements versus the\noutgoing version 5 version 5 was a flop\nfor so many Runners overweight bulky and\nslow and Nike have really been losing\nthe ground in this super trainer segment\nwith other brands really upping their\ngame recently but in comes the zoomfly\nversion 6 at a competitive price big\nupdates and a bold redesign as well so\nis it a return to form for zoomfly or\nare Nike going to miss the Mark again\nwell I'm really excited to bring you\nthis video now before we start I bought\nthis shoe 100% with my own money as we\ndo with everything here on the channel\nto give you my completely unbiased and\nhonest review thank you so much to\neveryone that likes and shares our\nvideos and also check out my website\nbenp parks.com where you can find\nawesome training plans new technical\nte's the best running hats anywhere in\nthe world to help with your running\nthousands of five-star reviews and we\nShi to all around the world feel free to\nuse code youtube1 for 10% off your order\nright let's get started with the Nike\nZoom Flight version 6 going through all\nthe differences between this and the\noutgoing version 5 we'll put up what the\nversion 5 looks like up on the screen\nnow as you can see there's been some big\ndesign changes here version 5 had that\nrecycled Zoom X foam and an Eva blend in\nthere but now we've got a ful length\nslab of Nike's Flagship Zoom X foam with\nan EVA foam underneath it a really nice\nupdate we've got a completely redesign\nupper to the shoe here as well it's now\n10% lighter the version 5 was so\noverweight it really was quite a heavy\nshoe and we've now also got a slightly\nhigher stack height a little bit more\nfoam underneath the shoe to increase\nthat puppiness that responsiveness but\nit's also unfortunately 10 SS more\nexpensive right let's get stuck into all\nof the facts and figures so the purpose\nof a shoe like this this is your\neveryday race shoe there a Shoe that is\ndesigned to get your key Training\nworkouts in and also that one that you\ncan rock up to a race and feel like\nyou've got a really good shoe on the\nbottom of your feet pricewise this shoe\nsent me back\n\u00a355 ordering off the Nike website here\nin the UK 42 mm tack height so just\nabove that legal limit not that that\nworries the vast majority of Runners\nthey've got an 8 mm drop overall Weight\nWise this is coming for me at 322 G in\nmy UK size 12 the zoomfly 5 was 359 G\nper meter 37 G decrease around about 10%\nlighter the upper of the shoe we've got\ntwo layers of a woven mesh really hugs\nthe top of the foot really nicely it's\npartly gusseted and the tongue is\nstitched slightly into the upper but it\nreally does hold in place really quite\nnicely ly midsole wise on top here we've\ngot a layer of Nike's Zoom X Flagship\npeber based midsole stupidly not where\nit says zoomx where it says zoomx on the\nshoe that is where we have Nike's sro2\nEVA foam which is a lot more hardwearing\na lot more durable not quite as bouncy\nand Poppy so we got the poppy\nresponsiveness in the zoomx on the top\nand then that durability with the EVA\nfoam on the bottom there a really nice\nmix of the two we've got Nike's carbon\nfiber fly plate sandwich between those\ntwo Foams outsole wise we've got a\nrubber waffle type outsole here a big\nchunk of rubber at the front of the shoe\nhere and also two sections at the back\nof the shoe there for the heel Strikers\nreally great for some winter grip there\nare no different widths available at the\nmoment but there's a surprising amount\nof width in this shoe so if you are a\nrunner with slightly wider feet you\ndon't need to worry about this one there\nare different men's and women's versions\navailable personally I quite like this\nblack colorway and really nice pairing\nit with my all new longsleeve technical\nrunning tea available on Ben parks.com\nperfect for that autum and winter\ntraining as I said feel free to use code\nYouTube 10 I went for the exactly the\nsame size as I've going in for the\nalphafly and also the Pegasus turbo and\nthe regular Pegasus all fitting very\nvery similarly right let's get stck into\nall of my likes my first like with this\nshoe it has a brilliant comfort and\nspeed ratio the heel counter at the back\nof the shoe it's got a good amount of\npadding for that really nice lockdown no\nissues at all with any slippage no\nblisters no hot spots the foot felt\nreally secure and there's no need for\nany heel lock lacing or anything like\nthat the plate that you get in the Zoom\nFlight isn't super stiff like the plate\nyou get in the vapor or the Ally the\nzoomly is a lot softer and a lot\nbouncier but not quite all out as fast\nand stiff as you get in the VAP and the\nalphafly the plate gives a lot of\nstability with the shoe but also a good\namount of speed in there as well I've\nbeen really surprised at the relative\neffort levels versus the pace I'm\ngetting out of the shoe it's just going\na lot faster than the effort I'm putting\nin so I've been really pleasantly\nsurprised and also think with the\nComfort levels that this shoe is\ndelivering it's also going to be a\nreally good option for those long runs\npicking up the pace marathon pace blocks\nsome easy Pace blocks or just a shoe\nthat you can wear for a very long time\nduring your marathon training coming on\nto my second Point here I did allude to\nit a little bit in the first one but\nit's just a surprisingly quick shoe the\nweight decrease here has been\nsignificant and it's very much welcomed\nit's always a big tick in my book the\nweight feels now right for this type of\nshoe The Rocker gives a lovely feeling\nthrough the footstrike and leads to a\nsuper smooth turnover as well here and I\nactually found myself looking forward to\nthe next rep some of these reps I'm\ndoing on the screen these were around\nabout 3 mid 325 km pace so quite fast\nreps here and I was like bring on the\nnext one I've really been enjoying\npicking up the pace in the shoe the\nmidsole mashup is really responsive and\nyou can cruise for a long time whatever\nPace you want to go at you can just dial\nit in and the shoe just goes out there\nand it gets it done my final like with\nthe shoe is the value not only the price\nbut it appears to be very wellb built it\ndoesn't necessarily look like the best\nquality shoe in the world but so far it\nlooks really durable really feel like\nit's been put together very well I'm\njust not sure I love the upper material\nhere but it works well it just doesn't\nlook quite right to me but it's\nperforming really quite nicely it may\nget a little bit hot in the summer but\nhow we are here in the winter the air\nflow through is actually quite nice\ncarbon plates at this price point are\nreally quite hard to find but at this\nsort of price point Nike have delivered\na really competitively priced shoe and\nit's 1010 cheaper than the Pegasus plus\nand that doesn't have a plate and for\nthe vast majority of people they're\ngoing to get a lot more value out of\nthis cheaper zoomfly version 6 it's a\nlot more versatile pick up the paast a\nlittle bit better it's going to look\nafter your legs a little bit better as\nwell and all right it's a lot faster\nshoe but it's not all smiles here as\nalways on the channel a couple of\ndislikes to take you through here the\nfirst one being in typical Nike sort of\nstyle it's a little bit noisy a lot of\nyou have commented on my Instagram when\nI put some shorter form content up about\nthe shoe so far it's just something to\nnote this waffle outsole grip is really\ngood when I've been testing it out in\nslightly wet conditions with some some\nleaves and things around to have\nabsolutely no issues with any sort of\nslippage or anything like that so a\ngreat winter training option but just to\nnote it is a little bit on the noisy\nside it's not very necessarily Slappy at\nall just a little bit loud and my second\ndislike with this shoe again it hasn't\nreally affected me but the rear\nstability of the shoe might put off some\nheel Strikers if you are striking at the\nback of the shoe it's just going to be a\nlittle bit unstable through the foot\nstrike again I'm a midfoot striker so\nit's been absolutely fine for me but\nmaybe something to consider right let's\nbring this all together with some\nconclusions and my final thoughts do I\nrecommend the Nike Zoom 5 version 6 very\nmuch so it's been a really good update\nso well done from Nike finally\ndelivering a shoe that's nice and\nlightweight it's responsive it's\naffordable and it's comfortable as well\nand it'll be really good for a lot of\nRunners so is it worth the upgrade a\nmillion times yes this is light and day\nbetter than the outgoing model still if\nyou really like the outgoing model\nyou're like should I buy this it's all\nquite different I really think you would\none thing that was quite good on the\noutgoing model is it was particularly\ngood Sho for some heavier Runners\nthere's a lot of protection Beneath Your\nFeet here you've still got that here but\nit's just a nice lighter weight package\nbut it's not going to bottom out so it's\ngoing to be a really good option if you\nwere someone that liked the version 5\nand it can also Cruise along at that\nTempo that nice steady Pace as well so\nwho should be buying a shoe like this\nanyone really looking for that Do-it all\nshoe with a car carbon plate that wants\nand also longlasting highly durable race\nshoe that doesn't want to go out there\ncompletely breaking the bank I think a\nlot of people will get some serious\nvalue out of a shoe like this people\nmight think of themselves as maybe more\nof a mid Packer running isn't their\nentire life they don't want to spend\n\u00a3280 buying an alphafly only then have\nto pair it with another shoe before they\nknow it they're spending \u00a3500 thinking\nthis running sport is really not as\ncheap as it could be they could get\nsomething like this it's not going to\nhave that all out performance of an\nalpha fly or vapor fly but it's going to\ndo pretty damn well and at this price\npoint this could be a really good one\ndoit all shoe that can really pick up\nthe pace next week we've got a video\ncoming up all about the best race day\nshoes for regular Runners and I'm sure\nthis is going to fit you in there so get\nsubscribed for that that is coming up\nvery soon so check out this video up\nhere for our full 2024 Nike lineup and\ncheck out this video down here if you\nwant to see the full review of the\nPegasus plus thanks so much guys for\nfollowing along let me know your\nthoughts Down Below on this shoe will\nyou be getting it and what do you think\nabout it if you have been running it so\nfar that's it keep on working hard keep\non get done we'll see you very soon in\nthe next one",

      "text": "the running shoe market is packed with\noptions these days the shoes for every\ndifferent type of run Racing shoes long\nrun shoes speed session shoes recovery\nRun shoes you name it the manufacturers\nare making it and while the\nmanufacturers are loving all of these\ndifferent types of shoes because they're\npersuading us to go out there and buy\nthese massive shoe rotations for some\npeople it's just not possible or even\nnecessary they just want that one shoe\nto do it all so if that's you you're\nafter a single pair of running shoes\nthat can handle just about everything\npretty well then you're in the right\nplace I'm going be breaking down my top\npicks for those daily running shoes\nshoes that are reliable versatile\ncomfortable shoes that you can go for an\neasy jogging pick up the pacing and even\nget on the start line of a race if you\nwant to I've got eight shoes to take you\nthrough here across four different price\ncategories there's going to be something\nhere for everybody and I'll give you my\nfavorite one at the end of the video so\nstay tuned for that as always here on\nthe channel I bought all of these shoes\n100% with my own money to give you that\ncompletely honest unbiased review and I\njust want to say a big thank you to\neverybody that supports the channel by\nliking the videos sharing with their\nfriends subscribing to the

supporting the channel\nand Ena us to review product as it\nshould be completely unbiased and\nunsponsored right let's get stuck into\nall of the shoes now we're going to be\nstarting out with the cheapest going to\nthe most expensive the first one being\nthat sub 120 category starting out with\nthe Adidas SL 2 priz VI the Adidas SL2\nsent me back\n\u00a310 stack kite 36 mil and a 9 mm drop\nWeight Wise a lovely 287 G for me in my\nUK size 12 which was a little bit too\nsmall so I'd recommend if you're looking\nat this shoe going half a size up the\nmidso we've got a layer of that lovely\nLight Strike Pro which is aded as most\npremium foam and that's sandwiched\nbetween two layers of the Light Strike\n2.0 for that durability to make the shoe\nlast that little bit longer and there's\nno plate of any description in this shoe\nas I said sizing wise these do run a\nlittle bit small so I'd say go half a\nsize up I got my normal size and they\nwere kind of okay but if I was going\nback for another pair I would go half a\nsize up right let's start out with my\nlights with the shoe it's super\nlightweight it's Snappy and it's fun as\nwell the midsole offers a really\nengaging ride in the shoe it's got a\nreally good turn of speed for something\nat this price point that's pretty much\nunheard of of course it's not as fast as\na shoe with the plates and the rods and\nthings like that in but it really does\nwell regardless of that and at this\nprice point it's fantastic I really like\nthe Foams they've used in the shoe as\nwell sandwiching that Durable foam in\nbetween a layer of that really nice\nlightweight engaging soft springy\nresponsive foam in there as well I'm not\nquite sure why Adidas have done this\nbecause one of their very cheapest shoes\nreally is one of their absolute standout\nsuccesses of the year in my opinion\nhe've also got really good durability\nwith the shoe and it's also been really\nversatile the outso grip was fantastic\nwhen I tested this so a good winter\nrunning option with my dislikes to the\nshoe as always it's not all smiles if\nyou do have wide feet this is probably\ngoing to be one to miss Adidas shoes\ngenerally are on the narrow side and\nthis one is especially narrow\nunfortunately also on the dislikes it\nmight be just a little bit too soft for\nsome people and it's not the best in the\ncorners a little bit unstable because\nit's so narrow there but overall a\nreally fantastic value show out there\none I'd wholeheartedly recommend for\ngetting the majority of your runs done\nreally well but price is a really big\nfactor in your buying decisions and I've\ngot another one coming up now which is\nthe Puma velocity Nitro 3 price-wise\nthis sent me back\n\u00a3110 now you can usually find this one a\nlittle bit cheaper stack outut of the\nback 36 mil 10 mm drop overall Weight\nWise a little bit heavier than the ads\none there 336 G for me in my UK size 12\nwhich was true to size here midso wise\nwe've got pummer standard entry level\nfoam they're Nitro foam and there's no\ncarbon plate in this shoe and underneath\nwe've got the pummer grip which is\nfantastic one of the best grip out SES\nin the running shoe market out there\nbrilliant in the winter especially as\nconditions turn a little bit wet likes\nwise with this shoe it's really\ncomfortable the Nitro foam is fun and\nbouncy really versatile and feels happy\nat all different paces and different\ndistances as well especially in the long\nrun as I said great grip in all weathers\nwith this shoe one of the best out there\nregardless of the price so a good solid\nwinter option dislikes wise with this\nshoe again like the ad shoe it's a\nlittle bit on the narrow side not as bad\nas the adash Sho so it will be okay for\nthe majority of people they did used to\nmake a wide version maybe you can find\nit but I can't find it out there for\nsale anywhere at the moment but overall\nit's a shoe that is massively\nunderpriced in my opinion if you can\npick up a pair at RP or even cheaper\nideally then you're going to be getting\na really good solid daily shoe it's just\na little bit firmer than the Adidas shoe\nso some people might like that so if you\nlike a soft squishy shoe at this price\npoint go for the Adidas if you like your\nride a little bit firmer feel a little\nbit more of the ground then go for the\npumer right let's move up a little bit\nin price now \u00a310 to150 at this point\nwe're going to be getting some higher\nquality Foams durability is going to be\na little bit better and we're going to\nstart to see some rods and plates appear\nin some of these more expensive shoes\nbut not with the first one which is the\naex Nova blast version 4 no plates and\nrods in this shoe just a classic all\nround training shoe price-wise this sent\nme back\n\u00a3135 stack cut at the back 41 mm a lot\nmore foam underneath our feet here at\nthis price point 8 mm drop overall\nWeight Wise 300 G not too bad for that\namount of foam Mido wise we've got the\nFF plus Ecco plus cushioning sizing wise\nI'd recommend just going half a size\ndown in the shoe from your regular one\nright let's start out with my lights\nit's a great balance of light cushioned\nand also responsive while being super\ncomfortable as well just a lovely\nallaround package good width in the shoe\nas well and you can also pick up the\npace really nicely in the shoe and run a\nlong way in it it's good for those\nmarathon training long runs it's a\nperfect shoe for anyone that's just\nstarting to take their running a little\nbit more seriously and you don't have\nany of the fancy Tech the rods and the\nplates and that all of that stuff in\nthere you're not sure how that's going\nto go and this is a really good option\nand get a nice standard training shoe\ndislikes wise the wet grip isn't\nfantastic in this shoe now they do make\na TR or a trail version of this shoe for\nvery light Trail runs it's exactly the\nsame shoe just a different grip on the\nbottom but overall the Nova blast 4 is a\nsuper versatile shoe at a really great\nprice point probably the most\ncomfortable shoe here on the whole list\nand it's probably the shoe I find myself\nrecommending more than any other to new\nRunners people getting into the sport\njust looking for a nice standard daily\nshoe to get a lot of their runs done\nwell now I said at this price point\nwe're going to start to get some rods\nand plates and that's what we're getting\nwith the Adidas Boston 12 using Adidas's\nenergy rod technology these glass fiber\ninfus energy rods that run throughout\nthe shoe this shoe sent me back\n\u00a340 stack out at the back 38 mm for a 7\nmm drop overall Weight Wise a little bit\nmore than the Nova blast probably\nbecause of those rods inside the shoe\nthere 318 G for me in my UK size 12\nsizing wise the shoe was a little bit\ntoo big for me I wish I'd gone half a\nsize down I did order my usual size 12\nit's strange with with the first adid\nDas shoe it was a little bit too small\nthen this one's a little bit too big I\nwish manufactur would get this right\nacross their whole range but just with\nthe lack of padding at the back of the\nshoe just had a little bit too much\nspace around my ankle anyway let's start\nout with the likes here it's a really\ngrippy shoe we've now seeing Adidas's\nContinental grip out so Continental they\ndo make car ties but they also make the\ngrip on the bottom of a lot of Adidas\nshoes as well fantastic for wet weather\nprobably the best option out there for\ngrip on the bottom of their shoe maybe\nthere s the pummer grip I know it's a\nreal tossup between them but they're\nboth fan fantastic it really delivers a\nfun and engaging ride and really happy\nto be picking up the pace feels like you\nspent a lot more than 140 lb the\nstability is much improved versus the\noutgoing model and you really notice it\nespecially in the cornering just got\nthat nice slightly wider base and you\ncan feel this in the upper as well it's\na really accommodating upper amazing for\nAdidas which always do tend to run a\nlittle bit on the narrow side this shoe\nhas got a good amount of space this is a\nshoe that I could really see someone\nstanding up to the S line of a 5K 10K\nright up to a marathon at distance in\nthis shoe and feel like they've got a\ngood shoe on their feet for running this\nrace they don't need a full out Flagship\ncarbon racing shoe it also feels really\nnice and lightweight on the foot as well\nreally helps to get that leg turnover\ngoing really nicely but also a good\namount of cushioning that will help you\nin those longer runs dislikes wise for\nme it's all about the back of the shoe\nhere just minimal padding for me it\ndidn't really give me any issues I\ndidn't get any heel slip but I have been\nreading about a few people having some\nheel step issues you can always go for\nthat heel lock lacing get a better lock\ndown with the shoe as well but it's just\nsomething to be aware of for me I just\nlike a little bit more padding at the\nback of the shoe but verdict overall if\nyou someone that likes a little bit more\nof an assisted feeling a little bit more\nTech in their shoe wants to pick up the\npace a little bit more than something\nlike the Boston 12 would be a really\ngood option it's not as comfortable as\nthe Nova blast but it can go a little\nbit faster than the Nova blast now\ninterestingly Adidas are about to drop\nthe Adidas Evo SL the much more afford\nable option of their Flagship Pro Evo\nwhich was way over \u00a3400 now they're\ndropping this new this lightweight daily\nspeed shoe for round about that \u00a3130\nprice point I'm going to get my order in\nat the end of this week so get\nsubscribed on the channel really\ninteresting shoe review coming up there\nin a few weeks right we're going to be\nspending a little bit more money now in\nthe \u00a3 150 to2 200 price bracket we're\ngetting some even more premium materials\nand generally a better quality of\nproduct that should last a little bit\nlonger starting out we're going to be\nhaving chat about this the Nike Pegasus\nplus this set me back\n\u00a365 stack cut at the back 36 mil 10 mm\ndrop overall Weight Wise 3133 G for me\nin my UK size 12 which was true to size\nfor me mid wise we've got a full length\nof Nike's Flagship Zoom X foam here\ntheir premium foam which we see in the\nlikes of the vaporfly and the apperly\nthey're all out super shoes and there's\nno plate in this shoe likes wise it's\njust a really versatile fun foam a lot\nof people me included just absolutely\nlove Nike zoomx foam and it delivers a\nreally fun engaging bouncy soft ride\nhere and this shoe can do all of those\nruns pretty well those easy runs speed\nwork Tempo longer runs it looks good too\nI've been wearing this shoe casually on\nmy travels recently as well it's kind of\nshoe you can go around the shops go to\nthe gym go for running and it's also\nHead and Shoulders much much better than\nNike's standard Pegasus shoe so it's\nreally definitely worth paying that a\nlittle bit more to get the Pegasus plus\ndislikes wise it is a little bit on the\nfirm side it's a little bit more of the\nkind of ride would be expected from a\nfew years ago I quite like it but not\neverybody will you've got that lower\nstack height more of a traditional\nfeeling on the road as well but for some\npeople they're not going to be fans of\nall this Mac stck height shoe with the\nplates and the rods in there this is a\nnice traditional type feeling shoe bit\nof a more old school running shoe with\nthat very high quality foam but if if\nyou'd like a plate in your shoe at this\nprice point then have a look at the\nsocony speed version 4 very nice\nlightweight speed SL daily shoe option\nout there stack C at the back 36 mm for\nan 8 mm drop overall just\n285 G for me in my UK size 12 midso wise\nwe've got the power run PB foam a nylon\nplate in the shoe but it's not too\naggressive so it's the kind of shoe you\ncan be using for those daily training\nMars sizewise this was good this was\ntrue to size for me starting out with\nthe lights with the shoe it works so\nwell at all different Paces it's really\ngood at those short Snappy workouts as\nwell as that cruising marathon pace soin\nhave called this their speed shoe which\nis what it's really designed\nspecifically for those faster workouts\nthose 5Ks 10ks and half marathons but\nit's the type of shoe that you can get a\nlot of your easy miles at died in as\nwell if you want a bit more of an\nengaging ride where you're going to feel\na little bit more of the ground again\nwith that lower stack height the plate\nin the shoe not only gives it a good\nSnappy speed but it also gives it a good\namount of stability in the corners this\nis a kind of shoe that's really good for\nsomething like a park run at 5K all out\nyou some fantastic grip on the bottom of\nthe shoe as well and also it's just nice\nand lightweight and it's fast and it's\nsuper Snappy perfect for that 5K\ndistance it's also pretty comfortable as\nwell as soon as you put the shoe on it\nfeels really nice get a good lock down\nreally like this breathable upper as\nwell although it really has started to\nBunch quite a lot for me we'll come on\nto that a little bit in the dislike so\nlet's start there it does bunch a little\nbit for me here so I'm always having to\nslightly adjust it and it as I say it's\nis a little bit on the firmer side so if\nyou're someone that likes a lot of\nground contact feel then you're going to\nlike this shoe some people like this\nsome people won't it's probably going to\nbe a little bit firm for those marathon\ntraining runs you might be getting done\nor even potentially raceing up in a\nmarathon although it's a lot softer than\nwhat I used to run a marathon in about\nfive or 6 years ago but with the way\nframes are the these days this is now\nconsidered a low stack height quite firm\nshoe it's amazing how times change and\nTechnology improves but verdict overall\nit's a great lightweight option for\nsomeone that likes doing a lot of speed\nwork in their training they like doing\nthose tempos those thresholds looking\nfor a lightweight shoe and they aren't\ntoo much into their Marathon racing so\nthey're going to be favoring the 5Ks\n10ks and half marathons and not doing\ntoo much of those super long runs right\nwe've got two shoes left to go this is\nnow in the \u00a3200 plus price point getting\nsome big money these next two shoes\naren't going to be to everyone's taste\nboth quite High stack height shoes but\npersonally I really love these two\nstarting out with what will probably be\nmy favorite shoe of the year which is\nthe aex super blast version 2 this sent\nme back 200 here in the UK if you can\nfind it it's really hard to find these\nshoes they in such high demand stack C\nat the back 45 mm stack height 8 mm drop\noverall and weighing in it just 288 G\nwhich is a lovely lightweight feel midso\nwise we've got asx's FF turbo foam which\nis their most premium foam that you're\ngoing to see in their high-end Ray shoes\nas well and there's no plate in the shoe\nbut it is definitely on the firm side\none of those shoes it doesn't need a\nplate not everybody loves a plate I\ndon't like to do a lot of my easy Mars\nand training Mars in a plated shoe and\nthis one just works really well getting\nthat stiffness from the foam sizing wise\nI went half a size down and what I\nreally like about this shoe is it's just\nsuper super versatile this is the shoe\nwhenever we've been traveling I can only\ntake one shoe with me this is definitely\nthe shoe I'm wearing you can wear this\nthrough the airport go and get your\nmarathon training long run even do races\nI have done races in this shoe it can do\neverything super well it's also\nextremely comfortable and the shoe as I\nsay that I reach for 90% of my training\nR when I'm not testing out other shoes\nit's so lightweight and allows you to\npick up the pace really effortlessly as\nwell it's also held up pretty well for\nthe amount of money you're spending on\nthe shoe you want it to last a long time\nI really think you can get a good 800\nsolid training marks out of this shoe\nfor me I did my review I can't remember\nhow many mils I done in my first first\npair but it was holding up really really\nwell we'll link to that video up here if\nyou want to check out my full super\nblast review but dislikes wise as I said\nat the start it's really difficult to\nget a hold of a pair it sells out pretty\nmuch on the day it comes out and yes\nit's really quite an expensive shoe but\nthe versatility and the durability\nreally make up for that my verdict over\nwith a shoe a lightweight Max cushion\nshoe can handle every type of run and\nPace absolutely brilliantly expensive\nbut it does last a long time right our\nfinal shoe of the day\n\u00a3230 here in the UK for the new Balan SC\nTrainer version 3 now it's a really\nweird thing with a shoe in some\ncountries it's a lot cheaper than that\nin America it's just $180 Us in\nAustralia $330 Australian doar so UK\nAustralia really expensive Canada USA\nthis shoe is probably one of the\ncategories below it's just a really OD\none but I'm in the UK so it's going in\nthis price category here stack kite at\nthe back 40 mm stack kite 6 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise not too bad a little\nbit on the heavier side\n325 G the midsole we've got a mix of\nthat Eva and peber midsole which is a\nreally good compromise for that softness\nthat responsive and that durability then\na carbon plate in the shoe as well for\njust that extra amount of rigidity and\nstability in the cornering likes wise\nwith this shoe it's super comfortable\nstraight out the box comfortable for\nthose long runs and this is what this\nshoe is this is what New Balance pitch\nthis is this is their training shoe to\ncomplement their high-end racer this is\nthe one they want you to do all those\nspeed sessions those easy miles in then\npicking out the SC Elite for when you're\ngoing racing and yeah as I said it's\ngreat value if you do live in the USA or\nCanada and a good option if you prefer\nthat softer feeling with a shoe this\nfirm is really really soft it's going to\nlook after your legs really\nfantastically well on those long runs\nthe plate here is not for that allout\nspeed it's adding a good amount of\nstability it's okay if you want to pick\nup the pace but for me this is a perfect\nshoe for people training for half\nmarathons and Marathon you're doing\nthose long runs and picking up the paast\nof marathon pace up to half marathon\npace it's not the kind of shoe you want\nto be going for your five in 10ks you'll\nbe much better off getting something\nlike the socony this is your allout\nCruiser to really perfect those long\nruns dislikes as I keep saying the price\nis just crazy outside of the US and it's\nreally as I say not the best option here\nfor that speed work it feels really good\nat marathon pace and half marathon pace\nor slower recovery jogs and easy Pace as\nwell so if you live in the USA\ndefinitely pick up this shoe it's a\nreally fantastic option to get a lot of\nyour daily training runs in so let's\nhave a chat all about my final thoughts\nhere my favorite shoe on the list it has\nto be the aex super blast it's just been\nan absolute Joy I'm going to carry on\ndoing my training miles in that but if\nyou can't get the super blast and\nsomething like the Nova blast 4 in fact\nall of these shoes are good that's why\nthey're on the list but the Nova blast 4\nas say is there an option that I do end\nup recommending the most for that good\nmix of that cushion responsiveness speed\nworkor and a good solid price point as\nwell next up I've got my video All About\nspecific long run shoes we'll link to\nthat one up here and if you want to look\nat my super blast review and super last\nAlternatives that video is coming up\ndown there that's it guys keep on\nworking hard keep on done let me know\nwhat what your favorite daily training\nshoers out there and we see you very\nsoon in the next one",

alphafly version 2 so when Nike\nlaunched alphafly version 3 it came with\na completely new redesign there was a\nbig weight decrease as well for me it\nwas 30 G lighter in my UK size 12 the\narch on the inside is a lot less\npronounced version two people are\ngetting some big hot spot issues in here\nand some soreness on that inside of the\narch that is a lot lot better now and\nnow you've got this lovely continuous\nmidsole which just makes it so much\nsmoother through the foot strike and\nyou've got a little bit of a wider\ncarbon plate for some extra stability in\nthere as well well let's get stuck into\nall of the facts and figures so the\npurpose of a shoe like the alphafly\nversion 3 this is a road racing Super\nShoe that marathon and half marathon\nCruiser is where this shoe absolutely\nshines price-wise this shoe sent me back\na staggering\n\u00a3285 we'll put it up with the other\ncurrencies up on the screen now stack\ncut at the back 40 mm right at that\nlegal limit we've got 8 mm drop over all\nthis is coming in for me at 269 G for me\nin my UK size 12 so nice and light\nthat's what we like to see this is a\nneutral shoe and it has this lovely\natomknit upper super breathable get some\nfantastic air flow in that as you start\nto pick up the pace midso we're talking\nNike's Flagship zoomx midso with two Air\nZoom Pods at the bottom of the shoe here\nto give you that extra propulsion we've\ngot a ful length carbon plate running\nthroughout the shoe with the outsole of\nthe shoe we've got a lot of rubber up at\nthe front here to give you some really\ngood grip mainly for your Forefront and\nmidfoot Strikers rear foot Strikers\ngoing to be a little less grip there's\nnothing there at the back of the shoe\njust some very small rubber units here\nthere are no different widths available\nthere are men's and women's different\nfits and this shoe was true to size for\nme right let's get stuck into my likes\nmy first like with the Ally is the super\nsmooth ride with this updated midsole\nyou're getting a lovely buttery smooth\ntransition through the foot strike there\nit's a lot less Slappy than version one\nand two because cuz it had that sort of\nbit missing in the center of the shoe\nthere the lightweightness of this shoe\nyou really notice that as well when\nyou're going from version two to version\nthree if you're a heel Striker this is\ngoing to be a lot smoother through that\nwhole foot strike compared to version\none and version two my second like with\nthe shoe is just so comfortable at all\nPaces previous version of the alphafly\nthey were just so clumpy at those slower\nPaces when you're warming up and easy\npace and now this is comfortable at all\nPaces this new breathable upper is\nfantastic that sock like feel really\ngood lockdown in the shoe as well I've\nhad no issues with any blisters hot\nspots anything uncomfortable even at the\nback end of the marathons when I've been\nracing the shoe absolutely comfortable\nfrom right from the start the middle and\nall the way to the end previously I've\nalways reverted back to vaporfly version\n3 cuz it was just way more comfortable\nbut with this update here this is now a\nlittle bit faster than vaporfly for me\nand with that Comfort aspect of as well\nit's the one I've been reaching for for\nmy races my third like with this shoe is\nthe surprising that what I've called\nthis video is the surprising truth the\ndurability has been really good this\nshoe has now done 200 miles in it a lot\nof training miles getting ready for\nBerlin and then I raised Melbourne in\nthe shoe I did actually get a new pair\nfor Berlin cuz I was like oh they say it\nwasn't going to last very long I better\nget a new pair but I actually went\nfaster in Melbourne with my old slightly\nmore bashed up pair that a lot of\nManufacturers would say has passed its\nbetter days but for me I had a fantastic\nrun in Melbourne it really has held up\nreally really well I like a lot of\npeople get frustrated by manufacturers\nsaying these Super Shoes are only going\nto last 100 miles of perfect running and\nthen after that you need to Trop and\nchange them in reality I really don't\nthink that's true if you're an elite\nathlete you've got unlimited amount of\nshoes to choose from Yes it probably is\ngoing to make that like .05 little bit\nof\ndifference right guys out here on the\nten path got a speed session to 7 by 3\nminutes getting ready for Valencia on my\nleft foot I've got my 200 mile pair of\nAl 3es on my right the Nearly New Pair\njust done at 26 miles of Berlin marathon\nand that just want to see how they feel\nhow they compare how that Popp that\nspringiness that bounce and see what\nit's like between the two shoes have\nthey lost it are they now dead do they\nneed to be retired I don't think so I\nthink they still feel fantastic but\ngoing to go through these three minute\nreps here and see how they feel going to\nbe doing these around 10K to half\nmarathon pace\n[Music]\nit's really hard to tell the difference\nthere is a slight difference the good\nthe newer pair feel a little bit more\nstable the airpods just have a little\nbit more life left in them they haven't\nbeen compressed and crunch quite as much\nas's the pair on the left but really\nvery very marginal I think most people\ncould easy Run 3 to 400 training and\nracing mares in their shoe absolutely\nfine wear wise on the bottom of the shoe\nI've just got a little bit of wear on\nthe outso here where I land and then I\nsort of roll inwards through the foot\nstrike there it's a little bit worn down\nat the front here but what's important\nwith these shoes is how the foam feels\nhow that's holding up and I really feel\nthere's so much life left in this shoe\nand we carry on getting ready for\nValencia by doing a lot of training Mars\nin their shoe it's far from done and\nthen my fourth like with this shoe is\njust how stable this shoe is for a\nmaximum stack height shoe that super\nwide carbon fiber plate you've got in\ntheir shoe just feel really confident\nwhen I'm cornering and things like that\nwhen I was in a couple of these races we\nhad to do some 180 turn backs I just\nfelt super confident going to that\ndidn't really enter my mind that I might\nroll an ankle or something like that\nwhich you can sometimes get with these\nMax stack height shoes the grip is much\nimproved on this shoe I haven't run in\nthe rain in this shoe yet been very\nlucky mainly training in the summer but\nwhen you go through some Aid stations\nand things like that where there's water\nbottles and stuff all over the road when\nI was going through that the grip felt\nsuper good when the roads did get a\nlittle bit wet but as always on the\nchannel here I want to give you that\ncompletely honest review so there are a\nfew dis likes and let's get stuck into\nthose now the first dislike with the\nshoe is it still just a little bit noisy\nnowhere near as Slappy as the older\nshoes I'll put up a little bit of\nfootage now this is Midway through the\nMelborne marathon in a really quiet\nsection and you can just hear how loud\nthis shoe is when you run along for some\npeople they don't like the amount of\nnoise that these shoes can make not as\nbad as the old one but it's still a bit\nnoisy my second dislike is it's still a\nlittle bit on the narrow side through\nthe midf foot it's been absolutely fine\nfor me I did have a few issues with the\nearlier shoes and it's much improved\nthrough the midot Section here but it's\nstill just a little bit on the narrow\nside and you do notice that and then\nobviously price has to come into it in\nthe UK this is nearly \u00a3300 but with how\nwell the shoe is holding up as I say\nyou're getting some good value here and\nI think if you spent some time on some\nlights like Vinted or Ebay you could\nprobably pick up a used pair for not a\nlot of money and have many happy\ntraining miles in this if a pair's only\ndone 100 miles or something you can pick\nthat up and it's going to feel\nabsolutely fantastic so what about a\nrotation what can I pair this up with\nwell if you want to stick with an Nike\nrange something like the Vero 17 or the\nPegasus Plus for your everyday runs and\nthen use this shoe here for your key\nworkouts and races if you got a bit more\ncash to spend you want a three shoe\nrotation it's a bit of a debate whether\nto get something like the vaporfly 3\nwhich is a little bit lighter a little\nbit snappier and it could be a good\noption for some faster speed work at\nthose 5K and 10K page that's when I'd\nprobably like to whip out the vapor 53\nif I was doing a 5k or 10k race it's\njust a little bit as I say a little bit\nlighter and snappier type of shoe there\nbe still really good in this but this is\nreally that marathon and half marathon\nCruiser is where this shoe absolutely\nshines or potentially you could dial up\nyour recovery runs with something like\nthe Invincible version 4 is launching\nvery soon I'm kind of checking the Nike\nwebsite every day for when it's dropping\nso get subscribed to that we'll get it\nin and we'll give you that review right\nconclusions and Final thoughts obviously\nI've really enjoyed running this shoe\nit's been fantastic but who is this shoe\nfor and I think because this shoe is so\nsmooth so comfortable but not overly\naggressive it really does mean a more\nintermediate Runner can benefit from a\nshoe like this so many carbon shoes out\nthere are so stiff and so firm you have\nto have that like Elite level leg\nstrength to get the most out of the shoe\nbut for me that hasn't being the case\nhere I feel a lot of people can benefit\nfrom a shoe like this there's no Bild\nbig Breakin period and it's really going\nto be popular with a lot of marathon\nrunners regardless of their ability so\nis it recommended definitely I recommend\nyou check out my full Nike lineup video\nwe link to that video which is going to\nbe up here next if you want to check out\nmy whole Melborne Marathon video that\nvideo is down here where I use this very\nshoe to run in so that's it guys I'm off\nto get some more training miles done let\nme know your thoughts on the alphafly\nversion 3 keep on working hard keep done\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

      "text": "the New Balance 1080 has been a staple\ndaily running shoe for many years now it\nused to be one of my absolute favorite\nshoes one that I'd recommend to almost\neverybody looking for that classic\ncomfortable everyday running shoe we\nreviewed and absolutely love version 10\nversion 11 version 12 but it really was\nunlucky number 13 which was it was still\na very comfortable shoe the cushioning\nwas way too soft and it had no stability\nwhatsoever was it just an unlucky blip\nhas the greatness now being restored\nwell stay tuned because we're going to\nfind out very soon and we're also going\nto be comparing it to the New Balance Mo\n5 and maybe the greatest daily running\nshoe you can get at the moment the Nova\nblast version 4 so stay tuned to the end\nof the video for that just before we\nstart out I just want to say I bought\nthis shoe 100% with my money from the\nRunning Company in jalong on our recent\ntrip to Australia so shout out to those\nguys and girls in there and also thanks\nfor everybody supporting the channel\nchecking out benp parks.com we've just\nlaunched our brand new long sleev\nperfect for all that winter running\nyou'll see me running them in all of the\nfootage we've got here today and feel\nfree to use code youtu10 for 10% off\nyour order right let's have a chat about\neverything that's changed in version 14\nfrom the outgoing version 13 well we've\ngot an all new mesh upper this triple\njackard upper with increased\nbreathability this is what New Balance\nare saying I actually disagree with that\nwe've got an updated out soole with the\nshoe as well with some repositioned\nrubber to give it a little bit more\nstability as well as improving that grip\nin those High wear areas and to increase\nthat durability as well we've also got\nsome of that increased stability from\nversion 13 and it's not quite now as\nsuper soft and plush and really\nmarshmallowy as version 13 now a little\nbit firmer and a little bit more stable\nand we can start to use this as a daily\nrunning shoe again the price is the same\nthe drop and stack is also the same but\nthe weight has slightly increased right\nlet's get stuck in all the facts and\nfigures so what's the purpose of the\n1080 well this is a premium daily\ntrainer sure you can do the vast\nmajority of runs in pretty well with\nsome good high quality materials in here\nas well pricewise this is \u00a360 here in\nthe UK\n\u00a310\n$165 $270 Australian dollar which what I\npaid for the shoe or around about $210\nCanadian do stack out of the back 38 mm\nand a 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise and\nfortunately a little bit on the heavy\nside here coming in for me at\n360 G version 13 was 323 so for me\naround about a 40 G increase in weight\nneutral stability this is a neutral shoe\nwith the upper of the shoe we've got\nthis triple jackard mesh upper midsole\nwe've got new balance's classic Fresh\nFoam X midsole there's no plate in this\nshoe whatsoever outsole we've got this\nrubber out soole it's not covering the\nmid soole completely just adding some\nextra grip and durability in those High\nwear areas different widths available\nwell unfortunately it varies from\ncountry to Country if you're in the USA\nyou've got four different widths\navailable narrow standard wide and extra\nwide in the UK we're just getting two\njust your standard and your wide so\ncheck with what's available in your\ncountry in terms of men's and women's\nfit we have that available for both and\nthe sizing it was true to size for me\nright let's get stuck into all of my\nlikes my first like with this shoe is\nthe improved stability versus vers 13\nit's now not quite as super soft a\nmarshmallowy which some people won't\nlove because there were a few fans of\nversion 13 although most people agreed\nit was just so soft and unstable that's\ndefinitely gone it's now just that\nlittle bit firmer a little bit more\nusable the slightly wider base we've got\nwith the shoe and the improved rubber on\nthe outso all adding to that extra bit\nof stability the updated geometry\noverall is working a lot better for me\non my runs so for fans of version 10 11\nand 12 this is going to be a real turn\nto form and you're going to be a lot\nhappier in the shoe my second like with\nthe shoe it's just extremely comfortable\nfor those easy runs those recovery runs\nwalking around and genely having a comfy\nshoe for living your life around\nOutdoors the upper is great the lockdown\nhas been spoton for me the sizing was\ntrue to size it's the same size I've\nused in all of my previous 1080s as well\nthe width has also been improved in the\nshoe it's now a little bit wider just a\nlittle bit more accommodating as well\nand you can always go for that wider\noption if that appeals to you if you're\nsomeone that you think you've got a wide\nfit definitely go for that wider option\nI particularly like the padding around\nthe ankle at the back of the shoe here\nas well and the updated upper is just\nreally working well for me just holding\nthat foot in place no sliding around no\nhot spots no blisters or anything like\nthat my third like with the shoe is just\nvery very dependable it's not the most\nfun shoe I'm going to review it's not\nthe most exciting but it just gets the\njob done in minimal F there's no fancy\nplates no fancy Foams or fancy rods it's\ngoing to be really great for a beginner\nRunner that's looking for that premium\nshoe they can get started in or that\nintermediate Runner just looking for\nsomething that as I say it's just very\ndependable it's going to give you no\nissues out there The Rocker at the front\nof the shoe provides a really good\nconfident feeling and for heel Strikers\ntoo at the back of the shoe the way the\nheel tapers here it's going to feel\nreally nice through that whole foot\nstrike so again really good option for\nthose heel Strikers it just feels like a\nreally premium well put together product\nit's built to last for a very long time\nbut as always it's not all smiles I\nalways buy these shoes so I can give you\nmy 100% honest thoughts on it so let's\nhave a quick chat about the dislikes the\nfirst one being I have experienced a\nslight little bit of overheating New\nBalance say this is an improved upper\nwith better breathability unfortunately\nI would sort of disagree I have been\nheating up a little bit in this shoe\nespecially when you do pick up the pace\nbut yes it might be just one that's\ngoing to be good for winter running if\nyou're the Norther hemisphere you're\nprobably going to be fine in the shoe\nover the next few months the weight gain\nis just a little bit frustrating now 360\nG the last one was 323 the wet weather\ngrip isn't fantastic in this shoe it's\nvery wet in London here at the moment\njust sliding around a little bit more\nthan I would like with my fourth dislike\nlike we saw with version 13 gone on the\ndays of the 1080 being that shoe that\nreally can do everything really well now\nreally the 1080 is just the shoe that's\ngoing to be good for the day after your\nreally big effort it's the day after\nyour long runs easy runs recovery runs\npeople going out for longdistance walks\nor people just working in retail and\nthings and being on their feet for a\nlong period of time if you want to pick\nup the pace in the shoe you're going to\nneed to invest in something a little bit\nspeedier a little bit faster a little\nbit lighter with this shoe it really was\nhard work to pick up the pace in\nanything faster than marathon pace and\nI'll just be begging to put something\nelse on but it's fantastic at those\nslower Paces for me right let's have a\nchat about some other options as well\nnow my best daily shoe of the year was\nthe Nova blast version 4 and how is that\ndifferent to this well the Nova blast is\nslightly narrower but really a very\nsimilar fit overall it's a little bit\nfirmer a little bit bouncier and it's\ngot some better energy return through\nthe foot strike as well and as I say\nit's just a little bit more versatile\nhas a bit more pop about it and it can\npick up the pace a little bit better\nthat's where the 1080 is lacking\nunfortunately and when the 1080 is\ndifferent from the Nova blast it's just\na little bit more comfortable it's a\nlittle bit softer as well and it's a\nlittle bit better on those easier and\nRecovery runs with that foam just\nabsorbing a little bit more of the\nimpact as you go along the no thought is\na lot lighter too plus lighter on your\nwallet as well coming at just \u00a31\n135 so for me it really is a bit of a\nclear winner there I'd really recommend\nsaving the money and picking up\nsomething like the Nova blast 4 if\nyou're looking for that classic daily\nDo-it or shoe and maybe pick out one of\nour new wraps for just \u00a3 12 which we'\njust released on the website with the\nmoney that you will save as well we're\nnow shipping those worldwide what most\npeople have been asking me about the\n1080 is not how it compares to the Nova\nblast but how it compares to the more\nversion 5 we've just released our\ndedicated review to this shoe so we'll\nlink that up here and at the end of this\nvideo the mo version 5 is very very soft\nfor that pure recovery and easy run shoe\nit's a hell of a lot bulkier as well if\nI put these side by side here you'll\njust see it's got a much bigger\nfootprint especially at the back of the\nshoe as well yeah this is just a big\nshoe and you really feel that massive\nbulk on the end of your foot as you run\nalong both have the same Fresh Foam X as\nwell but more 5 is a lot more of it and\nit is just a little bit heavier but\nsurprisingly not as much as you would\nthink this is really quite a heavy sh\nI'm not sure where they're getting all\nthat weight from the mo version 5 has a\nwider 4ot as well a little bit more of\naccommodating toe box neither of the\nshoes have a plate in them and the more\nfirst and find is just a little bit more\nstable little bit wider and it's got\nsome of the higher sidewalls in the shoe\nas well the 1080 just has a bit more of\na traditional run feeling through the\nfoot stripe really because it's not\nquite anywhere near as bulky as the mo\nversion 5 so go for the 1080 if you want\na little bit more versatility a little\nbit lighter you can pick up the pace a\nlittle bit better more version 5 is that\nPure Energy absorption Bliss super soft\nto look after those legs on those easy\nand Recovery runs so let's a chat about\nmy final thoughts on the 108 version 14\ndo I recommend the shoe yes I do\nrecommend the shoe if you want a soft\nvery comfortable shoe for easy and\nRecovery runs that isn't too bulky that\nyou get a lot of these Max cushion shoes\nthen this is going to be a good option\nto go for the more version 5 might be\nslightly too soft and too extreme for\nsome people so this is where the 1080\ncomes in is it worth the upgrade over\nversion 13 yes it very much is for me I\nreally did not get on with version 13 at\nall this one is now definitely a shoe\nthat I can now happily go for running\nand I really don't have to worry about\nit too much it's just a nice Dependable\ngood easy and Recovery run shoe and who\nshould buy a shoe like this well any\nRunner who wants a simple no fuss\ncomfortable trainer they can get the\nmajority of their runs done in pretty\nwell be more than happy with the 1080 so\nto answer the question that we've called\nthis video is this the most comfortable\ndaily shoe ever I'd say it's very close\nbetween this and the asex Joe Nimbus\nversion 26 which is my most comfortable\nshoe of all time they're both very\nsimilar shoes and you really can't go\nwrong with it either the Nova blast\nversion 4 is still the best daily shoe\nout there in my opinion but the 1080\nStrays away from this sort of daily shoe\nsegment it's fast becoming a little bit\nmore like the Joe Nimbus and that's\nreally where its bigest competition is\ncoming from so thanks very much guys for\nfollowing along with the video if you\nwant to watch the more verion 5 full\nreview that is coming up up here if you\nwant to check out our complete New\nBalance lineup review and learn all\nabout what the different shoes are that\nreview is down here so that's it

Expo so\nyeah let's go and get our wristbands and\ncheck in and see what it's all\nabout we just got the uh band and a bag\nwhich is probably just full of\npromotional stuff yeah a lot of people\nalways ask when we come and do these\nraces how did you get in I actually ran\na qualifying time if you can run under\n245 in a marathon then you get a\nguaranteed entry like a fast runner\nentry into Berlin around 243 I think in\nLondon not this year but the year before\nand I could use that to get a entry into\nthis race so you just enter it's\nguaranteed you pay your money to get in\nand it's quite cool if you're a fast\nrunner you get right up at the front so\njust behind the elites and like the\nfirst sort of Corral a so you get a\nreally good start as well right let's go\nget a number German English uh English\nis easier English okay perfect they\nprint the numbers on the day it comes\nout comes out the little printers just\nhere starting number for tomorrow

lot of money I\ncan't make that back on reviewing a\nreviewing a shoe but yeah let me know I\ntry and get one in absolutely\n[Music]\ncrazy as we're here a little bit later\nthan I'd normally be

got this camera I\ndon't really know how it works uh yeah\njust come back outside and it is now\nraining but the weather for tomorrow is\nlooking really quite good perfect\nperfect weather no excuses if you see\nanybody on their stra tomorrow saying\nhow hot it was they're lying but yeah\nlet's have a chat about my goals for the\nday tomorrow and hopefully I won't be uh\nhaving to come up with excuses cuz I'm\nhope I'm probably trying to go out there\nand run about sort of 90% as always\nevery year my big goal of the year is\nValencia so TimeWise hopefully 245 to\n250 solid run I'm just going to go sort\nof go through halfway see how I feel\nkick it down a little bit have some fun\nright let's go and get some food Sarah\nbecause we haven't been doing well today\nwe haven't even had

some pants\nI want to see that just got my saw\nshorts I have been chatting to saw about\npotentially making some shorts because\nso many of you guys want these shorts\nwith the logo on and they are fantastic\nhopefully we'll do something with that\nin the new year and then a spare battery\ncuz you don't want the camera to run out\nduring the race and the body Glide uh\nwhich we use to the start line and I\nthink that's everything anything else to\nchat about Sarah don't think so\nhere we\n[Music]\ngo all right good morning every we're\nhere at the start it's about 8:00 in the\nmorning what a

fine it just did\nnot have the fitness but I have tried a\nlot of new things in my training a lot\nof lower mileage but still getting a lot\nof intensity and a lot of gym work in\nthere and quite clearly today it just\nspectac has not worked I'm trying to see\nthe positive side of things so yeah no\nno real worries just going to go back to\nmy my regular wear training now for the\nleadup to Valencia which I'm really\nexcited for and going to get more of\nthose 130 140k weeks I think my biggest\nweek recently has been about\n75k and that's probably good for a sub\nthree hour marathon which is what I did\ntoday so I can't really complain I just\nwanted to try something different and\nyeah I don't have like a load of stack\nof natural Talent I'm just a regular guy\nand I can't supplement that high mileage\nwith anything else other than high\nmileage so that's what we going back for\nreally excited for that be back in the\ngym doing loads of strength work as well\nwell next time you see us we're heading\noff to Australia to come and meet a load\nof you amazing people out there and of\ncourse a quick shout out to Philly who\nran a 225 another YouTuber give her a\nfollow

      "text": "long runs long runs long runs arguably\nthe most important run of the week for\nanyone training for those longer\ndistances and with so many shoes out\nthere it's so hard to know what's\nactually best for you there's been a\nreal explosion from shoe manufacturers\nlaunching specific long run shoes\nrecently they designed to be comfortable\nfor a long amount of time with massive\nstack Heights and softer Foams to look\nafter your legs and keep that fatigue to\nthe minimum so I've got six shoes today\nhere to go through all tried and tested\non those longer runs at six different\nprice points too so there's something\nhere for everyone anyway let's get stuck\ninto it starting out with the cheapest\nand finishing off with the most\nexpensive the first one being the pummer\nvelocity Nitro 3 before we get stuck\ninto it I bought all of these shoes\ntoday 100% with my own money to give you\nthat completely honest impartial\nunbiased review so thanks very much to\neverybody liking sharing and subscribing\nto the channel it really helps us out\nhere so much right starting out with a\npuma this cost me\n\u00a3110 here in the UK well it should have\ndone but actually got these on for a bit\nof a cheeky discount PID just \u00a388 this\nshoe you can always find on offer\nsomewhere stack cut of the back 36 mm 10\nmm drop overall and 336 G for me in my\nUK size 12 the midso we've just got\npummer standard foam here their Nitro\nfoam and there's no plate in the shoe\nand this shoe for me was true to size I\nthink the shoe looks pretty cool but not\nquite as cool as the Ben Parks PB hat\nwhich is what I'm wearing in all of this\nfootage here so check it out in the\nlinks down below and feel free to use\nuse code YouTube 10 for 10% off your\norder thanks very much guys right let's\nhave a chat about all the likes of the\nPuma velocity Nitro version 3 this shoe\nreally was super comfortable in all the\ntraining I did the Nitro foam that\nthey're using here is fun and bouncy it\nfeels a much more expensive shoe than it\nis it's a good all round daily option\nreally versatile at all sorts of\ndifferent paces and different distances\nas well dislikes for the shoe just\nunfortunately it's a little bit on the\nnarrow sides this one is really just for\nthose narrow fitted people average\nyou're going to be okay but it might be\na little bit snug there I think they\nused to make a wide version but I can't\npersonally find it unfortunately so not\nsure about that but overall with their\nshoe if the price point is real priority\nthis is a fantastic option great value\nfor money massively underprice and you\ncan usually as I said pick it up for\ncheaper than the RP it really is more of\na general everyday shoe rather than\nspecifically for long runs at this price\npoint it's virtually impossible to find\na dedicated long run shoe but I think\nthis shoe really does get very very very\nclose to it so I wanted to put it in for\nthat budget offering here that really\ndoes do long runs pretty well moving on\nto have a chat about the aex Nova blast\nversion for came out earlier this year\nthis set me back\n\u00a3135 stack coat at the back 41 mm a good\nchunk of foam under the feet here for\nthose long runs 8 mm drop in the shoe at\na weight of 300 G so nicely on the light\nside here it's really what I personally\nlove to see in my running shoes with the\nmidsole we've got the FF blast Eco plus\ncushioning sizing wise I went half a\nsize down in this shoe what I really\nliked about the shoe is just a great\nbalance of light cushioning and\nresponsive all while being super\ncomfortable in this package as well it's\nalso got a bit of extra width in the\nshoe as well so really good wide-footed\noption here and it's a shoe that can\nreally pick up the pace nicely as well\nnot one that's again just for all out\nlong runs this one can actually pick up\nthe pace very versatile offering but\nwith that massive chunk of Stack height\nagain really good on those longer runs\nas well and I really think at this price\npoint around about \u00a3135 there is no\nbetter value that you can get out there\nwhat I didn't like about the shoe the\nwet weather grip isn't fantastic which\nis actually one thing that is really\ngood with a pum I forgot to add what\nthat in there fantastic grip there but\nthey do actually make a tree version a\ntrail version of this shoe which is\nexactly the same but they just slap a\ndifferent outso on the shoe which has\ngot a lot better winter grip so as we're\ncoming into the winter here in the\nnorthern hemisphere it could be a really\ngood solid daily and long run shoe to\nlook for there and then overall I just\nfeel this shoe is offering great value\nfor money it's so versatile like the\nPuma it's a little bit hard to find a\ndedicated long run shoe at this price\npoint but with these two options I\nreally feel you can go out there and get\nyour long runs done and also pick up the\npaces they're just really good allaround\noptions but with the Nova blast 4 you\njust got a little bit more stack height\nto absorb the impact coming up through\nthe road as well just to keep your legs\nfeeling fresh for a little bit longer\nand I think that's what you're going to\nfind by spending that little bit extra\nto get something like the Nova blast\nfour right moving on to a shoe that I\nstill have because I haven't actually\nworn it out we're talking about the\nBrooks ghost Max 2 which has only\nrecently dropped this shoe sent me back\n\u00a345 stack Co at the back 38 mm and a 6\nmm drop overall weightwise it's a little\nbit on the heavy side 373 G for me in my\nUK size 12 the midsole in this shoe here\nthis big white chunk here we've got the\nDNA Loft version 3 which has been an\nupdate from version one to version two\nand sizing wise this shoe was true to\nsize for me and it comes in medium wide\nand extra wide the only shoe on the list\noffering these wide options so wi footed\nRunners this is the one you need to be\nlooking at Brooks are fantastic are\noffering so many different widths and\nsizes and Support options in their shoes\nand what I liked about the shoe yes this\nupdated mids is now much much better\nthere's also a lot of foam underneath\nyour feet and it will look after your\nlegs really well on the long run I\nreally like this rocker design again a\nlittle bit of update here The Rocker\ndesign at the front of the shoe it just\nhelps you cover the ground well through\nthe foot strike it's just really quite a\nsmooth shoe it doesn't look it when you\nfeel it and you hold it and you put it\non you don't think it's going to be like\nthat and this when it's just got a\nlovely turnover through the footstrike\nit's also just very dependable it's a\nlittle bit boring a little bit like uh I\ndon't know this really doesn't excite me\nthat much but it's a shoe that can just\ngo out there on your long run and just\nget the job done with no fuss very very\ncomfortable option here as well it's\nalso a good shoe I'd recommend for any\nbeginners or any newer Runners out there\ngot some good stability in the shoe as\nwell just as people are building up\nstrength coming back to running on newer\nRunners as well it's going to look after\nyour feet really nicely on the long run\nnow what I didn't like about the shoe as\nI said it's just a little bit\nunfortunately on the heavy side also\nincredibly padded which some people will\nlove don't get me wrong but around the\nankle there is so much padding here yes\nit's great for Comfort but it's probably\na little bit Overkill and you're also\ngoing to struggle a little bit to pick\nup the pace too much this shoe like a\nlot of the shoes here is just very very\nhappy cruising along in that marathon\npace easy Pace recovery Pace second run\nof the day type option so overall with\nthe ghost Max 2 obviously it's going to\nbe a good option if you like the ghost\nas a daily option already this is\nbasically that but with a lot more foam\nunderneath just to make it a lot more\nsuitable for long runs and it's also\ndefinitely the option to go for as I\nsaid if you've got wider feet as well\nright let's move on to the hoker Skyward\nX we're now starting to talk about some\nplates in this shoe which is what you\nstarting to get by going up to this sort\nof price point now at\n\u00a3185 that I paid for this shoe and I\ncouldn't get it on special offer\nanywhere no discount codes so had to pay\nRRP for the shoe stack cut at the back\nan absolutely crazy 48 mm it's a really\nodd sensation when you put the shoe on\nyou just feel like you're 8 ft tall\nwalking around in this thing in terms of\ndrop we're talking about a 5 mm drop\nhere and\n378 G for me in my UK size 12 I'm pretty\nsure this is the heaviest shoe I have\never reviewed huge midsole wise we've\ngot two levels of midsole here one very\nsoft premium Heber midsole the kind of\nfoam that a lot of shoe companies using\ntheir very highest end Racing shoes and\nthen want a level of super critical EVA\nfoam here just for that added durability\njust a lot more hard wearing and then a\ncarbon plate that runs through the shoe\nkind of an x-shaped carbon plate it's\njust there really more for stability\nrather than speed now what I liked about\nthe shoe it's just so much fun to run in\nit feels super smooth smooth as well\ndespite what is a lot of bulk in this\nshoe and it feels really good quality\ngreat for the long run or even long\nwalks as well just for a good option for\nanyone that's going to be on their feet\nall day there's so much foam underneath\nyou to absorb impact and that's really\nwhat I found on my longer runs in terms\nof dislikes with the shoe yes it's just\nvery heavy it's very bulky and it's\nreally only good for going up to that\nmarathon pace in my opinion but overall\njust perfect for someone that's just not\noverly worried about the pace they're\ngoing at they just want something that's\ngoing to be Dependable super comfortable\nout there when they go out for their\nvery long run it's a good option also\nfor heavier Runners whose shoes might be\nbottoming out a little bit there's so\nmuch foam in this shoe you're not going\nto be worried about that at all right\nlet's spend a little bit more money to\ngo up to 20000 now we've actually lost\nthe carbon plate in the shoe and this is\nI know you can't smell this but the shoe\nabsolutely stinks cuz it's been pouring\nwith rain here today and this is still a\nlittle bit damp but this is my aex super\nblast version 2 no car carbon plate in\nthe shoe but you've now got a f length\nvery high-end PE midsole in the shoe and\na massive stack kite in here as well 200\nfor this shoe but it's really for me\nit's been my favorite shoe of the year\nit's sold out absolutely everywhere if\nyou see one coming up for sale then\ndefinitely go and buy it if you can\nafford it because obviously it's quite\nexpensive stack wise 45 mm stack at the\nback of shoe 8 mm drop overall and\ncoming in at a lovely 288 G which is so\nnice and light and yes you can massively\nfeel the difference between something\nlike that and the Skyward x 100 G\ndifference per shoe 200 g overall yes\nyou really do noce it seems like that\nmidsole wise it's mostly the FF turbo\nthe high-end peber midsole and there's\njust a little Slither as well of the\nmore Durable aex foam and as I said\nthere's no plate in this shoe sizing\nwise I went half a size down ax I tend\nto always go half a size down compared\nto every other brand that I buy but what\nI like about this shoe it's just so\nversatile easily the most versatile shoe\nhere on the list a shoe that can really\ntruly do everything races speed easy\nlong runs whatever you want to do it's\njust super comfortable this is the shoe\nthat I reach for about 90% of the time\nwhen I'm not testing other shoes hence\nthis is now done about 400 miles in this\nshoe now and I've absolutely loved every\none of those it's really lightweight and\nso you can pick up the pace really\neasily I've done reps in the shoe 5K\nPace 10K Pace run every different type\nof pace in this show as I say I raced a\nhalf marathon in it and it performed\nsuper well and I've taken it up to Long\nRun wise uh 36k getting ready for Berlin\nand I've raced marathons in version one\nof the shoe as well and it's been\nabsolutely fine what I didn't like about\nthe shoe yeah unfortunately it's just\nsuper hard to get hold of at the moment\nin those regular sizes yes it's a little\nbit more expensive but it's so versatile\nthe durability is fantastic this is\nholding up really well I'm pretty sure\nI'm going to get about 800 really good\ntraining marves out of this shoe before\nit's going to drop off and the phone\nwill become a little bit dead the super\nblast does give quite a firm ride so if\nyou looking for something a little bit\nsofter to really look after those legs\nthat marshmallow that cloud that squishy\nfeeling then go for something like the\nskywood x or our next option which is\nthe New Balance SC Trainer version 3 you\ncan really sort of feel the weight\ndifference it's not too much this is 50\ng heavier anyway let's start out with\nthe facts and figures\n\u00a3230 this shoe set me back so a hell of\na lot cheaper in the United States at\njust $180 there's a lot of price\ndifferences around the countries with\nthis shoe it's a little bit of an one\nstack height 40 mil stack height at the\nback of the shoe and a 6 mm drop overall\nas say Weight Wise 225 g so not too bad\nthe mids sole we've got a mix of a pea\nand Eva blend which is a really good\ncompromise for that softness and that\nresponsiveness and that durability and\nwe've got a carbon plate running through\nthe length of the shoe here again like\nthe skyex it's more there for stability\nrather than all outspeed and sizing wise\nthis was true to size for me I did\nactually get half a size down and it was\ntoo small small because I couldn't find\nmy size and I wanted to get in to review\nit so half size down was okay but I\nreally should have gone up true to size\nin the shoe I also really love this\ncolorway let me know what you think of\nthis guys it goes so nicely with our\ntechnical te which you can get on our\nwebsite and I'll link to it down below\nand feel free to use code YouTube 10 for\n10% off anyway let's talk about the\nlikes really comfortable straight out\nthe box as of course A lot of these\nshoes are are here I'm talking about\nsome really good high quality trainers\nhere they've got to be comfortable for\nour long runs and the plate adds a good\namount of stability as I say rather than\nthat speed so again it's suited more for\nthose slower Paces marathon pace I think\nyou could go up to half marathon pace in\nthe shoe absolutely fine half marathon\npace marathon pace easy Pace recovery\nrun Pace this is just going to\nabsolutely look after your legs really\nnicely on those long runs just really\nsoft marshmallowy feeling this foam here\nis just going to massively really help\nto absorb that impact of those long runs\nespecially anyone that's out they're\nrunning like I do living in a big city\nhere in London spending a lot of time on\nthat aspal and that tarmac dislikes the\nprice is absolutely crazy unless you\nlive in the USA or Canada which is just\nreally unfortunate because a lot of\nthese shoes here they are a bit Niche\njust for those long runs but overall as\nI say I have really enjoyed running this\nshoe and I'm going to continue running\nit even after I've done my testing and\nit's definitely one to pick up if you\nlive in the USA and Canada and can get\nit for around about $180 $185 Canadian\ndollars but for a lot of people they\nmight be better off in the UK going for\nsomething like the Skyward X very\nsimilar feeling Skyward X is just a bit\nchunky a bit heavy here this is a bit\nlighter bit more Nimble but still two\nvery good options so final thoughts I\nknow what you want me to say just tell\nme which is the best one and it's really\nhard to do that for me the super blast\nis probably going to be my best show of\nthe year so get subscribed to that when\nwe drop that video out probably at the\nstart of December when we do our top\nthree worst three and all of those sort\nof videos that will be coming up soon\nyeah it's really just that good but if\nyou want to go out there for simply all\nout comfort and a bit of fun something\nlike the sky X it's a really good solid\nbet as well or as I said something like\nthe SE trainer if you live in the states\nor if you're visiting the states or\nsomething like that so again a really\ngood option to pick up the ghost Max 2\nis going to suit some newer Runners out\nthere some more beginner Runners it's\njust so dependable very comfortable as\nwell and the pume and the Nova blast at\nthose price points they're really good\nso don't think you're being short\nchanged or anything and you're not\ngetting a fantastic trainer all the\nshoes on this list will look after you\nreally well the cheap ones they just\nmight not last quite as long and just\ndon't feel quite as premium as some of\nthe more expensive ones so that's it\nguys thanks very much for watching if\nyou want to check out my super blast\nafter 350 miles full review that is\ncoming up here and if you are a bit more\nof a beginner Runner then check out my\ncomplete list of beginner running shoes\ndown there that's it guys keep working\nhard keep wa done I see you very soon in\nthe next one",

      "text": "this is the hoker skywood X and at the\ntime of recording this is the best rated\nshoe on hooker's website Runners are\nabsolutely raving about the shoe saying\nthings like this is the most comfortable\nshoe ever and it was so good I bought\ntwo pairs but as always it's not all\nsmarts with a few onear reviewers in the\nmix saying I feel no stability in this\nshoe and they feel and look cheap so I\nwanted to get this shoe in and see for\nmyself what it's like put it through its\npaces and see if it delivers on the\nPromises as a top choice for long runs\nthat is how hoker art billing this shoe\nit has this absolutely crazy 48 mm stack\nheight at the back we've got that and a\nload more to chat out this so let's get\nstuck into the hoker skywood X review as\nalways I bought the shoe 100% with my\nown money so I could give you those\ncompletely honest unbiased thoughts and\nthank you to everyone that supports the\nchannel by liking these videos\nsubscribing commenting down below with\nyour thoughts as well and of course\nchecking out my website benp parks.com\nwhere we've got amazing running gear\ntechnical teas hats to help you out on\nyour run feel free to use code YouTube\n10 for 10% off your next order right\nlet's get stuck into the differences\nbetween this and the outgo model so\ntechnically the Skyward X is a brand new\nshoe for hoker but really it does\nreplace what was known as the Bondi X\nwhich was a carbon plated version of the\nHoka Bondi Hokah have just basically\nrenamed that to be the Skyward X I guess\nbecause the Bondi X just didn't really\nsell very well it was one of the worst\nshoes I actually ever reviewed and\nRunners just found it so confusing and\nso here we are we are with a brand new\nname and a much better shoe thankfully\nthe Bondo X had really old EVA foam the\nskyex has this dual layer peber and\nsuper critical EVA foam midsole it's\nmuch more responsive much softer and a\nlot easier on the legs as well the\nrocket is just a lot more pronounced at\nthe front of the shoe as well and it\njust rolls through the footstrike a lot\nlot smoother than the outgoing Bondi X\nright let's get stuck into all of the\nfacts and figures so the purpose of the\nSkyward X is for your long runs your\neasy runs recovery runs something that\nis very happy around about marathon pace\nor slower that long run Cruiser to look\nafter your legs as you're panning the\npavement to get those miles in\nprice-wise this set me back\n\u00a385 here in the UK R about 225\n$225 $360 Australian and $280 Canadian\nreally quite expensive in the EU and the\nUSA normally we're the ones in the UK\nthat have to pay the high prices but for\nsome reason it's pretty pricey in the\nstates I don't know why maybe you do let\nme know down in the comments stack\nheight at the back as I mentioned 48 mm\nstack height you will notice this you\nwill be walking around while trying this\nshoe on feeling like you're absolutely a\ngiant basically it's just crazy I it's\nonly a tiny bit more than something like\nthe uh super blast but I don't notice it\nin that shoe you really notice it\nwalking around in the shoe that stack\nheight 5 mm drop overall weightwise this\nis coming in at 378 G 13.3 o for me in\nmy UK size 12 which was true to size\nit's very much on at the heavy side I\nthink this might even be the heaviest\nshoe I've ever tested the upper of the\nshoe is a flat knit upper just has this\nsort of sock like fit to it really quite\nnice midsole we've got this dual density\nfoam the top half under the foot being\nthis really lightweight racing peber\nthat hok like to use and then below that\nwe've got that super critical EVA foam\nfor that added durability yes there is a\ncarbon plate in the shoe it's really for\nmore stability than that all out speed\nit's sort of this H shaped carbon plate\nwell bit more like the X I suppose an\nx-shaped carbon plate that the shoe has\non the outs soole we've got this High\nabrasion rubber outsole there are no\ndifferent widths available for this shoe\nwhich is just really quite annoying to\nsee cuz H are normally good with that\nbut I just don't think they're doing\nwider wits in the carbon plated shoes at\nthe moment I'm not sure why but\nhopefully we'll see them developing that\na little bit further into the future\nwider footed Runners you're probably\ngoing to avoid this one narrow footed\nregular footed wi width people will be\nfine there are different men's and\nwomen's versions available and as I said\nit was true to size for me right let's\nget St into all of the likes my first\nlike with the shoe is it's just so much\nfun to run in it's just a real laugh of\na shoe something that doesn't take\nitself too seriously there's so much\nBounce from this energy saving foam it\nalso does become even more lively after\nthe first couple of runs this shoe it\njust sort of comes to life after around\nabout 20K or so of training the the heel\nslip issues from that Old Bondi are\ncompletely gone I just couldn't run in\nthat last shoe at all for heel slip\nissues this one that's all gone really\nnice heel counter at the back of the\nshoe here no heel lock lacing needed for\nme no slip at all so yeah a really nice\nmuch more fun shoe to run in than the\noutgoing model my second like with the\nshoe is it's just now really really\nsmooth The Rocker at the front of the\nshoe just enables a really silky\ntransition through that foot strip you\njust cover the ground with minimal fuss\nhere it's really happy just cruising\nalong a round about marathon pace or\nslower and doing all of that hard work\nfor you the foot as I said felt really\nsecure really good lock down there's\nthis strap that sort of runs to keep the\nmidfoot really locked down as well and\nthat just works really well lovely\npadding here in the tongue at the front\nof the shoe really you can wear the shoe\nfor a very long time super comfortable\nno hot spots no blisses no issues with\nanything like that my third like with\nthe shoe and I have to disagree with\nthat one star review from the start of\nthe video I think the shoe is really\nwell put together really good build\nquality and it feels like a quality\nproduct personally I don't really like\nthis aqua fresh type colorway let me\nknow your thoughts down in the comments\nthe upper is just really comfortable as\nwell and surprisingly good breathability\nin the shoe didn't have any overheating\nissues and getting a good airf flow\nthrough to look at it you wouldn't think\nthat would be the case but had\nabsolutely no issues and I particularly\nlike the extra strength thing they've\ngot at the front of the shoe here this\nis going to really help with that\ndurability I think this this what shoe\nwill last a very long time at the key\nwear points at the front of the shoe and\naround the heel area here it's just\ngoing to hold out really well it feels\nlike a really good quality well put\ntogether product and my fourth like here\nwith the shoe is yes of course this shoe\nis primarily designed for running with a\nplate and these high-end racing Foams\nhere but we always get a lot of people\nthat watch our Hoka reviews that aren't\nRunners and they just want a nice comfy\ncasual shoe and this has been really\ncomfortable for me for wearing casually\nout and about here in London it's been\ngood for wearing for long period of time\ntraveling around when you just want that\nultimate pillow like Comfort the high\nstack of the shoe does take a little bit\nof getting used to because as I said you\njust feel so much taller and the plate\nin the shoe does help with that\nstability as well if you're just static\nor maybe standing around all day you're\nin a type of work environment where you\ndo need to be standing for long periods\nof time and although yes it is very\nexpensive it does work really well for a\ncasual shoe as well well let's get stuck\nin to my dislikes my first dislike with\nthis shoe is just that all out bulky and\nheavyweight nature of it coming in for\nme at nearly 400 G per shoe it really is\nquite crazy and yes you really do notice\nthat out on the run it's looking after\nyour legs quite nicely and it has got a\nlot of positives but the negative side\nof that is it's just in this massive\npackage my second dislike with the shoe\nis it just has that limited type of use\nit really excels at marathon pace easy\npace and Recovery drug Pace it likes to\ngo out for those relaxed runs to look\nafter your legs but it's really hard\nwork if you want to pick up the pace\nanything faster than marathon pace in\nthe shoe due to its weight and the plate\nreally doesn't add an awful lot speed\nwise in the shoe it's really primarily\nthere for that stability so if you want\nto be thinking that can I do it\neverything in the shoe 5Ks 10ks half\nmarathon speed workor thresholds you\nreally do not want to be doing that in a\nshoe like this this is something that is\njust happy plotting along ticking off\nthose CS munching those Mars just don't\nask it to go very fast and then my third\ndislike with this shoe it's just as I\nsay in the US and EU quite a high price\nfor a very specialist type shoe so who\nshould be looking at the hoker skywood X\nbut it's a really good option for any\nheavier Runners out there who can\nappreciate that extra stack height with\na shoe and that plate underneath as well\nthis foam here is never going to bottom\nout or just that really good solid\nmarathon training shoe for people that\nmaybe doing some easy Pace marathon pace\neasy Pace on their long runs it's really\ngoing to acceler at things like that or\nsimply for some that just wants a nice\ncomfy shoe for their running isn't\nworried always about how fast they're\nrunning just wants to put something on\nthat's dependable happy joyful bouncy\nexciting just when I go out there and\nenjoy their runs and it's a really good\noption to look out for because I'm all\nfor that coming up next we've got our\nbest long run compilation video that\nwill be up here that'll actually in a\nfew days so it might not be live there\nyet but it will be in a few days so\ncheck out that there and this shoe will\ndefinitely feature in my best long run\nshoe option that's it guys keep on\nworking hard let me know your thoughts\nall about the sky X keep on getting done\nand we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

      "text": "whether you're gearing up for your first\nmarathon or you've run loads before\nthere are some classic mistakes that can\nturn your dream race day into a complete\nnightmare today I'm breaking down the\nbiggest Marathon blunders that could\nsabotage your race day but most\nimportantly I've got loads of solutions\nto those so you can run at your absolute\nbest and secure an amazing run over the\nmarathon from Pacing too fast to\ndisastrous fueling choices and even that\nlast minute temptation to try out new\ngear we've seen it all I've done most of\nthese before I've leared the hard way\nover the years but I've got some really\ngood news for you because if you stick\naround to the end I'll teach you all\nabout how to ster clear of these\npitfalls race smarter and have more fun\nout there and of course finish the Run\nstrong right let's get stuck into\nprobably the most common mistake of them\nall and that is going out too fast\neasily the most common mistake we see is\npeople charging off far too fast at the\nstart of the marathon they're feeling\ngood they've got all that nervous to get\nrid of and they look down at their watch\nand it says they're going to do 715 a\nmile when they really want to be running\nalong at 8 to do their 330 and then\nbefore they know it they've blown up at\nhalfway and they're running and walking\nand the race is a complete nightmare\nwhen you go off at the start of the\nmarathan of course you're going to feel\ngood you're going to be out there for 3\nfour or 5 hours if your training's going\nokay the pace is going to feel very easy\nat the start of the marathon and this is\nreally not the time to be thinking you\ncan suddenly go and run a 310 marathon\nwith when you've been training for a 330\nso what are we going to do about this\nwell no doubt you'll have a goal time in\nmind set off at that pace everyone's\nrunning with these fancy GPS watches\nthese days they tell you how fast you're\ngoing look down at your watch if you\nwant to be running 8 Minute miles or 5\nminutes okay make sure that's what it\nsays on your watch don't suddenly go off\na lot faster than that ideally for the\nfirst few miles go off a little bit\nslower than that and ease up to your\ngoal Pace as the race goes on so make\nsure you have a plan for your race know\nthe paces that you want to be running at\nand be patient by the time that mile 20\nrolls around you'll be overtaking a lot\nof people around you and be finishing\nstrong believe me no one has ever gone\nout and magically run 20 30 minutes\nfaster than they intended to over the\nmarathon in as so many sports you can\nhave really good lucky days where\neverything comes together with running\nit's not like that you're going to get\nout what you've put in in training so be\nrealistic stick to your paces and run to\nthe the ability that you've been\ntraining for some other top tips for not\ngoing out too fast monitor the lap Pace\non your watch which will reset every\nkilometer or every mile if you've got\nlaps turned on just focus on that\nticking off every K as they go sticking\nat your pace potentially run with some\nother pacing groups that are going to be\nout there so if you want to run a\nthree-hour Marathon stick with the\nthree-hour pacing group they will make\nsure that you run the race nice and\nevenly all the way through and not burn\nout by going out too fast no doubt a lot\nof you out there will have been\nfollowing our training plans which you\ncan pick up at benp parks.com we'll link\nthat down below loads of five-star rated\ntraining plans from thousands of Runners\nthat have run some incredible times\nusing our plans and one of the big\nfeatures of our plans is practicing at\nyour goal Pace during your long runs we\nlike to put in blocks of goal Pace\nrunning there so you know what that\nfeels like to be running at your go pace\nso practice at your go Pace know what\nthat feels like look at your watch don't\ngo off too fast use a pacing group if\nyou want\nto something that isn't absolute classic\nover Race Day weekend is if you're going\nto a new city exploring somewhere that's\nexciting people spend far too much time\non their feet The Day Before the Race\nI've done this mistake myself before I\ndid 35,000 steps the day before I ran\nAmsterdam Marathon doing a bit of\nsightseeing I got to race day and felt\nobviously quite fatigued by doing that\njust because you might not be running\nthat day it also means you want to be\nspending some time off your feet and\nrelaxing go to the Expo means and then\nget back back to your hotel get back to\nyour Airbnb and just relax if you\nparticularly want to get out and do some\nsing maybe look up some segue tours out\nthere a bus tour a boat tour something\nelse to take you around the city other\nthan your legs you want to be saving\nthem but ideally plan to explore after\nyour race walking is a fantastic way to\nrecover after your Marathon one of the\nbest things we can be doing so plan some\nsightseeing maybe for Monday and Tuesday\nwhen you can walk around and get that\nrecovery process going that's definitely\nthe best time to be sight\nseeing this is way more common than you\nthink it would be but so many people use\nthe OnCourse nutrition when they haven't\npracticed with it in their training this\nis especially a problem on trail races\nwhen there's a lot more selection to\nchoose from than in Road marathons but\nit still happens in Road marathons as\nwell and not only is this a problem for\npeople trying the encourse nutrition\nit's also potentially problem from\ntaking things from people in the crowd\nthat are handing out jelly babies or\nsome other gels out there they do mean\nreally well and it's fantastic people\ncome out and support runners in this way\nbut if you haven't tried this stuff in\nyour training then how do you know it's\ngoing to work and be okay with your\nstomach during race day your body and\nyour guts are under a lot of stress when\nyou're running and throwing something\nnew in that could result in a few\nunwanted trips to the portaloo or pter\npoty for me I took some Lucas a sport\nduring a race once like as one of the\nLucas a drinks and I thought I've had\nthis all the time when I've not been\nrunning I've never used it when I'm\nrunning what's the harm that can do well\nI found out was some disastrous\nconsequences pretty soon after that with\na pants round the ankle type situation\nyour body works a lot differently when\nyou are running the solution to\nsomething like this only put things in\nyour mouth that you've used during your\ntraining try out lots of different\nproducts figure out what works with you\nin your training research what the race\nis giving out and potentially practice\nwith that in your training as well if\nyou do want to use the OnCourse\nnutrition fuel often fuel early fuel\nevery about 30 to 45 minutes during the\nmarath as well don't wait till you feel\nfeel tired cuz that will be too late in\nthe day practice carrying your gels in\ntraining for me I like to use a\nwaistband a waist belt I can tuck all of\nmy gels in there that I'm going to be\nusing for the race practice what it\nfeels like and you'll be absolutely fine\ngetting it done on race\n[Music]\nday moving on to have a chat about\nweather and tough weather conditions and\npeople not adapting to that now I get\nthis 100% you put your heart and soul\ninto your training get to race day\nfeeling really good only to find out\nsudden it's going to be 25\u00b0 855 F or\nhumid and bad weather conditions for\nrunning or potentially our worst\nnightmare windy conditions who remembers\nrunning the London marathon in 2017 or\nthat year that the big half had these\nhowling stormy winds your body's going\nto be working a lot harder to keep cool\nout there or battling through those\nwinds burning through your energy stores\na little bit quicker than you will be\nused to and if you push through this\nthen you're going to be hitting the wall\nVery quickly you can put some things in\nplace to delay this happening but it\nreally will result in having to slow\ndown and adjust your expectations for\nthe race the solutions for something\nlike this check the OnCourse weather\nduring the buildup for the race now it's\nnot really worthwhile to be panicking\nabout this all week and the week before\nbut just have some things in place that\nif it is going to be a hot day when you\ncheck a day or a couple of days before\nthat you can then adapt if it's going to\nbe warm then I say you need to adapt\nyour pacing wear some sun cream take on\nsome electrolytes in the buildups of the\nrace and ideally as you're going around\nas well we a hat of course getting a hat\nfrom benp parks.com we sell the best\nrunning hats anywhere in the world\nthousands of festar reviews used by\npeople in all sorts of different racing\nTrails roads and everything like that go\nand check them out and help support the\nchannel here now the wind is a really\nreally tricky one because there really\nisn't much you can do practice running\nin a group in some of your training and\nthen you can share the lead if you're\none of the faster Runners out there with\nnot too many people around you and you\ncan practice sort of drafting and then\nsharing the lead or if you are more of a\nmid pack Runner the roads are going to\nbe a little bit busy then winds don't\naffect us as much as we might think they\ndo in our training when we're just out\nthere by ourselves suddenly you're in a\nbig group and they don't affect us too\nmuch so don't panic too much about the\nwind we can usually get through that one\nokay something again that happens way\nmore than you think it would be people\nthat arrive late to the start line and\nthen have to start at the back of the\nfield add so much unnecessary stress and\nall that wasted energy weaving trying to\novertake people to get up to Pace what I\nreally always like to do with the races\nI do is practice that Journey from where\nyou're staying to the start line the day\nbeforehand or a couple of days\nbeforehand if you have time have a\nbackup plan if that goes wrong as well\nstaying close to the start line is\nreally important to me if I can afford\nit with the price of hotels and things\nin the running boom it's becoming harder\nand harder to do that but I always\nprioritize staying in maybe like a worst\npart of the city or a worse\naccommodation so long as it's near the\nstart line and I can walk to the start\nline for a completely stressfree start\nto the\nday so pre-race fueling in the lead up\nto the race and the morning of again\nit's a really tricky thing especially\nwhen we are traveling to races if you're\ngoing abroad staying in a hotel then\nplan your dinner and breakfast during\nyour training that you know you're going\nto be able to replicate in the day\nbefore and the morning of the race don't\nwalk into the hotel breakfast thinking\noh what do I fancy today I'm going to\nhave this massive mound of porridge and\nhoney and oats and stuff like this if\nyou never had it that could be an\nabsolute disaster keep it super simple\nRice is available pretty much everywhere\nin the world as a night before car blad\nan absolute classic for race day morning\nis my Bagels but maybe there's not a\ntoaster available I don't particularly\nlike eating bagels without that so maybe\nQuant is a really good backup you can\nhave them cold warm whatever you want\nChuck some jam on them Quant are a\nreally good thing you can buy again\npretty much anywhere take them to the\nrace and get those down potentially just\nhaving a peanut butter and jelly or Jam\nsandwich you can just practice that in\nyour training and again you can use that\non race day morning think of these\nthings that you can just make up cereal\nwith some milks make up these meals you\ncan definitely replicate on your race\nday morning and you know they're going\nto\nwork now I wasn't sure whether to put\nthis one in because it's something that\nhappens to me all the time I've never\nreally seen it on any lists or anything\nI've ever seen over the years but I\nthink it's such an important thing so\nlet me know in the comments if you agree\nwith this one and let us know what are\nyour best race day tips to help out the\nrunning Community as well well now this\nis not ignoring nagging things as they\nhappen during the race shoe issues\nclothing issues toilet issues things\nlike that these will normally only get\nworse if you ignore them the classic one\nhere is like something like a stone in\nyour shoe it's just as simple get your\nshoe off get that stone out get it tied\nback up and in and get back on your run\nif you got a stone in your shoe your\nfoot will probably be under tension\ntrying to stop the pain and then you\ncould develop quite a nasty little\ninjury from just running in a different\nunnatural way get that stone out your\nshoe as quickly as you can with some\nclothing you might be getting chafing\nhopefully not because it's a clothing\nyou've practiced in all the time but it\ncan still happen on a particularly hot\nand sweaty day something like that grab\na medical person grab some anti-chafe\nget it on there stop that chafing as\nsoon as you can maybe you tied your\nshoes up too tight or too loose at the\nstart again just stop adjust them don't\nlet these issues become other issues\nyou're going to be getting some blisses\nif they're too loose stopping off some\ncirculation if they're too tight stop\nadjust them carry on I know this goes\nagainst a lot of a natural instinct you\ndon't want to waste any time but when\nI've had these issues in the past myself\nI've always felt like I've made up more\ntime in the long run by just addressing\nthem really quickly using the L is\nanother absolute classic I ran a 238 in\nValencia last year including a l stop in\na porta potty that was just for a number\none but then I ran about 240 mid 240s or\nsomething at the uh in Denver at a\nmarathon before with a full sit down\nloose stop during the race so don't\nworry you will feel so much better\nafterwards for just getting that out of\nyour system as well and yes these things\nare annoying when they happen during the\nrace but deal with them quickly and I\nguarantee you're going to make up that\ntime now the final one here is an\nabsolute classic wearing new shoes and\nnew kit on race day again people do this\nall the time I've done it myself I've\nlearned the hard way and now I'm making\nthese videos to make sure you don't do\nit as well but again so many people go\ninto this panic mode in the night before\nthe race or the day before and just\nthinking I'm just going to suddenly use\nthis brand new shoe because I've seen\nthis influence us it or this\nprofessional athlete use it just being\nsuper boring is the best thing we can do\nin this situation no new shoes no new\nclothing no new gels no new breakfast if\nyou are in any doubt at all about what\nsort of shoes and what gear to go go\nwith the most comfortable ones running\nfor three four or 5 hours is a hell of a\nlong time you don't want to go with\nsomething that is potentially going to\ngive you some issues and be\nuncomfortable even if you feel like it's\ngoing to be faster you're going to get\nsome issues and you will run slower go\nwith the most comfortable option out\nthere but overall my message for this\nwhole video is I don't want to panic\neveryone it's awesome that you're\nwatching a video like this learning\nimproving yourself I'm still learning\nI've run nearly a 100 marathons here in\nmy lifetime and maybe about 10 of them\nhave gone what I would call absolutely\nperfectly stuff always does crop up but\nwe can really control is everything\nthat's happening before our race and\ngetting that right to really minimize\nthe chance of things happening during\nthe race so have a great time out there\nguys let me know how you get on if you\nwant some specific advice on how to not\nhit the wall in the marathon and check\nout this video up here that video is\ncoming up next that's it guys keep on\nworking hard keep on getting done we'll\nsee you very soon in the next one",

      "text": "I've had the aex super Blast 2 for just\nover 2 and 1/2 months now and I've\nthrown so much at them speed sessions\neasy runs races and I've clocked up over\n350 testing miles in this shoe so I'm\nsure you really want to know how they\nare holding up I gave this shoe a pretty\nglowing review when it first came out\nbut a lot can change did I maybe get it\na bit wrong because I've tested a lot of\nother shoes things so maybe I found\nsomething better because today we're not\nonly going to talk about the super blast\nbut also four Alternatives if you are\nstruggling to buy this shoe at the\nmoment so let me know have you managed\nto get a hold of a pair of the coveted\nsuper Blast 2 and what do you think of\nit let me know down in the comments for\nnow I'm going to get stuck in to the\nreview and starting out as always with\nthe facts and figures so the purpose of\nthe super Blast 2 this is a long\ndistance mileage monster of a shoe a\nnon-plated racing shoe potential perfect\nfor 10ks half marathons marathons and\neven longer but definitely the kind of\nshoe you're going to want to keep on the\nroad pricewise coming in around about\n\u00a3200 stack height we're talking about 45\nmil stack at the back of the shoe 8 mm\ndrop overall this shoe is coming in at\n288 G 10.2 o for me in my UK size 11 1/2\nin this shoe that is super lightweight\njust holding it here in the hand you\nalmost can't believe a shoe of this\namount of volume with this much stack\nheight weighs so little this is a\nneutral shoe midso wise we've got the FF\nturbo plus this is the same foam that\nasex put in their highest end races and\nat the bottom of the shoe it has a layer\nof the FF blast Eco midso just for a\nlittle bit of extra wear and tear\nability just to prolong the life of the\nshoe outside wise on the bottom we've\ngot aex grip here this is the same type\nof material that they put on some of\ntheir trailer shoes as well so a really\ngood update was one of the big updates\nfor version two different widths\navailable sadly not just the one here\nbut it's pretty good on the width side\nthere are no dedicated men's and women's\nversions and finally this was not true\nto size for me I had to go half a size\ndown exactly the same thing as I did in\nversion one of the super blast right\nlet's get stuck into my likes so my\nfirst like with the super Blast 2 is the\nsheer versatility it really is the type\nof shoe you could take away on holiday\nor traveling and you could just take one\nshoe with you I've done speed sessions\nwhen I've been away I've done easy runs\njust when I've only been able to take\none shoe I also ran erasing it the big\nhalf handled it so well picking up the\npace in the second half cruising along\nat around about 345 350 a pace handles\nthat kind of pace so so well and it's\nalso really stable at all different\nPaces as well the updated phone they've\ngot here is just a little bit more Poppy\nand responsive than the outgoing one and\nit's just that perfect balance from a\nshoe that can Cruise along so nicely and\nthen give you that sudden turn of speed\nit's just a real sleeper shoe that you\ndon't expect to be able to go so fast my\nsecond like is the comfort of the shoe\nthis is the shoe I've been reaching\nabout about 90% of the time when I\nhaven't been testing out other shoes\nI've done loads of long runs 32 34 and\n36k long runs in this very shoe here\ngetting ready for my next marathon it's\nfelt super strong all the way through\nthose runs the shoe really looks after\nthose legs so nicely on those long runs\nand the foam has really felt good from\nthe start of the run the middle of the\nrun and the end of the Run haven't felt\nit sort of wearing and tearing and\nfeeling different as the runs have gone\non my third like is this shoe is just a\nlittle bit faster than it really\ndeserves to be mainly because it is so\nlightweight it's amazing how light this\nshoe is for that 44 mil stack heide in\nthe shoe when you really want to pick up\nthe pace you can as I said I ran the big\nhalf in the shoe and it just coped with\nit so so well I was just dealing with a\nfew little issues at the time I just\nwanted to put something that was\nDependable going to get me through have\na really good solid run this shoe really\ndelivered there for sure a carbon plated\nracing shoe is going to be faster than\nthis but there's nothing that's quite as\ncomfortable for around about 85 90% of\nthe speed that the shoe can produce and\nthen finally I want to have a chat all\nabout the durability of the shoe what\nit's been like over the 350 miles we've\nput in it it's probably around about\nhalfway through its really good life now\nI think you can get about 700 mil of\ngood solid training in the shoe before\nyou're really going to start to see it\ntear off the wear on the new out soole\nis really impressive I land slightly on\nthe outside of my foot and roll in which\nis fairly standard yes of course it's\nwearing down a little a little bit there\nbut it's holding up a lot better than I\nexpect again for something that is super\nlightweight and here in the footage you\ncan see I've got a brand new shoe on my\nleft foot and my used and abused shoe on\nmy right foot and I really I can tell\nthe difference between the two but it is\nvery very minimal over the course of\nthese 350 Mi this phone really has not\ndegraded an awful lot at all and yeah as\nI say it's got plenty of life left in it\nas you would hope it would do for a 200b\nshoe but of course it's not all smiles\nwith a super L lo as you guys know here\non the channel I'll give you my likes\nand all of my dislikes as well because\nwe buy all these shoes 100% with my own\nmoney to give you those completely\nhonest impartial reviews so the first\ndislike it's just still really hard to\nget a hold of they have just dropped a\nnew colorway that sold out pretty much\nin the first day it came out I did\nmanage to get hold repair so thank you\nto a lot of you guys that sent me\nmessages saying going buy a pair now and\nyeah it went very very quickly my second\ndislike it is just a little bit on the\nfirm side for me I quite like that but\nit's not really great at that sort of\nrecovery or lower end of your easy Paces\nhere if you're going out for that second\nrun of the day or you just want to go\nout and let the legs recover you might\nwant to get something a little bit\nsofter for your recovery runs and some\npeople also might want something a\nlittle bit softer for those super long\nruns if you're going out for three or 4\nhours maybe training for Ultras and\nthings like that you might just want\nsomething a little bit softer a little\nbit more forgiving for me I quite like\nthe firm side so it's not really\nnegative for me but it's something I\nwant to let you guys guys know and then\nfinally the price yes this is a super\nexpensive shoe but with the supply and\ndemand they could probably charge \u00a3300\nfor the shoe and it would still sell out\nit is just that good it's just one of\nthose unfortunate things high price\npoint and scarcity as well if you can't\nget hold of the shoe you are struggling\nbut you'd like a really good shoe for\nyour long run SP now we're going to have\na chat about all of the best\nAlternatives so because the super blast\nshoe is so hard to get hold of people\nare always sending me messages saying\nwell what else can I buy because I can't\nfind it but I've just got to be honest\nwith you guys there is nothing quite\nlike the super blast this really is a\nunicorn shoe it's very very unique no\none makes anything quite like it which\nis probably why it's been so successful\nso I've put together a list of four\nshoes none of these are that similar to\nthis I've got to be honest but they're\nall really good long run shoes which is\nwhere this superl 2 really excels so\nstarting out we want to have a chat\nabout the mauno Neo Vista shoe here now\nthe Neo Vista is a little bit softer and\na little less reactive than the super\nblast and it has a very different upper\nto the shoe this booty upper giving you\na nice snug lock down plus it does use a\nlittle bit more of a basic EVA foam\nwhereas the super blast has that peber\nbased foam and it also has at the bottom\nof the shoe this nylon plate of repello\nalong so as you're seeing I have quite a\nfew differences between this and the\nsuper blast but the Comfort levels are\nhigh on the super blast the Comfort\nlevels also very high on the Neo Vista\nas well and it's significantly cheaper\nthis shoe com com in around about \u00a3 150\nso a really good saving there both very\ngood long run options but for me you can\njust Cruise along a little bit better in\nthe super blast it's just much nicer\nthrough the footstrike No Doubt the near\nVista is going to be one of the\nHighlight shoes of the year it's very\nvery good and at this price point it's\nabsolutely fantastic as well so a really\ngood solid long run option to consider\nmoving on we're going to have a chat\nabout the hoker skywood X now I've only\njust got this shoe in started to do some\nearly testing the shoe again we'll put\nall the facts and figures up on the\nscreen the hooker shoe is absolutely\ncrazy 48 mm stack height I've never run\nin a shoe quite like that this is a lot\nmore cushioned softer bouncier just\nincredibly bouncy in fact the super\nblast is a lot stiffer firmer and it\nreally does pick up the pace a little\nbit better as well there's a big weight\ndifference the trouble with the skyex it\nis incredibly heavy and because of that\nit just doesn't have that pace range\nthat the super blast does there is a\ncarbon plate in the bottom of the skyex\nas well and so many shoes have these\ncarbon plates they're putting carbon\nplates in shoes like this not for all\nout speed but for stability because\nthese Foams are so soft and squidgy so\nreally like this shoe is really quite\nfirm so if you like potentially like the\nride of the super blast and that sort of\nfirmness you're going to get some good\nfirm stiffness here but then this sort\nof this direction the shock absorption\nthis is where the skyex really comes\ninto its own at your easy pace and\nrecovery Pace the Skyward X is a really\ngreat option I'm going to have my full\nreview coming soon so if you want to go\nand do some really nice recovery runs\nsomething to really look after your legs\non very very long runs I'll say this\nshoe is going to be better than the\nsuper blast but the super blast is just\nfar excels at those faster Paces\nsomething like the Skyward really just\nfor those easy recovery run Paces it's\ngoing to look after your legs very very\nwell right moving on to a shoe I don't\nactually have anymore so I'm going to\npretend I'm holding it here but it's a\nshoe I had earlier in this year which is\nthe super blast is baby brother the Nova\nblast 4 which yeah you can save a\nsignificant amount of money going for\nsomething like the Nova blast 4 it\ndoesn't have the carbon plate in the\nshoe doesn't have any plates in the shoe\njust a nice good stack of foam it's it's\naix's all around shoe just a good daily\noption for sure the super blast is going\nto be a lot quicker it's a lot more\nresponsive less bouncy better suited for\nthose longer runs as well but if you're\nhappier with a slightly softer ride that\nthe Nova blast gives and you're not\ngoing super long or not going on too\nmany long runs then the Nova blast would\nwork just as well for a lot of you guys\nout there if the super blast wasn't\naround I would definitely be spending a\nlot more time or I'd have bought another\npair of the Nova blast 4 after I wore my\npair out earlier on this year finally\nthe final show I want to have a chat\nabout is the New Balance SC Trainer\nversion 3 which I've really been\nenjoying putting some miles here the S\ntrainer version 3 it's such a different\nfeeling a different ride compared to the\nsuperlast the foam is so sof and you\nreally sort of sink into it it doesn't\nhave the most poppy doesn't have the\nbest energy return in the shoe again\nyou've got a carbon plate running\nthroughout the shoe here similar to the\nskywood x that plate is more for\nstability rather than speed and the\nsuper blast as I say it's a lot firmer a\nlot more responsive and that foam is so\nfirm it doesn't need a plate in there so\nthe SC Trainer is far more suited for\nthose easy runs those recovery runs that\nslower Pace running again to really look\nafter your legs with all that squish\nthat plushness on those long runs\nwhereas the firmness in the super blast\njust me it has more Pace uses really you\ncan just pick up the pace a little bit\nbetter in a few weeks time hopefully if\nthe rumors are true Nike will be\nreleasing the Invincible version 4 we\nwill get that in to review and that is\ngoing to be another big potential\ncompetitor so to bring that to a\nconclusion a lot of you guys probably\nthink well what should I buy if I can't\nget this and it's really hard for me to\nsit here and say this one is the most\nsimilar because they're really not that\nsimilar there is nothing quite like the\nride and the fear and the lightness and\nthe nimbleness and responsive of the\nsuperl if it was me and this didn't\nexist this wasn't in the world I'd\nprobably be running most of my runs in\nsomething like the Nova blast 4\ncombining that with a carbon plated\nratio for my speed session something\nlike the vaporfly which is what I've\nbeen doing a lot of my speed session in\nthis summer and then yeah some of my\neasier longer runs in this you know the\nthe SC Trainer that's probably the one I\nwould be going for out of all of these\nso far I have to be building a bit of a\nrotation because this just covers so\nmany different types of runs and that's\nwhy it's that beautiful doit all\ntraining shoe that you can travel with\nput in your bag and just do so much in\nit it's an amazing shoe probably the\nbest shoe I've ever run in quite frankly\nso there are my final thoughts let me\nknow your thoughts down in the comments\nbelow I hope you've enjoyed this video\nthat's it guys keep on working hard keep\ndone and we'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

      "text": "a lot of us were never taught how to run\nwe just run and that's fine but\nsometimes as we start to increase our\nmileage we can start to pick up little\naches and pains and injuries due to bad\nhabits in our running form well the good\nnews is a few simple tweaks can make a\nhuge difference if we learn to run more\nefficiently it will ultimately make us a\nfaster runner and who wouldn't want that\nbut also less prone to injuries as well\nthere's no one size that fits all with\nrunning form everyone is unique\ndifferent body types different strengths\nand weaknesses that will affect how we\nrun my running form itself isn't perfect\nbut it's something I've worked on so\nmuch over the years to now I'm quite\nproud of it but I'm still making\nimprovements So today we're going\nthrough the technique Basics and some\nthings that you can do on your next run\nto help improve your running form the\nfirst thing we're talking about is\nCadence Cadence quite simply is the\nnumber of steps you take per minute most\nexperienced run outs will have a Cadence\nsome where between 170 and 190 now newer\nRunners will often have a Cadence much\nlower than this around about 150 to 160\nso if that's you you'll most likely\nbenefit by trying to increase it by\nraising our Cadence our feet will be in\ncontact with the ground for less of a\nTime there'll be less impact coming back\nthrough our body causing those injuries\nnow most modern watches most garments\nmost choruses most polar whatever you're\nusing you will be able to record and see\nthis data in your app of choice and you\ndefinitely can in straa depending on\nwhich one you're using so if you're\nunsure then check that out in the app\nand just go on a nice steady run and see\nwhat kind of figure you are running at\nso how are we going to go about trying\nto improve it and raise it up the first\nthing is using a metronome app back in\nthe day I had to clip one onto my\nshoulder and listen to it as it Beed\naway it was kind of I think it was a\nmusician's metronome you can still get\nthose if you want to but most modern\nways of doing this you're going to get a\nmetronome app on your phone and you can\nset that at the beats a minute and run\nalong in time with the beat as it's\nclicking away like that you can also set\na metronome on most modern Garmin\nwatches as well and just run along to\nthe beat that your watch is making and\non top of that you can also add a data\nfield to your watch as well and see in\nlive real time the Cadence that you're\nrunning at and then again you can try\nand focus on that with your metronome\napp and just make sure you're running at\nthe Target Cadence that you're going for\na couple of other options here the first\none if you are a Spotify customer then\nspottify I have some dedicated playlist\nat different beats a minute 165 170 180\nEtc just put that in the search bar up\nat the top and then listen to some music\nas you run along that has been set to\nthat exact metronomic beat the last\nthing I want to chat about here is\nstrides now strides is quite simply 20\nsecond burst of speed it's really hard\nto run these with bad running form but\nit also gets us to increase our Cadence\nup to a high level as well this just\ngets your body used to moving more\nefficiently over the ground and turning\nyour legs over a little bit quicker\nwhich you then can translate into your\nregular speed running as well and they\nalso help to get us a little bit\nstronger so there's so many bonuses by\nputting some strides in I'd recommend\nputting these after your easy run during\nthe week at some point just once a week\nit will really help improve your running\nform and your strength as well then a\nfinal little tip here if you are running\naround about 150 beats a minute say\nyou're more of a beginner Runner don't\ntry and jump all the way up to 180 it\nwill be too much on your body just try\nand Chip Away with this over time I say\nrecommend about five beats a minute\nchunks at any one time right let's move\non to chat about posture now as we run\nas our foot hits the ground we want to\nmake sure our head shoulders hips and\nfeet are all stacked up in a nice\nstraight line with a forward lean that's\ncoming from the ankles and not from the\nwaist this allows us to benefit from\nGravity that will help to propel us\nforward as we run we want to be running\nwith nice relaxed shoulders not not all\nhunched over like that I really also\nlike this analogy which I learned from\nmy running form coach Shane benzy we'll\nlink to his details down below which is\nimagine you're running with some crisps\nor some potato chips if you're a\ndifferent part of the world in the UK in\nyour hands and you don't want to crush\nthem you want nice relaxed hands we\ndon't want to run with loads of tension\nin your hands there you just want to be\nprotecting those crisps we also want to\nmake sure our arms are not crossing the\ncenter line as we run so imagine running\nsay towards the camera almost like I am\nhere with with a nice line drawn through\nthe body we want to make sure our arms\nare not crossing over like this which we\ndo see quite a lot of people doing we\njust don't want to be losing loads of\nexcess energy wasting loads of energy\nmoving our trunk and our torso around\nlike this save energy and use that to\npropel yourself forwards instead so how\nare we going to go about improving our\nposture well the first thing I'd\nrecommend and I did this so much when I\nstarted running is to make sure you\nstand up tall and fall forwards into\nyour run and don't worry it is going to\nmake sense start standing up straight\nand then stop and start a few times\nstart your run just by falling into your\nrun just lean from the ankles into your\nrun and start running this gets the body\nused to being in that nice forward lean\nposition no need to do this on\nabsolutely every run you're going on but\nmaybe just when you're trying to improve\nyour running form once or twice a week\nwill be really good just stop start\nmaybe four or five times just as you get\ngoing now another way to visualize this\nI see a lot of these onewheel scooters\naround London and again they Lean\nForward forward to go forwards as\nthey're slowing down they lean back\nthat's the same sort of visualization\nthat we want when we're starting running\nleaning from the ankles lean forwards\ninto it and then you can start running\nwe also want to be checking in with our\nrunning form cues as well things we want\nto think about as we're running have we\ngot a nice high head position our eyes\nlooking forward to the Horizon nice\nrelaxed shoulders running tall and again\njust think about these things eyes up\nrelax shoulders Amma running tall again\nmost modern garments allow you to set\ndifferent alerts for this customer\nalerts that come up on your watch just\nto check in eyes up relax shoulders\nrunning tool just think about that as\nyou're running along and then finally we\nwant to work improving our core strength\nlike I said earlier we don't want to be\nwasting loads of energy here how can we\nimprove our core just very basic things\ndead bugs Bridges planks side planks\nstronger core means we'll hold that\nupright position for longer so many\npeople's form collapses towards the end\nof races the end of half marathons and\nmarathons especially everything is\ngetting very tired and fatigue the\nstronger our core the better running\nform we're going to be having towards\nthe end of our race the better we're\ngoing to be running overall right next\nup we're talking foot placement and\nLanding so with our foot placement where\ndo we want to be landing well ideally\nunderneath our Center of mass as we've\njust talked about in our posture there\nwe're going to make sure everything is\nnicely in a line and we don't want to be\nover striding out in front of us as this\nwill be creating that breaking force\nwhich is what we really don't want to be\ndoing there's been so much debate about\nheel striking specifically over the\nyears if it's something we want to be\navoiding where should our foot be\nlanding should I 4ot strike midfoot\nstrike or heel strike myself I'm a\nmidfoot striker I believe that's the\nbest way to move but it really doesn't\nmatter as much as we used to think it\ndid as long as we're Landing nicely\nunderneath our Center of mass some Elite\nRunners Charlotte pgy one of the UK's\nbest ever marathon runners runs with a\nheel strike but what brings all Elite\nRunners together is I say they're\nLanding nicely underneath that Center of\nmass now I would say if you want to\nchange the way you move if you are a\nhill Striker you want to become a bit\nmore of a midfoot striker then it's\nsomething I really would urge people not\nto concentrate on too much because a lot\nof the time it can cause people to\novercompensate and end up running on\nyour tiptoes which really isn't a good\nway to be landing so there's lots of\nthings we can do to help this transition\nnaturally if you do want to be running\nwith more of that midfoot Landing first\nthing I'd say here is to shorten your\nstride a little bit and increase our\nCadence this will naturally lead to our\nfoot Landing nicely underneath our\nCenter of mass again something I used to\ndo loads when I started running is to\npractice some barefoot running on a\ngrass on a grass on the grass or\npotentially if you live in a more\nCoastal area on the beach a nice Sandy\narea now why I find this really\nfascinating is because a lot of people\nwill run along with a heel strike take\nthe shoes off run on a nice soft surface\nthey will then naturally be running with\nmore of a midfoot strike because they\ndon't have that huge lump of foam and\nshoe underneath them to protect them\nfrom Landing in this really sort of very\nnatural way if you're not used to this\nthis can put quite a bit of strain on\nthose lower leg muscles so only do this\nfor some short bursts just running at\nyour natural easy running pace maybe\nsomething like 4 by 30 seconds just to\npractice this again we can do this at\nthe beginning of a run at the end of a\nrun finish in a nice grassy area this\nalso helps to increase our propri\nreception the amount of feedback we're\ngetting from the ground up into the body\ninto the brain as well again modern\nrunning shoes running in these massive\nfoam things on our feet we just don't\nreally know what's going on out that\nthere and our brain doesn't really like\nit two other little things that we can\nadd in here as well Hill reps now\nbelieve me Hill reps are such a good\nthing to be putting into our R not only\ndoes it build a lot of strength it\npromotes a faster Cadence but it also\nreally helps encourage Landing\nunderneath that Center of mass as well\nit's quite hard to run up a hill over\nstriding so again put these in your\nroutine maybe once every couple of weeks\ndo some Hill reps doesn't have to be\nmuch just something four five 6 by 60\nseconds up the hill and a nice slow jog\nback down and then finally drills\npracticing these movement patterns of\nrunning and correct Landing some high\nknees some butt kicks simple stuff that\nwe can put into our weekly routine\npotentially do these before one of your\nspeed sessions now we've talked quite a\nlot in this video All About Cadence if\nyou want to learn a little bit more\ndetail about Cadence I'll link to my\ndedicated video All About Cadence up\nthere so go and check that video out\nnext that's it guys keep on working hard\nkeep on down and I'm sure you become a\nbch better faster stronger happier\nRunner overall with all of these tips\nthat's it guys we'll see you in the next\none h",

      "text": "with so many big marathons always on the\nhorizon you'll be noticing your long\nruns are getting pretty long as the\ntraining plan progresses no doubt you'll\nbe wondering how on Earth am I going to\nget through these you might be getting a\nlittle bit nervous about them well don't\nworry we're talking all things long runs\ntoday how you going to get through them\nhow you going to be feeling strong all\nthe way through them right the way to\nthe finish and ultimately have a much\nbetter stronger more enjoyable race day\nas a result so I've got my five golden\nrules all about long runs today so sit\nrelax let's get long runs done the first\nthing I want to chat about is planning\neverything we're going to be doing\nbefore we're going to be heading out on\nour long run the first thing we're going\nto be deciding a good route to go on a\nlot of people like to lapse of their\nlocal park in London the famous ones are\nbatti Park and Victoria Park both very\nsafe and traffic free as well maybe\ndoing some out and backs maybe be doing\na potential race route or doing a race\nas a long run training run for me I\nspend so much time on straa rout Builder\nworking out where I'm going to go the\ndistances I've got on my plan this week\nand a good route to go through so plan\nout a good route for your long run we'll\ncome on to fueling a little bit later on\nin the video but in terms of planning\nnow do you need to drop some bottles\npotentially along your route where\nyou're going out so you can say nice and\nhydrated do you need to plan some shops\nto potentially stop at are you going to\nneed to find some fountains can you do\nthat EST straa really good at pointing\nwhere fountains are out on your run so\nthink about how you're going to carry\nand transport all of your fuel that you\nneed if our long run the day before our\nlong run we want to be treating the same\nas the day before our race as well so\nwe're going to winning a good\ncarbohydrate heavy meal the evening\nbefore that run the classic some things\nlike pasta some rice some pizza getting\nearlyish to bed and make sure we're nice\nand hydrated as well check the weather\nfor your long run do we need to be\ntaking some extra electrolytes with us\nthe day before if it's going to be\nparticularly hot some sun cream or maybe\nif the weather isn't so good an extra\nlayer to keep warm a waterproof top as\nwell don't get caught out and let the\nweather ruin your long run potentially\nyou want to go out there with some\ncompany as well if you're going out solo\npotentially taking some podcast along\nwith you or some music on your\nheadphones to keep you motivated and\nthey're really good distractions you can\ntick off loads of KS it's another really\ngood idea to start your long run at the\nsame time as your race day run so if\nyou're running London Marathon for\nexample starts at around 10 10:30 can\nyou do your long run starting at the\nsame time maybe not every week but a\nreally good thing to practice and just\ngets your body used to running long at\nthat time of day right coming on to my\nsecond section this is all about pacing\nsuper important to get the right effort\nfor your long run to get the maximum\ntraining benefit now if you follow the\nplan no doubt this will all be laid out\nfor you we design all of our long runs\nin our training plans not only to get\nyou very fit but also provide lots of\nvariety to keep your motivation High and\nthe runs fun and interesting as well so\nhave a think about the structure of your\nlong run it's a really good idea to\nbreak your long run up into blocks of\ndifferent pace sections easy Pace\nmarathon pace maybe half marathon pace\nfor those people training for half\nmarathons my absolute classic marathon\ntraining long run is 5K On 5K off 5K\neasy 5K gold Pace 5K easy 5K gold Pace\nup to 30 35k potentially of that or you\ncould have a faster finish long run\nwhere you maybe do the first half of\nyour long run nice and easy the second\nhalf pick that up to your marathon and\ngoal Pace or a fart Le run where you're\njust adding in some random burst where\nyou can pick up the pace maybe 5 to 10\npickups during your long run again it\njust keeps it interesting just go up to\nmarathon pace half marathon pace a\nlittle burst during the run just when\nyou feel like just picking up the pace\nhaving a bit of fun opening up the legs\na little bit it just means that you're\nfocusing on such a small part of the run\nat any one time you won't get\noverwhelmed by looking at the bigger\npicture of what you've got to do and\nthen also research the paces or the\nheart rate zones that you want to be\nrunning out during your long run I'll\nlink to it down below we've got a\ncompletely free download with a marathon\npacing chart which has all the different\nMarathon goals you could be going for\nand then the paces for each of your\ndifferent types of run there as well so\ngo and check that out and get that\ndownloaded always start off your long\nruns with a few very easy kilometers as\nwell and build into the run this is\nespecially important for older Runners\njust to ease into it those first few\nkilometers should be below the goal Pace\nthat you have for the run and then ease\ninto that pace and they go onto your go\nPace maybe sort of 3K into the Run\nmoving on to have a chat all about\nfueling now so I'd recommend breakfast\nis going to be anywhere from sort of 2\nhours 90 minutes up to really the limit\nis about an hour before because you want\nto get everything settled in your\nstomach it can be a really good idea to\npractice the options that you're going\nto have available on your race day\nduring your training runs as well so\nthere's no point practicing with all of\nyour training runs by having bagels and\nthen get to your race day and think I've\ngot no toaster to toast my bagels or I\ncan't buy Bagels in this country that\nI'm in so practice for the option that\nyou think are going to be available on\nrace day in your training runs the\nClassics for breakfast are things just\nlike as I say Bagels oatmeal and\nporridge cassant musly granola bananas\nand another thing that a lot of people\nforget is hydration so water and\nelectrolytes or maybe a carbohydrate\nsports drink as well so many people Bonk\nor hit the wall not necessarily from\nlack of calories but also lack of\nhydration as well just get very very\ndehydrated so once you're out on those\nruns we want to be taking a gel around\nabout every 30 to 40 minutes\nfigure out what works for you and other\ncouple of little pointers here don't\nworry if you need to stop for a minute\nor two to take on a gel get a bottle\nfrom a bush just to rehydrate properly\nit is so important to be getting these\ncalories getting this hydration on board\nfar more important than it is just to\nmake sure you don't stop during the long\nrun a couple of minutes here and there\nreally isn't going to make any\ndifference you want to be fueling these\nruns to feel strong all the way to the\nend then obviously we want to be\nthinking about how we're going to be\ncarrying our liquids and carrying our\ngels as well for me I'm always taking my\nnaked band my waist belt around my waist\nhere and then in that I can stick in my\ngels for in terms of staying hydrated\nluckily I've got my girlfriend that\ncomes out with me on a bike I don't mind\nstopping a shop every now and then if I\nhave to putting water bottles in bushes\nis another absolute classic that I like\nto do on my long runs as well make sure\nI've got access it's planned out before\nI go so I don't have to worry about it\nonce my run has started a lot of people\nreally like to take a pack with them as\nwell a hydration pack where you can have\nbottles up the front or maybe a\nreservoir bladder in the back of it and\nthen you can just sip on it as you go\nthis is a bit of a weird one because\nmost people won't do that on Race\nbecause they use the hydration available\non the course but it's bit of a weird\none where we have to do it in training\nbut we don't normally do it on race day\na lot of people you just got to get that\nhydration in and that's the simplest and\neasiest way to do it now moving on let's\nhave a chat about Kit everything be\nwearing for our long run you want to\ndedicate a few of your long runs for\nfull dress rehearsals this is shoes\nclothing because we don't want be doing\nanything new on race day including socks\nand pants we want to make sure we'\npractice with all of it so there's no\nsurprises on race day make sure\neverything really works well together as\nwell with absolutely no issues we don't\nwant any chafing any bouncing any\ndiscomfort get some of that good old\nbody Glide in there to stop any chafing\nthis is when you want to iron out any of\nyour issues now what shoes to wear do\nyou want to be doing all of your runs in\nyour race day shoes well weirdly I'd say\nprobably not I like to do some of my\nreally important runs I'm going at\nmarathon pace those practice dress\nrehearsal runs in my race day shoe so at\nthe moment I'm doing those in my\nvaporfly 3s but then some other runs\nthat a bit more chilled long runs I'm\ngoing to be doing those in my comfy\nshoes at the moment that's the super\nblast Tu so just have a think about it\nwhat singlet are you going to be wearing\nwhat t-shirt are you going to be wearing\nwhat waistband are you going to be using\nand how are you going to be carrying\nyour fuels and liquids on your run and\nthen once the run's done you've paed\nyour watch you saved your watch you've\ndone your stra you've done your social\nmedia and everything like that how are\nwe going to recover from our long run\nbecause that's the most important thing\nit's how well we can recover from our\nlong run is how well we're going to\nadapt and become a better runner in the\nfuture so I always like to finish my\nlong run with about 5 to 10 minutes walk\njust to bring that heart rate back down\ngradually doing some post run static\nstretching we've got a follow along\nvideo you can use we'll link to that\ndown below and up here as well and then\nI like to get a good post run recovery\nmeal some good protein some good\ncarbohydrates in there and rehydrate\naround about 30 to 45 minutes about an\nhour after I've run somewhere in that\nsort of window but as soon as I come in\nfrom the door I like to have a recovery\nShake just get some good protein powder\nsome blueberries some cheer seeds things\nlike that into the blender get that all\nready to go and get that down and start\nthat recovery process as soon as\npossible I always like to take a rest\nday after my long run which is what I'm\nsticking to in my current buildup\nMondays for me at the moment are always\nrest days after that Sunday long run and\nthen make some notes after your run as\nwell what went well well what didn't go\nso well what can we tweak for next time\njust have a time of reflection and see\nwhat we can do to improve I know you're\ngoing to be amazing when it comes to\nrace day up next we've got a video all\nabout how to avoid hitting the wall in\nthe marathon so go and check that one\nout to have that perfect Race date which\nI know you're going to have finally\nenjoy your long Runs run with a smile on\nyour face they are tough but it feels\namazing when you get out there and get\nthe runs done properly please check out\nmy website benp parks.com and we'll see\nyou very soon in the next one",

      "text": "New Balance have just released the third\ngeneration of the super trainer which on\npaper seems like it could be the perfect\nshoe great for long runs great for easy\nruns and also a potential really great\nrace Sho for people looking at marathons\nand half marathons but unfortunately\nthere's one pretty big thing that's\ngoing to be putting a lot of people off\nbut we'll touch on that later on so here\nis my full honest review of the super\ncomp trainer which of course I bought\n100% with my own money give that\ncompletely impartial unbiased review\nwe'll go through all the facts and\nfigures my likes my dislikes whether I\nrecommend you buy this shoe but firstly\nlet's talk about what's changed and\nwhat's all new in version 3 the super\ntrainer from New Balance is such an odd\nshoe because with every new version that\ncomes out New Balance like to change\nloads of different things on it so if\nyou really like version one and then you\nget version two it's not the same\nversion three again some big changes\nhere version one had this huge stack\nkite to it version two had totally\ndifferent geometry from that and\nactually did feature it in one of my\nmost comfortable shoes of last year it\nwas super bouncy great at all speeds and\nI say Ultra comfortable but a little bit\nunstable so what's new with version\nthree where we've got an updated upper\nhere the midso foam is a slightly\ndifferent composition as well and the\ntoe box at the front is a little bit\nmore tapered it doesn't feel quite as\nbouncy as version 2 but it's certainly a\nhell of a lot more stable oh and it's\nalso \u00a320 more expensive here in the UK\nbut we'll touch on pricing a little bit\nlater on right let's get stuck into the\nfacts and figures all the stats about\nsuper comp trainer version 3 with a\npurpose of a shoe like this this is for\nyour long runs and just a very premium\neveryday shoe targeted towards people\nthat are training for half marathons\nmarathons and potential some longer\ndistances as well price-wise this is\nabsolutely outrageous this shoe is\ncosting\n\u00a3230 yes2\n\u00a3130 here in the UK as a dollar\nequivalent that's\n$300 for our American friends but they\ndon't have to pay that because in the\nUnited States this is just\n$180 \u20ac250 Aussie doll\n$330 again people in Europe and people\nin Australia people pretty much\neverywhere around the world apart from\nAmerica and Canada are paying a massive\npremium on their shoe stackwise we're\ntalking a 40 mil stack at the back 34\nmil at the front giving a 6 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise for me this is\ncoming at\n325 G I've actually got this in half a\nsize down in a UK 11 and half cuz I just\ncouldn't find a 12 anywhere and that was\na mistake I wish I'd waited and try to\nfind my UK size 12 so it should be true\nto size go with your regular size don't\ngo half a size to like I did upper wise\nwe've got a phantom fit engineered mesh\nupper and a gusseted tongue inside\nmidsole we've got new balances fuel cell\nphone which is very soft it's a peber\nand Eva blend very very similar if not\nidentical to the rebel V4 but offering a\nlot more stability than the rebel V4 and\nit's got some biobased content in here\nas well plate wise yes we have got a\nplate we've got the energy art carbon\nplate to add in some extra rigidity and\nstability and of course a little bit of\nextra speed and propulsion as well out\nsoole we've got a very wide rubber out\nsoole here the grip in the shoe has been\nsurprisingly good as well so far you can\nget this in two different wids again I\nthink this is only in America and Canada\nas well they're offering the two wids\neverywhere else we've just got that one\nwidth unfortunately hopefully New\nBalance might update the websites but\nthat's what I'm seeing at the moment\nwell let's get stuck into all of my\nlikes my first like is this Phantom fit\nupper it's really fantastic and it's\nalso really quite breathable for\nsomething that's actually quite thick as\nwell you can see your socks or put your\nfingers through you can see you're going\nto get get some good amount of air flow\nthrough this shoe I've been running this\nshoe in some quite hot weather in London\nhere in the summer and it's been really\ngood also getting a good heel lockdown\nloads of heel padding at the back of the\nshoe here adding to that extra Comfort\nyeah didn't have to use any heel lock\nlacing the gusted tongue good amounts of\npadding around the tongue as well and\nalso a good length for the tongue as\nsome people know if you have got the\nelite the tongue is just so short and\nflimsy but in the trainer version it's\njust that but lot more comfortable\ncarrying on that comfort from version\ntwo in version three as well no issues\nno hotpots no blisters or anything like\nthat just good allar around Comfort\nstemming from this lovely updated upper\nmy second like with this shoe is just a\nfantastic Cruiser New Balance have\npitched this for someone that's training\nfor those marathons and half marathons\ngoing out for your long runs and ticking\noff those ks in comfort and that's what\nthis shoe has really been doing well for\nme at easy Pace at marathon pace and\nalso a little bit faster up to half\nmarathon pace it's just really really\ncomfortable the midsole has without\ndoubt lost some of its spark that\nversion 2 had in my opinion but what\nit's lost there it's gaining providing\njust some non nonsense cushion some\nreally good stability a shoe that you\ncan really trust now not going to roll\nany ankles or anything like that in a\nshoe like this just going to go out\nthere tick off your runs and get it done\njust fantastic at cruising along all\nthose nice steady Paces yeah very very\ndependable my third like with the shoe\nas I've touched on before just that all\naround Comfort straight out the box it's\na really good option for that mid pack\nRunner that doesn't want to have an\nallout super lightweight but quite\nuncomfortable shoe when they're going to\nbe going out for 3 four 5 hours on some\ntraining runs and during the race as\nwell they're just looking for sure they\ncan trust for many hours out on their\nfeet to get their training runs done and\nalso in the race as well it's nicely\ncushioned but with enough extra speed\nfrom that carbon plate in the shoe to\nmake all the difference versus that\nstandard daily shoe that you'll get in\nthat sort of 120 1340 price point you\nreally feel the premium difference\nyou're getting with something like this\nright as I said it's not all smiles\nlet's move on to my dislikes the first\none being it's really not the CPP of\nshoe you could use for all sorts of\ndifferent speeds it's not going to be\ngreat for your super super fast running\nit's just not responsive enough for\nthose 5K and those 10K training Paces\nthis is a shoe that's Happy cruising\nalong at marathon pace and easy pace and\neven recovery Pace as well this will be\nperfectly happy with that there really\njust isn't the same amount of pop that\nversion 2 had this one's just a little\nbit Bland a little bit less responsive\nbut a little bit more stable version two\njust had a little bit more range speed\nrange that you get versus version three\nmy second dislike is just the ridiculous\npriceing\ncompared to Canada and the USA I just\ncan't work out why they're charging\n\u00a3230 which is honestly crazy it's just\nreally really weird I can't really see\nwhy they think this is \u00a330 better than\nsomething like a super blast but the\nrebel 4 pricing at \u00a340 that was\ncompletely fine and normal the more\nversion 5 \u00a3140 pricing completely normal\nlike it's only \u00a330 cheaper than that all\nout Flagship super light rate full peber\nracing shoe and it just I just can't\nwork out the pricing and what they've\ndone here you can go buy a pair of\nvaporfly 3es from Nike for only \u00a39 more\nexpensive so his Flagship and dorphin\npro is the same price as this so the\npricing is just all wrong this shoe\nreally should be priced at \u00a3180 in the\nUK \u20ac190 all day long anyway let me know\nyour thoughts down in the comments maybe\nyou know more than I do but it's just\nabsolutely crazy but there are of course\nsome similar options out there a Shoe I\nhad in quite recently the mauno Neo\nVista \u00a3 150 you get in the plate you get\ngetting some really nice high-end foam\nin that shoe and you're getting some\ngood comfort and it can do a lot of\nthings that this shoe can do as well\nsomething like the Boston 12 140 again\nyou get in the plate you get in the\npremium Foams in there as well or the\nHocus skywood X again a plated everyday\ntype of shoe I haven't actually running\nthe Boston 12 or the Hocus Skyward X so\nI can't recommend those but we will be\ngetting them in for a review on the\nchannel but as you can see with the\npricing of those shoes significantly\ncheaper than this so it's really hard to\nrecommend but anyway let's have a chat\nabout my final thoughts on this shoe do\nI recommend this shoe 100% definitely if\nyou live in the USA and Canada or you're\ngoing to be visiting soon then maybe try\nand pick it up but at \u00a3230 I couldn't\npossibly recommend this it's absolutely\ncrazy is it worth the upgrade of a\nversion 2 probably not I just really\nlike version two it's just bit more\npoppy bit more versatile but if you're\nlooking for something that's got a more\nstable ride then

that they claim or\nthey are a complete waste of money as a\nconsumer it can be hard to tell if these\nproducts are genuinely good or if\nthey're just promising great things\nyou'll go out and buy them with their\ndiscount code no doubt so they get a\nreally nice chunky commission check at\nthe end of the day well that's why we\nare here today so I can give you a\ncompletely honest un bied opinion to\nhelp you in your buying decisions now\njust before we start I want to say this\nis not me having a go at influences in\nany way whatsoever I've got many friends\nwho are influencers all going to make a\nliving in lots of weird and wonderful\nways but like so many of you I'm curious\nabout the good and also the bad about\nthese products but also the complete\nbuying experience that some influencers\naren't going to see because they just\nget sent most of these products\ncompletely for free and touching on that\nI did have a bit of a negative customer\nservice experience with one of these\nthings today so hopefully it goes\nwithout saying that I bought all of\nthese 100% with my own money exactly the\nsame way we do with everything we buy\nhere and review on the channel so\nstarting out we have this from purport\nthis is a muscle balm to help you with\nyour tired and aching muscles it's\ninfused with 1,000 mg of CBD also some\nmagnesium and arica in there as well\nlike a lot of people I found out about\nCBD a few years ago when it was all the\nrage and I've actually bought six jars\nof this stuff over the last couple of\nyears at40 of Pop \u00a3210 I've spent with\npure sport I've actually used a little\nbit of CBD when I was having some a not\nso good mental health time to try and\nimprove things and at the same time I\nheard about pure Sport and what they\nwere doing with this stuff but let's\nstart out with the likes of the pure\nsport muscle B the first one being it\nreally got me into a good routine of\nlooking after my body learning about my\nbody doing some self massage working\nthrough those little aches and pains\nit's also informed sport so I can trust\nit there's nothing and anything here and\ngood customer support when I did have to\ncontact them for a couple of things it\nsmells really nice it feels really nice\non the skin the ingredients that they\nusing it the arica the cvd the Magnesium\nall appear to me to be really good\nquality ingredients and it's actually\nquite good value for the amount of CBD\nthat you're getting into this it's\npretty potent stuff so if you want to\ntry out this type of product with some\nCBD in this is going to be a really good\nhigh quality premium product and then\nfinally I'm not sure if this is a like\nor a dislike but it's just that sort of\nStellar artto or that weight rro effect\nmaybe Whole Foods in America it's just a\npremium thing it's like reassuringly\nexpensive but it you spend \u00a340 in it so\nyou're going to use it but talking about\nthe dislikes here it is obviously super\nexpensive I've spent over a couple of\nhundred on this so far you're paying for\nthat influencer Kickback you're paying\nfor the marketing teams all of that the\nbenefits probably are a little bit\nminimal I feel the benefits I had were\nfor me actually doing the massaging into\nmy skin I feel I could have used all\nsorts of different type of muscle bombs\nand probably had a fairly similar effect\nI didn't personally receive any sort of\nreal pain relief or any reduction in\ninflammation or things like that if\nsomething's gone wrong I've rolled an\nankle or something I'm getting an ice\npack out of the freezer rather than\nrubbing something like this on and\nfinally some of the people I do follow\nthat are promoting this stuff it's just\nvery scripted and I'm just very\nuncomfortable watching sort of how\nthey're promoting it so yeah are there\nsome Alternatives well Holland and\nBarrett do a CBD one doesn't have the\naner and the magnesium in it and it's\ncertainly not as potent and then Neil's\ny do a one without the CBD and but I've\njust got some arac in as well that does\nappear to be really good and that is a\nhell of a lot cheaper so if you have the\ncash to spend on something like this\nthen it's going to be worth trying to\nsome extent CBD is going to affect\neverybody slightly differently but I\nwould say just take some time to learn\nsome self massage techniques just\nslapping this on your skin and thinking\nyou're going to feel better in the\nmorning is not going to happen so what's\nmy rating for this and I'm going to keep\nusing it well i' give it a three out of\nfive it's worth trying but it's not\ngoing to be for absolutely every it's\ncertainly very expensive I'm probably\nnot going to be buying much more of it\nnow and just use it a little bit\nsparingly but yeah not too bad three out\nof five Right Moving on we're going to\nbe talking about pillar performance\ntriple magnesium powder I've bought a\ncouple of packets of this from xmars\nhere in the UK they're a great company\nalways give them a shout out and you get\na bottle with it I think if you get the\npack at the start it's basically a\nmagnesium drink powder you put one scoop\nin with 250 Ms of water ideally having\nit before you go to bed it makes a right\nold mess here Sarah's get me on the\ncamera mix it up and then just give it a\nshake up and that's you done and yeah\nand then let's get this on the\nmicrophone give it a good Shake because\nthen it has this really ASR now someone\nlike me I've always really struggled\nwith my sleep over the years I find it\nso hard to get my brain to shut down\nlate at night so that's really\ninterested to try this to help with my\nsleep but also as they say on the packet\nsupporting muscle function tiredness and\nfatigue to help you sleep better so you\nrecover better you wake up feeling ready\nto go the next day as I said I picked\nthis up from X Mars here in the UK\nthey're one of the official suppliers I\nthink pillar are from Australia they all\nThe Branding is quite Australian they\nsponsor quite a few Australian athletes\nas search and they also do this in a\ncapsule form as well so you can take\nthis as tablets or make this little\ndrink mix they also did this in Berry\nand pineapple I just got the berry\nversion twice and I've had two packs\nover the last three months 40 servings\nper pack costing \u00a345 a go so as usual a\nlot of talking about here it's a little\nbit on the expensive side and I took\nthis around about 30 minutes before bed\nnot absolutely every night but probably\nsort of about five nights a week\nso what does it taste like well very\nvery very very sweet we'll come with\nthat in the negatives right let's have a\nchat about everything I liked about the\npillow performance first one being it\nmixes really easily no lumps or anything\nlike that just whack it and any bottle\ngive it a shake and you're good to go 30\nminutes before bed we're also getting\nsome really good quality magnesium\nglycinate in here which is the best to\nhelp with those tired muscles do I feel\nI slept better the most important thing\nyeah definitely and I did have some very\nmore peculiar dreams after taking this\nas well so there certainly a lot going\non one thing I really did notice though\nwas getting back to sleep if I do wake\nup in the night I stir you go to the\ntoilet or anything like that getting\nback to sleep was just so much better\nafter I had this and then finally I\nreally genuinely felt it did help with\nmy recovery I was just sleeping so much\nbetter I haven't had any injuries touch\nwood over the last few months since I've\nbeen using this anyway let's have a chat\nabout the dislikes the first one being\nit didn't help me fall asleep any\nquicker initially I haven't taken any\nsleep medication or anything like that\nover the years cuz I don't really know\nwhat that type of stuff is this is not\nthat and it certainly didn't help me get\nto sleep it was just if I woke up and\ngetting back to sleep it definitely\nhelped with and then it's also very\nsweet and very artificial tasting this\nis just to the berry flavor it just\ntastes like you're having some kids\nsweet so it's not going to be for\neveryone's taste let me know if you've\nhad it what do you think of the taste\nand then finally some alternatives to\nsomething like this well pure sport du\nmagnesium capsule with added beetroot in\nit as well so you could potentially\ncheck that out so my rating for this i'\ndefinitely give this four out of five\nand I totally will be keeping up taking\nit I'm not going to be able to afford to\ntake it all year but just when I'm doing\nmy hard training I'm training for some\nmarathons now at the end of the year I'm\ndefinitely going to be trying to take\nthis sort of four to five nights a week\nso four out of five super expensive but\ndoes seem to be making a difference next\nup we are talking about this this is the\nThea gun mini version 2 RP of\n\u00a3175 though I bought this one on eBay um\nfor 125 so yeah massage guns some people\nlove them some people hate them they\nhave been increasingly popular over the\nlast 5 to 10 years they're kind of\nBuilders I guess the foam roller for the\nmodern athlete to help with their Master\nrecovery seemingly every pro athlete out\nthere has one of these in their bag\nyou're seeing people using them quite a\nlot and the body or Thea gun as they\nused to be called they've rebranded I\nthink um seem to be the go-to brand that\nsponsor a lot of high-profile Athletics\nteams and influencers and stuff like\nthat the world now I bought a Theon\nPrime which is just like the basic entry\nlevel one a couple years ago it was a\nbit of a pain to travel with and\ncharging it up and always lose a stupid\ncharger for it so I bought the mini so I\ncould travel with it charge it up really\neasily cuz it's USBC so what you get in\nthe package is obviously the theun mini\nyou also get the USBC cable um three\ndifferent heads that you can snap on and\nthen snap back off again this runs at\nthree different speeds there's some\nlights on the side here these LEDs those\nlight up with increasing different\nspeeds and then finally the other fact\nis it's 12 mm of amplitude there so I've\nbeen using this to warm up before my\nruns using it for some recovery after my\nruns the first like for this is actually\nnot the the massage gun itself but the\napp that it comes with on your Android\nor iPhone whatever it just syns up so\nperfectly to the device with bluetooth\nthe biggest issue for most people using\nmassage guns is they just don't know how\nto use it now I'm not an expert I'm\nlearning like everybody else but so many\npeople hurt themselves by using these\nthings badly using too much pressure in\nthe wrong sort of places the app is\nreally good it guides you through you've\ngot videos in there it tells you how\nmuch pressure to use where to place it\nand everything like that for the\nproblems that you're having in that\nparticular point in time it's just very\neasy to use when you know how so I\ndefinitely recommend use the app if\nyou're going to be using one of the the\nbody products and I think if you even if\nyou don't have a massage gun from theab\nbody you can still use the app obviously\nit won't control it and it won't speak\nto each other but you can get some\nreally good guides on there for how to\nuse things second like USBC is just just\nso much easier to travel with I've been\ntraveling loads with this we've been on\nplanes driving in the car it's gone\nthrough security absolutely fine in hand\nluggage no issues anywhere in all of the\ntravels and the battery life has been\npretty good I've been getting at least 2\nhours out of this which is lasting sort\nof about 10 days of use probably 10 days\nto 2 weeks of use so I really don't even\nhave to charge it up that much and I\ngenuinely feel better by using it I've\nhad a lot of issues at the start of this\nyear from driving my car getting really\nbad super type hip flexors I really put\na lot of credit into this device for\nhelping sort that out I mean I can do a\nbit more driving than I want to do so\nthis goes with me pretty much every time\nI go on a long car Journey this thing's\ncoming with me I can charge up in the\ncar stop every hour or so and just go\nthrough my hip flexors and then my final\nlike is it's pretty powerful it's\nsurprisingly powerful probably not going\nto be if you're a massive Burly\nweightlifter or something like that it\nmight have struggle to get through your\nsort of muscles but for people like\nmyself and the vast majority of Runners\nout there it's going to have more than\nenough power to look after your muscles\nbut as always it's not all smiles my\ndislikes with this it doesn't come with\na plug so you're going to need to have\none of those like little adapter boxes\nto be able to charge it up and you can\ncertainly apply more pressure with a\nmore normal shaped massage gun the way\nyou hold this it's not the best thing\nbut it's super convenient and easy to\ntravel with it's obviously quite\nexpensive if you buy it for full RP so\nare there alternatives to this of course\nthere are the main one being like the\nBob and gr Bob and gr the Bob and Brad\nmassage gun let me know if you've used\nthat you can obviously use your foam\nroller at the gym or at home if you're\ngoing a little bit more old school or of\ncourse get a Weekly massage if you can\nevery two weeks 3 weeks 1 month whatever\nyou can do whatever you can afford that\nis going to help you out way more having\nsome some actual human go through your\nbody than these sort of things can but\nit's a nice thing for me to keep\neverything ticking over between saying\nmy regular massage therapist so my\nrating for this I really really quite\nimpressed because it's helped sort out\nso many little problems I've been having\ndayto day so four and a half out of five\nand will I keep using it yeah this is\ncoming everywhere with me we good\nfriends traveling around the world\ntogether right just going to have a\nquick drink if you are enjoying the\nvideo let me know hit that like button\ndown below and is there any influencer\ntype products or just any products you\nwant to see me review let me know down\nin the comments there it's going to\ngoing in there pick a few and we'll do\nanother one of these videos in a few\nmonths time I'll go and buy all this\nstuff and see if it's any good right\nback to the video I think we're talking\nabout aftershocks next right aftershocks\nas my girlfriend is just behind the\ncamera has reminded me they're not\ncalled aftershocks anymore they are just\ncalled shocks these sent me back\n\u00a360 if you don't know what these are\nthinking what the hell is he waving\naround these are headphones basically\nfor active people Runners cyclists\nWalkers well that's certainly how they\nbrand them on their website these used\nbone conduction Technologies they sit on\nthe side of your head like that and I'm\ngoing to read this because it's really\ncomplicated but if you're wondering how\nthey work they convert sound into\nmechanical vibrations that are\ntransmitted through the skin and the\ntemporal bone to the clear\nbasically these pods on the side of\nthese headphones vibrate and they go\nthrough your bones and you can hear them\nwhat do you get in the Box well you get\nthe cable the charging cable the\ntraveling case and the headphones as\nwell they come in two different sizes\nfor different size head shapes they\ncharge up super quick you can go from n\nto 60% in around about 20 minutes and\nthey'll be fully charged in one hour the\nbattery lasts about 10 hours so let's\nchat about my likes one the sound\nquality for listening to podcasts and\nany sort of spoken word audiobooks and\nthings like that is pretty good my\nsecond like is the safety aspect of\nthese because there's nothing actually\nin your ears you can hear of any\npotential dangers traffic other people\ncyclist whatever around you and you can\nalso use these pretty much all the time\nin races you still need to check with\nthe race organizer but pretty much every\nrace certainly here in the UK you can\nuse aftershocks even when headphones are\nbanned because the safety aspect you can\nhear medical people you can hear\ndirections and stuff from everything\ngoing on around you you can also connect\nthese up to any phone any watch so you\ndon't have to take your phone with you\nif you just want to connect it to your\ngarment and listen to the music on that\nthat works absolutely fine also super\ncomfortable you could easily wear these\nall day without any problem at all some\npeople also like to use these in like\noffice environments and things if I've\ngot a call in the house this is normally\nwhat I'll be reaching for battery life\nas we touched earlier really good as\nwell they also do work well in heavy\nrain I've never had a problem I've never\nhad a pair break I think this is my\nthird pair I've just upgraded so the\nbuild quality of these things is superb\nlet's have a chat about some dislikes\nwell because they're not properly in\nyour ears the sound quality for music\nisn't great especially the bass I've got\nthe like the pro version here which is\nmeant to have a bit of better bass if\nyou want to listen to music you're a big\naudio file these are definitely not the\nheadphones to be going for also you\nreally can't hear much if you are in a\nnoisy environment the whole point of the\nsafety thing you can hear the dangers\nbut if you're running through a busy\nUrban environment all the time you\nreally can't hear a lot of what's going\non in these I guess that's just the flip\nside of being safe which a lot of high\nvolume alerts I don't know if Android\nhas this but on my phone it's always\nwarning me because I keep listening to\nthese too loud because you listen to it\nnearly about sort of 80% volume most of\nthe time so Apple thinks you're\nabsolutely ruining your hearing but they\ndon't have a setting for these type of\nheadphones um you so I can't really wear\nthese under a beanie so we're coming to\nthe winter now so I tend to get my\nairpods out for wearing under a beanie\nand just put them on the past three mode\nother Alternatives out there I really\nwould say maybe just save \u00a330 and buy\nthe not pro version just the open run\nthey actually have a better waterproof\nrating as well they're \u00a33 cheaper and\nwhen I'm out a run I really honestly\ncan't tell the difference they've also\ngot a refurb section on their website\nwhere you can buy some with a pretty\nhefty discount as well so if you're in\nthe market for that then check out the\nrefurb section other alterers as well\nsunto have actually released um two new\nvery similar headphones to this I think\nthey're called the sunto wing and the\nsunto Sonic um the early reviews say\nthey are quite good so my rating for the\nafter trucks is 4 and2 out of five will\nI be keeping them definitely I use these\non absolutely every run I go on right\nour final product on the list today are\nsome running sunglasses from a company a\nBritish company called Su God I see a\nlot of people wearing this influences\nlove a pair of sunglasses I think I look\nmore like I'm about to go and do\nsomething in a laboratory with my bunson\nburner but yeah for them it's a nice\nlittle earner they s me back\n\u00a330 they make all sorts of different\nsunglasses um also like ski go they\nsponsor loads of pros and influencers as\nwell what do you get you get a nice\nlittle case you get three different\nlittle nose section things which are\nhere and you can just unplug that bit in\nthe middle and put one of these on the\nstandard pair fit me absolutely fine\nthat starts out with my first like\nbecause these do not move around\nanywhere on my head whatsoever I was\njumping around shaking around they do\nnot move even when I'm like Midway\nthrough a run here as I'm it's pretty\nsweaty here in the summer they don't\nmove they don't bounce they just stay\nthere they're also extremely lightweight\nas well just 26 G and when I've got\nthese on I can't see anything around my\nface at all they completely block any\nsort of normal bit of light coming in\nhere you can also spec them with\nrecycled material for the same price as\nwell when you sort of build your glasses\non the website you can custom pretty\nmuch everything on here but it's really\nnice to see them offering a recycled\nPlastics as well here for the same price\nas the new stuff and then my final few\nlikes I really like how you can just put\nthese on and you can run from shade into\nlight back to shade into light never had\nto like put them down like this to be\nable to see in sort of more darker areas\nlike that I'm not sure what this lens is\nI'll put the name of this lens up on the\nscreen it's got quite a yellowy tint to\nit so it was really good in low light\nbut then even when the sun was quite\nbright it worked pretty well as well\nI've never actually running them in the\nrain or any sort of high humidity but\nnever got any like fogging up issues\nwith the lenses here and they do offer a\nlifetime guarantee which I haven't had\nto call on for these obviously they're\nstill in good shape here but when I did\na bit of research online some people\nthat had said it was really quite good\nand they're having some positive\nexperiences and then finally when you've\ngot these on and maybe you've got your\naftershocks on as well you put them the\nother way around or whatever headphones\nyou've got everything sort of went\ntogether pretty well and comfortable and\nit worked absolutely fine when I was\nusing everything together right of\ncourse like all these things it's not\nall smiles I did have a bit bit of an\nissue with the customer services it's\nprobably my fault to be fair but\nbasically I logged on at about 9:30 in\nthe morning to order these glasses\nbecause I wanted them to go away on a\ntrip in a couple of days time and they\nhad a special offer on them buy one get\none free I was like that sounds really\ngood then with my whole adhp D brain\njust abandoned the checkout went off and\ndo something else came back about 40\nminutes later about 10 10 and the offer\nwere gone it was like their weekend\noffer so I just sent a little message\nsaying I I started my check out do you\nthink you can do the offer and they was\nlike no so that that was the end of that\none I was like like I run a website here\nin the UK of course I'd help someone out\nuh with that but they was like right\nfrankly no sorry you missed it you\nshould have checked out your fault it\nwas my fault they didn't have to but it\nwould have been nice and then I then\npaid for like the next day delivery said\nif you order before 3:00 p.m. we'll get\nthese in the post arrive the next day\nand they didn't dispatch them and then I\ncouldn't take them on my trip I wanted\nto go on and they arrived a day late and\nit was just a little bit annoying and\nthen finally some of the customization\noptions weren't available when I ordered\nthese I wanted to slightly different\ncolor whatever you call this arm on the\nside of the glasses and they weren't all\navailable at the time but yeah overall\noh oh Alternatives well goodar are like\nthe main one it's certainly a hell of a\nlot cheaper than something like Su God\nbut they do scratch up so easily and I\nhave bought a few over the years they\njust kind of ended up in the bins they\njust really did not last very long so\nI'm not sure how great that is then of\ncourse Oakley the other big one out\nthere I've got a few Oak glasses and\nthey've always looked after me really\nwell and I think uh what's Rich Roll oh\nRoka he's always going about rer glasses\nso my rating of the sung God glasses\nwell I give these a four out of five as\nsunglasses go I really can't fault them\nI'm not a massive lover of running in\nglasses but I've enjoyed running in\nthese you do look a little bit s see I\ndon't know I feel like I'm sort of back\nat school doing some experiment in this\nstyle if I was as cool as Courtney dewal\nI would definitely go for her pair so\nthat's it guys that's my thoughts on\nthese products here let me know what\nelse you'd love to see me test and get\nmy thoughts on down in the comments\nbelow and if of course if you've tried\nany of these products help out the\ncommunity and let us know your thoughts\non all of these things down below as\nwell so one of the biggest influencer\nproducts is the ag1 which I tested back\nend of last year so I'll link to that up\nhere keep on working hard keep on\ngetting done and we'll see you very soon\nin the next one",

      "text": "the New Balance more version 5 is one\nMammoth of a shoe packed with loads of\nsoft squishy cushioning underfoot it has\nthe potential to be one of the comfiest\nshoes of all time perfect for those\nlonger runs those recovery runs so would\nit be crowned the king of comfort today\nor will it end up being a clumpy\ncumbersome waste of money well today\nI've got all my thoughts on the more\nBion 5 plus some comparisons with\nsimilar shoes you might be torn between\nas always on the channel I bought this\nshoe 100% with my own money from sport\nshoes here in the UK give you that\ncompletely honest impartial 100%\nunbiased review right let's start out\ntalking about how this compares to the\noutgoing version 4 I don't actually have\nmy more V4 here anymore but I had good\nfun testing it out if you want to look\nat the review of that I think it's over\non my second Channel anyway we'll link\nto it down below the updated version 5\nhas a wider geometry underf foot but\njust really basically providing a lot\nmore stability which you need with these\nhuge High stack shoes because yeah this\nhas now has an extra 10 mm that's crazy\na whole cmet extra stack height compared\nwith the outgoing more V4 they've also\nupdated the tongue we've now got a nice\ngusseted tongue giving a little bit of a\nbetter lockdown and along with all of\nthat extra stack heite of course\nunfortunately it comes with a little bit\nof extra weight so an extra 19 G of\nweight for me and my UK size 12 this is\nnow tipping the scales at\n374 G right let's check out the stats\nthe facts and figures so the purpose of\na shoe like this this is for your long\nruns your recovery runs maybe your long\nwalks as well and for people that spent\na lot of time on their feet dayto day so\npotentially people from working in\nretail working in hospitals you know who\nyou are it's a great shoe for people\nthat spending a lot of time on their\nfeet when to look after their legs and\nbe nice and comfortable all day long\npricewise \u00a3140 this cost me here in the\nUK we'll pop up the dollars the\nAustralian dollars the Canadian dollars\nand the Euros up on the screen now stack\ncode at the back 44 mil and we've got a\n4 m drop overall it's a 40 mil stack at\nthe front of the shoe that is absolutely\ncrazy as I said weightwise 374 G for me\nversion 4 was\n353 with the upper of this shoe we now\nhave this engineered mesh with what\nthey're saying is a seam free\nconstruction to help with that Comfort\nmidsole wise we've got new balances\nFresh Foam X midsole extra soft very\nplush very very squishy here this really\ndoes feel like you have marshmallows on\nthe of your feet out soole wise we've\njust got two big patches of rubber one\nat the front one at the back and then\nsome exposed midsole here in the middle\nof the shoe so few durability concerns\nthere especially for some Ultra Runners\nwhich this shoe might well appeal to and\nyou can get two different widths\navailable although the standard shoe is\npretty wide as I keep saying but of\ncourse wider footed runners go for the\nwide size you can get a men's and\nwomen's fit and it was true to size for\nme right let's get stuck into all of my\nlikes so my first like with the New\nBalance more version 5 is quite simply\none word Comfort it is absolutely\namazing probably the most comfortable\nshoe I've ever run in it's very soft at\nall speeds but it's not really mushy you\ndon't have to worry about sort of this\nbig squishy mess that's not propelling\nyou forward it really doesn't feel too\ndead at all yes you can pick up the pace\nin the shoe given this rocker that it\nhas at the front of the shoe you get a\nreally good turnover going that's really\nnice plenty wide enough to give no sort\nof irritation no hotpots no blisters or\nanything like that just out of the box\nComfort right from day one a slightly\nsort of minor thing though it doesn't\nhave a pull tab at the back but it's\nfine to get off and on anyway my second\nlike with the shoe is this super stable\nvery wide platform that the shoe has an\na roomy toe box as well at the front of\nthe shoe it really is the amount of\nwidth and stability that a shoe with\nthis amount of Stack height needs\nsometimes when you get this High stack\nkite shoe the stability isn't very good\nand you can risk rolling an ankle you\ndon't have to worry about something like\nthat with a shoe like this as I say it\ncomes in the regular wits which is\ndecent but wider footed runners go for\nthat wider tow box just this larger\nsurface area in the bottom of the shoe\njust it gives you a lot more confidence\nin the corners and I like this sort of\nflaring at the back of the shoe as well\nit's just really nice design Touches at\nthe back of the shoe and then my third\nlike with this shoe is the ride is super\nsmooth as I said that rocker at the\nfront of the shoe heel Strikers are\ngoing to love this we've got a nice sort\nof rocker is at the back of the shoe\nthere so you can just transitions\nthrough the foot strike super smoothly\njust a really nice shoe for cruising\nalong if you're on an easy run you just\nwant to pick up the pace from of a\ncruisy pace this shoe will handle that\nreally nicely no heel slips good lock\ndown in the shoe as well really like the\nimproved tongue nothing moving around\nthere and yeah nice ankle Comfort at the\nback no irritations or anything like\nthat and then finally my fourth like it\nis a great option not just for running I\nknow some people that like to watch my\nvideos that aren't Runners they're\nlooking for a nice comfortable all day\nshoe you can get this spect in all black\nas well so if you like to look a little\nbit smarter right it's not all smiles\nlet's have a chat about my dislikes the\nfirst one being you can't get away this\nis a big shoe it is definitely on the\nheavy side but a lot of shoes in this\ncategory are going to be like that but\nit would have been nice just to be a\nlittle bit lighter there what do you\nguys think about lightness and heavy\nshoes like this they can do it the 1080\nhas got a good amount of foam in here\nand is significantly lighter it's like\nthe sort of different density Foams\nbetween these two shoes but the weight\nof the shoe is distributed really nicely\nthroughout and it doesn't feel too heavy\nwhen you got on it it doesn't even feel\ntoo heavy in the hands the second\ndislike with the shoe is it's definitely\na shoe on the stiff side now it doesn't\nhave a plate in the shoe but it's\ndefinitely just that sheer amount of\nfoam it is a little bit on the stiff\nside I personally quite like that but\nnot absolutely everybody will and my\nthird dislike with the shoe is just this\nupdated upper it's really not the most\nbreathable this is quite thick so if you\nare someone that's going to be running\nsome hotter humid climates you might\nwant to to avoid something like this but\nreally for anything you get in the UK\nyou're going to be absolutely fine right\nwe're just going to compare it quickly\nto some other options out there that you\nmight be thinking about firstly the most\nobvious one the 1080 version 13 the 1080\nis a lot lighter here probably just has\ngot a slightly less dense version of The\nFresh Foam X foam in there I wasn't a\nbig fan of that foam it just felt quite\nmushy but yes the more 5 slightly on the\nheavier side but a lot more stable which\nI really like the 1080 is just a lot\nmore versatile with that lightweight\nNess you can has just got a more of a\npace range that you can use it for\nwhereas the more V5 more of an easy and\nRecovery run shoe only one of the\nanother Classics the Hoka Bondi version\n8 very similar geometry with that shoe\nbut it's a lot lot firmer and it's quite\nan old shoe now it's really due an\nupdate hopefully that won't be very far\naway better for those that want that Mac\nstack shoe without that super soft\nsquishy feeling but for me the more 5\ndefinitely wins here I just really like\nthis nice super soft squishy phone for\nmy recovery runs and then finally\nprobably well it is the shoe I said was\nthe most comfortable shoe last year the\naex GEL Nimbus version 26 is a lot\nlighter well a little bit lighter than\nthe mo V5 and also a little less chunky\nas well Comfort is definitely on par I\ndefinitely prefer the stability in the\nmo V5 and the feel I just like I'm\ngetting a little bit better energy\nreturn in this shoe so I can just pick\nup the pace a little better and they\nalso 40 cheaper so quite a significant\nsaving there pricewise right conclusion\ntime do do I recommend this shoe well\ndefinitely yes this is my go-to recovery\nrun shoe right now I really do prefer it\njust a little bit over the Joe nus 26\nwhich is what it's replacing in my\nrotation is it worth the upgrade over\nversion 4 well I think so this has got a\nsignificant improvements quite surprised\nwith the amount of improvements that New\nBalance have managed to get into the\nshoe it's been a lot smoother it's much\nmore lively much more fine it can pick\nup the pace a little bit better as well\nand also just better lock down and\ncomfort in version 5 so you've got the\nbudget for it then definitely Splash out\non version 5 so who should be buying a\nshoe like the more version 5 or someone\nlooking to add a shoe into the rotation\nfor those slower runs of the week those\neasy runs those recovery runs those\nlonger runs as well so long as you're\nnot looking to pick up the pace too much\nUltra Runners I'd really recommend a sh\nlike this for some of your flat Ultra\nruns something in the UK maybe like a\ntemps past through as long as it's not\ntoo wet in the second half of the run\nbut Ultra Runners if you're running on\nprepared Services your toax fire roads\njust prepared services this will be a\nfantastic option to take on those yes\nit's a little bit on the heavy side but\nit's super comfortable to offset that\nand yeah finally just people need that\nall day Comfort up work as well then\nwe'll be keeping it definitely really\nenjoyed this shoe it is not going on\neBay I'm afraid right next video we've\ntalked a lot about comfort in the shoe\nup here we've got my most comfortable\nshoe review so go and check that out and\nthis would have certainly featured it if\nI had the shoe when I recorded that\nvideo that's it guys keep on working\nhard keep on done let me know what you\nwant to see reviewed on the channel next\nand we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

      "text": "running a half marathon is an amazing\nachievement for any Runner and what's\neven better well running a half marathon\nfaster than you have ever done before\nwell stay tuned because by the end of\nthis video you'll know exactly what to\ndo to get you that PB we'll go through\neverything what time you should be\naiming for all the sessions that help me\nrun a 67 minute half marathon and how to\nPace the race itself and what I'd also\nrecommend for fueling and hydration\nalong the way but first let's get stuck\ninto the training so how long should you\ngive yourself to train well it's one of\nthe big reasons why I personally love\nthe Half Marathon distance it doesn't\nquite take over your life the way that\nmarathon training does ideally you want\nto allow yourself 12 weeks of training\nthat's how long all of our training\nplans are and you can check those out on\nthe website all our beginner plans for\nthe half marathon are completely free to\ndownload we'll link to all of those down\nbelow I'll also put some good fun and\nfast half marathon races up on the\nscreen now that I've done before and\nalways let us know down in the comments\nsome great half marathon races that\nyou've run to help out the running\ncommunity so people know where those\nfast courses are so what's a realistic\ntime to be aiming for well this\nobviously varies wildly from person to\nperson and your running experience as\nwell for newer Runners out there you're\nlikely going to be able to achieve some\nreally big improvements in those early\nstages 5 10 even 20 minute PBS are\npossible but for more experience Runners\npeople running a little bit longer those\nprogressions do obviously cut a little\nbit shorter as you get a little bit\ncloser to your limit so it might be a\nminute or even just a few seconds but\nthey all count we want to get that\nlittle bit faster if you've never run a\nhalf marathon before then how do we know\nwhat we're capable of well this is a\nRough Guide if you want to run sub 2\nhours you're going to want to be around\nabout sub 60 for your 10K a sub 145 half\nsub 50 for a 10K a sub 1302 sub 43 for a\n10K once you hit those 10K times you're\nready to begin that training Journey to\nhit those half marathon goals and what\nwould our weekly mileage look like for\nsimilar goals well someone that's trying\nto break 2 hours we're looking around 3\nto four runs a week up to around 32\nmiles or 50k of training per week sub\n145 four to five runs a week now up to\naround about 40 Mi or 64k of training\nper week and sub 130 5 to six runs per\nweek up to around about 54 miles of\ntraining 87K per week now I should say\nwith those distance figures they all up\ntwo the figures I've given there going\nto going to be in the peak week of\ntraining with around about 2 weeks to go\nfor the half marathon we're going to\nbuild up have some recovery weeks build\nup have recovery build up and those Peak\nweeks are going to be around about those\nsort of distances see how that feels\nwith you and all that will give you a\nbit of an idea of what you are going to\nbe capable of in a half marathon one of\nthe biggest keys to get faster over the\nHalf Marathon distance and let's face it\nall running distances are doing speed\nsessions during the week in order to run\nthat fastest half we need to get the\nbody used to training faster than the\ngold pace and we do this with speed\nworkouts and interval sessions more\nexperienced Runners will probably want\nto be setting aside two runs a week for\ndoing these speed sessions we'll touch\non that a little bit later on now I've\ngot some really good example sessions\nthat you can try here the first one is a\nprogression run something like 10K in\ntotal distance 3K easy 3K at your half\nmarathon pace 2K at your 10K pace and\nthen 2K cool down afterwards really good\nto get the legs strong for when we're\npushing at the end of a half marathon or\nhow about a mixed Paces Run after round\nabout 10 to 15 minutes of warming up 4X\n1K at your 10K Pace your so current 10K\nPace going straight into 4X 400 m at\nyour 5K Pace taking 2 minutes little\nrecovery walking between each of those\nreps then a 5 to 10 minute cool down and\nthen thirdly one of my favorite sessions\nis gold Pace reps this is 3x 8 at your\nhalf marathon goal Pace with a 2minute\nwalking recovery between each one with\nall of these sessions make sure you do a\ngood warm up and warm down afterwards\nideally trying to get a few little\ndrills in there some proper Dynamic\nstretching before you get into those\nreally fast sections now if you're a\nlittle bit unsure with these type of\nsessions maybe get in touch with your\nlocal running club quite often they will\nbe putting on these type of sessions at\nleast once a week and also you don't\nhave to be running these at a track at\nall just find somewhere flat fast and\ntraffic free and that will be perfect\nconditions to get your runs done now as\nI touched on at the start of this\nsection if you are a fairly experienced\nRunner you may want to add a second\nspeed session during your week\ntraditionally the Tuesday is session\nwill be when you're running reps a lot\nfaster than your goal pace so something\nlike 400s 800s something like that then\nthe second session of the week is going\nto be around about that goal Pace there\nsomething like a tempo run or a\nprogression one where you're building\ninto that goal Pace it will just push\nthat Fitness up even more another big\npart of your training that you want to\nbe getting into your week is running\nstrides now these are bursts of around\nabout 20 seconds of fast running around\nabout 90% effort so not quite all out\nrunning for the bus territory but just a\nlittle bit slower than that and I really\nrecommend putting these at the end of\none of your easy runs during the week if\nyou're new to strides do something like\nthree to four reps of this more\nexperienced Runners up to around about\nsix reps just with a super relaxed easy\njog or just walking between each reps\ntake about 20 to 30 seconds just get\nyour heart rate back down and why we\nwant to be doing things like this it's\nhelping recruit some of those fast\ntwitch muscle fibers to help put in that\nstrong Sprint at the end of the race it\nalso helps really improve our running\neconomy and our running form as well\nit's quite hard to run with poor running\nform when we're running that fast so\nmoving on long runs and easy runs the\nrest of your week should ideally include\na good solid long run and also some easy\nmileage in there as well now a lot of\npeople come to me and say well why can't\nI just do speed sessions and run super\nfast every day well these sessions put a\nlot of stress on our body and that's why\neasy running comes in if we did speed\nsession every day we would just overload\nourselves and pick up some injuries so\nthat's why we do easy runs to recover\nfrom those sessions and it still helps\nbuild that cardiovascular fitness\nrunning nice and easy to help build up\nthat volume safely and build that\nendurance in the heart the body and the\nlungs that we're going to need over the\nHalf Half Marathon distance so how long\nshould our long runs be well for a sub\n2hour training we're talking around\nabout anywhere between 6 and 13 miles\nfor the long run this will again\nprogress as the training goes on so\nearly weeks about 6 miles later on\naround about 13 mil sub 145 we're\ntalking around about between 8 and 14\nmiles sub 130 we're talk anywhere from\n10 to 16 miles as the plan progresses\nthen for the more advanced Runners\nyou're going to want to add some gold\npaace blocks into these long runs as\nwell we want to be putting some blocks\nin here every other week all of our\ntraining plans are set out exactly like\nthis so of course check out VP parks.com\nif you're a little bit unsure you just\nwant to download a guide and follow it\nalong thousands of five star reviews\ngoing check them out we're really proud\nof these plans we produce so we going to\nbe adding some segments at that goal\nPace during our long run about 2 to 3K\nat our go Pace then back to easy then\nback to go Pace then back to easy again\nwe're just getting our body used to\nworking hard towards the end of those\nlong runs really really important I'd\nalso recommend if you can do some of\nyour long runs at the the same time of\nday as your goal race starts so if it's\n8:00 in the morning 8:30 9:00 in the\nmorning have a look when your goal race\nis and do some of your long runs at the\nsame time this gets the body used to\nworking at this time of day and you can\nalso practice your pre-race routine with\nyour breakfast for me as long the CH\nviewers of the channel know that's going\nto be a couple of bagels some peanut\nbutter and jam or jelly for our American\nfriends over the other side of the pond\nand I'm going to have this around about\n2 hours to 990 minutes before the run so\nmy body is nicely fueled ready to go and\nwhen I'm out on the run I'm going to be\npracticing my fueling strategy as well\nwith my gels taking some liquid out\nthere to say nice and hydrated these\nlong runs are a fantastic opportunity\nthe real dress rehearsal for the big day\nyou turn up on the big day there's going\nto be no big surprises in a similar vein\nwe want to be practicing our shoe\nchoices as well on our long runs what's\ngoing to be the most comfortable shoe\nfor the duration of the race that we're\ngoing for are those super lightweight\ncarbon Racing shoes going to be the best\noption will they lead potentially lead\nto some blisters and things like that\nfor me Comfort always wins in these\nthings if you want to get some really\ngood comfortable shoe Choice ideas check\nout this video up here and we'll link to\nit down below another crucial part of\nany half marathon training plan is\ngetting our strength working at least\nonce a week it's especially important\nfor training at these longer distances\nwhere we really need that strength at\nthe back end of a race if you're someone\nthat might have blown up in a race this\ncould be the key to get you that nice\nsolid finish and run strong towards the\nend as a minimum I'd add some strength\ntraining at the end of one of your easy\nruns during the week we've got a\nstrength training add-on that you can\nadd to the half marathon training plans\non the website give you three different\nroutines that you can do at home without\nany equipment at all they all include\nthose basic exercises things like squats\nlunges Bridges and planks as well we'll\nput some other ideas up on the screen\nnow and really try to keep those rest\ndays as fully rest days because that's\nwhen our body is recovering and making\nthose adaptations to become that faster\nstronger Runner that we want so keep\nyour rest as relaxed as you possibly can\nbut add some strength work after an easy\nRunner a little bit later on in the day\nnow you've done all your training race\nday is here and you don't want to go out\nand blow it all within the first 2K as\nunfortunately I've seen so many people\ndoing but not people that subscribe to\nthe Ben Park YouTube channel so whack\nthat subscribe button down below and\nfollow along for lots of great training\ntips for me there's two different ways\nthat you can Pace a half marathon either\nstart a little bit slower than your goal\npace and then speed up as the Run goes\non now this does require a lot of\npatience and control to go out nice and\nrelaxed and just roll into it some of\nour older Runners and I'm getting nearly\nat that sort of stage of my career now\nreally sort of favor this option because\nit does take a little bit longer to get\nwarmed up than it did when you were\nyounger so really good one for some of\nour older Runners out there\nalternatively and what what I usually\ntry and do here is set off simply at my\ngo pace and stick to it with nice even\nsplits throughout the race and then for\nthat last K give it a good kick down at\nthe end now getting this even pacing is\nquite easyish to do if the course is\nnice and flat and level and there's no\nHills in it so do some research on the\ncourse that you're doing how many sharp\nturns are there how many Hills are there\nthings like that there's some nasty\nlittle Hills towards the end of the race\nthat you might need to hold some energy\nback before it's another crucial way of\nrunning that fast off to do that course\npreparation ask some friends about it\nmaybe potentially go and cycle the\ncourse before if it's a local one could\nyou go and run it over a couple of your\nlong runs and just see what it's like\nget a feel for what that course is going\nto be like for me when I'm doing my race\nI simply use lap Pace on my watch and my\nwatch ticks over with every kilometer\nand I'm just looking at that lap pace\nfor just that particular kilometer that\nI'm running in at that moment so if I'm\ntrying to run say uh5 half marathon I'm\njust trying to make sure that's set\nnicely at 330 a k pace as I go on just a\nlittle bit under that sort of gold Pace\nCU some races and GP ches are never that\naccurate so always try and run just a\nlittle bit ahead of my goal pace for\nwhat my watch is saying potentially a\nlot of races there will be Paces as well\nso you can get stuck in to a pacing\ngroup if you're not sure reach out to\nthe race and see if they've got a pacing\ngroup this takes away a lot of that\nextra mental work that you're having to\ngo through to keep nicely on Pace now\nlet's have a chat about Fuel and\nhydration during the race now for me I\nalways recommend taking a gel around\nabout every 30 to 40 minutes during\npretty much any running I'm doing really\nand every half marathon I've done I've\nnormally taken two to three gels with me\nand I take one on the start line and\nI've got two for the race obviously\ndepends how long you going be running\nfor with how many gels you need for some\npeople it be three some people it might\nbe four gels over the course of the race\nnow in terms of hydration it's highly\nlikely they're going to have some stuff\nout on the course that you can get as\nyou go round but of course check how\nmany water stations or maybe energy\ndrink stations they're going to have out\nthere don't try anything new on race day\nis the old average so if you haven't had\nthe energy drink they're giving out if\nyou haven't had the energy gels they're\ngiving out it's probably not a good time\nto test what they're going to be like\nhave a look what gels they're giving out\nif you want to use them get some ordered\nin and test them in your training and\nthen you can use them on the race day\nabsolutely fine I always say to Simply\ndrink to thirst I'm thirsty I get some\nwater down as I go around for me I just\nlike to have a little little and often\nfor a lot of races that I do there only\none every other water station I'm just\ngoing to go in get some down if it's hot\none over the head something like that\njust to keep myself nice and cool don't\nfeel you need to like chug a load of\nbottles and again like a lot of things\ndo what you would normally do in your\ntraining perfect that routine if it is a\nlittle bit hotter out there potentially\nget some electrolytes in before you go\naround as well running a half marathon\nflast out is really really difficult but\nbelieve me it feels amazing when you can\njump and across the line with that big\nsmile on the face knowing you've given\nit your all and you've achieved your K\nif you need some more training on the\nHalf Marathon distance then check out\nthe plans on benp parks.com if you're\ninterested in running a 130 half then\ncheck out this video up here next if you\nwant to see my pre pre-race routine then\ncheck out this video down here keep on\nworking hard guys keep on

      "text": "this is the Nike Pegasus plus the daily\ntraining shoe I have been super excited\nfor I've been testing this all week over\nloads of different types of runs and I'm\nhere to give you my 100% honest thoughts\nbut first before we get stuck into it\nlet's take a little trip down memory\nlane in 2018 Nike came out with one of\nthe best ever shoes in my opinion the\nNike Pegasus turbo which is this one\nhere this is actually my girlfriend shoe\nbut this was one of the first ever Super\nShoe trainers that the world had ever\nseen there was a huge marketing campaign\nbehind it all the influencers had it and\nit really was one of those shoes that\ndefinitely lived up to the height\nthousands of Runners myself included say\nit was one of the very best ever shoes\nout there a year later they stripped it\nall out released version two a even\nlighter weighted version I absolutely\nloved it and then it's fair to say after\nthat Nike went a little bit off the\nrails and they released the turbo next\nnature in 2022 which is really\ndisappointing subpar zoomx Foams all\nthat recycled stuff glued together heavy\nand narrow but now fast forward and Nike\nare back with this the Pegasus Plus or\nmaybe the turbo 4 as they have on the\nbottom bizarrely so will this give me\nthe same spring of my step as the OG did\nor will it be another let down well\nfirstly let's dive into the facts and\nfigures and of course before we start I\nbought the shoe 100% with my own money\nto give you that completely honest 100%\nimpartial review right let's get stuck\ninto the facts and figures so the\npurpose of a shoe like the new Pegasus\nplus is a road running daily trainer\nthis sent me back\n\u00a365 but \u20ac180 we'll put all of the\ndifferent currencies up on the screen\nnow 36 mm stack height and a 10 mm drop\noverall Weight Wise this is coming at\n313 G for me in my UK size 12 so yeah on\nthe lighter side as we go another tick\nthere from Nike we'll talk about all of\nmy likes and dislikes coming up in terms\nof the upper we've got this lovely fly\nknit upper here mids salt we've got\nNike's F length Zoom X foam this is\nNike's premium foam that you get their\nVapor Flies their Alpha flies their\nFillon race shoes nothing recycled no\ncarrier Foams here we got a ful length\nzoomx there's no plate in this shoe the\noutside we've got these two patches of\nthe hban rubber out soole it has a weird\ncutout in the middle I really can't work\nout why they've done this other than to\nsave weight but now you've got some\nexposed zumex mids here which I just\nthink if you're going to be taking this\nshow Offroad in any way on that's going\nto get a bit bashed so this is really a\nroad running shoe only and as I\nmentioned at the start of the video it\nsays Pegasus turbo on the bottom of the\nshoe here and on the top Nike Pegasus\nplus I guess there's just been a little\nbit of misunderstanding between the two\ndepartments at Nike over what they're\ncalling it Nike got a lot of changes\ngoing on in their running department at\nthe moment to try and sort of bring a\nlot of life back into to their running\nshoes so I hope you we see that as we're\nseeing with this Pegasus plus there are\nno different widths available there are\nmen and women's different size available\nand this was pretty much true to size\nfor me if you're a little bit unsure\nmaybe go half a size down I got this in\nmy UK size 12 they were just maybe a\nvery tiny little bit too big I had 12 in\nversion one 11 and 1/2 in version 2 and\nI think I really if I was going to get\nanother one I would get an 11 and a half\nin this half a size down but it was\nreally okay if you're on the fence go\nhalf a size down right let's have a\nquick chat about the Pegasus 41 and the\nPegasus plus so the Pegasus 41 has\nNike's react X foone this is a little\nbit more on the heavy side 347 G versus\n313 G in the plus version these are also\n35 more expensive the Pegasus \u00a341 \u00a3130\nthe sizing may be very very slightly\ndifferent these were really good true to\nsize to me as I said maybe half a size\ndown would have be better for the in\nthese ones also the Pegasus 41 has the\nAir Zoom pods up at the front here\nadding that little bit of extra\npropulsion they've gone from the plus\nversion to make it a lot lighter and the\nNike X foam is far more responsive the\nplus version of the shoe is just a more\npremium option it's lighter weight it's\ngot better foam more responsive foam it\njust feels better quality but the 41 is\nstill an okay daily shoe as it goes\nwe'll link to the review up here and\ndown in the comments as well they are\nmuch better all around sort of daily\ntraining shoe definitely in the Pegasus\nplus but let's chat about all of my\nlikes and then we'll chat about the\ndislikes afterwards my first one being\nthis is just a great daily shoe it's\nsuper versatile it's handled everything\nI've thrown at it it's that perfect\nbalance between the Invincible and the\nstreak fly the Invincible being that\nvery plush that very chunky Sho perfect\nfor your easy runs and Recovery runs the\nstreet fly being that very lightweight\nshoe perfect for Speed workor and this\njust sits so nicely in between a shoe\nthat can do speed work easy Pace work\nTempo and also recovery runs pretty well\nmy second like is this is a really fun\nfoam we've been big fans of the zoom X\nfoam here on the channel for many many\nyears and it's a really good option for\nsomeone that wants to get out their runs\nbut doesn't want a plate in their shoe\nso maybe if you are a super blast fan\nfor example you don't like running with\na plate in your shoe all the time this\nis going to really bring that fun factor\ninto your running there's so many high\nstack height shoes out there at the\nmoment this is a fun lower stack height\noption for people that want a little bit\nmore ground feel with their running more\nof a traditional feeling very very\nsimilar to how the OG Nike Pegasus turbo\nwas when that was released when picking\nup the speed it's got some really good\nlevel of responsiveness and it's got no\nproblem maintaining that speed as well I\ndid a very long run session in the shoe\nwhich is some of the footage you can see\nfrom the screen now this is me running\nat about 340 a pace just cruising along\nat some 10 minute reps here felt super\ncomfortable throughout the whole rep and\nit's also really nice to get a little\nbit more ground feeling in your running\nshoe rotation to help with that Pro\nreception my third like with this shoe\nis just a great looking shoe it feels\ngreat on the feet it just brings a good\nsmile to your face you look down you see\nthe stripe going down the bottom of the\nshoe and I know it doesn't make any\ndifference but anyway let me know what\nyou think of all the different colorways\nwhat colorway option would you like I\nreally like the flare at the back here\nthe way it sort of tap is off because\nthe everybody was having issues with the\nfirst two shoes with the way it would\nsplit at the back here so yeah this is\nwhat they had on the nature version kind\nof Turbo version 3 and I really like how\nthat sort of flared at the back just a\ngood all around good looking shoe and my\nfinal like here is the breathable upper\nand which really gives a really good\nsolid lock down there's no gusseted\ntongue here but it's held in place by\nthe laces absolutely fine all around\ngood Comfort pretty good width on the\nshoe here it's a shame there aren't some\nwider width options available but Nike\naren't really one for doing that type of\nthing that some of other brands like\nBrooks and hoker are really good with\nbut unless you've got a seriously wide\nfoot you're going to be absolutely fine\nin the shoe right let's have a chat\nabout the dislikes now the first thing\nI'm just going to say here this could be\na positive could be a negative it really\ndepends what sort of Camp you're in so\nagain let me know down in the comments\nit is certainly a little bit firmer than\nyou would expect for say like a 2024\nrelease of shoe but it is certainly a\nvery similar feeling to the original\nshoe me sort of thinking back all of\nthose years ago and everybody holds this\nshoe in such high esteem one of the best\never shoes of all time and it's true\nlots of shoes have moved on technolog\nhas moved on Foams have moved on plates\nhave moved on the world is a very\ndifferent place as it now as it was in\nsort of 2018 2019 a couple of years ago\nI actually bought some turbo on EB I was\nsurprised just how different they were\nfrom the shoes I was running in the\ncurrent times so yes this is a really\nsort of true feel to the original shoe\nit's hard to say whether that's a\npositive or negative for some people\nlooking for a firmer lower stack ride\nit's really great and you will really\nlove this and I personally really do\nlike it but please don't think Nike\nrevolutionized this shoe to expect a\nsuper super super responsive very high\nplush shoe something like the super\nblast or sort of a very plush soft Ride\nLike the rebel version 4 it's not like\nthat it's got this really good section\nof the market and I'm really pleased\nNike kept true to those original\nfeelings with the shoe with the pricing\nit's a really difficult one what do you\nthink \u00a3165 for this shoe plenty of\npeople saying it's overpriced it's\nactually the same price as version one\nand version two which when you count for\ninflation over all these years would\nmake this significantly cheaper now in\nmy opinion in the current range of shoe\nit's probably around about \u00a310 too\nexpensive it puts it into the realm of\nall sort of the lower end plated shoes\nout there and some more responsive\nphones with without a doubt the trouble\nis this shoe isn't meant to be competing\nwith them but because it puts it into\nthat sort of price bracket you draw into\nthose natural comparisons so yeah maybe\na little bit on the expensive side and\nthen thirdly there's just potential for\na bit of big toe irritation here with\nthe line down the front of the shoe some\npeople are getting a little bit of\nirritation because the the height of the\ntoe box isn't great it certainly hasn't\naffected me of all if you got a really\nbig chunky toe then maybe this is going\nto be one to avoid because the toe box\ndoes sort of taper a little bit more\nmore aggressively than some other shoes\ndown to the front of the Shoe Right\nconclusions and final thoughts so should\nyou go out and buy this shoe well for me\nyes I've really enjoyed it I'm glad I\nspent \u00a365 on this shoe if you're looking\nfor a shoe with that lower stack height\nbit more ground feel to do your daily\nruns in I would say going up to only\nabout half marathon distance I wouldn't\nwant to be doing my super long marathon\ntraining runs in the shoe in 2024 we do\njust have some better options out there\nsuch as the super us be doing those very\nlonger runs I'm just going to want a\nlittle bit more stack height to look\nafter my legs just take advantage of all\nthe tech in these days but if you want\nto get some speed work in then give it a\ngo if you're a fan of the original\nPegasus turbo I really think you will\nlike this shoe is it worth \u00a335 over the\nstandard Pegasus well yes I really do\nthink so if you've got the budget to\nspend an extra 35 then I really\nrecommend going for this shoe it's just\na much more capable lightweight fun\ndaily shoe the next video is coming up\nwe've got the whole Nike lineup video up\nhere if you want me to sit here and\nexplain what each shoe is good for we've\ngot the best value shoes down here if\nyou want some really good value for\nmoney hope you enjoyed the video guys\nlet me know your thoughts on the Nike\nPegasus plus down in the comments and\nI'm off to get some more miles in this\nbecause it's definitely staying in my\nrotation that's it guys keep on working\nhard keep on we'll see you very soon in\nthe next one",

      "text": "is it possible to run faster with less\neffort well yes it's something Elite and\npro level Runners have mastered and the\ngood news is that you can as well so\nwhat's their secret how can we run\nsmoother faster run longer and make our\nruns just overall feel a lot easier but\nstick around because we've got all that\ncoming up and by the end of this video\nyou'll know exactly what you should be\ndoing the first thing we can be working\non is improving our running form if we\ncan improve our running form and move\nmore efficiently we'll get from point A\nto point B using a lot less energy more\nadvanced Runners often look so relaxed\nas if they're just gliding along so how\nhave they worked at achieving this well\nI've got five ways here that will really\nhelp you the first one being is\nimproving our Cadence now running with a\nhigher Cadence will really reduce the\namount of force coming up through your\nlegs beginner Runners are usually\nrunning around about 150 to 160 and will\ngreatly benefit from inred inreasing\ntheir Cadence a little bit more up to\nthe 170s 180s sort of Mark the simplest\nway of starting out on your Cadence\njourney is by using a metronome you can\nthen set the Cadence you want and it\nwill Tap Away in the background as you\nrun along and you can time your strides\nmonitor it and then have a look after\nyou're on as well on Garmin or on choros\nagain whichever app you're using and\nthen you can monitor that over time and\ngradually start to increase it don't go\nfrom big chunks just gradually work at\nincreasing it we've got a video all\nabout how how to improve your cence I'll\nlink to that up here and at the end of\nthe video and down below we will also\nwant to be improving our body position\nand leaning from the ankles a forward\nlean is how advanced runners use gravity\nto help propel them forwards the best\nway you can practice doing this is by\nstopping your runs and then just leaning\ninto it in my early days of running I\nused to do this all the time just for\nthe first like 500 me of a run just\nconstantly stopping and starting just\nleaning forward and starting running\nlike that your body will naturally go\ninto that nice forward lean and then you\ncan just relax stop and do it again and\njust repeating this all the time will\nreally help you don't to do this on all\nof your runs but maybe just a couple of\nyour easy runs throughout the week just\nto practice also we want to really be\nworking on our core muscles doing things\nlike Bridges and planks will help build\nthat strong core that we need to support\nall of our upper body as it rotates and\nit keeps our arm strings in check\nbecause all of this if you haven't got a\nstrong core all this going on is just\nwasted energy we also want to make sure\nour feet are landing nicely underneath\nour Center of mass the foot strike\ndoesn't matter as much a midfoot strike\nheel strike 4ft strike is not as\nimportant what is important is making\nsure it lands nicely underneath our\nCenter of mass this will be the best\nplace for our body to efficiently absorb\nthe impact and to maximize that energy\nreturn to Spring Forward quite often\npeople will overstride and overreach\nyou're just constantly creating that\nbreaking force every time you run which\nis just a complete waste of energy you\ndon't be applying the brakes bring that\nback and we'll be able to move across\nthe ground in a far far more efficient\nway I've got two other simple things we\ncan doing to improve our form the first\none is strides long-term viewers of the\nchannel know I talk about this all the\ntime they're absolutely fantastic quite\nsimply 20 seconds of really fast running\n90 to 95% effort here with about a 20 to\n30 second very relaxed chilled recovery\nbetween each stride I'd really recommend\nfour to six strides put these maybe\nafter one of your easy runs during the\nweek you can even do them during one of\nyour easy runs as well it's very hard to\nrun this fast with bad running forms it\nreally helps train the brain to get\nourselves moving in a far more efficient\nway the final one being Hill reps now\nhear me out cuz Hill reps are really\nreally good yes of course they're hard\nwork but they really help promote a\nreally good foot placement again nicely\nunder that Center of mass and really\nhelps improve our strength as well they\nget you really strong and moving in a\nnice way strength training something\nI've personally been doing a hell of a\nlot this year and I'm really starting to\nsee the massive benefits in my own\nrunning as well the stronger that our\nmuscles are the more Force we can put\nthrough them and therefore run further\nwithout tiring out quite as quickly now\nthis doesn't have to mean lifting huge\nweights it can simply be doing some\nbasic exercises at home without the need\nfor any equipment just things like doing\nsome squat lunges calf raises all really\ngood for that leg strength and then\nthings like planks and bridges as well\nwill really help to improve our core\nwhich as we talked about earlier really\ngood for supporting that upper body so\nI'd recommend picking a few of these\ndifferent exercises and putting together\na little circuit for around about 20\nminutes is a really good starting point\nfour exercises 1 minute for each\nexercise four to five rounds of this\nwith just a minute rest between each\nround I'd always recommend tagging these\nonto your easy run days and make sure\nyou keep your rest days as complete rest\nthat's when our body's adapting\nabsorbing everything we're throwing\nabout it so you need to keep your rest\ndays as rest days add the strength work\nto those easy run days we also do have a\nstrength guide which integrates into all\nof our training plans which you can see\non our website whatever distance you're\ntraining for check out benp parks.com\nand add on that strength training option\nif you want a complete guide on how to\nintegrate this with your training\nthirdly is all about improving our\nrunning Fitness and this may seem like a\nreally obvious one the fitter we get the\nfaster we'll get running at the same\nsort of effort level but how do we work\nat improving our running Fitness well\nquite simply this is by doing some speed\nsessions during the week couple of\nreally good ones 4 to 6times 3 minutes\nat around about our 5K Pace with a\n2minute walking recovery 3 to four reps\nof 5 minutes around about our 10K Pace\nwith a 2-minute walk recovery or perhaps\ntry a pyramid session is 1 2 3 4 3 2 1\nthese numbers represent minutes of\nrunning fast around about our 5 to 10K\npace for these with a 90c walking\nrecovery between the Reps now doing\nsessions like this will really help\nimprove that V2 Max improve our running\nFitness overall but it also does add a\nlot of stress to the body so it's really\nimportant for the rest of the week to be\ndoing a lot of our easy miles and at\nleast making sure we're having one maybe\ntwo full rest days during the week now\nwarming up before you head out on your\nrun is so important especially as we get\na little bit older and another way to\ndefinitely make those early stages of\nthat run feel a hell of a lot easier so\nmake sure you're taking that 5 to 10\nminutes to warm up properly before\nyou're heading out the door mobilizing\nour joints with some dynamic stretches\nwe've got a really good follow along\nvideo I'll link to that up here and down\nbelow as well and then easing into that\nrun really nice and gradually that first\ncouple of Cs should be nice and relax a\nlot slower than what we want to be doing\nfor our whole run and once you're up to\nspeed you'll feel far more relaxed and\nusing a lot less effort another thing\nthat can make running feel really hard\nis when you haven't fueled or hydrated\nproperly beforehand now a lot of people\nwhen they start out running either eat\nfar too much just before they head out\nand they're going to feel very sluggish\nand slow or they don't have enough and\nthen they're going to feel very sort of\nweak and risk the chance of getting\ndehydrated so I'd really recommend is\nhaving a small snack or something around\nabout 30 minutes to 1 hour before\nheading out and also avoiding the\nhottest parts of the day as well you can\nbe running at exactly the the same Pace\nthat you'd used be running at but your\nbody is going to be having to put a lot\nmore effort into keeping you at the pace\nthat you want to be running at so make\nsure you're heading out in the mornings\nor in the evenings make sure you're\ngetting nicely hydrated with some good\nfuel on board before you head out as\nwell and then you'll be using a lot less\neffort running at the pace you want to\nbe running at now I wasn't sure whether\nto put this one in the video so let me\nknow your thoughts down below all about\nSuper Shoes these carbon plated Super\nShoes that burst on the scene around\nabout sort of 6 seven years ago and now\npretty much every Pro so many amateur\nRunners are going out and spending vast\namounts of money on these shoes in the\nhope that they can be using less energy\nto run from point A to point B in all\nthese shoes they have these carbon\nplates that run throughout the whole\nlength of the shoe or some of them they\nhave Nyon plates and these plates help\nto propel us forward with each stride\nand then they have this huge chunk of\nfoam in there as well to help protect\nthe legs from that impact so our muscles\nwill be fatiguing a little bit L Nike's\nfamous 4% shoes I had my orange ones\nI'll put those up on the screen now\nclaim to improve Times by as much as\nthat 4% so for a 4-Hour marathoner they\ncan be looking at a 10minute Improvement\ngoing to 3our 50 so why wouldn't you\nwant that free speed will you\nautomatically just run faster by just\nputting on a pair of these shoes well it\nall depends in reality a lot of these\nbenefits are far more prominent in\nFaster runners in a lot of the studies\nthey Define faster Runners by any anyone\nrunning 4 hours or less for the marathon\nbut anyone can see these small\nimprovements by wearing a super shoe\ncompared to their regular shoe without a\ndoubt so why wouldn't we go about\nwearing a super shoe every day well they\ndo have their downsizes they're very\nvery expensive for a start they're\nuncomfortable they tend to not last very\nlong and they're also not very versatile\nthey really are only good at races and\nduring our speed sessions as well and\nthe body can come a little bit too\nreliant on technology and we can\nactually lose strength or not gain as\nmuch strength as we could by running in\nsome more regular shoes we'll link to an\ninteresting article down below about why\ndoing all of your runs in Super Shoes\nreally is not the best idea but without\na doubt for the vast majority of people\ndoing our races in these new fangled\nSuper Shoes amazing things you've got\nthe cash to do it and you can afford to\ndo it they are going to make a\ndifference to our running time by\nliterally doing as this video says\nmoving from point A to point B using\nless energy let me know down in the\ncomments have super shoes made a big\ndifference to you I'd love to know but\nwith all of this for me the biggest\nimprovements can be made by correcting\nour running form which is where I'd\npersonally recommend that you spend a\nlot of our efforts that is going to give\nyou some really good longterm gains in\nrunning hopefully also decrease that\nchance of picking up injuries as well so\nlet me know how you get on with all of\nthese tips if you've got some other ones\nlet me know down in the comments and\nhelp out the running Community got two\ndifferent videos coming up next one all\nabout improving our Cadence and one all\nabout mental tricks to help you get out\nthere and run a little bit longer as\nwell so check those out keep on working\nhard guys keep done we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

      "text": "the 10K is a great distance for many\nRunners it's long enough to provide a\nserious challenge but short enough that\nthe training isn't going to completely\ntake over your life running a 10K at Max\neffort is seriously tough but if you\nexecute it well it really is one of the\nbest feelings ever crossing the line\nearning yourself that new PV after\nwatching this video I know that's what\nyou're going to be doing because today\nI'm showing my best top tips on how to\nrun that 10K PV we're going to go\nthrough all the training that you need\nto do the sessions that help me run at\n3245 and some bonus race tactics as well\nso stay tuned for those so how long\nshould you give yourself to train for\nthe 10K well ideally we're talking\naround about 10 weeks that's exactly how\nlong our training plans are that we have\non benp parks.com so check those out on\nthe link down below and this will allow\nfor a proper build and then a short\ntaper before race day you can make some\nreally good improvements in the 6 to 8\nweeks if that's what you've got but\nideally we're talking about 10 the next\nthing you want to do is figure out where\nor when you're going to be racing your\n10K and then work backwards those 10\nweeks to get to your starting point make\nsure that when you're searching for that\nflat and fast course also find one where\nthere's not too many turns that you've\ngot to slow down for during the race as\nwell if you're not interested in getting\nan official 10K time you just want to\nrun a fast 10K in your local area again\nsearch out for some parks search out for\nsome traffic free routs anywhere where\nyou're not going to get interrupted\nbecause we can't stop during the 10K it\nhas to be 10K of continuous running\nwe'll list a few race organizers that we\nlike to use down below yes they're all\nin the UK let us know down in the\ncomments where are the fastest 10k\nroutes for you maybe put your location\nand where they are help out the\ncommunity Down Below in the comments\nright so what's a realistic time to aim\nfor with where we're at well of course\nthis will vary wildly from person to\nperson newer Runners are often able to\nmake some more significant improvements\nin those early stages whereas more\nexperienced Runners are likely to be\nalready a little bit closer to their the\nImprovement isn't going to be quite as\nmuch but as a Rough Guide what can you\ndo well if you're someone tracing a sub\n60 you want to be around about in 1 hour\n10 shape or comfortable doing a sub 35k\nsub 50 we're talking around about sub 55\nminute shape already around about 25\nminutes for the 5K sub 45 you want to be\nrunning around about sub 49 already and\nsub 2230 for the 5K and if you want to\nget that sub 40 you want to be running\naround about 43 minutes before we start\nthe training or be comfortable running a\nsub 20 minute 5K now what does weekly\nmileage look like for doing this\ntraining how many times are we going to\nget out there how many miles we need to\nbe running well for a sub 60 we're\ntalking about 3 to four runs a week up\nto around about 22 miles or 35k for a\nsub 50 we're talking four to five runs a\nweek up to about 35 miles in those Peak\nweeks 56k per week sub 45 get a little\nbit faster now got a little bit more\ntraining to do about four to five runs a\nweek up to around about 40 miles 64k in\nthat peak week and then finally sub 40\nminutes we're talking 5 to six runs a\nweek up to around about 45 miles or 72k\none of the most important parts of\ntraining for a fast 10K is getting those\nweekly speed sessions those intensity\nsessions those reps those intervals into\nour training we need to get the body\nused to running at or even faster than\nour goal pce and a great way of doing\nthis is through these interval sessions\nnow we'd recommend setting aside at\nleast one day a week for your speed\nsession day traditionally this is\nnormally on a Tuesday but it's whenever\nit falls for you quite frankly and then\nmore experienced Runners probably would\nto be putting a second speed session\ninto their training but we'll touch on\nthat a little bit later on now these\nworkouts involve running at a hard\neffort for a particular time or distance\nfollowed by a period of rest to recover\nso get the heart rate up and then\nrecover get it down heart rate up and\nthen down and these interval sessions\nare what really help boost that V2 Max\nour fitness to be able to compete at the\n10K distance running really really fast\nso here's some example sessions that you\ncan try when you're next out there of\ncourse with all these runs you want to\nstart out by 10 to 15 minutes very light\njogging to get the body nice and warmed\nup maybe do some drills proper warm-up\nroutine to get the body ready to be\nrunning fast now the first session I'd\nrecommend trying out is 10x 400 m we\nwill be running these 400 m at our 5K\ncurrent pace and between these reps\nwe're going to be taking a 90c walking\nrecovery really good one to do on a\ntrack if you have that available to you\nbut don't worry if you don't just\ngetting it done in the local park will\nbe fine second session I'd recommend 6x4\nminutes at round about our 10K goal Pace\nthe pace we going to be running that\nrace at at the end of our training\nbetween these reps we're taking a\n2minute walking recovery and then\nfinally my favorite session for 10K\nrunning is what I call kick down KS\nthey're basically K reps we're doing the\nfirst 800 M of these at our gold 10K\npace and then the final 200 M of that K\nrep at our 5K pace and then taking a\n2minute recovery between this if you're\ntrading for a sub 60 do four reps of\nthis sub 50 five reps sub 40 we're\ntalking about six reps here so nice and\nsteady fast finish for the rep and then\na 2minute recovery really is the best of\nboth worlds with this one a little bit\nmore fun and interesting and gets used\nto increasing the effort towards the end\nof the rep which is what we need to be\ndoing when we're running that 10K now\nyour local running club might well put\non a weekly speed session maybe that's\nsomething you can check out speak to\nthem if you're not remember of running\nclub we always recommend joining making\nsome new friends in your local running\nCommunity as I said at the start you\ndon't have to be doing things on a\nrunning track if you don't feel\ncomfortable you don't want to there's\nnot one near you just getting somewhere\nnice traffic free local parks local\ncycle paths canal toe paths whatever\nyou've got available near you where you\ncan run uninterrupted that's the best\nthing quickly guys you find this vide\nwell please smash that like button share\nwith a friend that wants to run a faster\n10K and let us know down in the comments\nwhat your 10K PB is and where you'd like\nto get it to as well if you got time\nplease check out my website benp\nparks.com we've got amazing running hats\ntechnical gear casual gear to power you\nthrough those training miles and get it\ndone in races as well right back to the\n10K tips now most GPS watches I don't\ntend to wear one day today but I do find\nrunning and I normally like to program\nmy workouts into my watch and then I\nfollow it along as they go Garmin choros\nwhatever it is I recommend putting these\nworkouts into your watch one less thing\nto think about when you're out there\ngetting your runs done now as I touched\non before if you are more experienced\nRunner maybe you're looking to train for\naround about a sub 45 sub 401K run here\nyou may want to include a second speed\nsession during the week if you're in\nthis Camp focus on that first speed\nsession on the Tuesday maybe doing some\nshorter reps the 10x 400 something like\nthat then the second session maybe\nThursday Friday something like that\nwe're going to be doing some longer reps\nso maybe some reps here some mile reps\nor maybe even a 20 minute tempo run\nlater in the week on that Thursday or\nFriday this will just help to push that\nFitness up even more you're a bit more\nof an experience running you've got some\ngood leg strength already you're used to\ndoing some higher mileage weeks so\nthat's when we can start to really push\nour fitness forward by doing this second\nsession during the week another key part\nof this and so many people ignore this\nso please don't but look at getting some\nstrides into your weekly routine at\nleast once a week we want to be doing\nsome strides now it's really easy to\nincorporate this you can do this after\nan easy run as part of your warmup\nbefore you go and do a session but\nbasically these are 20 seconds running\naround about 90% effort so really really\nfast High Cadence High turnover and as I\nsay maybe do these before your session\nas part of your warmup or at the end of\nan easy run if you're you new to strides\nstart out with maybe four reps\nintermediate five reps more advanced six\nreps and then just take around 20 to 30\nsecond walk between each one really\nimportant when you're going through\nthese focus on good form staying in\ncontrol then just a gradual acceleration\nup these are really good way to recruit\nsome more fast twitch muscle fibers when\nyou need that Sprint finish at the end\nof that 10K and they also help building\nsome strength and improve our running\neconomy as well the more efficiently we\ncan get to point A to point B the less\nenergy we will use during that 10K and\nthe faster we can run it's really quite\ndifficult to run with bad form when\nyou're going that all out pace so it\nreally helps unlock some free speed so\ndefinitely get those strides into your\nweekly routine another key aspect of our\nrunning week is getting those long runs\nand those easy runs here this is when\nwe're really going to build that\nendurance build that engine that we need\nto be running at a very fast pace for 40\n45 50 60 minutes or so it's going to\nrequire a big effort and we need to\nbuild that endurance the speed sessions\nreally put a lot of stress on the body\nwe need time to let that recovery set in\nto adapt so the rest of the week outside\nthe speed sessions we need to keep this\na nice low intensity if every day was a\nspeed session we would get injured very\nvery quickly so we need to get a good\nmix of Paces throughout the week now for\nyour long runs I'd say if you're someone\ntraining for a sub 60 looking around\nabout 5 to 8 Miles for your long run sub\n50 we're talking about 7 to 10 miles for\nthe long run sub 40 we're talking about\n9 to 12 miles for the long run in terms\nof the pace for these long runs we want\nto be keep them nice and relax nice and\nconversational easy Pace zone two kind\nof pace you can chat to a friend at\nthat's a rough guide will put some\nrecommended Paces for that sub40 sub 50\nsub 60 recommended Paces for our easy\nand our longer runs up on the screen now\nright the fun is here it's race day\nwe're ready to go how are we going to go\nabout attacking this 10K to get your\nyour PB with all racing we want to avoid\ngoing too fast and blowing up this is\nwhat so many inexperienced Runners do\nthey go out feeling all good and by\nhalfway they're absolutely gassed and\nthey're walking it in I've done it many\ntimes myself when I was learning but\nI've learned the proper way of pacing\nraces now and that's what we're going to\ngo through what a lot of people like to\ndo is start out slightly easier than\ngold Pace then move to Gold pace and\nthen move ahead of gold pace so averaged\noverall is your gold Pace but you start\nout nice and relax and just build into\nit gradually and then that fast finish\nto get your time now what I prefer to do\nis aim for even pacing throughout and\nthen that final K just give it\neverything I've got throw the kitchen\nsink at it for that final K there's not\none way that's right or one way that's\nwrong there's definitely one way that's\nwrong is going out too fast and then\ntailing off at the end going through a\nslow sorry death because that never\nresults in a fast time now if there are\nsome Pacers in your event then it can be\na really good idea to stick with them as\nthis really does take away a lot of the\nguess work and that hard work if you're\nnot sure about your watch you just want\nto rely on someone else stick in the\npacing group if they're offering it now\nwith regards to fueling and hydration\nit's a little bit harder with 10K\nsomething like it some people don't I\nsay definitely make sure you're nice and\nhydrated maybe have a gel on the start\nline before you go off and then for me\nif it's a hot day I'm going to be taking\na couple of Cups going around just\nsipping drink to thirst there's no need\nto chug a load of liquids down as we go\ngel's little bit more of a personal\npreference here some Runners will really\nlike something around about that 30\nminute Mark to really help sort of spur\nthem through in that back end of the\nrace other people will just go all the\nway through without needing anything\nremember the gold W here don't try\nanything new on race day use what you\npractice in training another top tip I\nlike to say is use your lap Pace on your\nwatch rather than the overall pace for\nthe whole event if you've got Auto laps\nturned on these are going to be going\noff every mile or every kilometer it's\njust going to be telling you the pace of\nthat mile or that K that you're in\nthat's all I like to look at and I just\nmake sure I'm running the right pace for\nthat particular K this sort of takes\naway the errors with some potential GPS\nissues over the course of the whole run\njust focus on that moment focus on what\nyou're doing right here right now just\nmaking sure you're running at that right\npace now running a 10K flat out is\nreally hard I think it's one of\npotentially the hardest distances but it\nfeels so good when you cross that finish\nline and get it done now if you do need\na little bit more guidance on training\nthen check out our 10K plans we'll link\nto them all down below all the beginner\nplans are completely free to download\nand if you're interested in running that\nsub 40 minute 10K then check out this\nvideo up here next so that's it guys\nkeep on working hard keep on it done let\nme know when you're next running a 10K\nwhat time you're hoping for what your PP\nis that's it we'll see you very soon in\nand good luck was

      "text": "a hybrid shoe or road to Trail shoe is a\ncross between a road shoe and a trail\nshoe something that is cushioned to\nsupport you when you're pounding the\nPavements but also grippy enough to keep\nyou upright when you're going along at\nsome more challenging terrain shoes like\nthis are super popular with Runners at\nthis time of year who want to dip their\ntoe into the trail world and don't want\nto fully commit to a trail shoe just yet\nplus they're really great winter option\nwhen you could be running on a lot of\nwet and slippery roads and can do with\nsome increased traction that shoes like\nthis offer so today I've gathered\ntogether my three top Road trail shoes\none from Nike one from Hoka and one from\nSalamon we're going to be putting\nthrough a full test going through all my\nlikes my dislikes of each one and see\nwhich one of these comes out on top all\nof these shoes here on test today are\nall neutral shoes and all hybrid and\nrotor trail shoes are not going to be\nperfect in really deep wet winter muddy\nboggy conditions or super technical\nTrails running through the mountains\nequally you're don't going to be sing\nany 5k PBS and shoes like this they're\nthe best of both WS pretty good on the\nroad and pretty good on the trail and\nperfect for this time of year as always\nI bought all three of these shoes 100%\nwith my money to give you that\ncompletely unbiased 100% honest review\nso you can get the right shoes on your\nfeet right starting out the first one\nwe've got here is the Nike Trail 5 this\nsent me back\n\u00a3130 here in the UK stack height at the\nback 38 mm we're in a drop overall of 9\n1/2 mm Weight Wise this came in at 344\nBrowns and my UK size 12 midsole we've\ngot Nike's all new react X which is\nexactly the same midsole as you see in\nthe Nike Pegasus version 41 we'll link\nto that video up here if you're looking\nfor a new road shoe potentially in terms\nof the outsole we've got some 3.2 mm lug\nand we've got Nike's own allterrain\ncompound here as well there is\nunfortunately no wide option in the shoe\nalthough the width is good but there is\na waterproof version a gortex version\nhere and it was true to size for me\nright let's get stuck into my likes\nfirst things first as I just alluded to\nit's a nice wide toe box here lots of\nroom in the standard shoe Unfortunately\nthey haven't got a wide option but they\ndon't really need one because the stand\none has got loads of room for a good\nfootplay if you thought version 4 was a\nlittle bit on the narrow side this is\ndefinitely improved in version 5 and it\nis also supremely comfortable one of the\nmost comfortable trail shoes I've ever\nrun in the Nike react X foam just works\nso well on this type of tril and it's\njust so nice through the foot strike\nreally nice and responsive as well the\nupper here gives a really good lockdown\nwith no slipping at all no blisters no\nhot spots this shoe is just all about\nComfort on the trails really like the\nNike Flywire lacing system here and when\nyou're on some more challenging terrain\noff-road jumping over some logs and\nthings like that it just holds the foot\nin place really really well and the\nankle collar as well something to really\npoint out really gives a good confident\nfeel no slipping or rubbing or anything\nlike that good sort of toe bumper at the\nend here just to protect your feet at\nthe front of the shoe as I mentioned the\nreact X mids is a big step up from just\nNike's standard react phone which they\nused previously and it just feels really\ngood on road and off-road and if you\nreally want to pick up the speed put in\na little bit of extra effort up those\nHills or towards the end of the race\nthen it really does that well it now\nfeels just much more responsive than the\noutgo model just much better energy\nreturn and it just looks good casually\nafter run a really good looking shoe\ndidn't really like this sort of pull tab\non the back it just looks a bit flimsy\nso that brings me on to my dislikes\nfirst one the grip is fine for wet roads\nlight Trail but you're going to struggle\non wet rocks or anything like that yeah\nit's difficult with these shoes they're\nnot really designed for that I'd love to\nsee the vibr out sole on the Pegasus\nrange that they put onto the zigama that\nwould be a bit of a dream but yeah the\ntraction's okay it's fine for what we're\ndoing testing on this type of service\nbut in some rocky areas you are going to\nbe able to feel the stone sort of coming\nthrough slightly there's no Rock plate\nor any sort of plate in the shoe to\nprotect you from that all in all the\nPegasus Trail 5 is just a really good\noption for those nontechnical Trails\nthose fire roads those single tracks and\nCity running to and it will really work\nwell for anyone that's going on some\nhiking walking long distances right\nlet's move on to the next one in from\nhoker the Challenger 7 quickly guys if\nyou are funing the videos so please\nsmash that like button and please check\nout my website BP parks.com we've got\nRoad plans Trail plans loads of\nfive-star rated plans the best running\nhats in the business and Technical gear\nto keep you powering it through as\nyou're getting it done thanks very much\nguys right back to the video I've really\nenjoyed running in the Challenger 7 or\nATR senser all terrain I think I really\nlike this colorway let me know what you\nthink about this my girlfriend hates\nthis colorway but I just think it's got\nsome really cool 80s retro Vibes anyway\nthis sent me back\n\u00a3130 here in the UK stack card at the\nback 31 mil which is a slight increase\non the outgo model which was 29 and a 5\nmm drop hit overall Weight Wise just\nover 300 G for me in my UK size 12 306 a\nslight weight decrease come on we love\nthat versus the outgoing version six the\nmidso with got the updated compression\nmolded EVA foam here we've got the\ndurasan rubber outs soole 4 mm lugs here\na little bit longer than the Nikes ones\nand it also does come in a wide option\nshould you spec that as well which you\ndo need because this shoe is a little\nbit on the narrow side there's also a\nwaterproof GTX gortex version and\nfinally this was true to size for me\nright let's get stuck into the likes\nstarting out you really got to think of\nthe shoe as the Clifton of the trail\nWorld it feels exactly like a Clifton on\nthe road just with that little bit of\nextra rip that extra outso which you can\nfeel that's the only slight sort of\ndifference but it's got a really good\nroad feel and when you want to pick up\nthe pace on the road or the trail with\nthe lightweight nature of this shoe and\nthat big chunk of hokus midsole here\nit's just a perfect shoe for those long\nruns and whenever I've been out for\nextending period of time just had no\nheating up issues at all really nice\nankle flare at the back I have been\nhaving a few little Achilles issues but\nthis has been an absolute joy to running\nno agitation there there's a lot of\nCushing here to look after your legs\nit's certainly one that's definitely on\nthe softer side hok's really squishy\nsoft foam some people will really like\nthat kind of ride and a stable ride as\nwell and then finally the updated\nengineered mesh upper feels really\ndurable to me haven't had any issues\nwith that so far a few little dislikes\nto go through I'd love to see a bit more\ntoe protection at the front a little bit\nof a toe bumper just to stop yourself\nstubbing roots and bigger rocks and\nthings like that but it's just not the\nmost Nimble it's a little bit big a\nlittle bit clumpy but that's just sort\nof the classic hoker feeling and the\nstandard version is definitely on the\nnarrow side so if you have got a wider\nfoot definitely go for the wider option\nhere but no all around fantastic shoe\nperfect for getting those road miles in\nand those Trail Mars as well and finally\ntoday we have the Salamon sens ride\nversion 5 one of the first Salamon shoes\nI've actually reviewed on the channel\nand hopefully it won't be the last\nbecause again I've enjoyed the shoe\nthese are all really good shoes for chel\nout here today now this sent me back\n\u00a3130 stack out at the back not\n12929 mm and an 8 mm drop overall Weight\nWise 346 R for me in my UK size 12 the\nmids soole here we've got some energy\nfoam midsole which is an Eva blend from\nSalamon and the Contra grip rubber out\nsoole lug depth 3 and 1/2 mm all these\nshoes very very similar to that there's\nno wide option here but there is a\nwaterproof option that you can expect\nand this wasn't true to size for me I\ndid get this in my UK size 12 but just\nfound it a little bit small so I would\nsay go half a size up because this this\nshoot is definitely on the narrow side\nright let's start out with my lights it\nhas salamon's famous quick lacing system\nhere you just pull it up lock and then\ntuck it away there and you're good to go\nit never came loose on any of my runs I\nnever had to adjust it it's what you\nneed when you head out on the trails you\ndon't be stopping adjusting your laces\nit just cinches right and it gives a\nreally nice lock down throughout the\nwhole foot it just hugs the foot really\nreally nicely with that fantastic lock\ndown you've got some really good grip on\nthe shoe here this is the best grip out\nof the lot of the grip at the back going\nup and down Hills has been really\nfantastic you're really not going to get\nmuch slip here unless you're getting\nsome deep mud but this shoe grips\nfantastically in any sort of spring\nsummer or Autumn type conditions and\nthen not everyone will like this but\nsome people really will is that this\nshoe is definitely on the firm side\nyou've got a lot of ground feel coming\nthrough this very very similar to\nsomething like The New Normal KAG and as\nwe know Killian was a Salomon athlete\nbefore he set up the whole new normal\nshoe brand everything and the feeling is\nvery very between those shoes it's\ncertainly a harder ride versus the hoker\nwhich is sort of super soft and pillowy\nyou can feel a lot of the ground when\nyou're cornering when you're running\nfast you can run really fast in this\nshoe and feel very very confident it's a\nbit more of an old school traditional\nfeel but that's what a lot of salomons\nare like and finally I think this shoe\nis just pretty damn cool I love Salamon\nproducts I love what they do I love the\nathletes that they sponsor as well it's\njust got a really good Cool vibe about\nit let's have a chat about the dislikes\nthis is very narrow if you are someone\nthat has average and narrow feet you're\ngoing to be okay if you're a wider\nfooted Runner unfortunately you're going\nto have to give this one a miss and then\nfinally as I say you either like it or\nyou don't like it but if you want a\nreally soft plush ride to look after\nyour legs on very long distances this\nmay be one to avoid it really has that\nsort of faster engaging ground contact\nsort of feel with this type of shoe bit\nmore suited for some shorter distances\nright let's wrap this video up so if\nyou're looking for the most comfortable\nshoe out of this range I would go for\nthe Nike trail version 5 the best for\nlong distances then definitely the hoker\nChallenger ATR with that super soft foam\nin there going to look after your legs\nthe best for grip I would have to give\nthat to the Salamon shoe the outsole in\nhere is absolutely fantastic and the\nbest for Speed would be the Salamon shoe\nas well in there just so much more\nconfidence inspiring really good lock\ndown just worked really well but I think\nthe best overall here the best that sort\nof mixes everything that I'm looking for\nis going to be the Nike Trail version 5\nit's very hard to find any sort of fault\nwith a shoe rctx foame I just think\nworks a lot better on trail than it does\nin a dedicated row to it just gives that\nreally nice responsive feel that you\nwant out in the trails and super\ncomfortable you're just not really going\nto have any issues good width in the\nshoe as well great lock down and it\nlooks pretty cool so that's my best on\ntest today but I wholeheartedly\nrecommend all of these three shoes for\nanyone looking to get out on the trails\nfor maybe the first time and that's\nwhere the next video is coming up\nbecause that's all about how to get into\ntrail running so go and check out that\nvideo guys that's coming up next up here\nor up here hope you enjoyed this video\nkeep on working hard keep on it done and\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

      "text": "if you've ever tried to keep your heart\nrate low during a run you know how\nfrustrating or even impossible that can\nfeel at times well today we're going to\nbe talking about how slow you should be\nrunning your easy runs at and we'll also\nbe going over how to calculate your own\npersonal heart rate training zones as\nwell as some tips on how to improve your\nrunning form and how you can ultimately\nrun faster at a lower heart rate\nmastering the art of running easy or in\nzone 2 is crucial for building that\nstrong aerobic base and that overall\nendurance and by the end of this video\nyou'll know exactly what you need to be\ndoing to achieve this so how slow should\nour easy runs be well you should be able\nto hold a conversation at this pace\nrunning with a friend or a colleague or\njust someone you know going out for a\nlittle bit of a chitchat and catch up is\na great way to tell you're running at\nthe right sort of intensity there's also\nsome calculators online our favorite is\nthe Jack Daniels calculator where you\ncan put in some recent race results or\njust some times of where you think your\nFitness is currently at and then will\ngive you some rough guides for where it\nthinks your various training zones are\nmost importantly we're here we're\nlooking for that zone two for that easy\nPace but for some people they won the\nabsolute gold standard the most accurate\nway of doing their easy runs and how are\nwe going to do this well we need to\ncalculate our heart rate training zones\nthere's basically three different ways\nyou can do this the first one being\nanother form of some online calculators\nthese are very very generalized but\nthey'll give you a rough idea of where\nyou're at the second option which will\ngive you the very very very best data\nnow I've done this a few times who put\nsome footage of me in the lab is to go\ninto a lab and get your lactate\nthreshold and your V2 Max tested and as\npart of that they will give you your own\npersonal heart rate training zones that\nyou can then take and use those in your\ntraining in the UK this is going to be\naround about \u00a3 150 to2 200 and then\nwhat's going to appeal for most people\nthe middle ground between those two is\nto test these out yourself and for this\nyou're going to need to know your\nmaximum heart rate and also your resting\nheart rate rate so to calculate your\nmaximum heart rate and I would always\nsay please get some medical advice if\nyou're at all unsure and definitely you\nshould be doing this in a supervised\nenvironment but you basically need to be\npushing yourself to the absolute limit\nthis is very very tough on the body\nplease don't do this if you got\nabsolutely no running Fitness or you're\nfeeling slightly ill now the best thing\nis to do is to get yourself a heart rate\nmonitor a chest strap or at the very\nleast a arm band these will be far more\naccurate than the heart rate monitors\nthat are built into some of our watches\nthese days these are very vague at best\nthey're very good for looking at heart\nrate longterm but for in the moment\nthey're really not going to be accurate\nenough for what we're trying to achieve\nhere there's a couple of options here of\nwhat to do when you're all set up heart\nrate monitors ready to go the first one\nis to run 400 m fairly hard fairly\nintense and then another 400 m\nabsolutely flat out the maximum heart\nrate will be somewhere towards that\nsecond rep of 400 m and then you can\njust look through the data and see where\nyour heart rate gets up to and another\noption you can do here is to find a\ndecent Hill in your local area and then\nprogressively pick up speed pick up\nintensity as you start running up that\nhill do this for around about 60 seconds\nfor that rep and again then look at the\ndata afterwards super fit people might\nwant to repeat this two or three times\nfor those 400 m reps or two or three\ntimes to do those Hill reps and just see\nwhere that heart rate is spiking to at\nthe end of the data before you do this\nyou want to make sure you're properly\nwarmed up you're going to be getting\nsome very intense running straightaway\nso i' say at least around 50 minutes of\nsuper easy jogging lots of dynamic\nstretching as well before you get going\nif you are a little bit injured or a\nlittle bit unwell or don't want to go\nout and do something like that straight\naway go back and look at some of your\nhistorical data from the last couple of\nmonths leading up to where you are now\nhave you done a hill rep session have\nyou done some allout efforts have you\ndone a Max 5K for example just look\nthrough that data if you've got reliable\nchest strap or arm strap data have a\nlook see where it is peaking some of the\nrunning apps as well such as Garing\nthings will be able to tell you what\nyour max heart rate is by reading the\ndata that is fed into it as well so\nthere you go you've got your maximum\nheart rate data then we need to find out\nour resting heart rate now what a\nrecommend here is to take your pulse\nfirst thing in the morning just over the\ncourse of maybe 2 or 3 days most modern\nwatches will give you a resting heart\nrght data and this is going to be fairly\naccurate watches these days with the\nwrist-based heart rate are pretty good\nat looking at long-term heart rate data\nso I would trust the figure that your\nwatch is giving you if you have that\navailable to you so now we've got those\ntwo figures and for Simplicity I'm going\nto say my maximum heart rate is 180 and\nmy resting heart rate is 60 now again\nthere's some online calculators where\nyou can plug these figures in that\nyou've now calculated it will spit out\nyour exact heart rate training zones\nagain we'll link to those down below lot\nof links Down Below in this video but\nfor example maximum heart rate 180\nresting heart rate 60 gives us a heart\nrate reserve of 120 beats a minute this\nis the range of what's available to us\nin our daily life basically the lowest\nit will be and the highest it will be in\nour current state of health so for Zone\none this is going to be 50 to 60% of our\nheart rate Reserve very easy recovery\njogging zone two 60 to 70% of our heart\nrate reserve for our easy runs our\nconversational pace and also some of our\nlong runs as well to build that\nendurance zone three 70 to 80% of our\nheart rate Reserve this is going to be\nsome moderate intensity we don't spend\ntoo much time here in this Zone Zone 4\n80 to 90% of our heart rate res this is\nour Tempo our threshold efforts\nintervals this builds performance it\nbuilds speed it really helps to build\nour ability to run faster and then\nfinally zone five 90 to 100% of our\nheart rate Reserve this really is\nreserved just for those race Sprint\nfinishes and really short intervals as\nwell and potentially some Hill reps and\nthings like that just when we're peaking\nright at the top of a rep so let's\ncalculate our Zone 2 heart rate using\nour data of 180 for our maximum and then\n60 for our resting heart rate so our\nreally simple formula here for\ncalculating it is that percentage of our\nheart rate Reserve plus adding back on\nour resting heart rate so here we're\nlooking for that 60 to 70% range so 0.6\nfor our 60% Times by 120 for our heart\nrate reserve and then add on 60 which\ngives our lowest value of 132 beats a\nminute which is where our Zone 2 Section\nstarts and then our upper end of that\nzone here we're looking for that 70% so\n0.7 times 120 for our heart rate Reserve\nadding on that 60 for our wrestling\nheart rate gives us 144 so our Zone 2\nheart rate section in our example is 132\nto 144 beats a minute but what do we do\nwith this data now we've got it well\nlike with anything the more you practice\nsomething the better you're going to get\nat it and in this instance it's that\nzone two that easy Pace running we want\nto be practicing so for your easy runs\naround about 80% of our total weekly\nvolume put your heart rate monitor on\nyour chest strap or your arm strap we\nlink to recommended heart rate monitors\ndown below as well stick to that zone to\nrunning you can set up alerts on your\nwatch if it goes too high or too low\njust to keep yourself dialed in in that\nexact right zone now for some people\nespecially when you start out me\ndefinitely included in this running in\nzone 2 will feel painfully slow and it\ncan be quite frustrating you feel like\nyou're hardly moving but believe me\nstick with this and you will speed up\nover time your easy runs will get a lot\nfaster because over time your Fitness\nwill grow your body will be adapting and\nyou'll be able to run faster at this\nlower heart rate so practice and be\npatient you might need to walk I\ndefinitely did when I first started out\ndoing this just to bring your heart rate\nback down get it dialed in back in the\ncorrect Zone you also really need to\nlose the ego and have some patience as\nwell a lot of people putting their runs\non social media on straa want to be\nrunning fast all the time that's not how\nyou're going to improve you need to lose\nthat ego you might be running a lot\nslower than you're used to for those\nfirst few weeks but stick with it you\nwill improve you will get faster and you\nwill see yourself naturally running at a\nfaster speed at a lower heart rate\neventually over time you'll know what\nthis will feel like and this is why a\nlot of elite runners or more experienced\nRunners will say I just run on feel and\nI do a lot of my running now like that I\nknow what easy Pace feels like I know\nhow my body should be feeling and so\nwhen I'm out on my easy runs I don't\nalways need to be monitoring this sort\nof stuff because you just get a good\nfeeling of what it's like but for some\nbeginner Runners some people trying to\nimprove learn more about running use\nthat technolog to monitor it make sure\nyou know what you're doing your body\nwill adapt and then you'll start to\nunderstand what it all feels like\nquickly guys if you are finding this\nvideo all please smash that like button\npotentially share it with a friend\nthat's always running too fast on their\neasy runs and also check out my website\nbenp parks.com we've got five star rated\ntraining plans on there helping Runners\nall over the world improve their running\nwe've got awesome running hats and some\nof the very best technical gear out\nthere to help you with your running\nthanks very much guys right back to the\nvideo there's also some other really\nimportant things we need to have our\nchat about when we're trying to run at a\nnice low heart rate in our easy Zone too\nthere's some things that might be\naffecting as well such as temperatures\nhigh temperatures high humidity as well\nthe body is going to have to be working\na lot harder so when we are running in\nthe summer or warmer climates you're\ngoing to be running again a little bit\nslower as well this is when heart rate\nmonitor training could be really really\ngood because you always know you're\ngoing to be training in the right Zone\nbut you might be running a little bit\nslower as you're used to because your\nbody's having to work that little bit\nharder to keep cool also hydration is\nreally important if you do become a\nlittle bit dehydrated your body's going\nto have to work a little bit harder to\ndeliver that oxygen to the muscles so\nmake sure you're definitely hydrated and\nkeep hydrated when you're going out in\nyour long runs the elevation of the\nroute you're running on will play a big\nfactor as well if you're going up a hill\nyour heart rate is going to spike you\nmight need to have to walk or slow it\ndown a lot just to bring that heart rate\nback down and I would say if you are\nrunning on a particularly hilly course\nyou could just look at something like\nyour average heart rate over the course\nof a run it' be how hard if you're\nhaving to stop all the time just have\naverage heart rate potentially on the\ndata field on your watch also altitude\nif you are running up in the mountain\nsomewhere again there's less oxygen\navailable you'll be running a little bit\nslower as well and then finally things\nlike caffeine alcohol lack of sleep and\nfatigue these are going to affect how\nyour body is going to be feeling these\nare other things we have to factor in of\nwhy we might be running a little bit\nslower Right Moving On Let's have a chat\nabout running form and efficiency this\nis all about how we can cover the ground\nfrom point A to point B using as little\nenergy as possible keeping that heart\nrate nice and low there's some really\ngood things we can do here to improve\nour running form very very simple the\nfirst one is all about strides running\nat a very fast rate just for very short\nburst of time about 20 seconds maximum\nalso doing things like Hill reps as well\nsuper important it's very hard to run\nwith bad form with Hill reps both of\nthese things will get you running well\nand also get you nice and strong some\nother things we can focus on as we're\nrunning making sure we're Landing nicely\nunder our Center of mass not out in\nfront of you which can be a bit of a\nbreaking force and then finally all\nabout increasing our Cadence potentially\ndepends where your Cadence is a lot of\npeople when they start out their Cadence\nis quite low in the 150s the 160s which\njust means we're not moving in the most\nefficient way possible the area we're\ngoing to be focusing on for a lot of our\neasy running is around about sort of 175\nup to 180 potentially just over 180\nwe've got a whole video on how to\nimprove your cence again

      "text": "the most anticipated shoe of the year is\nfinally here the aex super blast version\n2 the original super blast burst onto\nthe scene last year and almost\nimmediately became one of my absolute\nfavorite alltime training shoes and when\nI'm not out running testing other shoes\nthis was the shoe I'd reach for about\n90% of the time clocking it over 3,000\nkm in a few different versions of\nversion one with two big updates to\nversion two with the out soole and the\nupper hereit I was really worried that\naex might be messing this one up so is\nthis new model going to live up to my\nvery high expectations or am I going to\nbe scaring eBay to try and find some\npairs of version one and as always I\nbought this shoe 100% with my money to\ngive you that completely honest\nimpartial unbiased review right let's\nget stuck into all of the changes\nbetween the version one and version two\nthe price of the Superglass 2 is a\nlittle bit more expensive here in the UK\nnow costing \u00a3200 most markets around the\nworld it's pretty much the same we have\ngot an updated midsole this big chunk\nthrough the middle here which now uses\nthe FF turbo the same as the updated\nmetas speed sky and Edge asex is most\npremium responsive foam that they offer\nout there and then we've got a thin\nlayer along the bottom of here of asx's\nFF blast plus which is what they use for\na little bit more durability and also\nsort of stabilizing the shoe we've got\nan updated outsole much welcome updated\nouto this is new aex grip rubber on the\nbottom here a little bit more grippy\nhere in the wet weather we'll come on to\nchat about that a little bit later on\nthe review and also you can't get any\nstones and Pebbles and little\nhitchhikers on the bottom of the shoe\nhere which I you get all the time on\nversion one when you'd run on sort of\nmore grally areas they filled in all of\nthose holes in slightly different design\nand pattern on version two and then\nfinally we've got a different updated\nupper to the shoe here which is now this\none piece woven engineered mesh so it's\na little bit more stretchy and just has\na little bit more movement with the shoe\nversus version one right let's get stuck\ninto the facts and figures this is is\nyour long distance mileage monster for\ncrushing those long runs out there and\nit's also one of the very best\nnon-plated racing shoes perfect for like\n10K half marathons marathons and also\nUltra marathons if they're going to be\non the road as well is very much a road\nshoe although you could do have a little\nbit of light trail with this great aex\ngrip on the bottom here price-wise this\nsent me back \u00a3200 here in the UK around\nabout \u20ac220 $200 around about $320\nAustralian dollars stack Heights we've\ngot 45 mil at the back of the shoe 8 mm\ndrop overall and it's basically the same\nweight as the outgoing model for me this\nis coming at 288 G that's really really\nquite light for sure of this size this\nis in my particular size UK 11 A2 here\nthe old version was 290 so basically\nexactly the same it is a neutral shoe\nthe upper as I've just said is this\nlovely engineered mesh upper which Asic\nsay is going to improve the air flow\nthrough the shoe midso we've got the FF\nTurbo plus through the middle here and\nthen the FF blast plus Eco along the\nbottom of the shoe there there is\nfamously no carbon plate in the shoe and\nthe outsole Now features this aex grip\nwhich is these yellow sections here and\naex also put this on some of their trail\nshoes as well so it's very tacky very\nsticky a lce sort of slow density rubber\nto try and improve on asx's usually\nquite poor wet weather performance there\nare no different wits available at\nlaunch but it's pretty good here on the\nwitth side there's also this one\nFlagship color at launch which is asx's\nParis colorway personally I absolutely\nlove this let me know what your thoughts\nare down in the comments asex say that\nthis is to do with Paris called the city\nof lights and we've got sunset and\nsunrise colors here and finally this\nwasn't true to size I actually ordered a\nsize 12 my usual size and a size 11 and\n1/2 I always had 11 and 1/2 in version\none and I've stuck with that in version\ntwo basically i' just say go half a size\ndown from your regular size or go\nexactly the same size you had in version\none if you had that shoe if you could\nlike and share this video and let us\nknow down in the comments your thoughts\non the superl 2 that be great and please\ncheck out my website benp parks.com\nwe've got training plans the best\nrunning hats in the world some technical\ngear and Casual gear to keep you going\nthrough your training right let's get\nstuck into the likes my first like here\nis they didn't mess it up come on I get\nso worried when you have your absolute\nfavorite shoe out there and a\nmanufacturer releases a new one and\nyou're like please don't mess it up\nplease don't make it really heavy bulky\nuse different materials they have used\ndifferent materials but all the updates\nin the shoe have worked really well the\nupper is just a little bit more\nbreathable the key area such as the\nankle lock down absolutely fantastic no\nslipping no blisses no hot spots nice\ngusseted tongue here just gives the\nperfect right amount of padding so your\nfoot stays nicely locked down yes I was\na bit worried my foot might move around\na little bit at the front of the shoe\nwith this woven mesh upper but it just\nstays perfectly in place so no problems\nthere and also finally thank you to ax\nfor not increasing the weight actually\nfor me brought it down very very so\nslightly super lightweight shoe it is\nabsolutely amazing how a shoe can be\nthis light and it just feels so much fun\nto run in my second like with the shoe\nis this updated midsole foam it's just\never so slightly more Poppy and\nresponsive but really very very similar\nif you're a fan of version one you're\ngoing to love this updated foam in\nversion two It just strikes that perfect\nbalance in a shoe that can just have\nthat sudden turn with speed of course\nthere's plenty of faster dedicated 5K\nand 10K shoes with plates and things\nlike that there but that's not what this\nshoe is all about this shoe is perfect\nfor crunching those long distance\nmarathon training runs or marathon races\nas well if you don't want to be using a\ncarbon plate and really if you don't\nwant to have a carbon plate in your shoe\nthere really is nothing faster out there\nthan the aex super blast version 2 and\nthen finally my third like with the shoe\nis this updated outsole the super blast\nwas okay in the wet it really wasn't\nthat great but the new aex grip they put\non the bottom of the shoe here just\nmeans all of that worry has gone away\nwhen I have running it in the wet it's\njust gripped super fantastically and you\nreally can feel the difference even\nwalking around the house the you one it\njust feels different it's lot more tacky\nwhen aex had all their problems with\ntheir grip with their wet weather grip\nin like the Nova Blast 2 and three it\nreally wasn't very good this you don't\nhave to worry about it at all fantastic\nupdate aex well done finally got a shoe\nthat you can trust in the wet weather\nand also you can just take this out on\nsome light Trails as well and it will\nhandle those absolutely fine some fire\nroads and things like that you'll be\ngood to go here moving on to the\ndislikes this is really hard to be\nhonest my first dislike isn't really\neven about the shoe it's just about all\nthe supply issues that you have with the\nsuperlast and I don't know why aexs are\nlike this the shoe sells out so quickly\npretty much sold out on launch day all\naround the world maybe it's all just\nmarketing I don't know there's nothing\nin this shoe that you can't get on all\nof the other ax shoes the materials are\nall available but they really seem to\nlimit Supply I can only assume I don't\nknow why that is but this shoe will be\nselling out very very quickly if you can\nget a pair you want to get a pair don't\ndilly dally just go and get that order\nin and also the shoe was meant to launch\non Friday just gone on the aex website\nhere in the UK they didn't even launch\nbecause I think they had supply issues\nthemselves and they delayed their launch\nagain I don't know that's just what I\nsuspect even assets can't get it right I\ngot my player from sport shoes got up at\n5:30 in the morning to try and secure a\npair which I managed to do so very very\nhappy with that got the 11 and a half\nand 12 come in and now yeah need to send\nthe 12's back cuz I just a bit worried\nabout the sizing but we're all good the\nsecond sort of dislike I've got with a\nshoe yeah it is a little bit on the\nexpensive side it's so hard to be\ntalking about a 200 shoe and saying this\nis great it is a fantastic shoe but also\nwhat you're getting with that 200 L is a\nsuper durable shoe as well I'd always\nget at least 1,000 k out of my version\none the updated outsol in the shoe\nshould be even better so it should be\ngetting a little bit more mileage out of\nthis but it does last a long time I\ncan't wait to bring a full whizbang pop\nreview once I've done my thks in the\nshoe will slot it into a review\nsomewhere down the line and speaking of\ncost maybe you're better off at going\nfor something like the Nova blast 4 for\nexample \u00a365 less that's a big chunk of\ncash and really the Nova blast is a\nsuperb allaround shoe the super blast it\nis slightly quicker without a doubt it's\njust a little bit more responsive less\nbouncy foam you get here and it is\nbetter suited for your long runs just a\nbit firmer bit lighter and just a bit\nSmo smoother through the footstrike\noverall but I'd say stick with the Nova\nblast if you're just looking for\nsomething that you can do all of your\nruns pretty well and you're not doing\ntoo many long runs it's a shoe that's\nI'd say around about 90% as fast and\nreally will suit the vast majority of\npeople unless you're looking for the\nabsolute Crema creme or if you're very\nfortunate to have the budget and you\nwant to get both of them then you could\nuse you all your sort of regular daily\ntraining in the Nova blast and then use\nthis for your marathon training long\nruns and maybe even a marathon racing\nshoe at the weekend moving on the Neo\nVista hit the scene a few weeks ago I\ngave it a rave review it was fantastic\n\u00a350 cheaper and it really is a bit of a\nshoe at the moment has a nylon plate in\nit so slightly different feel very\ndifferent ride going through the shoe\nit's bouncier and it's softer and it\ndoes soak up those easy Mars a little\nbit better the super blast picks up the\npace a little bit better and it does\nhave a firmer ride both these shoes\nsupremely comfortable I could personally\nchoose this type of upper rather than\nthe booty upper just get a better lock\ndown in this one and with the near Vista\nit's just a little less stable around\nthe corners where this is absolutely\nRock Solid and the super blast will\nprobably last a little bit longer with\nthis better out soole with the shoe\nthere as well so I really think you're\ngetting about the same sort of value yes\nthe super blast is a little bit more\nexpensive but it will last a lot longer\nI think in my opinion then finally\nsomething like the Nike Invincible\nversion 3 around about 20 cheaper here\nthe Invincible is a lot bouncier it's\nroomier it's heavier it's perfect for\nthose easy recovery runs but again a\nshoe manufacturers using their Flagship\nfoam without putting that carbon plate\nin the shoe the super blast is just much\nsmoo through the stride a lot firmer\nmuch more Nimble and lightweight and\njust better at a more wider range of\nspeeds where something like the\nInvincible it's really is just your sort\nof steady marathon pace really steady\nmarathon pace and easing recovery run\nsort of shoe so let's bring this all\ntogether what do I think of the\nsuperlast well it's a fantastic shoe\nwithout a doubt it is definitely going\ninto my rotation\nI'm going to finish my miles I've got\nabout 300 miles left in my last pair of\nversion one so I'm not going to use this\nstraight away it's not a revolutionary\nupdate get subscribed and see if this\nshoe will be making into my top three\nshoes of the year which we normally\nlaunch around about December time if you\nare interested in other asset shoes\nwe've got a complete assets comparison\nguide again completely unsponsored B all\nthe asset shoes with I money check that\nout that is up here coming up next let\nme know if you've got any questions down\nin the comments about the super blast\nI'll catch up and answer all of those\ndown there keep it working hard guys\nkeep done I'm have to get some more\nmarathon training done we see you very\nsoon in the next one",

      "text": "over the past few weeks I've been\ngetting so many messages and comments\nasking if I was going to be testing out\nthe new Muno Neo Vista there's been so\nmuch hype for this shoe Muno went on a\nmassive promotion drive my social media\nfeeds been bulging with people promoting\nthis shoe I checked it out and\neverything sounds really exciting an all\nnew shoe a really radical design the new\nbooty upper and a new foam to go with it\nas well is this the value super trainer\nwe've all been looking for well stay\ntuned because we got all that and more\ncoming up with my full review of the\nMuna Neo Vista before we start out just\nwant to say I bought this shoe 100% with\nmy own money to give you that completely\nhonest impartial unbiased review if you\nlike this kind of content please drop us\na like leave your comments down below\nand subscribe to the channel if you\nhaven't already and of course check out\nmy own website BP parks.com where we've\ngot the best running hats and Technical\ngear to help you with your running right\non with the video now as I said at the\nstart of the video this is an all new\nshoe from Mao it's not replacing\nanything and I think the look are really\npolarizing from what I can tell what do\nyou think about the looks of this shoe\nyou a lover or a hater for me I really\nlike it well let's start out chatting\nabout all of the facts and figures so\nthe purpose of a shoe like this this is\na premium daily shoe really good long\nrun shoe for those Marathon paste long\nruns that high stack Max cushion shoe to\nreally look after your legs on those\nlonger runs and some similar examples\nhere something like the Hoka macx the\nBoston series of shoes more the more\nrecent Boston series of shoes or\nsomething like the Nike Zoom fly 5 this\nshoe sent me back\n\u00a350 here in the UK stack out of the back\n45 mil 8 mm drop overall 3155 G or 11.1\nOz it's a neutral shoe it has this\nseamless knit upper with a tongue\nintegrated into it like a booty type\nconstruction so it really hugs your foot\nprobably the most famous shoe like this\nis something like the Nike Tempo next\nperent in terms of the midsole oh I\nreally like the midsole in this shoe but\nthis is mauno super smooth speed assist\nenergy NXT midso foam this is an EVA\nfoam which is normally quite basic as\nFoams go and some people have been\nworried about that but they've injected\nsome nitrogen here they've got to hold\ntheir special process and it really\nbrings this shoe to life one of the best\nEva Foams that I've ever run in there is\na nylon plate in this shoe which is a\nlittle bit more forgiving a lot less\nstiff than a carbon plate shoe really\nsuited for that daily trainer type\naspect I've got mizuno's own rubberhead\non the out soole and as you can see\nthere's this massive cutaway along the\nbottom of the shoe which has probably\nbeen done to save weight more than\nanything there are no different widths\navailable which is a little bit\nfrustrating but in terms of width it was\nreally good for me this booty\nconstruction really means there's a lot\nof space to get your feet in there so\nyou should be absolutely fine as you got\nseverely wide feet and it wasn't true to\nsize for me I actually couldn't get my\nsize so I ordered half a size down and\nthat was perfect so it probably is about\ntrue size to half a size down if if\nyou're at all unsure go half a size down\nand finally there are two different\ncolorway options there's the blue for\nthe men's and the white colorway option\nfor the women right let's get stuck into\nmy likes my first like with the shoe is\nthis upper really good lock down snug\nfit the upper really does hug to your\nfoot like a sock as you'd expect I\nsuppose and I was worried about some\npotential overheating issues because\nthis upper is quite thick but for me in\nthe UK it was absolutely fine no hot\nspots blisters rubbing or any sort of\ndiscomfort like that really good lock\ndown at the back of the shoe as well\nwith the ankle is very soft here at the\nback but just held the foot really\nnicely through the whole foot strike so\nyeah upper really fantastic super\ncomfortable right from the off and it\nwas just an absolute joy to run in my\nsecond like with this shoe is it super\nsmooth across the surfaces really great\ncruising long run shoe it really shines\nat that easy steady marathon pace half\nmarathon pace that's where this shoe is\nbest used I didn't really notice the\nplate through the stride yeah you can\ntell it's there just about but it's\nreally there just to help assist with\nthe stability more than anything rather\nthan speed which is all due just the\nhuge amount of foam we've got in this\nmidsole so you really need to add that\nplate in just to give it that solid\nstructure yes the shoe is a little bit\non the heavier side of things again just\nfor a sheer amount of foam in here but\nit really does cruise along really\nnicely just a fantastic cruisy long run\nmarathon training or Marathon racing\nshoe and then finally the value of the\nshoe for in the UK \u00a350 for everything\nthis is delivering is really quite\nexceptional in my opinion for the plated\ntraining shoe sort of Market of course\nyou can get shoes way cheaper or way\nmore expensive for this type of shoe\nthis is definitely on the very cheaper\nend and one of the best ones out there\nat the moment as well I was really\nworried they're going to be cutting some\ncost by using this Evo instead of a p PX\nPham which you get in some of the more\nElite models out there but the midsole\nfeels so bouncy So Soft but it's just\nthe right amount of cushioning to really\nbring a smile to your face and the right\namount of energy to get your long runs\ndone moving on to my dislikes the first\none in just really sharp Corners it's\njust by using this kind of booty type\nupper there is a little bit of sideways\nmovement but for those marathon training\nlong runs when you're just going a\nstraight line you'll be absolutely fine\nand again with this big big bit missing\nin the bottom just a little bit of\ninstability there very very minor thing\nyou might notice that you might not but\nI really wanted to bring that up the\nsecond dislike with the shoe is it is\njust a little bit chunky and it's a\nlittle bit too soft for those faster\npacing runs if you're going to do some K\nreps some 5K races 10K races things like\nthat it's not going to be a super allout\nfar shoe it is actually quite\nlightweight for the sh size and volume\nthat this shoe is a lot of people don't\nlike these big clunky shoes which this\none definitely is but there's still a\nlot of bulk here there's a lot of mass\nunderneath your foot but yeah it really\ndoes deliver a really nice fantastic\nenjoyable ride for those as I say half\nmarathon Marathon easy tight Pace runs\nso if you wanton a firm ride with lots\nof ground feeling this is really one to\navoid in a similar vein it's just a\nlittle bit too chunky for those 5K 10K\nraces and that sort of training yes I\nreally think it's a really good solid\ndaily shoe but it's not perfect the\nshoe's far more suited for long distance\ncruisy Pace half marathon Marathon easy\nPace yeah you could even go for a\nrecovery jog in it as well it does take\na lot of these boxes but it's that\nmiddle sweet spot where this shoe really\nshines also a really good option for\nsomeone that feels like the flagship\ncarbon Racers a little bit too expensive\nthey're not quite sort of supportive\nenough not providing enough Comfort this\nshoe is really comfortable and again\nit's a really good option to have a look\nat I say the perfect person for a shoe\nlike this is someone that wants some\nreally good value wants a shoe they can\ndo all of their marathon training in\npotentially do their marathon race in as\nwell doesn't want to get too involved by\nbuilding big shoe rotations yes you can\nput this in a rotation get something\nfaster get something slower either end\nit will look after you really well there\nI say this is a really good one sh\noption for people maybe in their first\nsecond third sort of marathon with an\nallout Comfort shoe and following on\nfrom that this shoe was exceptionally\ncomfortable if you want to see my best\ncomfortable shoes then check out that\nvideo that's coming up next here that's\nit guys let me know your thoughts on the\nnew M let me know down in the comments\nhow I catch up there keep working hard\nguys keeping get it done and we'll see\nyou very soon in the next one",

      "text": "a simple Do-it all shoe for a bargain\nprice isn't that what all Runners want\nbut manufacturers make it so hard to\nfind constantly trying to sell us Niche\nshoes so that we end up spending more\nmoney well today I've got an absolute\nGem of a shoe in to test out and if the\nrumors are true this could well be the\nbargain shoe of the Year this shoe joins\nAdidas's Legacy Adi Zero range of their\nhigh performance running shoes joining\nthe Super Shoe adios Pro the super\nSpeedy Tumi Sen the classic uptempo\ndaily Boston the SL2 is a classic daily\nshoe where you can pick up your pace and\nhave some fun with your runs and that's\nwhat we will be reviewing today so St\nrelax let's get the Adidas SL2 review\ndone as always I bought this shoe 100%\nwith my money so I can give you that\ncompletely impartial 100% honest review\nlet me know down in the comments some\nother shoe reviews that you'd like to\nsee coming up we just putting a little\nlist together for some testing we're\ngoing to do over the summer I'd love to\nhave your input so let me know down in\nthe comments and if you like these kind\nof videos please like them and share\nthem with a friend and as I say let us\nknow down in the comments what you want\nto see coming\nup right let's chat about the\ndifferences between this and the\noutgoing model the first one being we've\ngot an updated upper which is now more\nlightweight and a little bit more\nbreathable well that's what Adidas are\ntelling us the second one we've now got\nthis fulllength strip of the Light\nStrike Pro Adidas's premium foam that\nruns the whole length of the shoe and\nthen that's surrounded by Adidas's up\nupdated Light Strike 2.0 foam as well as\na carrier foam meaning that this model\nis so much softer and also more\nresponsive with these really much better\nupdated phones and the third update is\nit's now much lighter as well coming in\nat 287 G that's ridiculous for me in my\nUK size 12 well let's get stuck into the\nfacts and\nfigures so the purpose of a shoe like\nthis this is your classic daily trainer\nfor me this is a 5K 10K up to half\nmarathon racing or training shoe yes of\ncourse you can do some marathon training\nfor your easy dogs I wouldn't personally\nwant to take it out for a super long run\nthe price of this shoe is fantastic this\nshoe sent me back just 98 here in the UK\nfrom sport shoes against an RRP of\n\u00a30 Stack Heights we've got a 36 mil\nstack heite at the back of the shoe 9 mm\ndrop overall and as I just said at 287 G\nvery very light weight for a shoe like\nthis it's a neutral shoe the upper we've\ngot this lovely engineered mesh very\ntraditional feeling here the midsole\nwe've got a lovely fulllength layer of\nAdidas's light strip Pro foam and that's\nencapsulated by Adidas's updated Light\nStrike 2.0 Pham treating as a carrier\nfoam just to add extra durability into\nthe shoe there's no carbon plate in this\nshoe the outsole is Adidas's own rubber\noutsole it's not the Continental one\nwhich you sometimes see on on most of\nthe Adi Zero range but still pretty damn\ngood at this price point at the time of\nfilming and the release there are no\ndifferent widths available hopefully\nthey will be along soon we'll chat about\nthat in some of the negatives coming up\nthere are three different colorways\navailable at the moment and this was\npretty much true to size for me I would\nsay if you're between sizes you're not\nreally sure then definitely go half a\nsized up added us on their own website\ntell you to go half a size up but it was\njust about okay but if you're totally\nunsure go half a size up right let's get\nstuck into my\nlights my first light with this shoe is\njust the sheer versatility that you can\nget with it the traction surprisingly\ngood with Adidas's own very basic outso\nhere but it works really well this will\nbe a really great shoe to get the\nmajority of your training runs and\npotentially some races done in it as\nwell whether you're training for your 5K\n10K or half marathon or even some\nmarathon training Mars in there as well\nand it's just a really fun shoe to run\nin it's so engaging it brings a smile to\nyour face it's Poppy it's just got that\njust the right amount of softness and\nresponsiveness a really fantastic shoe\nto get the vast majority of your runs\ndone and it's just incredible at this\nprice point as well I didn't have any\nslipping issues got a really good lock\ndown at the back of the shoe didn't have\nto use any heel lock lacing feet just\nfelt really secure in the shoe no hot\nspots no blisters the second like with\nthis shoe is just the lightweightness of\nit it's Snappy it's fun to run in the\nmid Soul offers a really engaging ride\nat this price point is just incredible\nreally of course it's not as fast as\nsome of the assisted shoes with their\nrods or plates in other manufacturers\nbut this shoe equally is certainly no\nslouch for that completely unassisted\nvery traditional ride and my third like\nwith the shoe as I've touched on a lot\nso far is just the sheer value that this\nshoe offers it really is unheard of at\nthis sort of price point usually the\nFoams in this area are hard dull just a\nreal afterthought of manufacturers Just\nchucking any of thing in there it\ndoesn't really matter but added ass have\nfor some reason added their premium\nphones to this entrylevel shoe and it's\njust fantastic the durability should be\nreally solid here I've only done three\nruns in the shoe so far but it's holding\nup really really well and although I\nhaven't really be able to run in the\nrain in this shoe because we're here in\nthe summer in the UK and the weather's\nactually quite good for a change I\nreally think it should be pretty good\nthe build quality at this price point is\njust exceptional as well I've heard a\nfew people complaining about the laces\nare a bit cheap and yeah they are you\nmay may want to swap them out but for me\nthey were absolutely fine so nothing to\nworry about just a fantastic brilliant\nvalue shoe that really really\ndelivers moving on to my dislikes the\nshoe is definitely on the narrow side\nquite a traditional Adidas quite\nEuropean fitting shoe here it's\ndefinitely a lot narrower than the\nBoston and the adios Pro and other shoes\nin their range as I said earlier their\nown website does suggest to get half a\nsize up here and that is is what I'd\nrecommend if you're at all unsure\nbetween two sizes but if you do have\nwide feet then really I'm afraid this is\ngoing to be one to avoid hopefully edit\nus will release a wider fitting option\nhere which will be fantastic but sadly\nat the moment this shoe really is for\nyour narrower or standard width feet\n[Music]\npeople so do I recommend the Adidas SL2\nwell as you can probably tell very very\nmuch so I'm definitely going to be\nkeeping it in my rotation this shoe is\ndefinitely not going on eBay we're\ndefinitely going to be shifting I'm\ngoing to enjoy putting many more miles\nin the shoe just perfect for someone\nlooking for that standard traditional\nfeel no plates no rods none of all that\ntechnology that some people love in\ntheir shoes but some people really don't\nyes you can pay more to get the Boston\nwith that assisted ride and it is a\nlittle bit wider as well but for the\nmajority of people this would be a\nreally good daily shoe now compared to\nthe other budget options out there at\nthe moment two of the really good ones\nlike the pluma pluma Puma velocity Nitro\nthree and the rebot float ride this just\noffers a far more engaging ride the foam\nin here you're getting added as's light\nstripe Pro foam and that's just their\ntop end foam that you see in their 200b\nplus shoes yes it's just a small Slither\nin there but that really brings the shoe\nto life it's so much fun to run in and\nthat sort of ride is just something\nyou're not getting at this price point\nyes there's a couple of nitpicky things\nI would like a little bit more stability\nin this shoe cuz it's just a little bit\non the narrow side nice it's a little\nbit wider if if I was going to be using\nthis for them dedicated Marathon long\nruns and things like that but for me at\nthe moment this is unbeatable value at\nthis price definitely the best shoe you\ncan buy around about that1 price point\nso I'd really recommend picking up a\npair before Adidas realize what they're\non to here and put the price up so very\nmuch recommended now clearly a lot of\nyou guys watching like myself want to\nget some exceptional value out there\nrunning which is why you're looking at a\nshoe like this we've got a really great\nvideo coming up next all about a load of\nKit and Tech to help you prove your\nrunning when you're on a budget so check\nout that video up here now keep on\nworking hard guys keep on it done and\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

      "text": "we've done aex we've done Nike we've\ndone Brooks and we've done hoker and now\nit's a turn of New Balance for a\ncomplete Mega shoe comparison video\nwe've got six of new balance's\nbestselling running shoes here all of\nwhich I bought 100% with my own money\nand tested them out so I can give you\nthat completely 100% honest impartial\nand unbiased review which we always do\nhere on the channel going through the\npros and cons of each shoe to help you\nwith your buying decisions at the end I\nchat through my favorites because\nthere's one here that really stood out\nand thank you for everybody that checks\nout my website benp parks.com and\nsupports the channel here to people that\nliking sharing the video subscribing to\nthe channel and checking out the best\nrunning hats the best technical gear and\nawesome training plans which you sell on\nbenp parks.com links to everything down\nbelow and that's what allows us to keep\nmaking these videos here on the channel\nso thank you so so much for the support\na lot of people obviously ask about Tru\nto size I just want to say I got all of\nthese New Balance shoes in my regular UK\nsize 12 and they were all really good\nand fitted very nicely so they're all\ntrue to size for for me right let's get\nstuck in with the shoe starting out with\nthe cheapest finishing off with the most\nexpensive so starting out with the New\nBalance 880 this is the brand new\nversion 14 with an updated mids and\nupper here now there's kind of Two Shoes\nin this range you got the 880 which is\nfor the neutral Runners out there and\nyou've also got the 860 which is the\nstability version of this shoe this is\nyour classic everyday shoe that can do\neverything pretty well good for doing\nall sorts of different types of running\nthis sent me back one\n140 here in the UK stack height around\nabout 30 mil stack height at the back 8\nmm drop overall Weight Wise we're\ntalking 312 G for me in my UK size 12\nfor the mids so we've got new balances\nFresh Foam X here big chunk of that\nthere's no carbon plate in this shoe but\nthere are plenty of wide options\nstandard wide and extra wide here now\nwhat I really like about the shoe my\nPros my likes super durable outso in the\nshoe this is going to last you a long\ntime on your runs it offers some really\ngood traction as well also a very\nversatile ride and a really good one\nshoe option super comfortable right out\nthe box great cushioning just the right\namount for all sorts of different types\nof runs you got a good amount of ground\ncontact feel without that Max stack kite\nthing I'm feeling a bit numb out there\nnow what I didn't like about the shoe it\nis it does run a little bit narrow so if\nyou're someone that does have a wider\nfoot definitely get the wide or the\nextra wide but all in all I've really\nenjoyed putting some Mars in the shoe\nand I'll be putting plenty more in as I\nbuild up towards my next marathon moving\non we've got the rebel version 4 this is\na hell of a lot lighter this is your\nlightweight daily trainer perfect for\nSpeed work 5Ks 10ks up to half marathon\ndistances and also say training for\nmarathons as well I wouldn't personally\nwant to use this for a Marathon distance\nwe'll come on to perfect shoes for that\na little bit later on price-wise\n\u00a340 stack height 30 mil at the back of\nthe shoe 6 mm drop overall Weight Wise\n242 G super lightweight midsole here\nwe've got some fuel cell foam peber 20%\nand EVA foam 80% so I blend of the two\nclassic Foams there's no plate in this\nshoe and there's also no wide option now\nwhat I really liked about this shoe it\nis super lightweight and really great\nfun to run in it really brings a big\nsmile to your face it's very Lively also\nreally good on the width option here\nthere aren't other wide options you got\nplenty of space up front here on the\nstandard shoe it's very versatile and\nalso fantastic value \u00a3140 for a shoe\nlike this that can do so much and it\nreally is one of the best value shoes\nthat you can get on sale today also I\nthink it looks really good as well let\nme know your thoughts down in the\ncomments now what I didn't like about\nthe shoe I did get a bit of heel slip\nand a bit of heel rubbing little\nblisters starting to develop at the back\nof the shoe on my first few runs did\nsome heel lock lacing and that went away\nso overall another shoe that I've really\nenjoyed running and I'm looking forward\nto keeping in my rotation moving on on\nto the more version 4 shoe I don't\nactually have any more because I had so\nmany happy Mars in it and it's now a\nlittle bit worn out this is your max\ncushion long run super soft super\nsquishy recovery run shoe the type of\nshoe you want to put on when you want to\nlook after your legs this shoe sent me\nback\n\u00a340 stack Co at the back 34 mil with a 4\nmm drop overall so a little bit flatter\nhere Weight Wise it is a little bit on\nthe heavy side 353 G for me in my UK\nsize 12 mids salt we've got got Nik Nike\ndefinitely not Nike we've got new\nbalances fresh f x midsole there's no\ncarbon plate in the shoe and you can\nalso get two wide options here just your\nstandard or your wide what I liked about\nthis shoe it's super stable given how\nsoft it is so sometimes with the squishy\nshoes you can feel a lot of instability\nespecially when cornering this is nice\nwide platform super stable really roomy\nand wide fitting as well super soft\nsquishy ride it ticks that Comfort box\nreally really well terms of what I\ndidn't like it is just a bit bulky and\nheavy and just doesn't handle speed very\nwell it's not really built for that sort\nof thing but it's really not the type of\nshoe you could just have one shoe and do\nall your runs in it this is a dedicated\nslower Pace easy recovery run shoe\nmoving on to one of the oldtime classics\nfrom New Balance the 1080 currently at\nversion 13 you can also get the vongo 6\nwhich is their stability version so the\n1080 neutral shoe vongo 6 stability\nversion the shoes are fairly similar\nthis do premium everyday shoe price-wise\nlittle bit expensive \u00a360 here for the\n1080 stack height 38 mil at the back of\nthe shoe 6 mm drop overall coming in at\n323 G for me midsole we've got new\nbalances Fresh Foam X again there's no\ncarbon plate in the shore no plate of\nany description there are also plenty of\nwide options you got your standard your\nwide and your extra wide what I really\nliked about it Supreme levels of comfort\ndefinitely one of the most comfortable\nshoes you can buy on the market at the\nmoment moment and it's also a really\ngood shoe for your walking or anyone on\ntheir feet all day really wellb built\nshoe as well good quality upper here yes\nit's a premium product but you can\nreally feel that in how well the shoe\nhas been built what I didn't like about\nthe shoe the standard width is a little\nbit on the narrow side little bit high\nprice point here as well for me I just\nfound it a little bit too soft and\nunstable and it really is no longer that\ndoit all shoe cuz now with it's so soft\nit really is that only easy and Recovery\nrun shoe so if you're the type of person\nthat wants the ultimate soft and\nsquishiness then B check out the 1080\nbut a better daily option for me I think\nis the 880 right let's move on to\ngetting a little bit more expensive\nagain to the super comp trainer getting\nsome real speed into the mix now so the\nsuper comp trainer I really love this\nshoe when I had it in earlier this year\nthis is for your fast training runs\nspeed sessions long marathon training\nsessions and also racing here as well we\nnow got a plate in the shoe not the\nstiffest plate but a kind of plate you\ncan use everyday a premium everyday shoe\nhere price-wise a bit on the expensive\nside \u00a3210 for this stackwise 40 mil at\nthe back of the shoe 6 mm drop overall\nweight 326 G for me midsole we've got\nnew balances fuel cell foam plate wise\nyes we have now got a carbon fiber plate\ncarbon carbon fiber plate in the shoe\nand there is no wide option here what I\nreally liked about the shoe it was\nsupremely comfortable a lot of padding\naround the back of the shoe around your\nanle really good lock down in there no\nslipping around no hot spots or anything\nlike that and with a plate in the shoe\nit's fast as well and I really think\nit's right up with the most comfortable\nfar shoe that you can buy anywhere on\nthe market at the moment and also a\nreally good entry level option for\npeople looking to try out a carbon\nplated shoe for the first time so it's\nalso a really good option for that mid\npack type Runner or back of the- pack\nRunner that wants to have a far shoe on\ntheir feet but running their marathons a\nlittle bit longer than some other people\nout there so what that really Supreme\ncomfort to get them through the race\ndefinitely one of my favorite shoes that\nI've run in this year so well worth\nchecking out and what I didn't like\nabout the shoe yeah it cost me a lot of\nmoney basically a little bit on the\nexpensive side but you're getting a\npremium product here and finally in the\nlineup today we've got the supercom\nelite version 4 currently this is New\nBalance allout Flagship super stiff fast\ncarbon race shoe new Balan is Super Shoe\nthat long distance specialist perfect\nfor half marathons we can use this for\nany distance really but for a lot of\npeople this is a half marathon and\nMarathon shoe price-wise oh this was a\nlot \u00a3260 I've just spent on this shoe\nstack height 40 mil at the back of the\nshoe with a 4 mm drop overall Weight\nWise 286 G for me and my UK size 12\nwe've got the fuel cell midsole 100%\npeber and a fulllength carbon plate\nrunning through the shoe and there's no\nwide option here now what I liked about\nthe shoe as I've said quite a lot today\nin this video very very comfortable\noverall really like like what new balets\nhave done with their Phantom fit upper\nit's extremely bouncy very poppy but not\ntoo stiff like some carbon shoes can be\nit's another good entry level point for\nsomeone that wants that that all out\nrace shoe as well that hasn't maybe run\nin some carbon plated shoes before and\nis certainly a very fast option out\nthere I've really enjoyed taking this up\nto some of my allout Paces at the moment\nI didn't actually have any heel slip\nissues in this one I was using the heel\nlock lacing on the front as well just to\ncombat that because the stru strcture is\nvery similar to The Rebel version 4 what\nI didn't like about the shoe the\ntongue's just a bit weird it's just a\nlittle bit on the short side with that\nHill lock lacing it doesn't leave much\nbut just about being okay and it's just\na little bit on the heavy side but as I\nsay I really like the Comfort levels the\nshoe offered and for someone landing on\nthe midfoot as well and just rolling\nthrough a really nice rocker through the\nshoe a very fast option so here's my\nfinal thoughts on the New Balance range\nthe most comfortable option the super\ncomp trainer the best everyday option\nthe eight 80 the best for allout Speed\nand Marathon racing definitely the elite\nV4 the best value shoe here the rebel\nversion 4 the best option for Walkers\nhikers being on your feet all day than\nthe 1080 and out of all of these shoes\nmy standout one was surprisingly I'm\nsure somebody would be surprised was the\n880 it just a really good classic daily\nshoe I just put it on it got the job\ndone no fuss really comfortable great\nlock down good breathability good amount\nof speed you can get in the shoe as well\nwell you can feel a little bit of the\nground and it was just one that caught\nme out and a really nice enjoyable ride\nin the shoe and going be racking up some\nmore training miles in this one without\na doubt so thanks for following along\nguys hope you enjoyed the video we'll\nlink to the full playlist of these\ncomplete overviews down below let us\nknow what you'd like to see coming up\nnext maybe on or added us potentially\nlet us know down in the comments up next\nwe've got the most comfortable shoes for\nall of your runs up here that's it guys\nkeep on working hard keep on done and\nwe'll see you very soon

      "text": "the Nike Pegasus has always been a firm\nfavorite of long Runners for such a long\ntime but over the last four years as\nrunning shoe technology has advanced so\nquickly that Pegasus has really started\nto lag behind its competitors big fans\nof the historic Nike Pegasus have been\ncrying out for updates especially to the\noutdated midsole and Nike have finally\ngiven us that in the shoe but not\nwithout a considerable hike in price so\nNike now finally caught up and produced\na 10 out of 10 daily trainer and if so\nis it going to be worth that extra hike\nin price so I'm three runs in to the\nPegasus 41 now thought what better time\nto put my thoughts down on paper and\nbring you this video right let's start\nout chatting about all of the\ndifferences between this version 41 and\nthe outgoing version 40 but before we do\nof course as I do with all the reviews\non the channel I bought this shoe 100%\nwith my own money to give you that\ncompletely impartial 100% honest review\nas I would always do so thank you to\neverybody liking commenting and sharing\nthis video it really helps support the\nchannel and allows us to keep on doing\nthat all right let's talk about the\nchanges the first one is this updated\nmesh upper it's now a slightly lighter\nweight and a little bit more breathable\nas well little bit more cushioning\naround the ankle and through the tongue\nas well a really nice update the second\none the all important one with this\nupdate Nike's new react X foam which now\nruns the whole length of the shoe we\nwere stuck with Nike's very outdated\nreact foam in versions 37 to 40 so a\nfantastic update there we've got an\nextra 4 mm stack height in the shoe and\nit's now \u00a315 more expensive here in the\nUK right let's get stuck into all of the\nfacts and figures so purpose of the shoe\nlike this this is your daily trainer\nsuitable for all different types of runs\nI'd say up to around about the Half\nMarathon distance in terms of price I\nshowed out 130 of my hard-earned British\npounds 10 mm drop here with a 37 mil\nstack at the back of the shoe giving a\n27 mil stack at the front of the shoe in\nterms of Weight Wise I measured this\nexactly the same as my outgo model 347 G\nfor me in my UK size 12 it's a neutral\nshoe and it has this lovely engineered\nmesh upper as I say really nice and\nbreathable getting good air flow through\nthere as well the midsole as we've just\ndiscussed now ful length react X foam\nhere and Nike have kept their two Air\nZoom units just g a little bit of extra\nbounciness in the shoe one at the front\nof the shoe and one at the back of the\nshoe there's no carbon plate in this\nshoe and it has this lovely waffle outs\nsoole rubber in this shoe lovely and\ngrippy and super super durable as well\nthere's no different width options\navailable certainly not at launch anyway\nmaybe that will come in time terms of\ncolorways we've got two at launch in the\nUK USA you're very lucky you got six to\nchoose from and as a side note you can\nget this in the Nikes by you choose your\nown colorway options and that is now\n155 here in the UK and this was true to\nsize for me right let's get stck into\nthe likes right we've got three likes to\nget through my first one is this updated\nreact X phone it is so much more\nimproved from the outgoing version Nike\nsay it's 13% more responsive and it's\nalso helped to reduce Nike's carbon Foo\nPit by 43% when producing the mid Sal of\nthis shoe yes it's just a lot more\nspringy lot more responsive with those\nAir Zoom pods in there as well and\nfinally a Nike P shoe has got a bit more\nlife about it it's a little bit more fun\nto run in it's a little bit more\nengaging to run in and you don't feel\nlike you're running around with two big\nblocks of lead on your feet my second\nlike with the shoe is the allaround\nComfort fantastic amount of padding in\nthe tongue and the ankle getting a\nreally good lock down fit in the shoe\nand a nice even amount of pressure all\nover the front of the foot here really\nlike what they've done with this lacing\nlock down system here it works really\nwell if you're someone that likes to\nheal lace lock I didn't get any sort of\nankle stip in this shoe but if you do\nthe laces are long enough for that if\nyou are someone that runs in some hotter\nclimates I would worry a little bit\nabout some potential overheating this\nshoe but for me in the UK even in the\nsummer here it's been absolutely fine\nand my third like with the shoe is this\nwider toe box combined with this waffle\noutsole provides a really solid nice\nplatform your feet have got a lot of\nspace in the front of the shoe here\nreally good footplay and really good\nsupport as you run along now of course\nI'd love to see Nike offer this shoe in\na wider option but for me I do have\nquite narrow feet but they had plenty of\nspace up the front here and I know this\nshoe will last a long time Pegasus is\nalways due this hasn't changed this will\nbe good for 5 600 miles and I've also\nspent quite a lot of time in the gym\nwith this shoe as well and he's got\nreally good stability that wider\nplatform with that outsole really good\nstability for doing weights and I've\nreally enjoyed it using the shoe for\nthat stability and you can really feel\nthat in cornering but let's move on to\nchat about the dislikes my first one\nhere is this really is not a far shoe if\nyou're looking for something to do some\nspeed workor some races this really is\nnot the one to be going for this shoe\nreally is built for all around comfort\nand all all around durability as well\nthere really are a lot better options\nout there if you're looking for that\nallout speed shoe we'll come on to that\nlater and the second disc like with the\nshoe is it's had a pretty significant\nprice hike and it now takes it from that\nsort of lower range more Budgy shoe I\nhate to say1 shoe was a budget is shoe\nbut in today's modern world that kind of\nis takes it from that up until that mid\ntier shoes and it's now really competing\nwith the Max 6 is with the Nova blast of\nthis world and it's just a lot better\ncom competition around at this price\npoint Nike always had that thing with\nthe Pegasus it always really undercut\neverybody and it's now really slap bang\nin the middle of a super competitive\ndaily shoe market right so let's bring\nthis all together my conclusion who is\nthis shoe for do I recommend it is it\ngoing into my rotation well if you're\nthe type of Runner that runs maybe two\nto three times a week wears the same\nshoe at the gym maybe play some other\nsports in your shoes as well travel in\nit go shopping in it then this is a\nreally good solid 7 out of 10 for all of\nthose different options if you like the\nprevious versions you're going to like\nthis one as well it's a perfectly fine\nokay shoe to get your basic runs done in\nis it worth going to buy the discounted\noutgoing version 40 or this one I'd\nreally say try and find this one if you\nwant to buy the Pegasus this one is a\nmassive step up on that outgoing version\n40 the new foam is so much more fun and\nengaging to run in and it really is just\nthat classic Pegasus do- it- all type\nshoe it's a perfectly fine okay\nacceptable shoe to run in but if you're\nlooking for a more of a dead ated\nrunning shoe you're a bit more serious\nRunner out there the Nike Zone Vero 17\nis a lot livelier it's a lot faster and\nit's a lot more engaging ride with that\nshoe because it's got Nike's zoomx in\nthere built into the midsole which is\njust a lot more fun and reactive to run\nin and it has all the durability of the\nPegasus line as well and then look at\nsome other brands Hoka Max 6 ax Nova\nblast now these are at the same sort of\nprice point as the shoes we've got to\ntalk about them in this debate they've\ngot far superior Foams in there compared\nto the react X much lighter much more\nresponsive and a lot more cushioning in\nthe shoe as well and personally that's\nwhere I'd be choosing to spend my money\nif I just had around that\n13540 to spend on a shoe I really do\nfeel Nike can't win with the Pegasus\nline it's got millions of big fans all\nover the world that will not want this\nrecipe to change they've tweaked the\nphone for the better no doubt but it's\nstill the same fundamental shoe perfect\nfor that beginner novice or casual\nRunner or the more advanced Runner\nthat's looking to get away from all the\nMac stack height shoes out there and\njust wants a little bit more feel at 27\nmil that's now quite a minimal shoe out\nthere as crazy that is and it's really\nquite nice be able to feel that ground a\nlittle bit more of an old school ride\nyes I'll be keeping the shoe without a\ndoubt I've really enjoyed using at the\ngym just casually out and about as well\nbut for me I'm super excited about the\nsupposed upcoming I'm sure it is coming\nNike Pegasus turbo when we're going to\nget a lot more zoom X foam in here f\ncross that is coming soon and when Nike\nwill hopefully finally deliver a\nfantastic allaround daily shoe which is\nso badly missing from their lineup at\nthe moment to rival or potentially\nbetter the likes of the as6 NOA blast\nand the hoker Clifton and the hoker Max\n6 as well and of course I'll be getting\nthat shoe as soon as it drops I'm so\nexcited for it the most exciting shoe\nI've got this year or maybe the super\nBlast 2 I don't know so that's it guys\nlet me know your thoughts down in the\ncomments are you going to be getting the\nversion 41 what do you think about it\nwhat do you think about this crazy\ncolorway I love this I've love wearing\nit casually I've love running it videos\ncoming up next you can check out the\nhoko Max 6 review up here or down here\nyou can check out my aex Nova blast 4\nreview keep on working hard guys keep my\ndone let me know your thoughts down\nbelow and we'll see you very soon in the\nnext one",

      "text": "over the past 6 months I've been buying\nthe best rated running products on\nAmazon to see if they are actually any\ngood I've purchased a real mix of\ndifferent gadgets clothing nutrition\nskin care recovery tools and of course\n100% with my own money there's\nabsolutely nothing here sponsored I've\nbeen testing all of these things out\nreally really vigorously to see if\nthey're going to improve my running or\nit all be one big disappointment and\nwaste of money right starting out guys I\nbought a couple of pairs of balaga socks\nthe best rated socks I could find on\nAmazon they were really comfortable\ndurable still going strong I've done\nprobably a good couple hundred K in\nthese socks and they show absolutely no\nsigns of giving up yet no holes or\nanything like that in terms of the cons\nthey are a little bit expensive Amazon\npricing is always a little bit all over\nthe place different sizes of different\nprices they are really quite thick as\nwell I think if you do run in a slightly\nhotter climate you are going to struggle\nthese are not going to be the most\nbreathable socks and in terms of my\nrating I would give these a 4.8 as well\nmoving on to energy gels to help with\nthose all important long runs and\nmarathon training I bought these CIS\nisotonic energy drills you get this\nvariety pack in a box loads of different\nflavors 22 G of carb in sport and vegan\nas well but I've been using CIS gels for\na very long time and what I really\nreally like about them is you don't need\nany water with these they're really\nreally liquidy and where I've always\nreally like to use these like on the\nstart line of races where you might not\nhave some water around as well really\nnice flavors so if you're the kind of\nperson that suffers with maybe some like\nFlavor fatigue you got loads of\ndifferent options here that you can have\non your run and also coming at just\nabout a pound of gel so something like\nMorton which is sort of a bit of the\nmarket leader you only about3 of gel in\nterms of the negatives of the cyst gels\nthey are a little bit on the large side\nas well and quite heavy for gels and\nthey can just get a little bit messy\nthey're a little bit hard to open and\nthese pull tabs do sort of come off and\nthen normally they fall on the floor\nwhich isn't really great as well but for\nsomeone trying GS for the first time I\nalways really recommend to a lot of\npeople start out with something like\ncyst gels they're really good on the\nstomach they've never given me any\nissues for me i' give these four stars\npersonally yeah they're not going to be\nthe best gels out there in the world but\nfor the value you're getting for these\nthey really are fantastic next up on the\nlist is one of the most oddest looking\nthings can you guess what this is yet a\nlot of you guys recommended this during\nthe winter and I thought I had to get\nthis in now to make it for this video so\nthis is what's called a shoe dryer\nreally good for any homes a bit like\nours without any sort of warm rooms so\nsomething like this can be really good\njust to get your shoes dry when you've\nwashed them or you've been out in the\npouring wind and rain down with rain\nGuys these shoes are welling through the\ndrenched so let's get back home and's\nsee how long it takes them to dry and\nafter I came in after this run the shoes\ntook about 40 minutes on here to be\ncompletely bone dry there basically like\nsome heating elements in the bottom here\nand a little fan inside here and then it\nblows hot air out these things here so\nyou rest your shoes on on there and it\njust basically just very simply blows\nhot air out into the shoes to help dry\nthem a little bit like a hair dryer I\nsuppose but nowhere near as hot as a\nhaird dryer and yeah overall it worked\nreally well I was quite surprised I\nwasn't expecting much in the depths of\nwinter when I'll be using this sort of\nthing a lot more in terms of the\nnegatives it was surprisingly loud if\nyou live in a small place it might be a\nlittle bit annoying so yeah I'd give\nthat four four stars to me now following\non from that when I was cleaning my\nshoes I was using this the boot buddy\nmaybe one of the most famous things to\nhave been on a program called Dragon Den\nin the UK Americans call this shark tank\nfill it full of soapy lukewarm water\nclean your shoes get all that muck off\nthem and then you've also got a scraper\nhere on the back as well just to get any\nsort of nasty or really dried on bits on\nthere as well in terms of what I really\nlike about it it did the job well it\ncleaned my shoes it got rid of dried mud\nor fresh wet stuff as well easy to use\nsuper portable if you're going out to\nthe trails you can just take some water\nwith you clean your shoes before you get\nback in the car in terms of what wasn't\nvery good about it it does run out of\nwater quite quickly a lot of water does\ncome out here so it needs refilling a\nlittle bit but one of these will\nprobably did one shoe for me so I need\nto refill it once to do two shoes if you\nhave got quite small hands it might not\nbe the easiest thing to grip I've got\nquite big hands so that's what it looks\nlike on there in terms of my rating 4\nand a half stars for this only sort of\nslightly let down because for me I'd\nlike a little bit of a bigger reservoir\non it next up I bought some Cal sleeves\ncompression for your calf muscles\nbasically supporting your muscles when\nyou're out there doing activity helping\nincrease blood flow and your recovery\nARS as well the thing with compression\ntechnology it could will be a little bit\nup here in the head but I just basically\nlike to put these on when I'm out on the\ntrip Trails it keeps my legs a little\nbit cleaner stops any sort of brambles\nand Stingers just nasty things when you\nget out on the trails it just helps look\nafter my legs a little bit better so in\nterms of what I liked about these they\nwere just great they were comfortable\nthey were fine the compressed Spore and\n2xu like the flagship ones are going to\nbe about 3540 a pairs these are so much\ncheaper and they did pretty much the\nsame thing I didn't personally notice\nany difference at all in terms of the\nwhat negatives these aren't as nice of\nmaterials as those High Flagship ones\nbut essentially they're all doing the\nsame job so yeah four stars for me\nmoving on we have this rather rather\nNatty invention here bit like a sort of\na sports bra really essentially what\nthis is is for carrying around your\nphone in here in this sort of pouch here\nyou can also put a few little valy boys\nand your car keys up in here this is an\niPhone 14 like the normal size and you\ncan just sort of Chuck that in there\nalong with your house keys or whatever\nand some other little valuables and then\ngo for a run and it works quite well\nstops everything bouncing around I do\nsee quite a lot of people running around\nLondon in these type of things since\nI've always been curious to get one in\nand just see how it feels it's a really\ngood option if you don't know the person\nthat doesn't like an armband or you\ndon't want anything around your waist or\nyou don't want a big sort of pack in\nterms of what I didn't like about it\nit's just not my sort of style if I'm\nbeing perfectly honest and it just seems\nlike a lot of material and faf just for\nbasically carrying your phone which I\nreally personally rather do in my\nrunning belt and that works absolutely\nfine not really the kind of thing I'm\ngoing to ever be using again and keeping\nin my rotation but yeah not to knock it\nat all but I would personally give it\nthree stars now longer term viewers of\nthe channel know my favorite way of\ncarrying my phone and my valuables is\nwith something called a naked band and\nthat just goes around your waist and you\ncan really good carry poles you get\nloads of stuff in there it's fantastic\nbut a kit but they don't sell that on\nAmazon so I can't be reviewing that here\nbut what they do sell on Amazon is\nprobably the best selling belt in the\nworld which is something called a flip\nbelt very sort of similar style of thing\nand I've really been enjoying using this\none here can stick my phone in the back\nhere again some valuable in there as\nwell my keys on this really handy little\nclip that keeps them nice safe and\nsecure in terms of what you really like\nabout this thing super comfortable got\nlots of different colors as well I just\nwent for the plain black easily holds my\niPhone 14 in here and I can you can also\nadd some gels in there as well and it\ndoesn't bounce around at all what I\ndon't like about it it would be nice to\nhave a bit of a security pocket here\nwith a zip but I never had any issues\nwith my keys just on there but stuff can\npotentially fall out I didn't lose\nanything myself but some of the\nreviewers did mention that yeah a little\nbit on the pricey side but really good\nquality product in here I'd give this\n4.3 out of five right moving on to some\nnutrition products I bought this massive\nthing of vegan protein powder 20 g of\nprotein I'm actually on my second packet\nhere now you can get it in chocolate or\nvanilla flavor 100% of vitamin D B12 and\nB6 as well and you get loads of other\nquantities of zinc and magnesium and\niron fruits and vitamins in there as\nwell as the protein that you need taste\nokay probably the best tasting vegan\nprotein as a dedicated protein shake\nthat I've been able to ever find Blends\nokay too it's got no nasty additives in\nthere and it isn't too sweet it isn't\nsickly sweet and it also doesn't really\ntaste too artificial as we also quite\nnice packaging quite cool packaging and\nand you can request it without a scoop\nbecause we've all got Scoops in our\nhouses already and they'll also plant a\ntree for you if you message them after\nyou bought it they will actually plant a\ntree which is a nice little Eco tip\nthere it does get a little bit thick and\ngritty it doesn't have many carbs in\nhere so if you're looking for a\ndedicated recovery Shake there something\nlike cyrio will be better just got a bit\nmore carbs in there so this isn't going\nto be replacing my cyrio but it's just a\nnice little extra thing if I feel like I\nneed an extra protein boost during the\nday so yeah keep this into my rotation\nas I said I've finished the vanilla one\nthat was great Chuck one enjoying that\none as well in terms of my rating we'll\ngive that four and a half Stars right\nsticking with the nutrition theme is\nTailwind you bought a load of these\nstick packs and I've been using them so\nmuch this year to get ready for a big\ncycle race I did a few months ago so\nwhen I've been doing a training on my\nbike I've been using the tail wind\nproducts for that and been feeling\nreally good by using them Tailwind say\nthat this is all you're going to need so\nyou can get all of your sugar salts and\nminerals you're not going to need to\ntakeing any other types of fuel or\ncarbohydrate I don't really agree with\nthat we'll come on to that in a minute\nin my own testing of it what I really\nliked about it very very mild flavor\nit's not overpowering it's really\ndrinkable even when I was feeling rough\nat the end of some of my cycles and some\nof the runs I was doing I could always\nget this down so that was a really sort\nof big positive very easy to drink lots\nof different flavor options you get\nincaffeinated or non-caffeinated as well\nand I've really seen a really good\nImprovement in how long I can last on\nthe bik done plenty of 100 mile rides in\nthe flat here on Swift and 100 mile\nrides outside as well I've definitely\nseen a really big Improvement in how\nlong I can go for and just feeling\nbetter for a little bit longer during my\nCycles as well the stick packs of these\nare really convenient you can put them\nin the back and when you are out in the\nrun just having these in your pack is\nreally convenient as well in terms of\nthe negatives of these the packs are\nreally quite to open they are really\nfiddly and I struggled pretty much every\ntime trying to get into these things I\njust still felt in during my running\npart of this I ran a 50 mile race a few\nweeks ago with these I still need to top\nup with other things but from a cycling\npoint of view these were absolutely\nfantastic in terms of my rating I'm\ngoing to give it like a five for cycling\nfor me but in terms of running it was\nabout a three next up we've got one of\nmy absolute favorites but as I had to\nstock up in the last few months on my\nbody Glide I thought why not including\nthis review because I love this stuff\nit's stops me chafing it's basically\nthis sort of almost like a roll on\ndeodorant type thing you can put it\nbetween your legs by your arms anywhere\nwhere you're going to have some skin on\nskin contact to stop that dreaded\nchafing and potentially ruining your\nruns I've been using this for absolutely\nyears and it's just an absolute staple\nin my running routine in terms of what I\nlike it just works if you put this on\nyou're not going to get any chafing and\nit doesn't really smell of anything at\nall it's really portable easy\napplication and no mess at all in terms\nof what I don't like like about it\nabsolutely nothing really I guess they\ncould have some more eco-friendly not\nplastic packaging but that's about it\nfive stars for me next up guys is my\naftershocks headphones now technically I\nbought these about 3 years ago people\nalways ask me what headphones to use so\nI thought I'd sneak them in because I\nbought these on Amazon or bit about 3\nyears ago these are basically bone\nconducting headphones you can usually\nuse these in races because you can hear\neverything that's going around you\nthere's a really good safety aspect to\nthe headphones if you're running around\na big city near Cod battery life is\nreally good I'm still getting at least 8\nhours out of these headphones really\ngood sound quality so long as you're\nlistening to podcast or audiobook spoken\nword stuff sounds really good through\nthis and music isn't great you know\ndedicated proper headphones in your ear\nwill be much better for music and these\nare an absolute staple in my running\nroutine I basically can't really go for\na run without these I absolutely go\neverywhere with them in ter what I don't\nlike about them you can only really use\nthem for running if you're going to be\nusing these for commuting or any sort of\nnoisy eras you're not going to hear\nanything that's going on mod and areas\nyou're going to be absolutely fine noisy\nareas you can't hear anything and the\nonly other negative I can really think\nof is they have their own dedicated\nlight I think it's called proprietary\ntype cable which if you lose it or you\nforget it you're not going to be able to\ncharge it I'd really love it if\nsomething like this was USBC but it's\nonly a minor sort of setback overall 4.8\nI'll give that it's just annoy it annoys\nme with the stupid charging cable moving\non to some more nutrition stuff now\npeople are often asking me if I could\nrecommend any like snacks and things to\nhave on the go and this is about the\nbest sort of thing I can find find naked\nbars I think they're a British company\nactually fruit and nut bars basically in\nthe states and you can get them in the\nUK if you got a whole food and things\nyou get Lara bars well this is probably\nsomething about the most equivalent to\nsomething like that 100% natural\ningredients no added sugar raw cold\npress available in most big supermarkets\nthey are quite cheap on Amazon and you\ncan buy them in these big boxes I think\nit's 18 bars in a box my personal\nfavorite was the lemon I just love lemon\nstuff anyway in terms of what I like\nabout it reasonably cheap I paid \u00a313 a\nbox of 18 bars and you get loads of\ndifferent flavor options and it's just\nsuper convenient when traveling they\ndon't make any mess but in terms of what\nthey look like it's basically just like\nthat and if you bite into it there's\nnothing that falls down so it's quite\ngood to have in the car if you're going\nsomewhere in terms of the ingredients\nlist all that's got in this one is dates\nraisin almonds coconut cashews lemon and\na h hint of natural flavorings and\nthat's not too bad some not you get some\nlong massive ingredients and they're\njust a good thing to have in the store\ncupboard if you ever get a little bit\npackage in terms of the negatives\nbecause they're sort of like natural\nfruit then the sugars are in them a\nlittle bit high if you're someone that\nhas some sugar problems then maybe steer\na little bit clear of something like\nthis so for me 4 and 1 half Stars\nthey're just a little bit on the small\nside and I only end up eating two at a\ntime right next up is this thing it is\nincredibly heavy but basically this is\ncalled a slant board and I bought this a\nwhile ago to really help with my ankle\nstrength cuz some of you might know I\nbroke my ankle in a skateboarding\naccident about 4 years ago go now I'm\nreally always working on my ankle dors\ndeflection to really try and improve\nthat range of motion have a bit really\nbig disparity between my good foot and\nmy bad foot and also using it to stretch\nout my carve stretch out my CES you can\nadjust it to all sorts of different\nheights there's loads of slant boards\naround this is definitely on the premium\nside of things in terms of build quality\nbut solid metal really good grip you get\non here as well it's like sandpaper type\nthing but it feels really nice just in\nbare feet as well you can definitely get\nsomething a little bit more on the\ncheaper side and I've seen really good\nimprovements with my ankle range of\nmotion if I just test it out and then go\non this for a few minutes and then test\nit again it really does help improve\nthat in terms of negatives but this one\nin particular it's very very heavy\nyou're not really going to transport\nthis around too easily so what would I\ngive this definitely five out of five\nnext up is this some sun cream from a\ncompany called life jacket as some of\nyou guys know I ran the Boston Marathon\nthis year I can't put any of that\nfootage up on the screen cuz Boston and\nMarathon will not like that but during\nthe race I got quite badly sunburnt\nbecause I was really stupid I'm normally\nso conscious of looking after my skin\nbut it just didn't feel that hot that\nday I just forgot about it and got badly\nsome got some heat stroke it's a real\nissue and after the race I did a lot of\nresearch and stumbled across this and I\nthought this would be really good and\nI've been putting into my rotation for\ngoing out on the hotter days in terms of\nwhat I really liked about it it just\ngoes on really well it's not really\ngreasy it doesn't leave any white marks\nand when you get super sweaty on your\nlong runs and things it doesn't really\nmatter it just all sort of rubs in\nreally quite nicely and really like the\ncompany and what they stand for it SED\nby three guys one of them unfortunately\ngot skin cancer and they started this\ncompany so where we're checking out some\nof these smaller companies selling their\nproducts on Amazon so they only make one\nwhich is Factor 50 plus it is a little\nbit expensive but \u00a320 that's going to be\na whole year of suncream for me the\nrating on Amazon gives 4.3 I think it's\nprobably a bit higher than that for me\npersonally so yeah 4.8 for this moving\non I bought another foot roller because\nI lost my beloved roll recovery R3 I\nwent on Amazon searched for foot rollers\nand this was available on same day\ndelivery which is super convenient one\nof the perks of living in central London\nso it's really good for rolling out the\nunderside of your feet keep plant our\nfasciitis at Bay rolling your feet on\nthese little nodules here it just helps\nmassage that fascia sort of stretch it\nout a little bit I really like this\nmiddle section they have in the middle\nit sort of raises up in the middle you\nget some really good angles going on\nunderneath your foot it's super\nlightweight hardly anything at all so\nreally good for traveling around and the\nspikes in this one particular one aren't\ntoo harsh Sarah has an orange one under\nher desk but it's really really severe\nin terms of what I didn't like about it\nit does just feel very cheaply made it\ndoes pick up a little bit of dust and\nthings like that but it got the job done\nI give that four out of five now if you\nwant to know what the best rated running\nshoe on Amazon is then that video is\ncoming up so go and check that out so I\nhope you enjoyed the video guys I've\nreally enjoyed putting this video\ntogether testing out these products and\nbringing that completely impartial\nhonest review as we always do on the\nchannel keep on working hard guys keep\ndone we'll see you very soon in the next\none",

      "text": "a lot of people get into running because\nit's assumed it's a relatively cheap\nsport compared to others all you really\nneed is a pair of shoes right well like\nwith most Hobbies the more you get into\nit the more money it seems to drain out\nof you it's so easy to be influenced\ninto thinking we need the most expensive\nrunning shoes the latest tech but most\nof the time it really isn't necessary\nrunning on a budget doesn't mean we have\nto sacrifice our running experience So\ntoday we're going to be exploring loads\nof affordable options to show that\nrunning can be accessible to everyone no\nmatter what your budget is right let's\nstart out chatting about events running\nevents can really cost a fortune I was\nlucky enough to run New York Marathon\nlast year and it cost me nearly\n\u00a3400 just for the privilege of being on\nthe start line well thankfully there's a\nlot of much cheaper options out there\nstarting out with park run which is\ncompletely free if you've never done a\npark run this is simply a 5K run every\nSaturday morning available at loads of\nlocations all around the world it's got\na really fantastic Community Vibe about\nit and you get a time when you finish as\nwell as a lot of people know park run\nisn't a race but if you do want to do a\nrace and get an official time we' really\nrecommend getting in touch with your\nlocal running clubs in the local area\nrunning clubs are very rarely profit\ndriven and they like to put on little\nlocal lowkey races and all the ones I've\never done have had a fantastic Vibe\nabout them my own club here in London\nSerpentine hosts the last Friday of the\nmonth 5K and it cost just \u00a36 to enter so\nwhat I recommend is just simply Googling\nyour local running club so if you live\nin Manchester put Manchester running\nclubs Newcastle Newcastle running clubs\nsee the events they put on look at their\nevent sections and go out and check some\nof those ones out I guarantee there'll\nbe some really good value for money\noptions Trail Races tend to cost a lot\nmore money to put on so the entry fees\nare always a little bit higher one way\nyou can get some really good free\noptions out there is by doing some\nvolunteering in those races and quite\noften the organizers will give you a\nfree place for the following year\nCenturion down here in the south UK are\nreally good at offering this if you\nvolunteer one of their events you can\nget a free entry K wrath is another one\nif you volunteer then they give you a\nreally good discount on next year's\nentry so maybe get in touch with some of\nyour local Trail organizations and see\nif you can volunteer and maybe get a\ndiscounted or free entry into the race\nof the year after quite often there's a\nlot of community and group runs if you\ndid live in some of the biggest cities\naround the world we got a big one here\nat the moment from tracksmith put on by\nour friend of ours called AMR he gets so\nmany people turning up every week for\nthis free community group run they're\nrunning at lots of different Paces as\nwell doesn't cost anything we'll link\ntheir details Down Below in London but\nas I said just like before just Google\nManchester Newcastle Edinburgh community\ngroup runs and hopefully something will\ncome up a lot of run shops will'll put\nthese on as well so maybe get in touch\nwith a local Running Shop and see if\nthey're putting on some group runs and\nthen finally with all of this join your\nlocal running club if you can afford it\nmy local running club here \u00a345 for a\nwhole year they also offer discounts if\nyou're unemployed over 65 or a student\nthings like that for just2 a year\nfantastic Valley lots of free coaching\nthat you get with that as well unlimited\ngroup group runs and then finally run\nthrough put on a lot of big events all\naround the UK a lot of races I'm not\nsaying they're great value for money but\nthey're not too bad but they also have\nWhat's called the run through Foundation\nbringing a free Mass big sporting events\nto lower income areas around the UK\nright guys moving on to the all\nimportant running shoes so cheap doesn't\nhave to mean poor quality and poor\nperformance we've tested many budget\nrunning shoes here on the channel over\nthe years and while some were really\nreally bad and disappointing others did\nperform actually quite well and better\nthan some of the more expensive options\nout there two of my really big favorites\nwant to check out the Reebok float ride\nseries you talking around about 50 or 60\na pair or the pummer velocity Nitro\nseries as well we're on to Nitro 3 at\nthe moment about 80 or 90 for some\npumers there really good to seek out\nlast year's models as well newer shoes\ndon't always mean better like a lot of\nthings in life when the new version\ncomes out the old model will be on\ndiscount some really Dependable Classics\nyou can look for over the years things\nlike the aex Nova blast series series\nthe Nike Pegasus series The New Balance\n1080 series or something like the hoker\nClifton and then finally there's good\noptions out there to buy secondhand\nshoes now I buy a lot of running shoes\nevery year mainly to review here on the\nchannel and because I buy all of them\nmyself to give you completely impartial\n100% honest reviews we sell a lot of\nthose on eBay and vintage as well and\nthese are really good marketplac to have\na look you can look at Facebook\nMarketplace or some of the groups like\nrunning gear buy and sell on Facebook\nthat people that will sell pretty much\nnearly new shoes shoes a lot of running\nretailers you can't send things back so\nif people get shoes they don't quite\nlike they're going to be selling them\nthey might have only done a few miles in\nthere just to test them out so you can\npick up some really good secondhand\nBargains I would say don't try and buy\nshoes that are more than like one or two\nyears old really because of the foam and\nthe glues just don't tend to last that\nlong but if you are looking for some\nnewer clothes kit and gear some really\ngood brands that offer exceptional value\nBrands like Ron Hill the legendary Ron\nHill one of the best ever British\nMarathon out there Company still going\nstrong making some really good value\nproducts and also Classics like the\nCatalin Brands like high five you can\nget some really great deals on high five\ngels fantastic value and really good\nproduct as well it's scored really well\nwhen I've been testing out their gels\nthings like goodar for some fantastic\nsunglasses really good polarized options\nfor not a lot of money and a brand\ncalled at Tru which is a new running\nshoe brand out there we've tested out\nsome of their shoes as well all being\nreally really good options so let me\nknow down in the comments your best\nrunning Brands out there that offers\nsome really good value and where You'\nlike to find all of your Bargains and\nthen finally have a look at some Sal\nsection on some website I've got a sale\nSection on my website and a lucky di\nsection as well where we sometimes sell\noff some slightly damage or seconds or\nsamples and things like that so we'll\nlink to that section down below as well\ncheck out benp parks.com where you can\nfind amazing running hats technical gear\nand trading plans to help with your\nrunning now a lot of people when they\nget into running they don't invest too\nmuch in New Gear a lot of people say go\nand get a watch now if you can't really\nafford a watch then I just recommend\ndownloading driver on your phone and it\nwill track your mileage and your\ndistance and your time and get all those\nreally basic things that you need to be\ntracking during your running but if you\ndid want to get yourself a running watch\nthen have a look at something like the\nGarmin 55 for around about \u00a3 150\nfantastic value it has really all the\nrunning data that most people will ever\nneed choros I think got the pace three\njust over \u00a3200 some of these watches\nmight seem a little bit basic but I see\nso many people spending so much money on\nrunning watches and then use like 5% of\nthe features on them or you can suiz get\nsome older discounted models on websites\nlike C I've always gone into store with\nCX just to check what it's like but I've\nbought a few watches in there over the\nyears and they always worked out really\nwell but I always like to just go into\nthe shop first to see what the\nconditions like see if I got any\nscratches and things like that you can\nsell your old watches to them or buy new\nwatches off them well cheap running kit\ncan be great there's also an argument of\nyou get what you pay for spending a\nlittle bit more money on your kit can\nmean it's less likely to break or fall\napart it will last a hell of a lot\nlonger for you saving a lot of money in\nthe long term for example I bought four\npairs of Saw shorts I've actually got a\npair on here this evening about 4 years\nago and I wear them pretty much all day\nevery day and they're still going strong\nI've done thousands of kilometers in\nthem the quality has been absolutely\nfantastic there some really good brands\nthing like saw tracksmith Lululemon\nthings like that Mak some really good\nquality gear now when we race on the\ntrails you tend to need a lot of a quite\nexpensive gear to be able to do there's\na lot of mandatory kit and things like\nthat myself and Sarah usually share some\nsome of the items that we have with\nother Runners around and they share some\nstuff with us for example we did a race\nlast year where we needed some spikes\nwhat are they called Sarah micro\n micro spikes and we didn't want to\ngo out and spend \u00a3100 on those so we\nborrowed some off some of our running\nfriends around so ask again in your\nlocal community asking your running club\nmaybe on Facebook groups and things like\nthat if you just want to borrow\nsomething that's a mandatory kit item\nfor a race if you can't afford to buy a\nlot of these things there is an\norganization here in the UK called into\nUltra which aims to rake ultra running a\nlittle bit more accessible by providing\nsort of help and discounted options with\nrace entries kit and training as well\nyou can borrow some equipment off them\nso if that appeals you then again we'll\nlink to their details down below right\ntwo more things to go through second\nfrom last all about run commuting I used\nto really like doing this type of thing\nback in the day and I still run to\nmeetings that I have in London as well\nturning up a little bit sweaty but I'm\ngetting my run done you'll also save a\nlot of money on your travel class safe\ntime because you're getting your run\ndone while you would ordinarily be\ncommuting so maybe see if that's an\noption for you and then finally looking\nout for some affordable training plans\nthat can help with your running of\ncourse we have these on our website all\nof our beginner plans are completely\n100% free no catch at all just go on\nthere and download them we offer a lot\nof really good value I feel we do offer\nreally good value with all of the\ntraining plans we have on the website so\nif you want to know more all about cheap\nrunning shoes and which ones to avoid we\nbought the very cheapest running shoes\nfrom all the biggest brands out there in\nthe world so check that video that's\ncoming up next",

      "text": "[Music]\nNike has just launched the second\ngeneration zigama with a few big changes\nthat will hopefully solve the issues\nthat many people face with version one\nI've just put 100 miles through this\npair here to see if Nike have finally\nsolved their outso issues that have\nplayed a lot of their recent trail shoes\nso coming up we've got all my likes my\ndislikes and there's a few so stay tuned\nfor that and to see if this shoe is\ngoing to be going into my rotation and\nof course like everything on this\nchannel I've bought this shoe 100% with\nmy money to give you my complete\ncomplely honest impartial unsponsored\nthoughts on this shoe to make sure that\nyou get the right shoes on your feet if\nyou're running right let's get stuck\ninto this review and get the zigama 2\ndone so the big update from version one\nwhich is here to version two is this all\nnew Vibram outsole the grip on version\none was really truly terrible especially\nin the wet and the dry it was okay but\nthe wet was just a disaster so now we've\ngot this updated Vibram Mega grip out\nsoole that Nike put in the shoe they'\nalso the upper a little bit and just\ntided a few little things up made a\nlittle bit more aerodynamic and they've\ngot a little bit more of a rocker on the\nfront here as well versus the outgoing\nmodel not any big updates up top the big\nupdate everyone's talking about is that\noutso right let's have a chat about all\nof the facts and figures starting out\nthe purpose of a shoe like the zigama 2\nthis is very much a longdistance cruisy\ntrail shoe built for Comfort terms of\nprice wise this sent me back\n\u00a3160 buying this off the sport shoes\nwebsite site here in the UK it's going\nto be around about $180 or\n\u20ac180 stack card at the back Nike is so\ngood they love telling us all these\nfigures well they really don't it's hard\nto find out but we're thinking around\nabout 36 mil stack at the back and\naround about a 4 mm drop overall in\nterms of weight for me this is coming at\n389 G in my UK size 12 the outgo model\n387 so 2 G basically exactly the same as\nthe outgoing model it's a neutral shoe\nthe upper of the shoe this engineer mesh\nupper hopefully getting a nice amount of\nbreathability through there we'll come\non to that later on in the review the\nmidsole of the shoe we've got Nike's\nFlag ship zoomx sort of wrapped up in a\ncarrier foam to protect it out of those\nTrail so super squishy super bouncy very\nresponsive and now zig's finally joined\nultrafly Nike sort of Flagship carbon\nplated Trail shoe to have that Mega grip\nout soole Unfortunately they haven't put\nit in the Nike Pegasus Trail 5 which\nwe'll be reviewing soon on the channel\nbut yeah the zigama and the ultra have\nthis fantastic grip on the bottom there\nare no different widths available terms\nof colors we've got two at launch here\nin the UK and five in the US rather\nbizarrely they're all very light colors\nso a lot of people like some darker\ncolors when they're running on the trail\ncuz they get muddy and everything bit\nodd and finally this was true to size\nfor me in my UK size 12 exactly the same\nsize as I had in the outgoing model\nquickly guys if you are find this video\nso please smash that like button share\nit with a friend and let us know your\nthoughts down in the comments Below on\nwhat you think about Nike cigar you are\nyou interested in it are you going to be\ngiving it a go or could you recommend\nsome other options out there to help out\nthe community and if you got time please\ncheck out my website benp parks.com that\nwould be really fantastic where we make\nthe best running hats and Technical gear\nin the business thanks very much guys\nright back to the video so starting out\nwith my likes the first one is this\noutsole that Nike put this vibrant Mega\ngrip the wet grip the dry grip the\nallaround traction in the shoe is night\nand day better than the outgoing model\non mud rocks wet Dr it all past with\nflying colors as I said I've done 100\nmiles in this shoe I've barely slipped\nat all my second like with the shoe is\njust the stability and it's just got\nsuch a smooth ride through the\nfootstrike I think a lot of that's\nprobably coming from this outsole it\njust gives a lot more rigidity there's a\nlot less chance of rolling your ankle\njust a lot less of this sideways\nmovement you get with a shoe compared to\nthe outgo model which just will move a\nlot more so in corners and changing\ndirection it really handles it very well\nlove this sort of increase rocker we've\ngot at the front here so when you are\nrunning on Tac sort of as a more of a\nroad to Trail shoe you can run in much\nmore of a natural way as well so it\nreally gives you a lot of confidence\nwhen you're out there with that grip and\nthat stability as well my third like the\nreason I really like the originals of\ngar was it super comfortable that\nComfort remains here it is still super\ncomfortable and you've got so much\ncushioning to protect your feet when\nyou're out on the trail yes it's a high\nstack shoe it's not going to be for\neverybody but if you're looking for that\nsuper soft super comfortable just\nrunning over rocks and everything in\nyour path without really even feeling\nthem or noticing them then you're really\ngoing to like running in the shoe and\nthis is what the shoe looks like after\n100 miles of running it's really got\nvery little we on there so far so\ndurability with this is really going to\nbe fantastic and I'm expecting to get a\nlot of miles out of this the ankle Gator\nat the back for me it's kept all the\nlittle rocks out and I personally didn't\nhave any heel slip issues in the shoe at\nall and we'll touch on that a little bit\nin the negatives coming up so with that\nlet's get stuck into the negatives the\nfirst one being it's still quite a big\nheavy clunky shoe but at least there\nhasn't been any weight gain with this\none they also do run a little bit hot\nI've been running in in quite hot\nconditions it's coming into the summer\nmy feet have been getting a little bit\nwarm in this shoe as I've been running\nalong hasn't caused any issues but if\nyou are in a particularly hot climate\nyou may get some overheating issues in\nthe shoe my second is like is\nsurprisingly a little bit on the narrow\nside now I did quite a long RAC in the\nshoe at the weekend the new upper just\nseems to have a lot less depth to it and\nwhen I took my feet out at the end my\nfeet were so scrunched up sorry I\nhaven't got any fidget this my feet look\ndisgusting my feet were so sort of\nscrunched up and I actually did have a\ncouple of small blisters starting to\nform just because it felt a little bit\non the narrow side they look very\nsimilar to the outgo model never had any\nissues in that it just has a little less\nmaterial up the front here and the feat\njust haven't got as much room to spread\nout and breathe up at the front it's a\nreal shame at the moment there's no wide\noption with the shoe because that would\nbe a really good one to go for if you\nhave got some wider feet I really think\nit's it's one to avoid but on my shorter\ntraining runs had no issues at all like\nthat it was just when I was going out\nfor a super long time feet were getting\na bit swelled up towards the end of a\nvery long day out on the trails and my\nfinal dislike is the laces are just\nbizarrely quite short so if you are\nsomeone that has some ankle slip issues\nit's going to be really quite hard to do\nthat heel lock lacing I did manage to do\nit as you can see the footage here now\nand one thing the outgo model had was a\nhalf decentish toe bumper at the front\nso if you stab any rocks or trees you\nhit that that seems to have disappeared\noff this one now I did have quite a bad\nfall in the sure I just hit a tree route\nas you can see I've got a little bit of\ndamage on my arm here and and on the\nknee if you can see that but I didn't\nhurt myself in any way but yeah just the\nend of my end of my feet were just a\nlittle bit sore from that would be nice\nto have had a proper toe bumper on there\nfor when we are heading out some more\ntechnical Trails especially in the\nmountains when you get a lot more rocks\nand things so in conclusion let's bring\nthis all together who should be looking\nfor a shoe like this there someone\nthat's looking for that long distance\ncruisy shoe that screams all day comfort\nso long as your feet aren't too wide and\nthere now going to have the confidence\nthat it can run in all different\nweathers and conditions with this\nfantastic updated outsole if you're\nlooking for a lightweight Nimble shoe\nthen this one really isn't for you if\nyou as I say if you have got a slightly\nwider foot you are going to struggle\nwith this if you were a big fan of the\nzigama 1 are you going to like this I\nthink very much yes the updates of the\noutsole are really really good so will\nthis be going to my rotation W\ndefinitely yes I'm going to be enjoy\ndoing a lot more training Mars in this\nover the summer if I had another race\nsay next week would I be reaching for\nI don't think I would I think I'd be\ngoing back to my version one because\nit's just got that slightly wider\nfeeling up at the front but I'm going to\nenjoy putting some more testing miles\nthrough this to see if that was a bit of\na weird oneoff in that race or whether\nwe have really got that slightly\nnarrower toe box in the shoe as I've\nexperienced if you do go for a pair make\nsure you test them out really well\nindoors before heading outside just make\nsure you're getting a good lock down no\nsort of heel slip and yeah just see how\nthat front of the shoe feels but overall\nfantastic update on the bottom next up\nwe're going to be testing Killian all\nnew Tamir version 2 from New Normal some\nmassive vibrant Mega grip lugs on the\nbottom of that one so going to be really\nlooking forward to testing that one out\nnext up we've got Nike's whole Trail\nlineup if you want to check out some\nother Nike Trail shoes then check that\nvideo coming up here now that's it guys\nlet me know your thoughts down below\nkeep on working hard keep on get done\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

      "text": "as a new Runner coming into the sport\nbuying your first pair of shoes can be\nextremely overwhelming is it a case of\nthe more expensive the shoe the better\nit's going to be what does all that\nrunning shoot jargon actually mean of\ncourse it's a lot to take everything in\nbut today we're going to make it super\neasy to help you narrow down your search\nwe've got six different options and two\nbonus pairs at the end so stay tuned for\nthat to really give you a good head\nstart on your running Journey as with\nall the videos here on the channel I've\nbought these shoes 100% with my money\ntested them out myself there's nothing\nsponsored nothing gifted nothing like\nthat at all or we ask if you get benefit\nout of our videos to hit that like\nbutton leave us a comment down below\nshare the video and of course check out\nmy website benp parks.com where we make\nand sell the best running hats and\nTechnical gear in the world so what are\nwe looking for in our first pair of\nrunning shoes well we want something\nthat's going to be nice and versatile\nsomething you can run on the roads or on\nthe treadmill something that's going to\nbe of course very very comfortable out\nthe box long lasting and we want some\ngood value for money here as well so you\nmight have heard this term a neutral\nrunning or a stability running shoe and\nwe need to work out what type of shoe is\ngoing to best suit us it's a rough guide\nabout 80 85% of people are neutral\nRunners and about 20 15% need a\nstability shoe with their running the\nbest thing you can do with this is go to\nyour local running shop where they can\nput you on a treadmill analyze your gate\nand see how you're moving and tell you\nif you're going to need a stability sh\nbut as a Rough Guide if you do have\nparticularly flat arches then you may\nbenefit from a stability shoe but if you\nhave normal or high archers then opt for\na regular normal running shoe we'll link\nsome resources down below if you want to\ndo some testing of this at home before\nyou go out and get yourself a pair so if\nyou have bought your pair of shoes\nonline and they've come how do we know\nif they fit correctly it's a rough guide\na rough rule of thumb should we say you\nshould have about a thumb's width at the\nend of the shoe between the top of your\nbig toe and the end of the shoe you\ndon't want to have your toes right up\nagainst the shoe when we run our feet\nwould expand a little bit again if you\ncan get into your local running store\ntest out a few pairs they're going to\nmake sure they fit properly some online\nretailers do allow you to use use the\nshoe test it and send it back if it's\nnot quite right so always check out the\nterms and conditions with where you're\nbuying your shoes from there's a couple\nof terms I'll be chatting about today\ndrop and also stack height starting out\nwith stack height well that is basically\nfrom where your heel would sit at the\nbottom of the shoe the distance between\nthat and the ground so that is going to\nbe around about this figure here the\nhigher the number with the stack height\nthe more foam the more man of cushioning\nthe other thing we're going to have a\nchat about is drop and that is basically\nthat figure there that stack height the\ndifference between that and then the\nstack height at the front of the shoe so\nmost running shoes have around about\nsort of four up to around about 12 mm of\ndrop it just tilts the foot forward a\nlittle bit barefoot running shoes or if\nyou are running without any shoes on at\nall that would be 0o mm drop that is\ngoing to be flat on the ground but it\njust takes a little bit of pressure off\nthe carves it tilts the body for a\nlittle bit helps us to get the feet\nnicely moving under the body as well\nright let's start out with my top\nrecommendations for beginner Runners\ntaking into account everything we've\nsaid before we're going to go through\nthese shoes starting at a a low price\npoint and finishing at a higher price\npoint and at the end I'm going to go\nthrough my favorite one of these and\nit's not the most expensive and Chad\nabout a really good stability and Trail\nshoe option for beginners so starting\nout with my first recommendation the\ncheapest one here the Reebok flight ride\nversion five round about \u00a385 no one's\ngoing to pay that I think I paid \u00a355 for\nmy first pair of these the stack height\n27 mil 8 mm drop overall true to size\nfor me there's no different widths\navailable now what I really like about\nthis shoe with the recent updates has\nbecome a much more comfortable and\nstable shoe really good versatility at\nall sorts of different distances very\nhighly durable outsole to the shoe as\nwell so really last and just fantastic\nvalue for that price point one of the\ncheapest shoes out there but also a\nreally really good option also very nice\nlightweight feel for the shoe as well\ndoesn't feel like you're carrying around\nloads of extra unnecessary weight now\nwhat I didn't like about the shoe it\njust takes a little bit of breaking in\nthat foam takes about 20 mi to soften up\nget nice and squidgy but after 20 mi it\nreally starts to come to life so yeah\nthese shoes are a little bit more on the\nfirm side that stack height little bit\nlower than a lot of other shoes but you\nlike a little bit more ground contact\nfeel then this can be a really good\noption to go for moving on to around\nabout 110 L for the pummer velocity\nNitro version three this new version has\ncome out recently I think I paid around\nabout 85 for these off start Fitness\ndrop 10 mm in the shoe 36 mm stack\nheight at the back of the shoe and yes\nthis was true to size for me and you can\nget this in a wide version if you get it\noff the pummer website what I really\nliked about the shoe again super\ncomfortable the Nitro foam that Puma\nusing in the shoe is really fun and\nbouncy and it's just really versatile at\nall sorts of different distances the\ngreat fantastic grip you get on the\nbottom of the shoe this pumer grip this\nrubber out soole fantastic in the wet\none of the really best wet weather\nrunning shoes that you can buy for any\ndifferent price point at the moment and\nthe durability of this shoe will last so\nlong in terms of dislikes for this shoe\nis a little bit on the narrow side so if\nyou have a slightly wider feet then\ndefinitely check out that wider version\nright moving up to a slightly higher\nprice point now the main difference\nbetween the shoes we've been talking\nabout and these ones is these are going\nto be a little bit more stable little\nbit more cushioning and they're going to\nbe slightly more durable as well some\nslightly better materials that they're\nmade with although really the Puma shoe\nwe've just talked about really does\nperform as well as these next two shoes\nstarting out with the hoker Clifton 9\none of the absolute Classics of the\nRunning World now in its ninth version\nmy shoe sent me back \u00a3130\n5 mm drop with the shoe stack height of\na 32 and it was true to size for me I\ncan make this in a wide variety of\ncolorways they also make it in the\nstandard width and the wide width as\nwell now what I really liked about the\nshoe is it was really nice and\nlightweight but still offering a really\ngood amount of cushioning Under Foot\nsuper comfortable very breathable and\nthe foot feels really secure no blisters\nno hot spots what I really didn't like\nabout the shoe is it's now just slightly\ndated the foam of the shoe is just\nslightly dated it really needs ping up\nwith a new update it doesn't feel too\nsquishy but maybe some people will like\na slightly firmer ride and this is is\nhooker's bestselling overall Ru and also\nthe hok of Clifton is probably the most\nlike fashiony shoe here Tik tokers\ninstagrammers absolutely adore the\nClifton 9 for casual as well now if you\nlike the style of the hooker shoe you\nmay want to check out the Max 6 which\njust has a slightly better quality foam\nin it to run in but it's just not quite\nas durable moving on to one of my\nabsolute favorites from last year when I\npicked this shoe up in New York at the\nNew York Marathon Expo was the aex Nova\nblast verion floor version two version\nthree were absolute Classics and version\n4 aex really delivered again now I paid\n$140 for this at the Expo around about\n\u00a3135 8 mm drop in the shoe stack height\n41 and A2 it wasn't true to size for me\nI had to go half a size down what I\nreally liked about this shoe nice and\nlightweight nice and cushioned the Eco\nfoam that aex used in the shoe is really\ngood fun to run in it's engaging it's\nresponsive Ive and just super\ncomfortable overall again no hot spots\nno blisters so much padding around the\nankle and at 135 really fantastic value\nfor the quality of the materials and the\nquality of the product when you feel it\nin your hand you're running along with\nit it really is a great value what I\ndidn't like about the shoe it's just not\nfantastic in wet weather it has asexy\nslightly lower density foam which should\nbe really nice and grippy and it works\nfantastic in the dry but in the wet it's\njust a little bit slippy but nothing to\nworry about too much as long as you are\na fair weather Runner right moving on to\nsome higher price point options here and\nnow we're starting to pay for a little\nbit more Tech some softer more\nresponsive Foams and just that extra\nlevel of allout comfort and the next\nshoe we're going to have a chat about\none my most comfortable shoe of all time\nin a recent video we did we'll link to\nthat one up there and that is this the\naex Joe Nimbus version 26 which sent me\nback \u00a3180 run $160 or\n\u20ac200 drop of 8 mm in the shoe overall 42\nmil stack kite a load of phone to look\nafter those in joints and muscles when\nyou're out on your run true to size for\nme three different widths available in\nthe shoe the standard width which is\nactually pretty good I was absolutely\nfine with that wide or extra wide what I\nreally like about this shoe is it's just\nsimply the most comfortable shoe that\nI've ever worn from my running the foam\nis so soft underf fooot and the upper is\nreally really stretchy as well super\nsupportive at the back again loads of\nreally nice padded foam to look after\nyour feet no rubbing anywhere in the\nshoe no blisters no hot spots or\nanything like that and it really is a\nshoe you can just put on and absolutely\nforget about when you're going out of\nthose nice easy jogs this really is a\njoy to run in the dislikes with a shoe\nlike this because it is so soft and\nsquidgy underf fooot is a little bit\nharder to pick up the pace for some\nfaster running it's also a little bit on\nthe expensive side as well but if you're\nlooking for the most comfortable shoe to\nstart your running Journey then this one\nis definitely one to check out right\nmoving on to the most expensive shoe\nhere \u00a3210 for the new balanced fuel cell\nsuper comp trainer version 2 this is\nalso really highly rated in my\ncomfortable shoe video in terms of drop\n6 mm drop in the shoe stack height 40 mm\noverall this was true to size for me and\nthere are no different widths available\nas you might be able to see just through\nhere and if I click on it it has a piece\nof carbon that runs through the shoe\nthat just helps and assists us with our\nrunning and I think for a beginner\nRunner that wants to have a look at some\ncarbon shoes this is a really good entry\npoint into the market what I liked about\nthe shoe yes Supreme comfort with the\nshoe had absolutely no issues really\ngood for someone that's potentially\ntraining for their first marathon eats\nup those miles on those Long training\nruns it's very stable as well and the\nfoam is super bouncy it's really fun and\nengaging it puts a smile on your face as\nyou run along it really makes you want\nto run really really fast as well no\noverheating issues at all really nice\nbreathable upper the upper part of the\nshoe good air flow going through there\nas you run it's just a really good\noption if you potentially want to do\nsome races in the future or push your\npace a little bit more it is slightly on\nthe heavy side and I can't deny it over\n\u00a3200 is definitely on the expensive side\nif you've got that sort of money that's\nfantastic and this shoe will really not\nlet you down right we've got two more\nshoes to have a chat about the first one\nis a beginner Runner that's looking for\na stability shoe I'd really recommend\nhaving a look at the Brooks Adrenaline\nGTS which stands for goto support that\nsupportive element version 23 now this\nshoe sent me back\n135 35 mil stack at the back 12 mm drop\nit was true to size for me and in true\nBrook style they offer this in four\ndifferent widths available what I liked\nabout the shoe super durable this shoe\nwill last a long time and the stability\nelements of the shoe just to keep that\nArch nice and supportive on the inside\nthey are there but they're not too\nintrusive you don't really notice them\ntoo much it's just an absolute classic\ndaily option really good price point for\nsuch a longlasting shoe as well what I\ndidn't like about the shoe the Pham was\na little bit hard to start with but it\nreally does soften up over time so don't\nworry about that too much and last but\ndefinitely not least my favorite\nbeginner shoe for someone going out on\nthe trails this is perfect for someone\nthat doesn't want to do all of their\nrunning on the roads maybe live out in\nthe country side do a little bit of\noff-road running through Parks Forest\nGrass or maybe you live up in the\nmountains already and you want to\nexplore some Trails do some hiking or\nsome running on those Trails something\nthat has a little bit of extra grip for\nthose rougher surfaces my girlfriend has\nrecommended these shoes to me because\nshe is a far better Trail Runner than I\nam and it's the hoker quite a smelly h\ntaking it off H got speed goat version\nfive I've done many miles in my version\nof this as well but I thought it really\nnice she put some footage of Sarah now\nrunning in this shoe round UTMB now this\nshoe set had back \u00a340 4 mm drop overall\n38 mm stack height and it was a true to\nsize for her as well on the official\nHoka website they do offer lots of\ndifferent widths available and the\ngortex waterproof version if you're\ngoing to be doing a lot of winter\nrunning now what Sarah really liked\nabout the shoe and I I would definitely\nagree with her the viam outsole is\nreally grippy on this shoe vibr are a\nseparate company that makes them\noutsoles and their own shoes as well and\nyou're going to get some really good\ngrip in all sorts of different weather\nconditions here it's also super\ncomfortable for very long periods of\ntime Sarah ran the hold of UTMB in this\nexact pair of shoes so around about 40\nodd hours of continuous running and\nHiking through the mountains in the shoe\nand gave her absolutely no issues\nwhatsoever it's super lightweight and\nvery breathable as well some dislikes\nthe not fantastic for their durability\nsome people have had some upper issues\nwith toes poking out the side and also\nthe regular normal version of the shoe\nreally is definitely on the narrow side\nso if you have a particularly wide foot\ndefinitely check out the wider options\nhere now if I had to choose one shoe to\nrecommend above all of the others as\nwe've chatted here today I think I'd\ndefinitely go for the aex Nova blast\nversion 4 or if money's a little bit\ntighter then definitely look at the Puma\nthey're my two standout shoes for\nbeginner Runners so now you know what\nshoes to go and buy let us know how you\nget on with them but you're also going\nto want some really good beginner\nrunning tips well I've got you covered\nthere that video is coming along next\nwith my very best Runner Tips click up\nhere for that well guys keep on working\nhard keep it done we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

      "text": "an ultramarathon is any run or any race\nlonger than a marathon so anything\nlonger than 26.2 mil and today we're\ngoing to be covering everything\nultramarathon how to get into it what\ntype of ultramarathon you might like to\ndo what kit you might need some good\nfirsttime events plus we'll also have a\nlook at what the training looks like and\nI promise you it's probably not as hard\nas you might think it will be so stay\ntuned for that now over the last few\nyears I've run some 50ks some 50 MERS\nand a handful of 100 MERS as well and\ntoday I want to show you that ultr\nrunning really can be for everyone now\nyou might well think that running an\nultramarathon is surely one of the\nhardest things that you can do in\nrunning and while yes there are lots of\nreally tough races out there but there's\nalso a general Vibe around Ultras that\nthey're a lot more relaxed than running\na road Marathon for example and some\nUltras can take you some incredible\nbeautiful parts of the world and that's\none of the reasons why ultr running is\nin such a big boom in recent years there\nare so many different distances surfaces\nformats there's so much variety so I\nguarantee there'll be something in here\nfor you now the standard distances in\nUltras tend to be 50k 5050 MERS 100K 100\nm 200 MERS and anything up to around\nabout 250 mil for the most part we'll\ncome on to some longer races a little\nbit later on the video and I should say\nif these are on Trails they'll be a\nroundabout this sort of figure nobody's\nmeasuring these courses out on Trails so\nstarting out with 50k this will\nobviously take you a little bit longer\nthan a marathon moving up to 50 m mil\nand 100ks you're talking around about\nsort of 10 to 15 hours to complete\nsomething like this you're not going to\nbe running consistently through this\nwhole distance for a lot of people there\nmight well be some walking brakes some\nwalking up some of the hills moving on\nto 100 mile distance for most people\nyou're talking around about 20 to 30\nhours to finish 100 mile probably no\nsleep you'll be running through a whole\nnight and then moving up to the 200 250\nM distance this really is not for\nbeginners but I thought you might like\nto know a little bit about it here with\ntalking for three plus days sleep\nbecomes a big factor in these sort of\nraces getting that sleep and then\ngetting back up and running as well now\none of the very biggest road Ultras in\nthe world is a race called comrades\nwhere myself and my partner Sarah who's\nfilming this will be traveling to very\nshortly it's around about 90 km every\nyear the distances do change slightly\ncomr is quite a hilly run you either go\nup or down and lots of undulations along\nthe way but for a lot of people they\nmight like to start out with something\nflatter now in the UK we have a lot of\ncanal races Gran Union Canal R 135 Mi\nrunning from Birmingham all the way down\nto London races along the temp's path\nyou can then be influenced with\ntemperature as well some very hot races\nsomething like spartathlon 153 Mi\nthrough the heat of Greece in the summer\nor something like bad water 135 Mi\nthrough California's death valley or\nmaybe someone that prefers running in\nthe cold something like Ark of attrition\nhere in the UK in the depths of Winter\nthe spine race they got lots of\ndifferent distances but tapping out\naround about 20 60 Mi and then winter\nDowns 200 M here in the UK as well and\nthen moving on to some slightly\ndifferent races track races the 400 met\nAthletics track a fantastic mental\nchallenge now these going to be the time\n6 hours 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours even\nlonger up to about 6 days we hear some\nof these events are going on for now and\nit's simply how far you can run in that\ntime or they might Simply Be\ndistance-based things so again your 50ks\nyour 100 miles going around the track as\nwell really races here in the UK\nsomething like Crawley 24 the self\nTranscendence 24hour in battery moving\non to a new type of running which we've\nseen in the last few years called the\nbackyard Ultra started by Lazarus Lake\nGary Cantrell the guy that started uh\nBarkley name that and this is simply\nrunning a\n4167 mile loop on the hour every hour\nand it's the last man standing now we\ndon't know how long this race could last\nthe record at the moment is 450 miles or\n4 and a half days you can then do Ultras\nin the mountains some big races things\nlike UTMB Hard Rock T western states or\nmaybe you want to look at something like\ndoing an fkt a fastest known time not an\norganized race check out the fkt website\nmaybe a big challenge in your local area\nwhere you want to be the local Legend as\nstra would say but you could be the fkt\nholder for something like that and then\nyou might like to look at something like\nstage races the big ones here Marathon\ndesabla MDS dragons back K wrath Ultra\nthere's a set amount of distance you\ncover each day and then the clock stops\nat the end of each day and it's your\ncumulative time over a period so a lot\nof these may be around about a week of\nrunning and the winner will be the\nperson with the least amount of time\nrunning and then finally the longest\ncertified foot race in the world\n3,100 miles the self Transcendence in\nQueens New York at the moment the male\nrecord of 40 days of running to cover\nthat 3,100 Mi the female record 45 days\nthere were just six finishes last it\nwhen the race happened just an iconic\nrace go and read all about it some\nfantastic documentaries we'll link to\nthose down below most of these races\nwill have Aid stations where you have a\nchance to refuel with nutrition and\nliquids that the race is giving out some\nof the races will also allow outside\nassistance from your crew these are\npeople that you'll know and they'll\nfollow you around and can stop off at\ndesignated checkpoints for them and be\nable to give you assistance so again hot\nfood change of clothes some drinks as\nwell and the sun races will also allow\nwhat's known as Paces particularly\npopular in the United States and you can\nhave a buddy that will run with you help\nkeep your pace make sure your spirits\nare high motivation high and just for\nsome instances in some more remote\nlocations it's a good safety thing to\nhave out there as well one of the\nbiggest things with running Ultras is\nyou've got to find your why people\nreally need to find out why they want to\nbe doing this it's not a natural thing\nfor the brain to be out there running\nthese tremendous distances simply\nchallenging yourself pushing yourself\nmentally and physically further than you\never thought you could do they really\nare good fun as well and that can be a\nwhy a lot of people might be escaping\nsomething escaping a dull job a bad\nrelationship we've all been there over\nthe years and it can simply bring a lot\nof joy to your life a lot of purpose\nalternatively just want to go out and\nexplore see some new parts of the world\nsimply escaping for me I just love the\nSolitude of being out there for hours on\nend running through some beautiful\nscenery just a sense of Peace and\nFreedom phones and stuff are away you're\njust out there you and the trails with a\nsingle thing to do it's a really\namazing experience when you're out there\nsome people do get a little bit\ndisillusioned with Road running all the\npaces the splits setting PBS the speed\nsessions and things you've got to do and\na lot of that does go out the window\nwith ultra so some people can find a\nreally new love of running by running\nlong and giving themselves slightly\ndifferent challenges and also some older\nRunners do turn to Ultras maybe they\ncan't be hitting those PBS they want\nanymore so if you've decided when I get\nout there and run an ultra what are some\ngood races to have a look at we're\nstarting out in the south of the UK here\none of mine my girlfriend's favorite\nCenturion running offer anything from\n50k the 50k 100 Hills where we\nvolunteered at last year it's a really\ngood very beginner focused Ultra event\nso we'll link to Centurian running down\nbelow threshold races like race of the\nking race of the stones race of the\ntower I've done two of them myself but\nthey really are very welcoming they\noffer very generous cut offs you can\nwalk a lot of these races as well so you\ndon't need to worry about being timed\nout and things like that and they all\noffer some of those amazing a stations\nout there are very proud of their 9 %\nfinisher rate so really most people will\nget round some other organizers to have\na look at things like serpent Trail SVP\nwhich I think stands for Star Valley\nparth I'm not sure 50k and 100K GB\nUltras and also Ultra X if you want to\ngo a little bit longer if you want to\ntravel a little bit further field from\nthe UK have a look at the list of UTMB\nraces that they now have all over the\nworld they normally pretty much always\noffer races anything from about 20K\nnormally up to 100 bars plus and if you\nwant to look at some slightly longer\nraces as well then have a look at the\nworld Trail majors and new setup they\noffering some really amazing experiences\nall around the world we'll link to all\nof these down below please let us know\ndown in the comments what are your\nfavorite beginner friendly races maybe\nin your country you've got some\nfantastic things help out the community\nand let everybody know now of course\nwhen you start training and racing a lot\nof these Ultras you're going to need\nsome basic kit to get you going so\nstarting out with the fundamentals\nyou're going to need to get yourself a\nrunning pack because you're going to be\nrunning a lot longer than you would be\nduring a marathon you need to have a way\nof carrying some supplies with you some\nnutrition some water some extra clothing\nand some safety kit as well so you have\nto be a little bit more self-sufficient\nyou're also going to want to get\nyourself a really good quality\nwaterproof jacket something that has\ntape seams just because when we out\nthere for a long period of time the\nweather can turn especially if we're out\nin the mountains you're also going to\nwant to get yourself a head torch most\nraces that are over 50 Mi are likely to\ninvolve running during some periods of\nDarkness especially if they're going to\nbe winter races you're also going to\nwant to find yourself some trail shoes\nsomething that's going to be a little\nbit more grippy a lot of Ultras will be\non Trails or off-road and you're really\ngoing to benefit more from having that\nextra grip but also a more sturdy and\nharder wearing shoe they going able to\nwithstand a lot more abuse then also\nsome basic safety kit out there so a\nfirst day kit a foil blanket a means of\nnavigating around for most people that's\nsimply on their watch and of course a\nfully charged mobile phone now of course\nall of this kit doesn't come cheap\nthere's an organization here in the UK\nput them up on the screen now link to\nthem down below that help some\nindividuals that are less able to afford\na lot of this kit to be able to get into\nthe sport so if that applies to you then\nas I say We'll link to them down below\ngo and check them out so in very simple\nterms what does the training look like\nfor an ultra well for a standard 50 to\n100K race the type of thing you would\nfind here in the UK you're talking\naround about 15 to 16 weeks of training\nthe same length as a standard marathon\ntraining block basically if you want to\ncheck out our training plans for these\nwe'll link to them down below the main\ndifference between marathon training and\ntraining for Ultras like this you want\nto really try and get in something\ncalled backto back long runs so lot of\npeople this might be on the weekend of a\nlong run Saturday and then a long run\nSunday getting used to running on tired\nlegs fatiguing them on Saturday and then\ngetting out and running them again on\nSunday to give them even more of a\npunishment strength work is so important\nhere you might be able to get by with\njust doing some basic stuff at home but\nideally want to be getting into the gym\nand lifting some weights and building\nthat strength that you're going to need\nto power yourself up the mountains down\nthe mountains and really run strong at\nthe back end of a race another top tip\nis really try and train on as similar\nterrain to your goal race as possible if\nyou're going to be doing Arc attrition\non the coast path try and get down and\nrun on the coast paath if you're doing\nsome canal running run on the canals if\nyou're going to be racing in the\nmountains try and spend some time in the\nmountains getting used to What It's Like\non the exact terrain of your goal race\nand also with the training a lot of very\neasy low heart rate relax zone two\nconversational Pace running building a\nreally big base strong cardio system\nthat is going to allow you to run a very\nlong way without burning out nutrition\nis so important with ultr running we\nneed to be fueling our body throughout\nthe race to be able to run strong all\nthe way through it so we also need to be\ntraining our gut trying new things\nexperimenting with all the weird and\nwonderful types of race nutrition you\ncan get out there and that has to form a\nbig part of the training so when you get\nto race day you've got your nutrition\nplan sorted and you know your body's\ngoing to respond and be well to it and\nnot give you any gut issues so moving on\nto our livite nutrition section here as\nI've just said ultra running is not so\nmuch about running it's all about eating\nand consuming calories as we go along\nnow you may think that sounds like a\nperfect wonderful day out there but so\nmany people become unstuck in this area\ngetting GI issues being sick because\nthey haven't consumed enough calories or\nthe right calories that their body wants\nif you can't keep your food down you\ncan't fuel yourself and you can't\ncontinue and you'll be tapping that dnf\nbutton unfortunately it's as simple as\nthat now there are lots of different\nways you can fuel your runs and keep\nyour energy levels topped up some\nRunners like to stick to your standard\nSports Nutrition so your gels your carbs\nthings like Tailwind or like Morton\nother people like to have sort of like\nreal foods things like sandwiches crisps\nnuts fruit things like that that some a\nstations might be giving out as they go\nround but as I've said it's for you to\nfind the right strategy for you a lot of\nRunners will come into an a station get\nas much stuff as they can and then leave\nthat a station while walking maybe up a\nhill or something like that and then\nkeep on consuming calories and getting\nthat down as they parir on through the\nrace if you can keep the sickness and\nthe digestive issues at Bay and able to\nkeep yourself fueling you have a much\nbetter chance of getting to the finish\nso if you got your training done your\nnutrition done the final big crucial\nthing with Ultras is all about what's\nbetween the ears the mindset ultr\nrunning is around about in my opinion\naround about 90% in the head and about\n10% in the body the physical aspect of\nit dnfs us usually occur because the\nhead has given up far far earlier than\nthe body has things do get tough weather\ncan get bad aches pains blisters\nsickness the distance remaining and you\nlook down watch and it still says 140k\nto go it can be very overwhelming and\nyou start questioning your why so make\nsure you work out your why before you\neven get out there one of the very\ntoughest races that I've ever done when\nI had to push my body and mind further\nthan it had ever gone before Was a Race\nI did in Cape Town 100 km and if you\nwant to watch that that video is coming\nup here keep on working hard guys keep\ndone let let us know how you get on in\nyour Ultra training and racing that's it\nwe see you in the next one",

      "text": "running a 5k at Max effort is one of the\nvery hardest things you can do in\nrunning the margin between a Flawless\nrace and complete disaster is Razor thin\nbut when you have a good day and\neverything clicks it really is one of\nthe best feelings and I know that's what\nyou're going to experience after putting\neverything in practice that you're going\nto see in this video because I'm sharing\nmy very best tips on how to run that\nfaster 5K we'll go through the training\nyou need to do the sessions that help me\nrun a 1526 at a park run 5K and some\nbonus race tactics too so stay tuned to\nthe end of the video for that right\nlet's get stuck into it how to run a\nfaster 5K so how long do you need to\ngive yourself to train for that faster\n5K well ideally you want to give\nyourself around about 10 weeks for a\nsolid training block which\ncoincidentally is the exact amount of\ntime that all of our plans are that we\nhave on the website so maybe check those\nout at benp parks.com so you need to\nfigure out where and when you want to\nhave this 5K attempt and then work\nbackwards 10 weeks from that maybe a run\nmaybe a race but making sure somewhere\nthat is nice and flat without too many\nsharp turns as well but maybe you're not\nthat bothered about having an official\n5K time and you just want to go by your\nstraa go by your GPS and find a nice\nflat fast loop somewhere near your house\nwe'll put a list down below of the\nfastest Park runs here in the UK and a\nfew race organizers that we know\norganize some really fast races as well\nto get that official 5K time if that's\nwhat you're after check out the links\ndown below so many people come and ask\nme what is a realistic IC time that I\ncan be aiming for well this obviously\nvaries wildly between the amount of\ntraining that you've been able to do in\nthe past our historic training in our\nlegs but newer Runners are able to make\nsome significant improvements in those\nearly stages the more experienced\nRunners are because they're already\ngoing to be a little bit closer to their\nlimit so the margin of improvement is\ngoing to be a little bit smaller but as\na Rough Guide with around about 10 weeks\nof training this is roughly where you\nneed to be before starting these\nattempts so for someone looking for a\nsub 20 you should already be about sub\n22 for a sub 25 you need to be already\nbe about sub 28 and for a sub 30 attempt\nreally need to be at least sub 35\nminutes moving on to have a chat about\nweekly mileage how far do we need to be\nrunning every week during our training\nwell for a sub 20 attempt we're talking\naround about 5 to six runs a week up to\naround about 40 miles or 64k in total\nvolume for sub 25 we're talking four to\nfive runs a week up to around about 30\nmiles 48k of total training and for a\nsub 30 attempt 3 to four runs a week up\nto around about 20 mil or 32k that total\nvolume during the week in order to run\nfaster over that 5K distance we need to\nget the body used to running at that\ngold pace and even a little bit faster\nthan that gold Pace as well and a great\nway to do this is incorporating speed or\nworkout sessions during our week we'd\nreally recommend setting aside one\ndedicated run during this week more\nexperienced Runners might want to\ninclude two of these sessions during the\nweek but we'll touch on that a little\nbit later on on now these workouts will\ninvolve running at a hard effort for a\nparticular amount of distance or time\nfollowed by a period of rest and\nrecovery and then repeating this a\nnumber of different times so here are\nsome really good sessions that you can\ntry to incorporate into your week all\naround about 4 to 5K of total overall\neffort the first one 8 to 10 times\nrunning 90 seconds repeats this will be\na little bit faster than our goal pace\nand then about 90 seconds to 2 minutes\nrelax walking recovery between each of\nthose blocks the second session I really\nlike to do is 6 times 3 minute reps at\nthe goal pace and then around about a\n2minute walking recovery between those\nreps as well and then my third one what\nI like to call kick down C so it's four\nto six reps of a k but we're doing the\nfirst 800 M of that rep around about our\n10K pace and then kick down at the end\nfor that last 200 M at our goal pace so\nwith these ones we want to add in around\nabout a 2-minute walking recovery\nbetween those reps really helps to get\nthe body working at effort towards the\nend of a rep simulating what it's going\nto be like during that 5K race before\nall of these we need to start out with\nabout 10 to 15 minutes of very light\njogging doing some running drills and\ngetting the body warmed up and ready to\nbe running fast now alternatively your\nlocal running club might well be putting\non some weekly speed sessions so maybe\ncheck those guys out and also a lot of\npeople ask me do I have to be doing this\nat a running track well if you've got\none near you that's great they are\nreally good and you'll know you can run\nsome exact distances if you do your\nsessions there but you really don't need\nto have a track there just find\nsomewhere nice and flat available to you\nand ideally traffic free as well also if\nyou weren't aware most of our GPS\nwatches that we wear you can program\nthese sessions into your watch and then\nfollow it through so you don't have to\nremember exactly what you're doing in\nyour head all the time you've got a\nGarmin choros all the major\nmanufacturers look up how to program\nthose workouts into your watch so as I\ntouched on before if you're a fairly\nexperienced Runner and you've already\nused to a lot of this type of training\nyou could include a second speed session\nduring the week as well I would\npersonally recommend focusing the first\nspeed session of your week on some\nshorter reps something like a 10x 400 m\nand then the second session of your week\nsome slightly longer reps so something\nlike 3 to four * 1 mile reps or even\nlook at including something like a 20\nminute tempo run which will elevate your\nFitness even more moving on to a little\nsecret that I really love and I really\nwish more Runners would put this into\ntheir routine because they are fantastic\nthat is something called strides now\nthese are really mini reps little burst\nof speed of pace around about 20 seconds\nof fast running around about 90% effort\nwe say here and it's really good to\nincorporate these when you finish one of\nyour easier runs throughout the week now\nif you're new to stri you've never done\nthese before then maybe start out with\nfour reps of this and after each of\nthese just give yourself round about the\nsame around about 20 30 seconds just to\nrelax and recover get yourself focused\nagain before you're ready to go on the\nnext rep now it's so important with\nthese to be focusing on good form and\nstaying nicely in control we don't want\nto be doing all out Sprints here the\nmain benefit of doing things like\nstrides they're really good at\nrecruiting they fast twitch muscle\nfibers so you can put in a strong Sprint\nfinish at the end but most importantly\nthey really help improve our running\nform it's very hard to run with bad\nrunning form when we're running at this\nsort of pace the rest of your week\noutside of your speed session should\nideally involve some kind of long run\nand then also some easy runs in there to\nhelp build and maintain your endurance\nthe speed sessions during the week do\nput a lot of stress on your body so\nyou're going to need to include some\nrest stays in there so our body can\nadapt and recover but we also need to be\ndoing some easy runs during that week at\na nice low intensity running\nconversational Pace because if every day\nwas one of those allout speed sessions\nwe would get injured very very quickly\nso how long should our long runs be for\nsomeone training for a 20 minute 5K\nprobably around about 7 to 10 miles\nsomeone training for a sub 25 we're\ntalking six to eight miles for the long\nrun someone training for sub30 around\nabout 4 to7 miles the pace of these\nshould be nice and relaxed very easy\nZone 2 heart rate conversational Pace\nthe kind of pace you can have a chat\nwith a friend if they were running next\nto you on the screen now we'll put some\npacing recommendations for anyone\nlooking for that sub 20 sub 25 or sub30\npacing recommendations for those easier\nlonger runs and then finally race day is\nhere how are we going to go about\nputting these 10 weeks of training into\npractice well for me there's two\ndifferent ways you can Pace a 5K run\neither start slightly slower than your\ngoal pace and then speed up as the Run\ngoes along so a nicely Progressive Way\nstart out slower than gold Pace then to\nGold Pace then finish strong ahead of\nour goal Pace or as I think most people\ndo and what I like to do is set out at\nmy gold Pace running nice even splits\nall the way there and then in that last\nlittle bit at the end the last 300 M or\nso really give it my all kick down for\nthat stronger finish if you're the kind\nof person that likes to go out hard and\ntry to bank time that rely rely works\nmost of the time this ends up in blowing\nup and you'll just see on straa that\npacing chart that just goes like that is\ngetting slower all the way down you want\na nice even splits all the way through\nso do we need to eat or drink anything\nduring a 5k well probably not if it's a\nreally really hot day then potentially\nwe want to be taking on a little bit of\nwater but for most people they're going\nto be fine to get through this distance\nof course if you're thirsty please do\nhave something to drink with gels or any\nother race nutrition we aren't going to\nneed these during the race some people\ndo like to take a gel on the start line\npotentially but really your body will\nhave enough fuel in it to get through\nthe 5K some races and some Park runs\noccasionally do have pacing groups as\nwell so I'd really recommend having a\nlook into that if that's the kind of\nthing you're looking for helps take away\na little bit of the mental stress of\nworrying about your pacing and then how\ndo we set up your watch well I'll put my\nexact watch setup on the screen now for\nme when I'm racing a 5k I really like to\nfocus on just my lap pace which is the\npace I'm running that particular a\nkilometer for me cuz I work in\nkilometers but oh that's that particular\nK or or that particular mile if you're a\nmild person and I just like to stick to\nthat and tick each one off so for me\nwhen I ran my 15 20 or something like\nthat I was just looking for round about\n303 304 for each K yeah I'm sticking to\nthat nicely it ticks off and then I want\nto repeat it again for the next K\nrunning a 5k flat out really is one of\nthe hardest things that we can do in\nrunning believe me when you cross the\nfinish line look down at your watch in\ndisbelief at what you've just managed to\nachieve it feels feels amazing it's\nincredibly addictive so please let us\nknow how you get on in your next 5K race\nI always love to hear how everyone gets\non in their training one of the most\nimportant aspects that we need to also\nfit into our training is making sure\nwe've got a really good strong head on\nour shoulders to keep pushing when\nthings get really tough around about\nthat 3 and 4K Mark so to learn some\nreally good mental tricks you can take\nthrough to your next races check out\nthis video next",

      "text": "hello everybody and welcome back to the\nchannel and welcome to Boston I'm here\nfor the\n128th Boston Marathon in a couple of\ndays I am beyond excited potentially\nhopefully I'm sure we will be completing\nmy fifth ever major on Monday my first\nBoston the nerves and the excitement are\nbuilding so so much just absolutely\npumped we taking part in this legendary\nrace one of the most famous running\nraces anywhere in the world here we've\ngot a actionpack video for you coming up\ntoday we're going to be going to the\nExpo talking about my kit got a big\nShakeOut run to go to and of course all\nmy goals and expectations for the race\nbut for now it's Saturday morning I've\njust keyed in a 10k run into my watch\nand we heading out for a little ShakeOut\njog we got here quite late last night\nI'm a little bit jetlagged but overall\nsuper excited for this and thank you\nguys you make this all possible for me\nto come and run races like this but\nthank you so much we'll catch up out on\nthe Run\n[Music]\nthat is the Run done 10K 44 minutes a\nlittle bit faster we did have a few GPS\nissues with all the to building TR here\nso probably more like 45 minutes let's\nuh have a quick shower and get up to the\nExpo really enjoyed that what a lovely\nplace to\n[Music]\nrun right guys here we go we made it\ndown to the Expo super excited we pick\nit right now I've been treat me of this\nfor so many years taking my running\nseriously for I don't know about 10\nyears or so and yeah I've run quite a\nfew big qes over the years but it's\nnever really panned out to actually get\nhere and come and pick up my number and\nrun the race I just get my phone out and\njust see what number I am we are\n1,8 right oh we're right here let's go\nhave a look hi afternoon how you doing\ngood here's your runner's bag thank you\nall right congratulations for your first\nmarathon thanks very much thank you\nthank you\n[Music]\njust heading through all the merch area\nnow at the moment it's just absolutely\ncrazy uh but a little bit overpriced for\nus the jackets are\n$120 oh we don't want to go in the\ncheckout we're not buying a thing if you\ndon't know about Boston to get into the\nmarathon I I actually don't even know\nwhat race are you to get in but you have\nto run qualifying time so about four\nfths about sort of 80% of the field will\nhave run that qualifying time to get\ninto the race for people in like 18 to\n35 men you've got to run a sub three\nhour and then go a little bit faster\nthan that as well because it's just the\nfastest around about 30 35,000 people\nthat do the race that actually sort of\nget in and uh yeah the other sort of\nfifth of people are all sorts of like\nsponsor places or people doing\nInternational tour operating places that\nsort of things so you don't have to\ntechnically run the bigy\nbut Myers you kind of should do really\nkind of it's what it's all about running\nyour BQ and coming here to\n[Music]\ncelebrate Sarah now you're on this side\nof me you can speak into the microphone\nhow excited are you for the London\nMarathon exp spr next weekend yes I'm\nvery\nexcited I know that doesn't sound like I\nam but I am excited you've got the\ncontrast of me and Sarah but uh yeah\nwe'll be at London Marathon Expo next\nweekend uh we've got a stand there so be\nweek next whole week Wednesday Thursday\nFriday and Saturday we've got a stand\nthere with all of our running hats and\nour tops and our gear and all of that\nsort of stuff loads of you guys are\ngoing to come down

ever like inperson thing really\nlooking forward to it and uh yeah can't\nwait to see you guys there\n[Music]\nso on this massive board behind me is\nthe list of six star finishes I'll\nhopefully be joining them soon um if I\nfinish Boston I don't to keep saying\nthat I'm sure we'll finish Boston on\nMonday but uh you never know with me\nlet's be honest um then I'll only have\nTokyo to do which we may try and do next\nyear I have got in touch with a couple\nof the travel companies I've tried to\nget in so many times just one of those\nthings it's all a bit complicated I\ndon't really know but I am hopefully\ngoing to be trying my ab\nto get into Tokyo Marathon next year so\nwe can finish it off and get my six star\nfinish probably before it goes to Seven\nStars um and then we'll have to go to\nSydney to finish that one off everyone\ngetting their norm tech legs done\ngetting nice and recovered before Monday\nit's keeps see so weird to say the RAC\nis on Monday but yeah Patriots

then we're\njust going to head out up the road here\nso you might see behind me because that\nis the Finish Line Of The B marathon\nwhere we will be on uh Monday so yeah\nreally excited for that

haven't seen any\nof those in the UK they're not coming to\nthe UK anyway but uh as a car fanatic\nprobably one of my biggest Hobbies it's\nuh quite nice to see my first cyber\n[Music]\nTru right walking back through the\nFinish Line what is going to be on the\nclock when we cross that well I don't\nknow I have I get my excuses out the way\nfirst but I had about 5 weeks off\nrunning in February with a hamstring\nlike strain which was really rubbish so\nI haven't really done any workouts this\nyear my mileage has been all right but\nright here right now apart from Rolling\nmy ankle a bit this morning on this\nmorning's run um we're kind of okay so\nI'll take anything on a sub 250 will be\na really good run I'm here just to have\na laugh make a good video experience\nHeartbreak Hill and just experience the\nmass magic of the race all my big\ntraining will be focused on Valencia at\nthe end of the year just want to have an\namazing experience out there so yeah sub\n250 Happy Days with that I'll set off a\nlittle bit faster and just see see how\nwe go but I've really got no idea to be\nhonest cuz I haven't been done any\nproper long workouts my longest run so\nfar this

      "text": "you've gone through months and months of\ntraining done countless miles and now\nthe big day is finally here you'll no\ndoubt be nervous and a little bit\nstressed about the day ahead especially\nif you're running your first marathon\nand not knowing what to expect well\ntoday we've got a full race day\nstepbystep guide to get you from the\nstart to the finish with full time\nstamps throughout the video to help ease\nyour nerves and get you pumped up for\nthe great Marathon that we know you're\ngoing to have so with 2 to 3 hours to go\nwe're going to wake up get out of bed\nthe first thing I like to do is check\nthe weather for ask is it going to be as\nexpected is it all good do we need to\nmake any last minute changes it's likely\nthat you won't have slept that great but\ndon't worry about this it's happened to\nme so many times and so many other\nthousands of Runners around the world it\nreally doesn't make too much difference\njust get up and get your breakfast down\nyou that's the most important thing we\nshould be doing in the morning for me I\nlove to have a bagel or two Bagels\npeanut butter and jam now you might not\nbe feeling like eating too much at this\ntime of day most likely due to some\nnerves and you might be just a little\nbit earlier than you'd normally be\nhydration here is also equally really\nimportant for me I'm trying to have\nabout 1 and 1/2 to 2 L before the race\nthis is usually for me about 2/3 of my\nvolume out having in a sporty\ncarbohydrate drink something like a\nMorton 320 or a Precision hydration carb\nmix and then for the other third in a\nseparate bottle I'll have some\nelectrolyte fluids in there as well I'll\nbe sipping on these drinks throughout\nthe whole morning all the way up to the\nstart line and then while I'm sipping on\nmy drinks I'm getting all of my race day\nkit ready as well I I've laid it out all\nnicely the night before and then's\ndouble checking I've got everything have\nI got my number have I got my pins to\nput my race number on have I got my\ntiming chip as well my Watch My Shoes my\ncap my singlet and my socks then there\nmight be some other little bits and\npieces that you going to need as well\nthat you can take off your checklist\nthings like headphones if you're going\nto be using those your gels how you\ncarrying everything your pack or your\nwaistband plasters body Glide your\nmobile phone just get all of this into\nyour drop off bag that you're going to\nbe taking to the store D line and also\nat this time of day you want to be\nthinking post race as well maybe a\nlittle snack for when you finish the\nrace you can get something down quite\nquickly for me I like to put a recovery\nshake mix in there some powder that's\nready to go also some flip-flops because\nmy feet will probably swollen up a\nlittle bit during the race flip-flops\nare usually the most comfortable thing\nand then really the most important thing\npostr is some warm clothes your body is\ngoing to be pretty trashed after the\nmarathon and keeping warm is just a\nlittle bit harder marathons tend to not\nbe at the warmest time of year as well\nso nice big Puff jacket to put on after\nthe race moving on about about 1 to 2\nhours to go we're probably in a car\nwe're on a train we're on a subway\nheading to the race village where the\nstart of the marathon will be this\nreally is now the time to focus on what\nis coming up think back over all the\ntraining that you've been doing\nreiterate your why what has got you to\nthis moment why are you doing this we've\nall got our own personal reasons go\nthrough your a b and c goals as well be\nso proud of yourself you've made the\nstart line that is a massive achievement\nto do two in long distance running now 1\nhour to go we'll hopefully arrived at\nthe race Village I personally like to\nget there a little bit earlier than that\nwhat I really like to do first is one\nfind the toilets go to the loot and then\nfind where I'm going to be dropping my\nbag off because that's a real stressor\nfor me there'll be big bag drop places I\njust like to pinpoint where those two\nthings are that's all I'm focused on for\nthe next hour or so pre-ra make sure\nyou've bought your own L roll as well\njoin the back of the L queue or the\nPorta poty L as soon as you get there\nand come out the L and then maybe go\nstraight to the back of the queue again\nbecause by the time you get to the front\nof it you're going to need to go a lot\nof pre-ra nerves a lot of people are\ngoing to be needing to go to the L more\nfrequently than you might regularly be\ndoing because you're going to be\nnaturally quite nervous about what is\ncoming up now is a good time to get the\ngels out of your bag get your pack on or\nyour belt on get everything in there\nthat you're going to be taking through\nthe race for me I need to get my camera\nand my GoPro out and put that in my\nwaistband as well then now it's time to\ngo and check that bag in and make sure\nyou've taken a nice warm item with you\nthe sweater something you're going to\ndiscard on the start line just to keep\nyou nice and warm most races will then\ndonate these clothes so don't feel too\nguilty about chucking something away\nright the nerves are going to be rising\nabout 30 minutes to go before they off\nfor me carrying on sipping on my sports\ndrink getting a banana down is something\nI really like to do just helps settle my\nstomach a little bit as well and also\nperson in some Road Racers like to take\na little em modium tablet again just to\nhelp s my stomach I do not want to be\ngoing to the L during the race that's\nnot what I'd recommend everybody to do\nbut it's just something that works for\nme and I've always done it it's also now\ntime to start to think about having a\nlittle jog around and getting ourselves\nnice and warmed up dynamic stretches and\ngoing for a little jog this is a really\ngood time to do this when we're our\nCorrals or our starting pens we're not\ngoing to be able to do that it's going\nbe very busy in there for me it's\nusually about about 5 to 10 minutes of\nvery slow jogging just getting\neverything moving and nicely warmed up\nand then lots of dynamic stretches my\nleg swings opening and closing the gate\nand also a good time to check while\nwe're doing our warming up how are our\nshoes feeling are they too tight are\nthey too loose hopefully they're just\nright but now is the time to readjust\nour lacing and making sure we've got a\nreally good solid lockdown we don't want\nto be having uncomfortable slipping\nshoes just as the race starts the more\nimportant the race for me the more times\nI double knot or triple knot or\nquadruple knot my laces Valencia ran I\nthink I did five different knots with my\nlaces they were never coming undone so\nmake sure your shoes feel nice and\nsecure it's time to head to the start\nline and get yourself in that start line\npen then around about 8 to 5 minutes to\ngo I like to get my GPS watch locked on\nnice and early with the amount of people\naround looking for GPS you want to get\nthat locked on nice and early I think\nthe garments don't time out for about 10\nminutes so got about 8 minutes to go I\nlike to get that nicely locked on ready\nto go time to ditch that warm layer\nmaybe have a chat to a few other people\naround you just keep your nerves in\ncheck and then before you know it's the\nrace start thousands of people crossing\nthe start line including you offer an\namazing adventure for maybe the next two\nif you get dry three four five 6 7 hours\nwhatever it's going to be wishing you\nthe very best of luck now these are my\ntop tips for what you should be doing\nduring the race the first one as we\nstart know your Paces be patient ignore\nwhat everyone else around you is doing\neveryone's going to have their own goals\nso many people go off far too fast at\nthe start of the race and don't get\nsucking into their Pace or suddenly\nthinking you can go 30 minutes faster\nthan you've actually prepared for if you\ndo suddenly decide to go off way quicker\nthose last 6 miles are going to be\nreally really horrible around about 30\nminutes into the race you should be\nnicely settled in and feeling quite\nrelaxed hopefully the rad have got a\nlittle bit quieter because it can be\npretty chaotic at the start of marathon\nraces this is really when you're going\nto start to think about having your\nfirst gel we recommend taking something\naround about every 30 to 40 minutes\nduring the marathon but whatever you've\ndone in training whatever gels you've\nbeen using in your training for me it's\nnormally a Morton gel or Precision\nhydration gel but only use what you've\nbeen practicing with in your training\nthings are probably going to be\nhopefully feeling very comfortable at\nthe stage as still don't be tempted to\ngo any faster you really should be\nrunning it at your goal Pace or slightly\nslower than your goal Pace at this point\ndon't get stressed out about it too much\nit's all part of the plan now in terms\nof water stations my goal is always\nlittle and often don't go try and\ngulping or glugging massive loads of\nwater at each station that's going to\nslow you down it's going to really feel\nquite uncomfortable as well so to just\nsip little and often now one of the most\nimportant sections of the marathon is\nhalfway to 20 mi keep ticking off those\nsplits I like to focus on simply the\nparticular K or the particular mile that\nI'm running in I just focus on that on\nmy watch lap pace for the particular K\nor particular Mark and I'm now I'm\nstarting to think about picking up the\npace a little bit gradually as well and\nmaking back some of that deficit from\nthe first half the race gels might have\nbecome a little bit harder to get down\nnow but you really got to work on\ngetting those down and no doubt by this\nstage of the race you'll have probably\nstarted to run in a little group of\npeople around you maybe you're in a\npacing group as well which we'd always\nreally recommend just look around you\ntake it all in what you're doing is\nabsolutely amazing running a marathon\nand just give yourself a little mental\npat on the back and just say you can do\nthis push on and keep ticking off those\nsmiles and now we've approached the\nhardest part what all of this is about\nwhat makes the marathon so amazingly\nspecial the final six miles but why it\nmakes it special because it's so\ndifficult but don't worry you done the\ntraining set won't be too bad some\npeople say this is the real halfway\npoint of the race and it really is in\nterms of effort the first 20 miles and\nthe last six miles effort wise they're\nprobably going to be around about the\nsame think of your Mantra think of your\nwhy focus on the runners that are up\nahead of you and if you paced your\nMarathon quite well you're going to\nstart to pick those people off just keep\ntrying to push the pace as much as you\ncan and it really does feel very good\nwhen you start overtaking people towards\nthe back end of a marathan one of the\nnicest feelings in the world but yeah\nsorry to those people they should have\nwatched more of my videos and Pac it a\nlittle bit better some Runners like to\nthink of their loved ones at this stage\nas well and dedicate one of the last six\nMars to each one of those people just\nfocusing on them in your mind and it\nreally will just help to Spur you on but\nessentially you're trying to hold it\ntogether you can do this you've trained\nfor it and you can get it done whatever\nyou've got left in the tank now is the\ntime to empty it take in the atmosphere\nand the crowds maybe it's time for a few\nhigh fives to pump yourself up and get\nthat Marathon done and then before you\nknow it you'll be crossing the finish\nline hands in the air you are now a\nmarathon finisher or multile Marathon\nfinisher get your medal get a bottle of\nwater whatever else they're giving out\nto rehydrate start getting that recovery\nprocess done as soon as possible but\nreally take a moment to recognize what\nyou've just done what you've achiev you\nare amazing and now you're going to have\nan amazing story to tell all of those\nloved ones around you for the rest of\nyour life about this incredible\nachievement you've just done then it's\ntime to go and collect your bag put on\nthose warm clothes meet your friends and\nfamily potentially go out for some food\nwhatever you fancy it really doesn't\nmatter and then finally take some photos\nremember this moment get your medal\nphotos you may not feel like being up\nthere smiling straight away but future\nyou will really appreciate then of\ncourse finally get that run up on stra\nand show everybody how amazing you've\nbeen then in terms of the rest of the\nday and maybe the days after it's really\nimportant just to keep mobile keep\nwalking around keep hydrating through\nthe afternoon and the evening then yeah\nobviously you're going to travel back\nhome to a hotel wherever you're staying\nget a good shower just chill and relax\nin the sofa you might not be feeling\nthat hungry a lot of people don't it's\namazing how much you think of having a\nmassive pizza or bowl of pasta when you\nfinish the race and then you actually\nfinish it you lose all your appetite I'm\nnot sure what that's all about but it's\nhappened to me many times but probably\nby dinner you're going to have a pretty\nraging appetite and then get yourself\nsome good sleep again it's really odd\nafter a marathon for me I really don't\nsleep very well your body's just going\nthrough a massive recovery process You'\nprobably got a bit of an elevated heart\nrate a little bit warm and things like\nthat so you might not sleep very good\nstraight after the race but don't worry\nyour body will get back to normal pretty\nsoon so yes you've been amazing but what\ncould make you even more amazing uh is\nto have a much better stronger mental\ngame which is so important with Marathon\nrunning so that video is coming up next\nall the mental tips and tricks to help\nyou exceed it your marath that's just up\nhere keep it working hard guys keep down\nwe'll see you very soon in the next one",

      "text": "you've put in the hard work done\ncountless Mars over the last few months\npushed through many difficult runs no\ndoubt highs and lows along the way\nrunning has completely taken over your\nlife but you can now finally see the\nlight at the end of the tunnel that\nstart line is in sight congratulations\nyou've reached the taper phase my name\nis Ben Parks 225 Marathon I've run\nnearly 100 marathons over the years and\nCoach so many athletes to achieve their\nPBS over the Marathon distance this is a\ncollection of everything I've learned\nand used in my own training and everyone\nwe coach so starting out what is\ntapering well in simple terms that\ntapering is reducing the volume we are\nrunning each week to maintain our\naccumulated Fitness while allowing us to\nfully recover from the training block\nthat we've just been through this full\nrecovery period we're about to go\nthrough will allow us to use that\nFitness to its full potential and reach\nrace state in our Peak state to go out\nthere and perform if you don't take then\nyou run the real risk of arriving at the\nstart line tired and fatigued so many\nRunners are really scared of losing\nFitness but over the tape of period our\nmuscles will be repairing our body is\nrecovering our mind is recovering as\nwell it will give us the opportunity to\nsharpen everything up to be in the best\npossible shape on the day all of our\ntraining plans follow a 3 we taper the\nfirst week you've only got a very small\nreduction in the amount of volume and\nthen two weeks out you see a decent\nreduction and then one week out quite a\nbig reduction in overall volume right\nlet's go through each week in detail\nstarting out with 3 weeks to go so with\n3 weeks to go you're talking around\nabout a 10 to 15% drop in overall volume\ncompared to our peak week so if your\nbiggest week was 100K for example this\nweek you're talking around about 85 to\n90k in volume we want to be keeping our\nintensity the same so our long run our\nspeed sessions and our strides should\nstill be in there just as they always\nhave been the number of runs should stay\nthe same as well we're just slightly\nreducing the the length of those runs\nyour long run this week is still going\nto be fairly long around about 16 to 18\nmil for a lot of people and it's the\nfinal chance to practice in your race\nday kit and with your race day nutrition\nas well to make sure they're completely\ndialed in so you're going to be feeling\nreally confident you also want to have a\nquick look at your nutrition now just\nmaking sure you're getting some good\nprotein sources in there each week just\nto help that recovery and help our\nmuscles repair right it's getting a\nlittle bit serious now 2 weeks to go and\nthis has been a lot of people St getting\na little bit nervous and thinking\nthey're going to be losing a little bit\nof a fitness but don't worry trust the\nprocess you're going to be fine at this\npoint in the taper we can't add any\nFitness we're now just concentrating on\nmaintaining that Fitness we've built and\nrefreshing everything and getting nice\nand recovered to maximize the potential\nof using that Fitness so in terms of\nvolume wise we're looking around about a\n30 to 35% drop in that peak week volume\nso using our 100K example there we're\ntalking about 65 to 70k running this\nweek you want to also be keeping the\nsame structure that you've been used to\nas well again just slightly shorten\nThose runs but don't go adding in any\nextra rest J just keep the structure the\nsame as you've been following throughout\nyour plan you going to be keeping a\nlittle bit of intensity in there as well\nkeep your speed session in there for the\nweek maybe just cut down the Reps a\nlittle bit if you've been doing say 6 or\n7 by 3 minutes maybe now do four or 5 by\n3 minutes just so our body can recover\nthat little bit quicker from that\nworkout and in terms of long run range\nfor anything from about 10 to 15 miles\nfor our long run and it's also a really\ngood time to book in a sports massage\nand again get those legs nice and\nrefreshed get everything flushed out of\nour legs so they'll be feeling really\nnice and Poppy and ready for race day\nit's also a really good time to plan out\nyour race day Logistics your travel how\nyou getting there any last minute gel\npurchases but don't go try any new gels\njust those gels you've been practicing\nand you know they're going to be working\nhow you get into the Expo where you're\ngoing to meeting your friends and family\nand of course downloading our race day\nchecklist from the website we'll link to\nthat down below because we want to be\nkeeping that stress to a minimum and\nwhat was going to make you very very\nstressful is if you go and get a cold or\nan illness this week so really try and\nfocus on getting some extra vitamin C in\nyour body just a supplement or just\nnatural things like orange juice things\nlike that just to help keep that immune\nsystem topped up and keep those colds\nand sicknesses at Bay right moving on to\nthe most important week race week is\nhere probably 6 days to go before one of\nthe biggest runs of your life but don't\nworry you're going to be absolutely fine\nthis week is going to be quite common\nfor a lot of people to be feeling just a\nlittle bit lethargic maybe your energy\nlevels are a little bit lower than\nnormal there maybe be a few little extra\neights and pains this is called taper\nTantrums or Marino we'll come on to\nchatting about that a little bit later\non but for now in terms of our volume\nwe're talking around about a 60 to 70%\ndrop in overall volume about 30 to 40K\nplus the race this will be a bigger drop\nfor the beginner plans if people are\nfollowing that though what I really like\nto do with everybody is a marathon pace\npractice session so lower int inity\nsomething like 3 or 4X 5 minutes at your\ngoal Pace on the Tuesday or Wednesday\nwith just jogging recoveries between\njust reminding our body what that race\nPace feels like again and it won't add\nreally any extra fatigue into our body I\nwould also say this never feels easy but\nit's a really good thing to do but don't\ngo panicking too much of how am I going\nto run 3 four hours at this pace it\nnever feels easy but it's just good to\nremind our body what that race Pace\nfeels like some people like to put some\nstrides a little short burst about 15 to\n20 seconds of running just to help\nfreshen up the legs just get that\nturnover up a little bit more and they\nwon't be adding really any extra fatigue\nI personally wouldn't be doing any\nstrength work this week probably from\nabout 10 days into the race I wouldn't\nbe doing any strength work because as\nyou know I've said quite a few times\nthis week is all about recovery many\npeople will suffer with what is known as\nmarinia or taper Tantrums as I just\ntouched on earlier when your body\npresents these really weird pains and\naches you freak out thinking that every\npain in your body is going to be some\ncareer ending injury this has happened\nin pretty much every race I've done and\nabout nine times out of 10 your body is\nabsolutely fine it's just the stress\nyou're going through and your body\nadapting to all the changes and just\nbecoming a little bit fresher and ready\nfor RAC so try not to get too stressed\nabout it but believe me I know that's a\nlot easier said than done but just be\naware that is a thing that happens to a\nlot of people should I run the day\nbefore the race run if you want to it's\nnot going to have any bearing on the\nrace but just two or three Mars 3 4 5K\nsomething like that very relaxed and\nvery easy the main benefit of doing this\nis just keeping your stress levels lower\njust helping combating those nerves this\nwhole week is about listening to your\nbody and trying to get as much sleep in\nas you can so we're going to be feeling\nfresh for race day now a lot of people\nit's going to be very hard to sleep on\nusually that Saturday night the day\nbefore the race you're going to have all\nsorts of stress and worries going\nthrough your system so we really want to\ntry and prioritize that Thursday and\nthat Friday night to really try and get\nto bed early and get a decent night\nsleep and then so when that inevitable\nslightly Sleepless restless night\nhappens on Saturday which has happened\nto me so many times over the years and\nI've always had a pretty good run on\nRace there as well so don't worry about\nit Thursday night Friday night that's\nthe key nights you want to be getting a\ngood night's sleep also starting think\nout about car bloing in those 2 to three\ndays before the race as well and if you\nare doing like a destination Marathon\nyou're going to some exciting place\nplease this week don't go go doing\n20,000 30,000 steps a day doing all your\nsing do that after the marathon wear\nthat metal with pride as you're walking\naround a beautiful city if you're\ninterested in my exact 24 hours before a\nrace dat everything I'm doing and eating\nand things like that that video is\ncoming up next click over here for that\nbut finally best of luck with your race\nlet us know how you get on I'm sure\nyou're going to be amazing we're going\nto be in Boston and London coming up\nLondon will be at the Expo as well\nexhibiting there every day we'll hope to\nyou there keep on working hard guys keep\non it done see you very soon in the next\none",

      "text": "if you are a heavier Runner with a\nlarger build you're going to need\nsomething on your feet that has the\nright balance of cushioning something\nsoft enough to be comfortable but firm\nenough to support your body through each\nfoot strike with hundreds of running\nshoes on the market it can be really\ntough to know what's going to work for\nyou but we've sifted through all the\noptions here to help steer you in the\nright direction going back a number of\nyears I used to be quite a heavy guy so\nI know how frustrating it is to have\nshoes that wear out really quickly and\nnot feel well supported in your running\nso some of this has come from my own\npersonal experience as well as extensive\nresearch and also speaking to a few of\nmy friends that work in running retail\nspeaking with Runners just like you\nevery day to see what they're\nrecommending heavy Runners should be\nputting on their feet I just want to say\nnothing in this video at all is\nsponsored in any way and also I've\nbought and tested and run in all of\nthese shoes and bought them 100% with my\nmoney to give you that completely\nimpartial honest review right let's get\nstuck into the best daily shoe options\nthat's coming up now if you are looking\nfor one shoe to do it all something to\ndo your easy runs in your long runs your\nspeed sessions and a few races as well\nthen we've got a few options here we're\nlooking for a foam in these shoes that's\njust a little bit more on the firmer\nside something that's not going to\ncompress and bottom out too much and\nalso a little bit of extra rubber on the\nouto to protect that foam and also\nincrease the durability with just some\nmore forces going through the shoe with\nevery foot strike so my first shoe I'd\nrecommend having a look at here is the\nsocony Triumph version 21 a really\nfantastic all round super versatile shoe\na really nice wide toe box as well then\nyou've got a thick slab of durable and\ncomfortable midsole foam in the shoe in\nterms of some negatives it might not be\nsuitable if you do have some narrow feet\nand there is only one width available on\nthe slightly cheaper side we've got the\nhoker Clifton 9 a fantastic daily\ndurable shoe it does come in two widths\navailable super comfortable and really a\nvery dependable daily shoe the regular\nversion is a little bit on the narrow\nside so if you do have wider feet make\nsure you go for that extra width option\nand my last shoe in the daily section is\nthe aex super blast a little bit more\nexpensive but you're getting a fantastic\nrunning shoe for your money here super\nversatile really maintains its structure\nthrough that heavy load and it's just\ngot a nice big surface area on the\nbottom the shoe which will keep it nice\nand stable yes very big stack height in\nthis shoe but you can pick up the page\nwith ease that turn of speed is really\nfantastic and super comfortable over\nthose long distances as well suitable\nfor everyone doing some long marathon\ntraining runs and you could definitely\nrace in the shoe as well in terms of the\ndownside yes it's a little bit more on\nthe expensive side and also the shoe\nonly comes in one width but there is a\ngood amount of wiggle room at the front\nof the shoe a good wide toe box there as\nwell right moving on we've got a couple\nmore daily options to chat about and\nthese are really good supportive or\nstability Run shoes if you can get into\na running store definitely try and do\nthat there'll be more than likely some\nreally good people that can give you\nsome good advice on shoes but me take\nthis list in say what have you got here\nI've heard these shoes are good if you\ncan get into a running store running\nthese on a treadmill and then they're\ngoing to be able to tell you if you do\nneed a neutral shoe or you do need a\nstability sh in general about 80% of the\npopulation has a neutral shoe 20% need a\nstability shoe I will link to a little\nguide down below if you can't make it\ninto a running store just to see whether\nyou might need a stability shoe but\nanyway let's have a chat about my best\noptions here the first one is the aex\ngel Cayo one of the most classic\nsupportive shoes of all time we're here\nat version 30 they had a good time to\nget it right what I really like about\nthis shoe that ax guidance system that\n4D guidance system really impressive\nstability really going to help keep that\nfoot supported through the whole\nfootstrike also comes in three different\nwidths your regular wide and extra wide\nas well super breathable upper in the\nshoe very thick and durable outsold as\nwell moving on to the Brooks Adrenaline\nGTS 23 four different widths available\nin the shoe here a slightly more firmer\nride it does soften up a little bit over\ntime you got Brooks's guide rail\nstability system in this shoe it's not\ntoo intrusive they a really good option\nA little top tip here if you do run more\nthan about three times a week then\nreally try to rotate between more than\none pair of different shoes the foam in\nour shoes needs a little bit of extra\ntime to decompress especially for\nheavier Runners they going be putting a\nbit more Force through that foam so if\nyou can allow at least sort of 20 24 to\n48 hours between runs to let that foam\njust breathe and return back to normal\nthat is really good cycling between two\ndifferent pairs of shoes will last a lot\nlonger than buying one shoe and then\nanother shoe after that moving on we're\ngoing to have a chat about the best easy\nrecovery Max comfort shoes the TP of\nshoes to really look after your legs\nlook after your body making sure they're\nabsorbing that impact to try and keep\nyou as injury free for as long as\npossible being a heavier Runner you\nmight assume that the more foam you have\nunder your feet the better however a lot\nof these Mac stack shoes that you can\nsee on the market these days have very\nsoft Foams and the problem with that is\nthey can be quite unstable for people\nwith a higher body weight and those\nFoams can sort of collapse and lead to a\nlot of instability as well that can lead\nto some higher chances of getting\ninjured so coming up I've got some\nreally good options that have a really\ngood balance of everything that is going\nto be really suited for heavier Runners\nstarting out we've got the Brooks\nGlycerin currently on version 21 it's\nsoft but it's not too soft again you've\ngot two different widths available here\nand also a stability option as well if\nyou do want a little bit of extra\nstability in your shoe it's got a very\nvery tacky but highly durable outso and\nso so comfortable to run in the only\ndownside of the shoe is not great at\npicking up the pace this is very much an\neasy recovery run shoe option here\nprobably one of my favorite shoes of\nthis year and last year as well the aex\nJoe Nimbus currently on 26 the pros of\nthis shoe it comes in three different\nwidths standard wide and extra wide it's\nso so comfortable it just one in my\nrecent video all about the most\ncomfortable shoes we'll link to that one\nup there it's also got a super durable\noutsole to the shoe very breathable and\nsuper soft upper to keep that Comfort\nmaximized a really large surface area\nunderneath the shoe as well so very very\nstable the foam in the shoe again it is\nquite soft but not too soft you're not\ngoing to bottom out that foam as you run\nalong and also a good amount of Stack\nheight in this shoe in terms of the\nnegatives it is a little bit on the\nexpensive side version 25 go and find\nthat one the updates are very very\nminimal and there's also not much energy\nreturn again the shoes in this section\nare just those recovery Run shoes so\nyou're going to need something for your\nfaster runs and your races to put it\ninto your rotation as well and then\nfinally in the recovery easy Run shoes\nsection we've got the Hoka Bondi version\n8 this comes in three different widths\nstandard wide and extra wide what I\nreally like about the shoe super\nbreathable super comfortable you can\nwear it for a long amount of time on\nyour feet you can run Ultras in a shoe\nso many Ultra runners use this type of\nshoe and it's also good for people that\ndo a lot of walking as well people that\nspending a lot of time on their feet\nmaybe you're working in retail in health\ncare something like that we up on your\nfeet a long time this is a really good\noption to look at in terms of what's not\nso good it is a little bit on the\nnarrower side as these shoes go and it\nhas also got quite a small toe box as\nwell so make sure you do Speck it in\nthat wide or extra wide if you have some\nwider feet and also the outso isn't\ngoing to be the best if you're a super\nheavy Runner there's a little bit of\nexposed foam on the bottom but for a lot\nof people it's going to be absolutely\nfine right the final section here let's\nhave a chat about the best plated shoes\nthat could be used for a lot of your\nfaster running and your racing they just\nshoes with plates and to help us run a\nlittle bit faster the main thing to\nconsider here when we're talking about\nshoes for heavier Runners is that Super\nShoes have one problem is they're\ngenerally not the most stable shoes out\nthere the super Foams tend to be very\nsoft and they don't last very long even\nfor slightly lighter people as well and\nthey often are quite narrow fitted so\nall the shoes I've here should cover\nthose bases and be the best for the\nheavier Runner out there starting out\nwe're going to have a chat about the\nNike zoomfly version five it's not a\nsuper shoe per se but a really good\noption for your long runs and your long\ndistance races and you can pick up the\npace in the shoe really well cuz it has\ngot that carbon plate in it it's got a\nsuper thick durable outsole and you'll\nbe Runing on a massive trunk of Nikes\nwell it's a bit of Zex in the middle\nthere Flagship foam with a carrier foam\naround it but a really nice responsive\nride as well and I'd say on the whole\nlist of shoes here this is definitely\ngoing to be the one that's going to last\nthe longest the most durable and in\nterms of the negatives with this shoe it\nis a little bit on the heavy so a little\nbit of a chunky ride with this shoe and\nthere's also only one width available\nnext on the list is a shoe I've recently\nbeen running in and absolutely loving it\nwas another star in my most comfortable\nshoe video recently which is the New\nBalance SC Trainer I would say this is\nthe most comfortable plated shoe that\nI've ever worn it's super lightweight\nsoft but again not too soft this is\ngoing to be a really good shoe to do\nsome of your speed workouts or as an\nultra comfortable race day shoe again\nnice durable outsole to the shoe very\nstable at cornering and a good amount of\nspace in the toebox for that footplay in\nterms of negatives yeah it's just not\nthe most Poppy the most responsive out\nthere but you are sacrificing a little\nbit of that to get a super comfortable\nride in the shoe and then finally what\nmost people said was the fastest best\nRAC day plated shoe for heavier Runners\nis the Nike alphafly version two or\npotentially version three as well which\nhas a slightly different ride what I\nreally like about the shoe is it's got\nthis super wide very stable platform in\nthe front and it's also just so fast\nreally with the massive Zoom Air Pods at\nthe front of the shoe the carbon plate\nrunning through it Nike's flash Chi Zoom\nX foam in the shoe it is super super\nquick also really encourage you to land\nnicely on the midfoot through your foot\nstrike really helping your leg turn over\nas as well but it does run a little bit\non the narrow side especially through\nthe midfoot so if you have a slightly\nwider foot through the midfoot then\ncheck out version 3 which is the most\ncurrent version out at the moment a lot\nmore space in that shoe but it's just\nnot quite as stable as version one and\nversion two there's also one thing to\nconsider especially with some slightly\nheavier Runners is these airpods at the\nfront have been known to pop and burst\nduring races I've never had it happen to\nme during a race but I have had it\nhappen in a very old battered pair of\ntraining shoes a couple of times it kind\nof depends the type of mileage you're\nputting into the shoe but something to\nbe aware of so I'm sure there's a few\nother options out there these are\ndefinitely ones that I would\nwholeheartedly recommend you go and\ncheck out let us know down in the\ncomments what are your favorite shoes\nhelp out the community as you've heard\nme mention quite a lot today I had a\nvery recent video all about those\ncomfortable showes of all time so maybe\ngo and check that one out next that's\ncoming up right guys keep on working\nhard keep on done and we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

      "text": "after really enjoying the Mac 4 and Mac\n5 I've been eagerly anticipating this\nMac 6 update when I heard about all the\nchanges I was really worried though but\nwas I right to be concerned well stay\ntuned as we dive into all that and more\nwith the full review of the Hoka ma\nversion 6 my name is Ben Parks 225\nMarathon please excuse this work going\non behind me at the moment we're getting\nset up for the London Marathon Expo we\nhope to see a lot of you there as we're\nexhibiting our whole range which you can\nsee on benp parks.com any time but today\nwe're talking all about this new latest\nand greatest update from hoker going to\ngo through the facts and figures the\nchanges my likes dislikes and is this\ngoing into rotation so without further\nAdo let's get stuck into the facts and\nfigures so the purpose of the hookup Max\n6 well this is an everyday non-plated\nspeed shoe perfect for your daily miles\nand slightly faster runs as well this\nshoe set me back\n\u00a3140 I bought the shoe 100% with my own\nmoney here off the hoko website in the\nUK I give that completely honest\nimpartial review it's going to be about\n\u20ac60 or\n$140 the stack out of the back 37 mil at\nthe back of the shoe 5 mm drop overall\nand for me this is coming in around\nabout 276 g a pretty nice lightweight\noffering here from hoker it's a neutral\nshoe and it has this lovely engineered\nmesh upper not the most brutal one I've\nrun in but really not too bad we'll come\non to all that a little bit later on in\nthe midsole of the shoe you've got one\nmassive chunk of hokus super critical\nfoam one of the biggest updates here\nwith this shoe there's no carbon plate\nin the shoe but we've got an all new\nrubber out soole the first for the Mac\nhere which does give it a little bit of\nstiffness a little bit of rigidity as we\ngo through the whole foot strike there\nare two different widths available in\nthe shoe regular and wide which you can\nspec on the hoker website if you think\nyou have any sort of extra width in your\nfeet definitely go for the wide version\nthere's also four different colors to\nchoose from and this for me in my UK\nsize 12 was true to size right let's get\nstuck into all of the differences\nbetween this and the outgoing version 5\nthe biggest update with the Mac 6 is\nthis new massive chunk of their super\ncritical EVA foam in the outgo Mac 5 you\nhad a little bit of that and then\nbeneath it a really hardwearing Eva\nphone now you've just got a big chunk of\nthe most sort of softest squishiest but\nalso pretty responsive super critical\nfoam there's also been a big increase in\nstack code about 7 to 8 mm extra St kite\nin the shoe so many manufacturers are\ndoing that these days and you can really\nfeel that difference when you're running\nin both of these shoes version six now\nhas this rubber outso to the shoe to\ngive that a little bit of extra\nstability a little bit of extra support\nin the foam if you didn't have that this\nfoam would wear out very very quickly in\nthe old shoe you didn't have that you\njust had a layer of the Eva hard wearing\nfoam on the bottom you can't have that\nin this they've added this extra bit of\ntraction extra bit of rubber outs salt\non the bottom of the shoe so you do Lo a\nlittle bit of ground feel there as well\nversion 6 also to me does feel a little\nbit on the narrower side and hus say\nthey've updated the back of the shoe as\nwell it's a very minor tweak right let's\ngo to my likes the first like with the\nshoe is it was supremely comfortable one\nof the most important things when\nlooking for a new pair of shoes let us\nknow down in the comments what's your\nmost important thing you want speed\nComfort let us know got a really good\nsolid lockdown with this very nice\ncomfortable upper I really like the\nupdated heel color I can't really feel a\nmassive difference but it's still really\ngood no heel slip issues or anything\nlike that when I go out testing these\nshoes I'm always hyperware Sensations\ntrying to pick up any sort of things of\nhow my feet are feeling I just kind of\nSwitched Off running this one it's\nreally odd and so I had said to Sarah\nwhen she was cycling behind me it's just\nthere getting the job done my second\nlike with this shoe is this update this\nnew super critical big chunk of super\ncritical foam it really delivers a fun\nand also very responsive ride a little\nbit like the New Balance Rev V4 again\nwith that massive chunk of foam at the\nbottom of the shoe there it's always\npushing you to go a little bit faster\nand that could be good or it could be\nbad this is really not a shoe to take\nout for your recovery runs but it's\nalways egging you on always sort of\npushing you to pick up your stride pick\nup your Cadence and run just that little\nbit faster for me the shoe really sings\nthat faster end of our easy Pace all the\nway up to Marathon half marathon 10K all\nthe way up to 5K paast that's where the\nshoe really delivers and not only\nthrough the foam but also because it's\nsuper lightweight as well you really\njust feel you've got running along with\nabsolutely nothing under your feet which\nis a really impressive job from hoko\nwith what they've done considering that\nincrease in stack height that increase\nin responsiveness adding the outsole for\nthat extra durability the weight has\nonly gone up a very very small amount\ndifferent depending on what size you're\nrunning in so just a great all around\neveryday shoe to bring a smile to your\nface when you're getting your runs done\nmy third like with the shoe is this new\noutso that they've added for version 6\nyes it really helps with durability\nand grip when I have taken out in some\nwet weather the out soole has been okay\nthe grip's been okay everything's just a\nlittle bit average probably as you'd\nexpect on a shoe like this I have seen a\nfew people complaining about the wet\nweather grip but in the dry the out\nsoole is delivering some really good\ngrip but it just really helps support\nthat midsole gives it a slightly stiffer\nfeel but also it means you can just\ncover the ground that much smoother and\nI really just love how this shoe feels\nthrough the whole foot strip with the\nrocker at the front of the shoe as well\njust a much better structure with how\nthe shoe is put together right let's get\nstuck into my dislikes now the first\nthing to have a chat out here is not\nreally a dislike for me but I really\nwant to bring attention to it it's just\nthis is a very very different shoe from\nthe outgoing version 5 if you're a\nmassive fan of the version 5 you might\nnot necessarily really like version 6\nwith a massive increase in stack height\nthis shoe gets with that outsole you're\nlosing a lot of that ground contact feel\nG is that very very lightweight and\nsuper responsive ride that the Mac was\nfamous for and now it's just a bit more\nsubdued now some people are really going\nto like this update but some people are\nreally not going to like it so depends\nwhat type of Camp you're in there have\nbeen some really big changes with this\nupdate for me I personally really like\nit I like a little bit more stack heite\nI like what the outso is doing this shoe\nit's a much better overall General shoe\nbut we're losing some of these Niche\nproducts out there and the Mac was a bit\nof a niche sort of speed workor Fast\nVery responsive lightweight shoe and\nthat's kind of gone from the hoker range\nso you may be wanting to stock up on\nversion 5 if you were a fan of that type\nof shoe and the other things to note in\nthis shoe is very typical of hoker they\ndo like their narrow shoes this is\ncertainly a little bit narrower than the\noutgoing model so I'd certainly say\ndefinitely look at the wide options if\nyou have anything approaching wide feet\nas well and my final sort of thing to\nnote is it just feels a bit awkward at\nrecovery run Pac it's not a true Do-it\nall shoe that's still going to be the\nClifton but for this type of shoe which\nreally is that higher end of all the way\nup to 5K it really does deliver very\nvery well so in conclusion who should be\nlooking for a shoe like the Hoka Max 6\nor for me someone looking for a\nnon-plated shoe for their faster easy\nruns their tempos maybe a little of an\nimpromptu sh race maybe a park run\nsomething they do their sessions in as\nwell best suited for those definitely\nquicker Paces am I going to keep this\nshoe is it going to go in my rotation\nI'm definitely going to keep it I don't\nthink I'm going to do too much and I got\nso many shoes to test but I've really\nenjoyed running in it it has really\nbought a smart on my face I probably\nenjoyed the rebel just a little bit more\nbut I had some bad heel issues with that\nshoe with some blisters nothing with\nthat in this shoe so I definitely\nrecommend checking it out I've really\nenjoyed running in it I have no problem\nin recommending it to friends family and\nmost importantly all of you the amazing\nrunning Community out there next up\nwe've got the hoker massive comparison\nvideo you can watch that over here or\njust below that you can check out the\nreview of this the New Balance Rebel\nversion 4 keep on working hard keep on\ngetting done guys we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

      "text": "the New Balance Rebel version 4 is\nrumored to be one of the best daily\nshoes of 2024 in my testing there have\nbeen some amazing highs and really\nfalling in love with a shoe but also\nsome real lows so that's what this video\nis all about my roller coaster ride with\nthe New Balance Rebel version 4 so the\npurposes of a shoe like the New Balance\nRebel version 4 is just a classic\neveryday shoe to do all sorts of\ndifferent types of runs in pretty well\nthis shoe set me back4 0 around about\n\u20ac60 or\n$140 and of course like everything on\nthe channel I bought this shoe 100% with\nmy money so I give you that completely\nimpartial honest review in terms of\nStack Heights we've got a 30 mil stack\nat the back 24 at the front giving that\n6 mm overall drop in the shoe for me\nthis came in as a super lightweight\n248 G I rarely run in a shoe under 250 g\nand I really noticed that lovely\nlightweight feel it's a neutral shoe and\nit has a lovely engine mesh Phantom fit\nupper the midsole of this shoe is New\nBalances all new peber and Eva blend and\nthere is no carbon plate in the shoe at\nall in terms of the outsole you've got\nfive rubber strips on the out soole\ngiving a really good amount of grip and\ndurability to the shoe are there\ndifferent widths available well at the\nmoment it depends where you live if you\nlive in the USA get it on the New\nBalance website then yes you've got the\nstandard width and the extra wide one in\nthe UK we've only got standard at the\nmoment and then finally this was true to\nsize for me in my standard UK size 12\nright let's have a chat about the\ndifferences the first one is this new\nmidsole the peba and Eva Blended midsole\nit's about a 3 mm gain in stack height\nand also significantly ligh as well\nabout around about 10 G lighter\ndepending on what size of shoe you have\nthere's also been a slight price\nincrease in the shoe kind of to beit\nexpected in the world we live in and a\nslight increase in the width a lot of\nroom in the front of the shoe we'll come\non to that later on in the review right\nbut let's get stuck in to my likes now\nmy first like I've just written\nlightweight and fun because that's what\nthis shoe is it really puts a smile on\nyour face as you run along but despite\nbeing lightweight they've also added\nthis extra width in the shoe wider\nfooted Runners rejoice and you've got a\nreally good amount of volume up there\nfor all sorts of different foot sizes\nyou've got a really good amount of\ncushioning but also it's a really\nresponsive ride as well you can really\npick up the pace if you're going to be\ndoing some speed workouts some races the\nturn of speed in the shoe is really\ngreat considering it doesn't have a\ncarbon plate in it it's also with that\nextra width it's super stable at all\nspeeds as well especially going around\nthe corners it's just an all around\nreally good fun shoe to run in puts a\nsmile on your face and wants you to run\na little bit more and a little bit\nfaster as well the real highlight of\nthis shoe is this new midsole that peber\nand Eva blend basically peber foam is\nthat lightweight racing super responsive\nsuper Snappy the Eva part of that foam\nis to get you that extra bit of\ndurability so not quite as is responsive\nbut it's going to last a long time\nthat's that really good balance which we\nwant in a daily shoe my second like with\nthe shoe is it's so versatile or\nwhatever type of running you want to\nthrow at it it's really happy at easy\nPaces Tempo Pace threshold Pace marathon\npace whatever you want to be doing your\ntraining at this shoe will handle it\nreally well with this durable outsole\nhere you could even do some light Trail\nsome fire roads and things like that it\nwill handle that absolutely fine the\nupper of the shoe New Balances Phantom\nfit upper really breathable getting good\namount of air flow through there as well\nand I wouldn't hesitate to use this for\nall different types of races as well 5K\n10K half marathon even up to a Marathon\ndistance with the amount of cushioning\nyou're getting from this midsole so yeah\ntrue versatility which is really what we\nwant to see in a classic daily trainer\nmy final like is that price and that\nvalue that you're getting from this shoe\nI managed to get these for just \u00a3118 I\nthink it was with a discount code off\nsports shoes really fantastic value for\nthat sort of price point so far\ndurability wise holding up really well\nwe've done about 30 m about 50k in this\nshoe and there is absolutely no wear on\nthis whatsoever it makes you feel good\nwhen you're running and also in your\nback pocket as well I honestly can't\nthink of a better value shoe if you can\nget a little bit of a discount like I\ndid for around about \u00a31 1220 out there\non the market at the moment but like\neverything in life it wasn't all smiles\nthere were quite a lot of them but there\nwere some dislikes with this shoe as\nwell the first one being I did\nexperience some really bad rubbing at\nthe back of the shoe on the back of my\nankle on the Achilles area real sort of\nbad chafing and I had to cut short my\nfirst run in the shoe which was really\nannoying because I was loving it so much\nabout 5k absolutely fantastic and a k of\nlike something's not quite right here\nand this is on both ankles as well and\nthe last 2K was just trying to limp back\nto the car as fast as I could I put a\nlittle photo of what my ankle looked\nlike after 8K of the first run in the\nshoe and it was really really quite sore\nI had to have a rest day the next day\nbecause it was soaring all the other\nshoes I was then trying to walk around\nin it was a really odd sensation I\ndidn't feel like anything was slipping\nbut I think all this comes down to is\nthe shoe is particularly wide my feet\nare a little bit on the narrow side\nyou've got a lot of space in here and I\ncouldn't really get it locked down very\nvery well now we're do went out from the\nsecond testing run of this shoe some\npeople suggested in my straa comments\nand on Instagram to try some heel lock\nlacing and that definitely improved\nthings a little bit and I didn't suffer\nany sort of pain at the back of the shoe\nquite as much but I really wanted to run\nand test this shoe properly so I did add\nsome plasters or Band-Aids As Americans\nsay to the back of my ankle and of\ncourse then it went away there was\nnothing to rub in so I think all this\ncomes down to is if you have a\nparticularly narrow foot you might\nsuffer some bunching some lockdown\nissues and just find it really hard to\nget a good lock down in the shoe with\nthose little tweaks that Hill lock\nlacing at the front and some plasters at\nthe back of the shoe that obviously went\naway and then it really was all smiles\nback again and that really was the only\nnegative to the shoe quite a big\nnegative because no one wants to be\ncutting runs short but overall have\nabsolutely Lov putting those test Mars\nin their shoe despite the pain I really\nwant to persevere through it because I\nthink think the shoe could be absolutely\nfantastic on my achilles will just\ndevelop a little bit of callous and I'll\nget i'll get on with it but yeah a lot\nof shoes these days you don't even have\nto run them in back in the day I've been\nrunning for so long every shoe you got\nout it was a little bit uncomfortable\nthat for that first sort of 20 miles so\nthen it all it would all soften up but\nshoes have come so good these days you\ndon't really need to do that at all but\nwith this one I think just my breaking\nperiod is just going to be a little bit\nlonger so in conclusion is this going to\nmy rotation am I keeping it is it going\non eBay I definitely really want to keep\nit because it's been so much fun to run\nin the slight little issues at the back\nwe'll get over that and I'm really\nlooking forward to doing some\nlongdistance training runs for the\nmarathons I've got coming up in this and\nit's going to be a good speed session\nshoe and a good Marathon long run\ntraining shoe as well especially for\nanyone that doesn't want a carbon plate\nin the shoe this really is one of the\nbest options out there but there are\nsome other options as well the classic\nshoe it's up against is something like\nthe Nova blast version 4 this is a\nlittle bit heavier a little bit chunkier\nnot quite as fast and not quite as\nlightweight so it depends the type of\nthe feeling you want you feel a little\nbit more in contact with the ground with\nthis one lightweight Snappy whereas this\none is just a good sort of chugging a\nlong shoe super super comfortable a lot\nmore comfortable than this one that will\nlook after you pretty well or\npotentially you can't justify I don't\nwant to spend the amount of money that\nthe super blast cost because it's a\npretty expensive shoe at over \u00a3200 then\nthis shoe is really really good as well\nmaybe not quite as Snappy not quite as\nfast but a significant price drop from\nthis you're going to saving about 90 p\nin your back pocket with a shoe like\nthis so very much it's staying rotation\ndefinitely not going on eBay I really\nhave enjoyed running and testing this\nshoe out let me know your thoughts down\nin the comments have you had some heel\nslip issues what did you think about the\nwidth but yeah very much recommended go\nout and check it out wherever you buy\nyour shoes from the next video coming up\nis all about my best ever comfy shoes\nthis video is kind of blown up quite\nwell so a lot of you guys must look for\nsome comfort in your shoes so go and\ncheck that one out I'm off to get\nanother run in the New Balance r version\n4 that's it guys keep on working hard\nkeep on get it done we'll see you very\nsoon in the next one",

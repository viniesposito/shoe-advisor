      "text": "[Music]\nwe're doing it again dgr yes we are\ndoing it again amazing another year is\nin the books and tough year difficult\nyear hard year challenging year however\nyou want to say it it was a hard year\nfor the deor clan all right and but we\nmade it through that's the key is that\nwe're all going to have hard years we're\nall going to be challenged but you come\nout the other side a different person a\nstronger person um and a person that's\nready for the next challenge cuz you\nknow it's going to come because why\nwe're human beings all right so thanks\nfor sticking with me through thick and\nthin and I realized listen hundreds\nthousands H maybe tens of thousands of\nRunners have you know said I'm not going\nto watch Seth's YouTube channel why two\nreasons really but it's okay\nwhy he doesn't do a daily Vlog anymore\nand he doesn't do shoe reviews anymore\nand the reason I know this is because\nyou email me you comment below and\nthat's okay but but but but but but I\nwant to make the point I don't want you\nto be a runner or to seek inspiration\nfor running because of me I want you to\nseek your inspiration your motivation to\nbe Runner because of you because of\nwhat's inside of you and I yes I just\nordered my own copy I've read the book\nbefore in college but I I don't actually\nown a copy of once a runner many of you\nhave read it it is the quintessential\nnovel for runners once a runner great\nbook and it really speaks to the uh\nexperience that we runners go through as\nhuman beings on this Earth\nthat once you're a runner once you've\ndiscovered the the lore of running the\nAllure of running the uh just the the\nthe grit and the the uh yeah the grind\nof being a runner and how much you want\nit how much you seek it out every single\nday to be a runner it's um it's\nsomething that you just can't explain to\nmost humans on this Earth in fact many\npeople on this Earth will think you're\ncrazy if you're a runner and that you\nrun every single day but once it's in\nyou and it might take it might take a\nyear it's probably going to take five\nyears it's probably going to take a\ndecade and yes uh I started running in\n1997 all right and many of you know the\nstory I was a soccer player growing up\nbut I was a small soccer player so I\ncouldn't kick my legs I could run all\nday I could outrun anybody on the soccer\nfield but I couldn't kick the ball hard\nenough to get to the goal and So\neventually I decided you know what we're\njust going to leave the ball behind and\nwe're just going to run and run and\nthat's when I joined my cross country\nteam in in Middle School in seventh\ngrade in 1997 I tell that little\nbackstory to encourage you is your\nDiscerning your goals and yes I'm going\nto pull up my goals here from 2024 and\n2025 on my computer here as you're\nDiscerning and figuring out your goals\nfor the new year um it's important to\nremember that it might take you time to\ndiscover what should my annual mileage\nbe what should my annual uh racing goals\nbe what should my annual goals in the\ngym be okay what vertical goals all of\nthat and I guess why not let's dive into\nit right now from 2010 to\n2017 I was starting a family I was\ngetting you know getting married\nstarting a family you know doing my own\nwork uh and but you know moving into the\nold house and so I actually wasn't\nrunning very much maybe 5 to 800 miles a\nyear no joke but here's the graph on\nyour screen when the Vlog started and\nthank you if you've been watching for\neight years nine years on this YouTube\nchannel it's been a long time here's the\ngraph all right so slowly I've been\ndialing in and again I just want to\nencourage you if you're a newer Runner\nespecially it might take you two three 5\n10 years to figure out what should my\nannual mileage be what should my annual\nvertical gain be what should my routine\nbe in the gym it just takes time\ninconsistency so all right so keep going\nkeep going don't stop oh yeah question\nof the day what were your running goals\nfor\n2024 how' you do and what are your\nrunning goals for\n2025 sound good I cannot wait to read\nyour goals down below in the comments so\nhere are my goals from\n2024 I had eight of them and I think I\nhit four of them all right so core\ncrushed it Mobility not so much oh I got\nto work on it in\n20125 three\nfktsgi\nmy brotherr we live in Colorado we've\ngot 58 mountains that go above 14,000 ft\nof course that's going to be like the\nthat's the Pinnacle that's what we\nthat's what we love to do there's the\nfootage on your screen like it's amaz\nlike we crushed it I I can't even\nexplain to you how many\nfktsgi\nin uh 2000 like we nail we it was a\nlittle ridiculous actually how many\nmountains we ran but anyway there you go\nwe crushed uh gold number three for\n2024 uh win One race good check mark we\nactually won two races in\n2024 PR my birthday mile nope\nso the family and I had a tough year we\njust had a tough year and what am I\nalways saying on this channel life is\npart of running running is part of life\nall right so they go together and\nsometimes you get a curveball and it's a\ncurveball that you swing in a miss and\nthese circumstances that came up in 2024\nfor the family they were out of our\ncontrol and that actually makes true\nlove and I feel quite a bit better it's\nlike we didn't it was out of our control\nis that's just I'm just going to leave\nit at that so when I'm reflecting on my\nPR my birthday mile also goal number\nfive uh sorry goal number six uh\n4,31 miles um I came up short for both\nof those and sometimes life I just say\ngets in the way and that's what happened\nfor us in 2024 however today when I'm\nrecording this I did hit goal number\nseven\n341,000 vertical feet the most vertical\nfeet of my entire life as a 39-year-old\nI feel really good about that and then\nlast goal goal number eight Road\nMarathon PR I did not hit it nope didn't\nhit didn't even attempt it didn't even\nrun a road marathon in in excuse me in\n2024 that is okay so it was a good year\nbut it wasn't a great year all right and\nI'm excited for the new year to put the\nchallenges in the rearview mirror move\nahead and I hope for you out there as I\nread your comments down below if you\ndidn't hit your goals in\n2024 bump it up bump it to the next year\nbump it to 2025 and who knows maybe\nyou'll hit a goal in in the new year\nthat you didn't hit last year all right\nthat's okay uh they roll over and you're\ngoing to see there they are on your\nscreen all of them together and yes the\nleast is first the least uh exciting is\nfirst uh core strength Mobility I'm\nputting them all together now why am I\nputting them all together this year\nversus last year I split them up core\nstrength Mobility because I actually\nlike going to the gym I go three times a\nweek I'll make a vlog about that very\nsoon why I'm doing that in the New Year\nactually I've been doing it the last 6\nmonths but I like the core I like the\nstrength work I don't like the mobility\nwork it's like I lo it so if I'm going\nto go to go to the gym that's like a\ntreat for me I like going to the gym I\nlike I like working in the gym but do I\nlike doing the mobility I do not so if\nI'm going to go do core and strength\nI've also got to do so that's why I'm\nlumping them together because I got to\nkeep myself accountable that way does\nthat make sense I hope it does there you\ngo that was goal number one goal number\ntwo three again fkt we're just keeping\nit real uh I won two races in last year\nuh the goal is to win three races next\nyear I like to be competitive and yes I\nwill be turning 40 in the new year and\nso I'll become a master's Runner but but\njust all right quick Side Story here's\nfootage from Utah about seven months ago\nand I was looking around the starting\nline and I was like wait a minute I'm\nracing 20y olds I'm I was actually\nracing 19y olds these kids could be my\nkids these kids could be my kids I think\nI took sixth or seventh in the race so I\ndid okay it was very competitive but\nanyway it's like not getting any younger\nI'm going to become a master's runner in\n2025 and I want to win through outright\nI don't want to win my age group I want\nto win it's just a competitive nature\ninside me keep that spark going and I\nhope you've got a spark for you maybe\nit's not to win a race outright but\nthink about like what gets you going\nwhat's the spark inside you that gets\nyou excited all right so keep keep it\nmaybe it's Health just Health lower your\ncholesterol in 2000 whatever it is uh\nthat's the spark that and so that's my\nspark for two thou for\n2025 yes PR the birthday mile I'm not\ngiving up on it I am not giving up on PR\nthe birthday mile 4,400 miles in 2 I I\nknow I can get it because it's based on\nhistory The Last 5 Years and what true\nlove and I went through in 2024 all\nright so I know I can get that one goal\nnumber five goal number six\n350,000 vertical feet we're going to get\nit in a half marathon PR and uh on that\nhalf marathon PR um March or April all\nright so I'm not going to announce yet\nwhich race I haven't even registered I'm\nstill researching sea level half\nmarathon PR lifetime half marathon PR in\nMarch or April 2025 that is the last\ngoal for running goal for the year\nonward and upward thanks for listening I\nhope you hit your goals and if you\ndidn't roll it over don't be afraid to\nroll over your goals to the New Year all\nright of course we'll toss it to last\nyear's goal Vlog from 365 days ago don't\ngive up don't give up don't ever give up\nkeep it rolling all right so right there\nright there I love you all what a great\nyear all right what a good year and what\na great year we are about to have in the\nNew Year all right seek Beauty work hard\nand love each other",

      "text": "[Music]\n[Music]\nwelcome back to the shed new shudio no\nno no not the new question of the\nday I've always wanted to do that roll\ninto the shot all right we're in the\nshed yep uh doing some organization\ninside the shudio so obviously question\nof the day what are you gifting for\nChristmas 2025 to Runners that you know\nwhat are you going to give them all\nright that's the question of the day so\nobviously brands are still very\ninterested in sending me running gear\nthank you by the way uh but I want to\nclarify obvious like it was a year ago I\ncan't believe it one year ago deor\nstore.com launched and that is consuming\nall of my time and I wish if it really\ndoes it breaks my heart that I cannot be\nyour shoe guy any longer it's the time\nhas passed and maybe I'll pass it on to\nmy sons I don't know running shoe\nreviews that is it's over like I don't\nhave the time to create high quality I\ncould create bad running shoe reviews\nbut high quality running shoe reviews\nlike I used to do Coes oh my mind and\nthat's okay all right I I've accepted it\nbut I know a lot of you out there have\nnot accepted it and I'm sorry I just I'm\none person there's only 24 hours in a\nday I cannot do the hike and I'm all\nabout high quality on YouTube and so uh\nbut I will say as far as gear and I know\nthere's shoes here there's a lot of I\ndon't know what's all in these boxes\nwe'll open them in a second but as far\nas gear brands out there companies we've\ngot our own brand all right we've got\nour own gear we've got our own store and\nthat's again consuming most of my time\nbut if you send me gear I will open it I\nwill use it I a very high likelihood I\nwill use it in videos will I do a full\nreview video I will not I will not again\nwhy time that's the only reason all\nright I just want to be thankful\ngrateful gratitude in the the boxes\nshowing up at my house um but I I cannot\ngive you full review videos because I'm\none person all right but send it to me\nlike for example in\n2024 probably six different companies\nfor sunglasses have sent me sunglasses I\nthink they know maybe my eye issue that\nI'm still dealing with they I don't know\nif they saw that video but I got a lot\nof sunglasses sent to me this year from\nRudy Project Smith Oakley and if you\nwatched all the fkt videos up in the\nmountains this summer\nI wore all the sunglasses it was awesome\nand I appreciated it but so your if you\nsend me gear I will open it I will show\nthe camera and I will use it in videos\nbut I'm not going to do a single video\nabout the gear capiche all right let's\nopen up what is going on here and I have\nagain I just don't know what is in these\nvideo in these um I should say in these\nuh bags and boxes okay o some running\ngear okay from artil for those alive in\nthe world it looks like a hat it looks\nlike I'm interested in this this looks\nlike a shirt has anybody heard of oo\nthat feels quite nice artil systems ooh\nthat feels very nice very lightweight\nt-shirt all right and I will do my best\nscroll down scroll down everybody to the\ndescription below to link to all of\nthese companies I'll do my best there's\nno guarant again I'm not getting paid\nthat's the other thing okay that's the\nother thing this is free marketing for\nECT which I just opened it's free market\nthey're not paying me to do this and so\nif I remember to link I will but at the\nend of the day I don't have to link but\nI will art select uh because I\nappreciate oh that's nice a nice beanie\nthat's actually really nice I must say\nthis feels like high quality product\nright here this is more than Marino this\nis five times faster drying okay oh this\nis okay artil I don't know you\n[Music]\nwhat did I just say all right pause the\nvideo Hold on let me open\nthis three pairs of sunglasses in this\nbox and I'm grateful okay I'm very\ngrateful do I need all these sunglasses\nno but I'm grateful and I'll show so\nthis is blenders everyone knows blenders\nat this point Thank You blenders for\nsending the sunglasses they're looking\n[Music]\nschnazzy this is true lightweight long\nsleeve true spelled t r e w yes feels\namazing all right let me hold it up\nthere true all right five times better\nby\n[Music]\nDesign this is from Echo I think high\nfive say Hey you love these specs from\nAdidas sport eyewear Jacob and Team Echo\nwow oh my goodness oh my goodness it's\ntoo much I can't handle it every I\ncannot handle it it's so much gear one\nthing that Deora store does not have yet\nis sunglasses so maybe so maybe uh maybe\nthere this is a sign that we need oh wow\ninteresting I didn't actually I don't\nknow if I've ever seen anybody wear\nAdidas sunglasses have you these are\nAdidas nice very nice thank you Adidas I\ndo appreciate wow I like that nose the\nnose right here that feels very secure\nwe're going to Pivot it's too many boxes\nwe got to move we're going to move over\nhere it was a good run come on you got\nyou got to admit we had a good run and\nbusiness owners companies\nBrands thank you five six years really\nfive to six years of not non-stop\nrunning gear reviews and not you know\ndon't get me started on running shoe\nreviews but just like Gear reviews with\nheadlamps running vests half tights\nt-shirts long sleeves pants socks oh my\ngoodness it's it's amazing so I get it\nlike if you're a business owner out\nthere in the running space specifically\nI understand what you're going through\nkeep fighting don't give up on your\ndreams and I'm grateful for you sending\nme all this gear for the last 5 to 6\nyears and I just want to I just want to\nexpress my thanks for trusting me to but\nto do the the gear\nreviews back in the day I'm done all\nright and I so hopefully you see this\nvideo and you realize okay maybe I won't\nsend running gear to Seth in 2025 but if\nyou do keep sending it to me I'll give\nyou a shout out every now and then all\nright like bare butt wipes in case you\nyou know need to take care of business\nout in the woods yes indeed or always\nHoka sending me gear always appreciate\nlook like there's some loafers here with\nsome epic tread on the bottom all right\nor go sleeves some recovery sleeves for\nthe calves right there oh it goes on and\non and on so keep fighting I'm cheering\nyou on as a a a fellow business owner\nit's not easy but that's what it takes\nyou got to send the gear out and you got\nto um you got to just see what the\npeople think okay so I will wear this\ngear I will use this gear I'm really\nexcited some of this uh t-shirt action\nand long sleeve action but I'm not going\nto commit to full reviews for the gear\nit's just been a good run there's a pun\nintended there's Seasons to life so many\nseasons to life and the season of life\nwith respect to so many Gear reviews and\nthat's what I'll toss it to of course\nright now is like\nouterwear um outerwear oh my goodness\nyou

get a\nlittle get a little AA one second here M\nokay hey Loops patience give yourself a\nlittle Grace 3 years we've been in the\nnew house I'm believe I you know 3 years\nthat's seems like seems like yesterday\nwell really the only concern about\nmoving from the little Peno house to the\nbigger house for the family was that I\nlost access no at the old house we had\nlived there true love and I for 9 years\n9 years at the old house and I had the\nloops dialed in as a runner so I was a\nlittle concerned moving to the new house\nbecause it's like all right I got to go\ndiscover a whole new neighborhood a\nwhole new Bear Creek State Park where\nI'm at right now and figure out what is\nthe exact mileage kilometers miles\nhowever you want to track it for all of\nthese Loops all right and then about a\nweek ago right around Thanksgiving it\ndawned on me wait a minute what if I\nconnected that loop with that Loop with\nthat Loop how and that's what I made the\nguess a minute ago how big is this Loop\ngoing to be let's go on an adventure and\nfind out and so that's what we're doing\ntoday but I just want to little tip of\nthe day give yourself a year two years I\nI always say two years to figure out how\nbig or sorry how how are my Loops going\nto develop from my front door all right\nso you will know here's my 5 m Loop\nhere's my 10m Loop here's my 23 Mile\nLoop and today I'm guessing guessing\nabout 29 mies I really don't know that's\nmy guess so we'll see I'll tell you at\nthe end and remember the 20m fkt I did\nabout 6 weeks ago just about a mile back\nas I was reflecting on what I was going\nto share with you right now I was like\nwait a minute oh my my depending on what\ntoday's Loop is I could connect the 20m\nfkt that I snagged the mini Falcon Punch\nto this Loop that I'm on today and then\nare we looking at a are we looking at a\n50 m loop from my front door on this is\nwhere it gets exciting everybody on I'm\ngoing to say today is going to be about\n70% on dirt and we live in the city and\nso if you can you know for me I love\nrunning on dirt I love the trails I love\nthe vert if you can find those Loops\nthat have some dirt even better all\nright\n[Music]\nIce Ice Baby\n[Music]\nwoo I wonder how many mountain lions\ncross through\nhere this feels like mountain lion\nterritory right through\nhere keep your eyes up\neverybody haven't said that in a while\neyes up pum\nboms quick\nfeet you can't really see it but there's\nthe mile high city way out there Denver\nColorado this is definitely the best\nview of Denver\nin the city up here on Green Mountain\nall right time for a little little snack\n[Music]\n[Music]\nlet's see your uh hoodie\nJoseph yeah guys enjoying a snack y nice\nthere it is come\non good job what do you see

Irish Breakfast\nDon't Mind If I Do shout out to uh\nDuncan over on the Emerald Isle miss you\nDuncan hope you're doing well over there\nall right you see my gut reaction I was\na little off on the mileage I have a\nfeeling I was quite off on the vertical\ngain all right let me pull up straa here\nso uh question of the day what um when\nwas the last time you connected a couple\nof your Loops to make a bigger Loop and\nwhat was that experience like today was\nthree of my Loops into one all right and\nwhat did I say this morning 29 miles\n2800 vertical feet I believe all right\nso it ended up at not bad not bad 30 all\nright EX exactly\n30.5 mil 30.5 so I was a mile and a half\noff so basically a 50k you know not too\nshabby and what did I say 2,800 vertical\nfeet oh my my that's pretty good\n3150 3143 so\n3,143 vertical feet for the uh for the\n30m loop that was awesome and again oh I\njust I bring up today's Vlog and the\ntopic because you wherever you live in\nthe world whether it's Singapore or\nEcuador or Chile or uh Northern Canada\nwherever you're at you're at it's going\nto take time to discover your loops and\ntoday I found my 50k Loop like there it\nis and a lot of vert you know a decent\namount of vertical gain but it's just\nfun to build upon what you've are upon\nthe foundation of okay that was a that\nwas my 13 Mile Loop my uh uh let's see\n23 Mile Loop and then also a 26 M\nbasically I combined three Loops\ntogether is what happened today and it\nturned out to be right at 50k\n30.5 miles very cool all right love you\nall cheers have a great day and onward\nand upward all right we'll toss it to uh\nI don't know I guess another long run\nsomewhere somewhere in the archive right\nthere right there seek Beauty work hard\nand love each other",

especially on a HomeTown Mountain\nuh we're in BB and that was Mount Yale\nvia Denny Creek unbelievable so 107 I\nran 15 months ago July\n2023 and I didn't even have a c a camera\nI took the summer off no filming so\ntoday\n10450 and tip of the cap to cam cam a\namazing Runner and I'll talk more about\ncam in a second but the no excuse\nmindset my legs the first half mile\ndidn't feel awesome I'll be frank and by\nthe way we're in we're on the uh we are\non the Main Street here of buav Vista\nbeautiful BV uh so the legs didn't feel\ngreat the first half mile and tomorrow\nI'm doing another mountain in about 18\nhours and I almost threw the towel in\ntoday because I was like uh this time is\nso tough from cam I don't know if I'm\ngoing to get it\ntoday\non but here's my strategy here's and\nthis is a question of the day here in a\nsecond as well but this is what I do I I\nI I build a wall in my mind in my brain\nlike literally IM literally imagine\nbuilding a brick\nconcrete difficult rebar enforced wall\nin my mind where I had the thought oh\nman maybe I need to throw the towel in\non today's fkt attempt on Mount Yale\ninstead I built the wall and said okay\nno more that that excuse in my mind is\nnot going to cross this wall ever again\non this run now I'm human so it'll\nprobably pop up again at some point\nmaybe tomorrow but instead from the half\nmile Point onward and here's the footage\non your screen from that point onward I\nwas golden and I started rocking and\nrolling because I built this wall in my\nmind saying enough is enough we're going\nfor it today we drove up here from\nDenver let's let her let's let it rip\nand that's what we got done and so a tip\nof the cap to cam so that's anyway\nthat's the no excuse my and sadly I know\nRunners not a lot of Runners but a\ncouple I know Runners whether in high\nschool college or even today that just\nmake excuses all the time and I'm like\nno you got to stop that you're you're\nyou're cutting yourself short when you\nmake too many when you make any excuses\nbut when you make excuses all the time\nso cam shout out to cam that's who I\nsnagged it from today I'm sure cam will\ngo back and get the fkt again maybe next\nyear but uh Cam and I we have been going\nback and forth back and forth in races\nand\nfktsgi talented they're fast and they're\nthey sometimes I beat that like cam beat\nme at the Kendall Mountain run this past\nsummer I beat him at Pike's Peak it's\nlike we just go back and forth back and\nforth but at the end of the day it's\nthat's important you know being fast\nthat's what we do here on YouTube and as\nRunners we want to PR we want to get\ncourse records we want to get ftts at\nthe end of the day we want to push\nourselves but more importantly at every\nsingle Finish Line that I've raced\nagainst k him positive mindset no\nexcuses I've never heard an excuse at it\nso I just want to give him a shout out\nand some other Runners as well that I\njust you know when you have a competitor\nand you're like you're competing back\nand forth back and forth I know you guys\nhave them out there and that's the\nquestion of the day uh what is your\nmental mindset when you are hitting\nadversity in your ftts in your races and\nfor me it's just a nice refreshing\nreminder from cam to keep going and\ndon't make excuses so onward and upward\nlet's go let's let it rip uh time to\nrecover from that effort see if we can\ncome back tomorrow and get another get\nanother Mountain under our belt going to\ngo uh ice the legs in the river and oh\nit is so cold used to jump In this River\nuh like it was nothing when I was a\nteenager those days are long gone uh and\nthen squeeze the legs with a compression\nsleeves get some good uh get some good\nfood\nin the body all right a little snack\nmaybe a little maybe a little uh little\nuh fkt treat if you know what I mean so\nbutter to bread we'll toss it to the uh\nfkt playlist right there fkt playlist\nright there and uh I look forward to\nreading your strategies your mental\nstrategies down below CU if you struggle\ngo down to the comments if you just\nstruggle a little bit with it and again\nfor me I literally got to build that\nbrick wall butter butter butter let's go\nlet's go seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other",

straa or\nwherever else I'm out of Crossroads\neverybody I'm not going to be racing\nmuch in the future\nwithout the family in fact at all that's\nthe goal is it's all about the family\nit's always been about the family but as\nthe kids get older you learn you well\nyou learn but you know like okay these\nare the moments these are the like to\nyou know to to win races I love it it I\nwill continue to strive just I'm not I'm\nnot giving up on racing or chasing down\nPRS personally or chasing down course\nrecords depending on where I'm racing\nI'm not giving up on that but at the end\nof the day it's the hugs at the finish\nline that's what matters you guys know\nthat and so that is why I'm eating the\nfilet monion is that I was able to\ncelebrate on top of the mountain down in\nManu here and give hugs and high fives\nand fist bumps to everybody up on the\nmountain you're amazing for waking up\nearly and driving up the mountain but\nthen everybody at the award ceremony\nshout out to Shan uh for just Dawn oh my\ngoodness Dawn getting the footage up on\ntop of the mountain like that's what\nracing is all about that's what is\nsharing the experience with other people\ncuz if you're sharing it alone that's\nsad like that's no fun so it's all about\nex meeting all of you giving you hugs\nhigh fives and so yes I'm going to\nfinish this steak enjoy it while while\nit's hot and I love you onward and\nupward and um we'll keep we're going\nkeep fighting we're going to keep\nworking hard and now I got a team of\nteam of videographers the boys shout out\nto the boys for filming all day long\ngetting the shots thank you boys you're\nthe best so onward and upward we'll toss\nit to the Pikes Peak playlist right\nthere and um oh man I'll break down the\nrace what

I've never done\nthis before Oh I actually wanted to show\nyou this too so last\nhere we go glad I remembered or saw this\nso this is I think this is last year it\nmight be two years ago so I think this\nis my fifth or sixth I don't I'm losing\ntrack uh Pikes Peak race so this is last\nyear's race shirt very cool probably\nsays it somewhere on here I think this\nis last year's and bottom line last year\nI was a little tired for the Pikes Peak\nascent and remember last year I doubled\nso this year just the ascent on Saturday\nthree weeks before last year's race I\ntook a little little rad road trip to\nmavista Colorado and I did three\nfktsgi hope it finish higher than that\nat least top three but it just showed me\num like what I'm getting at for you and\nyour racing you're going to learn you're\ngoing to learn you're going to learn\nevery year every training block you're\ngoing to learn new things and as you age\nyou're going to learn how your body is\nreacting to the training so I think I\nwas a little tired on the starting line\nuh last year but this year we shall see\nwe don't know yet that's why we tow the\nline that's why we lace him up that's\nwhy we go have fun in Mana 2 Springs\nColorado but this year so I this is it I\ntook I've never done this before ever\never I took two days off I took I didn't\nI did not run I didn't run I never do\nthat ladies and gentlemen if you've been\nwatching for years and years you know\neven before a peak race but so I I foam\nrolled I did a little walking on the\ntreadmill I went to the gym to hop in\nthe hot tub I just tried to make the\nlegs as happy as possible so that was\nTuesday and Wednesday today's Thursday\nFriday racing Saturday so I I jog two\nmiles today tomorrow I'll do like a mile\ncrazy again adaptation learning the\nprocess of racing as you get a little\nolder almost a masters but I just wanted\nto communicate with you like don't be\nafraid to change things up and we shall\nsee we don't know we don't know that's\nwhy you got to tune in I I think there's\ngoing to be a live stream and uh a live\nstream and what else um I don't think I\ndon't know if there's live tracking for\nI think there's a little bit of live\ntracking on the website but bottom line\nI'm excited I'm excited for the packing\nenjoying the whole process and I just\nclose with this is\nthat I love racing but I tell you what\ntapering is kind of a sad moment because\nyou can't run a lot and I I just like to\nrun that's all I like to run a lot but\nyou have to pull back and you got to\ntaper and you got to let those legs get\nhappy but I'm excited to get past the\nrace and I'm excited for race day you\nknow why cuz I'm sharing it with the\nfamily and I'm going to share it with\nyou if you're there and again question\nof the day are you racing are you going\nto be there oh if you have any video\nclips from the starting line the Finish\nLine uh up on the mountain if you're up\nthere somewhere feel free to email them\nto me info at demor Global running.com\nand I'll try and get them into the Vlogs\nthe Vlogs that happen after this video\nso uh but it's like at the end of the\nday yes winning the Pikes Peak Marathon\nI think the first one was 2020 exciting\nunexpected got it done but like if I'm\nnot sharing it with the family what's I\ndon't want to say what's the point but\nit's almost like what's the point for me\npersonally so the family will be there\nit's just going to be a good old time it\ngoing to be a good old time everybody so\nhave fun out there enjoy the process of\npacking of getting your bib number\nputting it on eating some pasta whatever\nyou do to get ready for your Peak races\nand um yeah you can have some nerves\nnerves are good I'll be a little I have\nsome nerves but at the same time I'm\ngoing to be like once a year we get to\njust go rip it up a mountain 8,000\nvertical feet and there's just nothing\nquite like it so onward and upward love\nyou see you on the Peak and uh there's\nall the gear most of the gear you're\nseeing on your screen as you as you\nascend upward all right we'll toss to\nthe Pikes Peak uh Pikes Peak playlist\nright there seek Beauty work hard and\nlove each other",

actually already\nstarted so the men go second so what is\na VK so it's 2.6 miles I think this is\nthe shortest race since high school I'm\nnot even I really I think it's last time\nI Ran 2 miles was in high school on the\ntrack so this is 2.6 Mi to the top and\nuh just over 3,000 ft all right there it\nis on your screen that's the that's so\nwe're talking 24% average grade but you\nstart in town so that eats up maybe a/4\nmile of the course and then you just\nstart climbing but what's kind of cool\nit's not just pure nature it's also\nyou're running through people's\nbackyards and little farms and gardens\nand you're weaving in and out of these\nhouses so it's going to be epic um it's\nthe first so what are the goals for\ntoday a have fun with Joseph in the\nItalian mountains B uh figure out what\nis it what does it feel like to race a\nvertical kilometer this is the first VK\nof my entire life it's only it only took\nme 39 years but we're here we're doing\nit and then see is I want to stick my\nnose in it um I I know I just know it's\ngoing to go out like a like a high\nschool or or college cross country race\nso but I want to stick my nose in it and\njust see see how we do this is\ndefinitely out a little out outside my\nwheelhouse but um I I feel good we've\nbeen getting some good fkt training as\nyou all know in the Colorado Rockies and\nso the elevation so obviously

yourself a little Grace\nall right give me Grace this is my first\nVK and it's not going to be my last will\nsay that much but it didn't go well\ntoday uh I I mean I stuck my nose in it\nfor maybe a half mile you know granted\nthe entire race is 2.6 miles so I was in\nit for maybe like a half mile 3/4 of a\nmile and then they started to pull away\nand I'm going to break down the entire\nrace here in a couple days but at least\nat the moment it just it didn't work out\nis the bottom I haven't even seen the\nofficial results when I get the official\nresults I'll let you know how how I did\nbut it it was not good uh I don't even\nthink I was top 25 yeah it was rough any\noh Mama Mia the heat the heat in Italy\nis no joke I don't know why anyway\ntomorrow's race I'm racing in like 12\nhours so I actually got to go to dinner\nand then hit the sack but in 12 hours uh\nwe start two hours earlier I'm I'm\nhoping that that's going to make all the\ndifference in the world for tomorrow's\n21k not a VK but a 21k so I'm excited\nabout that but didn't didn't go off has\nplanned but in the joy department and\nthe fun Department I mean come on\nsharing the starting line with Joseph\nepic but running through the village and\njust seeing all the youngsters out there\ncheering and the elderly halfway up the\nmountain shout out to the Italians you\nguys came out in full force to cheer us\non so thank you question of the day\nwhat's your top one two or three niches\nin the racing world in the Running World\nall right what do you love to do as far\nas racing is concern concerned I will\nsay the VK is probably not going to be\nin my top three anytime soon uh but\nwe're going to keep striving all right\nonward Upward at least we got to seek\nsome beauty along the way out there oh\nmy my oh

      "text": "[Music]\nthese are the fun moments when the path\nyou are on as a runner isn't as\nclear as you might hope for whether you\ncoach yourself whether you work with a\ncoach either way you got to make\ndecisions you might have two three four\nfive doors in front of you that you just\nhave to analyze and figure out huh I\nwent down this this door this path and\nit it didn't quite work AKA last week on\nhere on Peak I didn't keep up with\nJoseph that's right he took off and my\nlegs didn't quite have the juice didn't\nquite have the the the power to get up\nthat mountain as fast as him so now\nwhere it becomes a a riddle and riddles\nare fun that's it's like the last seven\ndays I have thought way too much about\nthe Tinker I'm always talking about the\ntinker and what can I do differently\nwhich door can I choose in the next\nseven days to make the results a little\ndifferent for today for this morning\nthat's the fun part of training of\nrunning and I hope I just hope that you\ncan get to that point in your training\nin your running uh you know may it might\ntake you a couple years it might take\nyou five years it might take you a\ndecade before you feel comfortable\nenough to make those decisions for\nyourself knowing ooh okay didn't quite\nwork out this week we're going to we're\ngoing to we're going to go through this\ndoor and see if we can change uh change\nthe outcome so that's what we're doing\ntoday it's been a fun week of I'll just\nsay it trial and air or air and trial\nyou know Belford two weeks ago here on\nlast week we got Belford hereon was\ngreat but not I wasn't I wasn't at the I\nwasn't at the level all right so go to\nElbert the tallest mountain in Colorado\nthis is the North Trail the South Trail\nwe got earlier in the summer it was\nbeautiful it was amazing but it was a\nvery simple Day meaning the time was\npretty pedestrian for Joseph and I to go\ngo after together the North Trail is not\nit's the opposite it is the doozy it is\ndifficult it is fast it is steep 177%\ngrade about 4.6 mil to the top about\n4,300 you can tell tell I've been I've\nbeen analyzing about 4,300 vertical feet\nlet's get after it get these shoes on\nget through beautiful Leadville Colorado\nand uh see if we can't track down Joseph\nin the High\n[Music]\nCountry yeah I think you know it's it's\nbasically 105 flat yeah and uh\nif you uh same deal\nif if you feel good you go if I feel\ngood I'll go if hopefully we feel the\nsame yep\nbut\nokay no I think we I think we nailed the\nweather day yeah this would be great\nso okay count down\nyeah\nthree two one go\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nh\nthat's crazy\n[Music]\nhe\n[Music]\nhe\n[Music]\n[Music]\ncan I kick some ass let's go\n[Music]\n[Music]\nsh\n105 you\ngood thank\nyou enjoy kill it enjoy yeah butter my\nbread\nw\nokay\nright I'd do that you'll never see\nme\nah that was good told me that maybe\nyou're just not going to be able to ever\nrun again and I'm like I'm okay with\nthat's okay hiking is just\ngreat well we were close\nright just like so I don't know we'll\nhave to have a\ndiscussion\nabout I don't know if stra will give it\nto us yeah but I think\nfkt so I was thinking on the way\ndown in uh\nDiscord I could ask some like math\nWizards yeah to\nlike use the difference in\ndistance and the pitch and the final\ntimes yeah\nso I think we like we might have been 10\nor 15 seconds short yeah but we ran A4\nmile further right like I think I had\n4.88 yeah maybe 4.9 and it was and it\nwas 4.6 totally yeah so that's if I'm\ndoing the math right on my watch that's\na quarter mile basically yep so I think\nthose switch backs where the new Trail\nis\nI think it's I think that's basically\nwhere it's adding on yeah most of\nthe I mean I think it's noticeable how\nthat was probably oh yeah and then and\nthen also tell the people whoever the\nmath Wizards\nare um like on my watch so yeah I think\nthat's the key met metric maybe is is\nthe 13 my watch said and I trust Garmin\nbut once we get back to service but my\nwatch said we average 1330 a mile yeah\nand I know\nfrom\nstraa my fkt was\n1406 what you what we got today was up\nin the uh lasportiva Captiva\nCaptiva all right Mount Albert\n14,433 think yeah sounds bad right\ntallest mountain in Colorado so we got\nCaptiva I went with the pulsars yeah it\ndid well and um hair of our chinny chin\nchin uh razor thin margins yeah there's\nkind of layers I feel like there's\nlayers to uh fkt efforts totally yeah\nthere's where it's like you know some\nmountains that have never been touched\nand then there's some mountains that are\nvery popular that's what this one was\ntoday right yeah popular mountain in\ngeneral and very popular Mountain for\nfkt some of the names that have yeah\ngone after the times it's pretty cool to\nsee yeah be a part of that list and uh\nyeah it was it was close we so as usual\nwe don't have cell service right yeah I\ncan't tell yet so we don't know we don't\ncan't give you an answer with respect to\nif we got it or not but it was fun\nand uh we just rolled from the beginning\nright yeah it was fast off the gun and\nthere's some fast sections below tree\nline and yeah really fun day there was\nsome good people out there the trail\ncomments be hilarious butter my bread I\ndon't know if you heard it on the little\ncamera but we whoever you were hopefully\nyou see this uh thanks for getting a\nlittle butter my bread on there enjoy K\nit yeah someone said that there were\nFlames coming off our feet oh nice\nsomeone said uh I didn't hear that\nsomeone said uh save some oxygen for us\noh really that's we some good ones\nthat's good that's good yeah just I know\nand uh a little windy on top it's just\njust perfect temperature pretty much the\nwhole way but again we're talking like I\nsaid last week it's just seconds cuz all\nthese all these uh all these\nfktsgi yeah shout out to everyone who's\ngone after this time Noah Killian back\nin the day Anton Anton Sage yeah a lot\nof uh a lot of stout Runners yo yeah I\nmean it's just been like if you look at\nthe top 10 maybe I'll put it on the\nscreen it's just\nlike it's like the best yeah and\nsomething that's cool about fktsgi\nI don't know if they're making the trail\nfaster but they're definitely making it\nbetter and more sustainable it's for\nlong term it's like the work they're\ndoing is incredible I if I can find\nfootage basically they're adding steps\nand retaining walls and it's totally\nnecessary because hundreds of people\nalmost hundreds of people go up it every\nday so you have to control the trail and\nbut you have to do the good old stair\nstepping as well yeah and the\nquads yeah stair stepping the the uh\nit's a little bit added distance now\nwhich will be interesting to kind of\nbreak down and see like you know when\nthe trail is fully fully done like you\nknow what it really looks like I think I\nhad like\n4.88 4.9 basically to the top from so\nwe'll see again once we get back to cell\nservice but it at the end of the day\nit's all about the stimulus yeah abely\nbrick stacking those bricks\nand it just is were working pretty hard\nit was a lung burner you probably heard\nthe uh heard the breathing at the end\nthere so yeah fun day and now we go to\nItaly yeah last uh last hard effort and\nI think we're ready this might be the\nlast might be the last Vlog before Italy\nbut if you're watching in Italy maybe\nwe'll see you there in Northern Italy so\nCasto yeah oh man all right good work\ncool the socks shoot you okay oh yeah\nthe sockss are perfect nice yep had to\nbring the fast socks for this one yeah I\nknow be able to dive in to the fkt on\nthe tallest mountain in Colorado yes we\nhave 58 Summits that rise above 14,000\nft but I can't dive into it now because\nI got to go catch an airplane that's\nright there's the passport Joseph and I\nare heading to Italy for for races this\nweekend in Casto Italy Northern Italy uh\nI'm going to do a VK on Saturday and\nthen a half marathon on Sunday and I\nknow this is might be a little\ndisappointing that we're not going to\nreally break down uh what happened on\nMount Elbert but I just got to tell\nyou there's a lot of layers to there's\nlayers to this thing and it's fun\nbecause guess what it's connected to\nhistory\ntradition uh\nexperience and um people you know like\nreal legitimate mountain and Ultra\nRunners from across the United States\nbut especially here in Colorado who have\nput forth very Valiant efforts on Mount\nElbert all right\n14,433 ft above sea level that's a\nsummit of Mount Albert and let's just\nsay Joseph and I put forth a very good\neffort today but some other things some\nother actions that's a better way to say\nit some some other actions were also put\nforth on Mount Elbert literally at the\nexact same time that Joseph and I were\non the mountain all right and I'll just\nleave it at that and so probably in a\nweek from now 10 days from now once\nJoseph and I are back from Italy again\nwe got to go to Italy go race and once\nwe're back I just don't think I'm going\nto have the time to really dive into\nwhat transpired on the mountain and what\nwe witnessed all right I'm going to\nleave it at that it was very good I will\nsay it was a PR for me Joseph I'm not\nsure if he's act I don't think he has\nactually on that particular Trail the\nNorth Trail on Mount Elbert I don't\nthink he's ever put forth an fkt effort\nand that's what we did today and so that\nwas my probably\nthird third or fourth effort in the last\nfive or six years on that mountain and\nit was a PR so that's good but there's\nlayers layers to this story and it's fun\nand\ndramatic quite quite dramatic oh my\ngoodness all right I'll let you dig into\nit if you want to over on straa all\nright we will uh we will toss it to the\nuh f KT playlist right there sorry I\ncan't give you more answers but I got to\nwe got to we got to get off to Italy all\nright seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other",

Avalanche parking lot\nand yes we're back in BV Hometown buav\nbua not bu buav Vista and I just got to\nsay it's uh it's so nice to return to\nthe hometown and see the 14ers see the\nCollegiate Peaks oh I'm on Main Street\nright now beautiful I just love soaking\nit in seeing you yes yes it has changed\na lot but it's still it's still BB it\nreally is at the core at the heart even\nthough it does look different with new\nBanks and new new new a lot of things\nhere on here on the old Main Street but\num so today Avalanche Park Avalanche\nparking lot that's where we're going 5\nmiles up uh 4,900 vertical feet and why\nI'm really excited I I went back and\nforth on what mountain to pursue today\nbut the reason I am going to to Yale is\nbecause it's been 5 years almost exactly\nto the day 5 years since I did this\nsegment this route up Mount Yale and I\nknow the time that I ran 5 years ago\nthanks to straa this is one one nice\nlittle benefit of straa is that it's\neasy to track okay it's been five 2019\neverybody in fact a little Side Story I\ndidn't have a lot of money back then and\nso I slept in my car at the trail head\nthe night before wasn't really willing\nto dish out money for a motel or\nanything like that so I just crashed if\nI have if I can find footage I'll put it\nin I don't know if I'll be able to find\nit but uh that's how much life has\nchanged and we've moved along uh and now\nwe are going back to 20 so I would have\nbeen 34 so now we'll be 39 today uh\ngoing after the\nfkt on Mount Yale it's going to be Stout\nit's not going to be easy it's going to\nbe difficult but we're going to go for\nit all right and yes we do have some\nboxes in the uh back of the truck that\nif I have time I'm going to try and open\nup for all of you after the run we'll\nsee how see how it goes so 5 miles to\nthe top and 49 so it's about an uh 8\n% grade up the trail the average grade\nup the trail all right main Street's\nlooking good sun is looking good\nopportunity is looking good all right\nonward we go let's lace it up and let a\nrip\nhe\nmeady I could be\nyour there's no\ngue on anything\nand I'll take care of you along the\nway my love one

do believe I don't have sell\nservice here but I do believe we beat uh\nwe beat 5ye 34 year old Seth by 12\nminutes to the top I'm not sure yet\nabout the round trip but at least on the\nAscent over uh basically 5,000\nft I'm shocked actually so my clock said\n128 20 12 or sorry\n1262 to the top that feels real real\ngood so in 2019 when I slept in this\nparking lot it was uh I ran 138 I'm\ndying to know what shoes was I wearing 5\nyears ago cuz the pulsars weren't out\nyet uh the innovates um like the mud\nTalons or the uh yeah the X Talons from\ninnovate that I don't think I had those\nyet I'm just wondering if I was in Speed\ngoats speaking of which so I you'll know\nif we got the overall fkt uh here in a\nminute if you know what I mean going\nthrough a drive-thru but uh in the\nmeantime uh let's let's see if I can run\nthem down everybody Rudy Project Smith\nsunto uh Hoka\nSolomon and it's funny Once you become a\nbillion dooll company you hire PR firms\nto do your marketing and so that's like\nthe third pair of speed goats so thank\nyou Hoka I don't need any more speed\ngoats just so you know speed goat sixes\nbut I do appreciate you sending them and\nuh let's see what else did I open C wow\nthey're coming out with some clothing\nnow not just hats just so you know I\nwill not wear the hats I really won't\nwear the singlets I'll wear the shorts\nuh but as you know we got our own\nrunning gear now and so I I haven't worn\nanother company's hat in a long long\ntime so C if you're listening to this\nyou can stop sending me uh uh hats\nthat's for sure I I will give it away\nthough to somebody on the intro webs out\nthere so it's a fun unboxing let me just\nmake sure I got everything Cel sunu Rudy\nSmith Hoka Solomon um thank you thank\nyou Brands thank you companies and the\npostar I'm going to say we're going to\nsave that pair for the Italy races when\nI go to Italy here in about uh 3 weeks\nwith my brother so those are going to be\nthose are

for you question\nof the day like what are\nyou when you are and this is where I\nknow oh I'm I'll say it I'm a preacher\nwell I preach patience on this YouTube\nchannel because if you don't have\npatience in the game of long distance\nrunning it's just going to be difficult\nand and I'm just I'll be honest I like\nwhat did I say on YouTube we're in the\ntop of the second inning now maybe we're\nin the middle of the second inning if\nyou don't have patience in YouTube or\nrunning it's just going to be difficult\nfor you to maybe see the gains because\nit is that aerobic engine building and\nso to go 12 minutes faster today it's\njust like a little uh a little okay okay\nwe still got this and keep cha keep\ndreaming keep working hard all that good\nstuff keep eating andies along the way\nso let's go deliver this uh deliver this\ngoodness to those those boys and and\ngirls uh can't forget Kate now I don't\nknow if we'll uh maybe we'll let\nFrancine have a little bite as well but\nthat's the question of the day how have\nyou um progressed over the last 5 years\nin the game of long distance running\nbecause it is a game and it's a fun game\nand it's a it's more fun if you got a\nlittle patience mixed into all the\ngoodness all right I think we'll close\nit out everybody that was just a good\ngood effort uh a tip of the cap again to\nRyan all right we'll toss it to Mountain\nrunning playlist as per\nusual actually no no no fkt playlist fkt\nplaylist we got one of those too all\nright see beauty work hard and love each\nother",

think I slept well but it was not\nhard to get out of that bed I just was\nlike all right today's the day sees the\nday sees the moment let's turn that dut\nlet's make it happen I don't know just I\njust popped out of that bed I did not\nsleep well\num got home late last night but it\ndoesn't matter we're going to make this\nhappen we're going to go get some vert a\ngood amount of Earth today all right\nsomewhere around somewhere around 8,000\nfeet and again it's just going to be a\nlittle adventurous up uh one of the\niconic Front Range\n14ers so again going to pick up Joseph\nright now we're going to uh let the legs\nlet the legs have a little bit of fun up\nin the High Country you get it now come\non come\non don't uh don't lay back\nleing come\non all right well let's do it here we go\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthan\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nh\nall right where we at top of Mount merer\n13,000 911 sweet\n12955 yeah nice co woo now going over\nthere\n[Music]\nyeah look uh look behind\nus yeah that's pretty sweet\n[Music]\nwhere are we at long\nspeak yes\nsir\n14,265 and\n20925 might just have a little uh a\nlittle snack\ntwo two down three to\ngo yes sir that was good moving well\nyeah\n[Music]\ngnarly yeah we did it top of pagod what\nis this one pagod pagod that's right new\nnew Summit for both of us pagod third\nSummit of the day third Summit\n13437 3 hours flat s all right look at\nthe where we just came from holy smokes\n[Music]\nif you lost an iPhone I found\nit ah what's this one storm Peak storm\nPeak\n18,38 ft in\n353 here's our last one last\none that mount lady Washington I don't\nknow\nhow I think this is it yeah basically is\nit\nhighest oh man look at the diamond yeah\ndang what is that like 2,000 ft or\npretty amazing man all\nright lady Washington yeah mount lady\nWashington Mount lady Washington\n13,277 in four minutes or 4 hours and 21\nminutes yeah oh man that's it five done\n[Music]\ncool camera died\nwhen you get back to the\ncar and you don't know if you got it it\nit might be very close I thought we did\nI'm not sure my watch said exactly 14\nmiles on the\nbutton and I don't know what the vert I\nI'm guessing about 8,000 ft of vert and\nyou might be wondering where is Joseph\nhe's getting more mileage he needs to he\nneeds a little more little more volume\ntoday for his weekly volume so he's to\ngo pick him up down the road but it was\nclose I think our total time was about\n511 we don't have cell service here so\nwe can't tell recovery is in full swing\nyou better believe it got to take a load\noff after that let me turn the music\ndown Henry and I hanging out out here\nquestion of the\nday when did scouting a race course or\nan fkt course really make a difference\nfor you all right that's the question of\nthe day when it's scouting a race course\nor an fkt course really make a\ndifference for you out there it's\nincredible how knowledge of a course\nreally really makes a difference so that\nwas the long\nPeaks Grand Slam we had never done it\nbefore and sure enough crazy crazy\n2 minutes we missed it by about 2\nminutes\nunbelievable it's an it's it's probably\nmy guess is uh 60% off Trail so you're\nreally negotiating everything the Rocks\nlittle bit of snow little bit of water\nit's just it's gnarly there's no other\nway to put it but scouting ahead of time\nit just makes such a difference for\ndecision-making speed and sure enough I\nmean two minutes for a 5H hour fkt\nattempt like that's that's pretty that's\npretty close like we were very very\nclose and at the very end like actually\nmy one of my cameras died so I was\nfilming with Joseph's phone there at the\nend but it was epic Mount Meer Longs\nPeak uh pagot storm and then our lady I\ncan never get this right lady Mount\nWashington there we go that's so five\nPeaks seven 7500 vertical feet uh 14 mil\nwas what my watch said but it was just\nit was gnarly and Li man I am a feeling\nit right now that's why I got the cat\nlike I'm going to be a hurting unit but\nwe did it no Falls that's always good\nand uh don't go do that course just so\nyou know especially if you are not\nconfident with\nsteeper situations we'll just put it\nthat way all right but it was good and\nof course sharing it with with your\nbrother is the best uh Joseph was C he\nI'll be honest he probably would have\ngotten it without me but you know we\nstuck together and uh he's he's if you\nthink I'm a mountain goat or a billy\ngoat or whatever you want to call me Old\nMan Billy Goat he is the real billy goat\nof the family so it was epic but we did\nmiss it we I think we I mean I'll just\nsay we might have like a mount Meer that\nwas the first Mountain so it tops out at\n13,900 ft which is a\nCentennial mountain in Colorado so\neveryone goes and Hikes all the 14ers in\nColorado right there's 58 14ers so\n14 Summits in the state of Colorado rise\nabove 14,000 ft well there's another\nchallenge that people like to go after\nand that's getting to the top of the\ncentennials the centennials is you can\nguess are the 100 highest Summits in\nColorado of course my brother has done\nthat and um so Mount merer is part of\nthe centennials\n13,9 Ft so I think we got the uh Ascent\nfkt for that anyway it was epic good\ntimes man but now it's time to\nrecover hi Michael we're just grilling\nout here Henry keep it in the pond all\nright we love you guys I'm going to toss\nit to of course as you know the mountain\nrunning playlist all right seek Beauty\nwork hard and love each other and love\neach other",

      "text": "[Music]\nand we're back from the cir series come\non everybody the US Mountain running\nchampionships\n2024 and that was some footage from the\nstarting area starting line really just\na beautiful beautiful setting you can't\nbeat it out there in it just really\nquite steep mountains and today actually\nyesterday in case you missed it upper\nright hand corner we published the full\nVlog so it's a long one get your popcorn\nout and sit down and enjoy that I'll\nlink to it down below in upper right\nhand corner in case you missed the Vlog\nyesterday but I did promise that I\nwanted to break down the race for all of\nyou so that's what we're going to do\nright here right now but QD uh what is\nyour next race all right what are you\nwhat are you shooting for what are you\ntraining for I know a lot of it's crazy\na lot of people already ramping up for\ntheir fall marathons uh building their\nvolume so it's uh it's exciting but what\nis your next race the distance the\nsurface and um and the location all\nright I knew in my mind I knew it was\ngoing to be a cross country feel but in\na mountain setting so fast off the start\ntoo fast for me like these guys were\nmoving and I was like you know what I H\nmy legs first of all okay here's the bib\nnumber from Leadville all right bib\nnumber from Kendall Mountain bib number\nfrom Snowbird so three weekends in a row\nI don't do that but again we're just\ncoming back to this racing thing and it\nwas fun to do three weekends back to\nback to back I'm not doing I'm not\nracing this weekend uh but 15 miles 12\nmil 8 Miles that's one of the reasons I\nknew it would be fast out of the start\nand you actually don't do that and I've\ntalked about this many many times over\nthe last five or six years here on this\nchannel you build your racing distance\nso you go if you're getting ready for a\nmarathon you do a 10 mile or maybe half\nmarathon tuneup race uh if you're\ngetting ready for a 10K you do 3ks and\n5Ks I'm thinking more like track 10K you\ndo 3ks and five even 1500s before kind\nof building your leg speed getting ready\nfor that test so this was the opposite\nof what you should do but guess what\nthat's how the cookie crumbled in 2024\nfor me for Mountain racing so it was a\nstacked field USA Mountain running\nchampionships I knew there was going to\nbe some guys there that were quite a bit\nyounger and yes faster than me\nespecially at that distance but patience\nall right I I showed it yesterday but\nagain going from I was at about 15th\n16th Place at about the half mile Mark\nand moving your way up oh that's the\nother thing thing it was toasty all\nright I'm not a not a big like heat\nRunner I don't you know here in Colorado\nour temperatures are pretty pretty tame\npretty mild in the summertime even and\nwe don't get any humidity now there was\nno humidity in Snowbird but it was warm\nand you felt it out there uh sometimes I\ngo right through the aid stations I did\nnot go through the aid stations\nespecially for an 8 mile race like\nthat's not very far from me and but\ntoday or on that on race day I had to\nstop and get water so thank you to all\nthe volunteers out there at the Circ\nrace uh but I just start picking them\noff and I knew I would pick off many I\ndidn't know how many uh because I just I\njust know what altitude does so the race\nstarted should have mentioned this at\nthe beginning the race started at 8,000\nft and tops out I think at about\n11,200 roughly I I'll try and put it on\nthe screen um so there you go so I Knew\nby the top there would be a little bit\nof Carnage especially with the heat so\nwe're passing it's beautiful uh a Circ\nis a rock formation on a mountain so\nthat's why it's called the cir Series so\nall of the races in this series which\nI'd recommend you go check out if you're\nlooking for shorter faster steeper\nMountain racing all right that's and so\nthat's what a Circ is c i r q e so we're\ngoing we're going Mile Three Mile 4 but\nby mile about um I was going to say\nabout mile 4 and A2 I'm I don't not\nexactly in my head where we were on the\nmountain but I'm move I've moved up to\nabout seventh place and I can see fifth\nplace ahead of me all right so we're\ntopping off and thanks to everybody out\nall the photographers out there taking\ngreat pictures amazing so we top off and\nYou Begin The Descent and it's steep\nand it's dangerous and a runner did fall\nthis past weekend and it was it was bad\nuh you just you know I'm 39 and I'm not\nan expert at downhill running but I do\nhave a decent amount of confidence going\nfast on technical downhill and\nespecially when my legs are really fresh\nand so I felt it I was like okay I feel\nconf even though this is gnarly and you\ncan see it on your screen like it's it's\nno joking and the biggest thing I'm\nthinking obviously I want to get home to\nthe family safely but you just like if\nyou do fall out there everyone just\nplease please like your arms they will\nheal but your head just try to protect\nyour head out there um if you're doing\nsome of these races I'm not joking about\nthat so um by about mile five so three\nmiles to go sure enough I catched uh I\ncaught uh cam Cam's a great Mountain\nRunner who beat me the week before at\nKendall mountains so I managed to catch\nup to cam and uh and and then you really\nbegin the Steep downhill at some point\nyou we're sent off course uh through\nthis rock Bower Field there's some snow\nit it's just gnarly it's fun but again\nyou just got to be aware of your\nsurroundings as you're going through\nthese settings uh so you're breathing\nyou're working you're at 11,000 ft and\nthen you end through a tunnel you go\nthrough a tunnel and then it's a a\nSprint to the finish uh like literally\nit's 2 miles to go and it it is a combin\nof service road and Trail uh and sure\nenough thanks to straa I'm looking at it\nright now and certain segments on the I\npr it's amazing I pr now five years ago\nI won this race that was the last time I\nwas there and I was in first place by\nquite a bit so I don't think I was\npushing as hard on the downhill and so I\nactually PR many of the segments on the\ndownhill in Snowbird so that kind of\nfeels good like\ndidn't uh you know didn't get the win so\nI was in fifth on top and ended up in\nseventh all right um I would have loved\nto get you know Podium top three top\nfive is kind of nice seven so two guys\nfast I mean they did kind of they blew\nby me I mean they were just fast um I\nheld one of one of them off for about a\nmile but sure enough he caught me and\nthen another guy caught me with about a\nmile to you know half mile to a mile to\ngo so ended up in seventh uh but for the\nthird weekend in a row of racing it uh I\nfeel like it was a good effort and now\nit's like back to training I know I'm\nnot in like my Peak Fitness right now\nsummer is still like it's not early but\nit's it's you know we're not there yet\nwe haven't been up in the 14ers as much\nin this in June and July as as you know\nI might typically have so it's coming\nit's coming it's going to be another two\nto three weeks before we're really ready\nto rock and roll for some races in\nAugust Italy Italy italan yeah I'm\ncoming for you more details on that very\nsoon that will probably be my next race\nis over in Italy late August and then of\ncourse Pikes Peak in September so the\nracing is back it's fun to get some get\nsome bib numbers back on the uh singlet\nand let it rip that's a brief Rec recap\nI could go on and on and on no Falls uh\nI felt strong on the uphill but not like\nepic again the legs just didn't have the\npop you know Mountain Run like when when\nyou have the pop you got the pop and\nliterally like you just kind of prance\nup the mountain that was not the case\nlike I was kind of digging just to get\nto the top um and that's okay that's\npart of racing and part of the whole\nexperience I'm going to stop there\nthanks for watching Love You all can't\nwait to read your comments what's your\nnext race and keep buttering that bread\nI'm actually plotting out more of my uh\nsummer 2024 fkt and racing as we speak\nit's happening and we do it we're doing\nit all right keep going everyone we'll\nof course toss it to the race Vlog from\nuh this past weekend right there all\nright see beauty work card and love each\nother",

two more\nladies get up there get up there you're\nlike dude I'm tired of walking up things\ntoday that looks\n[Music]\ngreat unreal that's insane too and for\nsnowbird too to repeat it Snowbird is a\ntrue true accomplishment\nand that's a wrap from Snowbird so good\nwe're going to do a breakdown video of\nthis race because I think I think I\ndon't know yet I got a lot of good\nfootage and it just played out very\ninterestingly and so I want to break it\ndown for you not right now I got to hit\nthe road time to get back to those\nbabies back to Denver I'm going to catch\nan airplane and bottom line is if is fun\nenergy at Circ races it's uh\nshorter\nsteeper and fun all right so if you're\nlooking for that type of racing remember\nI think I mentioned this um I mentioned\nthis three or 4 days ago if you have not\nfound your niche in the racing world and\nyou're just like man I don't know like I\ndon't enjoy uh one M races around a\ntrack or I don't enjoy 50k races in the\nmountains\nor I enjoy running 100 miles around a\ntrack the key is that you just keep\nexploring because this is uni actually\nJulian the founder of this race uh he\njust told his story like why he started\nthe cir series and it was because when\nhe was getting into trail running you\nknow 14 years ago he couldn't find any\nraces that were shorter steeper races\nand he so he made it he just made it out\nof out of nothing the cir Series so it's\nAbsolut I think there's six or seven of\nthem uh great energy great meeting all\nthe vendors uh great companies I'll give\nsome shout outs throughout the video and\noh man at the end of the day it feels\ngood to be back in some air conditioning\ncuz it was toasty out um there's the\nfirst place guy he's uh he's a college\nguy I think or something he's young oh\nmy goodness Good Times so I hope you\nenjoyed that if you I don't say this too\noften but if you enjoyed the race\nfootage you know share this video spread\nit around Facebook Instagram Twitter I\nwould appreciate it and it helps out\nCirc as well I didn't expect actually to\nget a uh a medal I guess because it's a\nus it's it was the USA Track and Field\nTrail championships that's why like top\n10 get a medal I thought only the top\nthree so that was kind of cool uh\nappreciate your usatf throwing down in\nSnowbird Utah seeking Beauty out there\nonward and upward I am not at least I\ndon't think so no I don't believe I'm\nracing next weekend I think it's time to\nget back to training everybody all right\nwe'll toss it to the last Snowbird race\nwhere we flew the w 5 years ago all\nright seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other there",

      "text": "I frankly don't have much business\nracing this weekend I I really don't if\nyou been watching for six seven eight\nyears on this YouTube channel you know\nthat I never race I mean rarely do I go\nbackto back weekends I don't know if\nI've ever done backto back to back\nLeadville\nSilverton\nSnowbird all right we're going to Utah\nsee you in Utah it's the US Mountain\nrunning championships and here's the\nother business it's 8 miles total that's\nthe total length of this 8. like five I\nthink with about 3800 vertical feet\nroughly I'll try and get some more\ninformation on the screen bottom line\nwe're going up against the Young Guns\npeople that are 10 12 15 I don't think\nwe're quite at 20 years younger than me\nbut at least 10 to 15 years younger but\nwe're going to go mix it up we're going\nto go have fun as true love said last\nweek to me she said you know what let's\njust you know it was it was a hard six\nmonths earlier in\n2024 just go have fun Seth isn't that\namazing like your spouse your wife said\njust like you missed 6 months of racing\ngo have fun go let it rip even if your\nlegs are tired from Silverton and yes\nthey and they're very sore right now as\nI'm driving back up to the mountains for\none more high altitude stint okay one\nmore little scraping of the sky before\nwe go out to Utah I'm not going to go\nvery far today I'm going to try to rest\nthe legs as much as possible bottom line\nI'll see you in Snowbird come say hello\nit's going to be I've actually raced I\nraced a 50k there again four five I'm\nlosing track of time 6 years ago I don't\nremember it was probably 2019\nroughly if I can find some footage I'll\nput it on the screen so I'm very excited\nto go back and shout out to the Circ\nseries hosting this event we're going to\njust do our best have fun in the process\nand I hope you are you know I'm always\nsaying it but like dig into that if you\ndon't enjoy your racing find a different\ndistance find a different surface find a\ndifferent location there's so many ways\nthat Runners like for me it sounds like\nI don't want to say horrible but it\ndoesn't sound fun to race around a track\nlet's say you know five out of seven\nraces a year but some people love the\noval that's what they're passionate\nabout is racing around the oval it's\njust not me anyway I digress um we're\ngoing to see what business we can uh we\ncan muster on the the Steep vertical\ngain of snowbird so oh onward and upward\nand yes question of the day gear what is\nwhat was your most recent running gear\npurchase that wasn't running shoes all\nright what was it explain why you you\npurchased it is it working out for you\ndid you have to send it back and uh so\nwe got we got boxes we're going to open\nthese up right about now it's snowing on\ntop flurries the light snow but I have I\nthink that's the latest I've ever seen\nsnow up on a 14er in the summertime\nthat's that was pretty cool to have snow\nin July um all right gear companies\nthank you oh yeah everybody come on now\nlet's pack out our trash from the 14ers\nuh whoever whoever left that up there I\nappreciate the elevation uh information\nbut got pack out that trash up on those\n14ers all right here we go um as you\nknow as we do R&D research and\ndevelopment for our gear uh my my P my\nswitch that's right the battery died up\non the mountain so I I got to finish\nhere in the shudio so as I was saying uh\nup there sorry about that sometimes\nthese things happen uh R&D as we develop\nour own gear I've made the distinct and\nyou've seen it here on the YouTube A\ndistinct shift and it's intentional very\nintentional where I'm not I used to\nreview how many running shoes a week two\nthree three pairs a week now it's maybe\ntwo a quarter and that's intentional\nbecause of time I just don't have the\ntime to invest in the in the research\nfor as6 New Balance Hoka all everything\nthat goes into a running you know the\nshots the Drone shots for the running\nshoe reviews and now I'm actually crazy\nenough I love running shoes I know many\nof you love running shoes keep testing\nkeep pursuing it and I'll continue to do\nrunning shoes sparingly here on the\nchannel but at the end of the day I'm\nmore excited about uh clothing about\nouterwear about what we wear as Runners\nbecause um that's what I'm doing I'm\nactually developing our own running gear\nthese are our socks love these socks\ndeor store.com in case you need to pick\na pair up I've raced in these socks the\nlast two weekends and I love them um\nthis even this uh long sleeve right here\nthis is all part of the research as I\ntest different materials so up on the\nmountain today thank you to Nathan to\nMont sleep to Solomon to norona uh to R\nRie to Adidas for sending this gear to\nme but I'm not it's not at the top of of\nmy priority list with respect to testing\num every shoe Under the Sun or every\npiece of outerwear under the sun because\nthere's just not enough time as I invest\nin our own gear right here in the right\nhere in the basement right here in the\nshudio so that's the that's the update\nthank you Nathan for the for the gear\nI'll keep testing it but it's um it's\njust a it's a shift and it's a good\nshift and I look forward to reading your\ncomments Down Below in the question from\nthe question of the day with respect to\nwhat are you buying what are you\npurchasing uh why are you purchasing\nthat piece of running gear and it's fun\nit's fun to to back up from so many shoe\nreviews so much Gear reviews and it's\nit's good though like I'll keep testing\nand Nathan thank you love Nathan on Mont\nsleep just so everybody knows is a I'm\nas I've been talking on the channel for\nyears and years about the importance of\nsleep as Runners and so this is a face\nmask that helps keep the light out and\nI've been wearing this for um they've\nsent me one a year ago and actually over\na year ago I because I wore it all last\nsummer every single night and you just\nput it on and basically it just block O\noh my goodness it just H so anyway thank\nyou mon sleep m n ta RI uh or sorry reii\nis out of Poland a recovery Gear Company\nthis is a jump rope this is a u a stick\nor a foam roller and then norona is a\nnew company that I've never tested and\nagain this is all part of my research\nlike as I so okay I actually already\nwore this because I'm recording this the\nnext day this is made in Vietnam but\nit's based out in Norway so for me in my\nbrain what I'm doing is I'm like huh how\nare they constructing this this long\nsleeve out of Viet let me just make sure\nVietnam yes made in Vietnam designed and\ndeveloped in Norway so narona I've never\nworn their gear before it looks like a\nviking is their logo very cool and but\nSolomon on the other hand is a t-shirt\nthis is a t-shirt obviously here um and\nit's made in uh Tunisia but obviously uh\ndesigned Solomon you know in France is\nwhere they're based out of so anyway\nit's just all part of the process as we\ninvest in our gear and so thank you\ncompanies I will put all this through\nthe paces and so now I just have more\ntime to put it through the paces and\ngive you my thoughts eventually is the\nkey word here all right I love you\nonward and upward oh deor store.com we\nare running a little low on some items\nbut if you do want you know sing like\nsinglets we are pretty low on singlets\nbut hats uh bottles uh socks we got all\nthat so onward and upward we will toss\nit to um we'll toss it to I don't know\nsome sort of gear review video I don't\neven know which one but some sort of\ngear review right there all right see\nbeauty work hard and love each other",

Silverton\nwe shall see epic day amazing day for a\nlot of different reasons um I did not\nrun as well as maybe I had hoped but\nguess what uh well first of all no Andes\nthat's right so for those that don't\nknow for if you're new to the channel I\nget Andes Frozen Custard when I win a\nrace get a PR or get an fkt I bring\nandies to the house for the whole family\nto enjoy it's a fun family tradition\nthat we've been doing for probably 5\nyears now and so when I have to break\nthe news that I got second place and I\ndid not win I did not PR the course\ntoday in fact I was about I think 3 or 4\nminutes slower than four years ago we'll\ntalk more about that in a second but\nthat's part of the point I want to teach\nmy kids especially the older boys Joseph\nand Seth they're old enough now to\nrealize like life isn't always going to\nbe a winning proposition there's going\nto be challenges there's going to be\nmoments where you don't hit your PR\nwhere you got to go back to the you know\nto the training and see what you can do\nthe next time so uh cam who today\ncongrats Cam he's an amazing Runner and\nNoah in third he's also an amazing\nRunner and uh so it was fun to mix it up\ntoday with some of the really the some\nof the best Mountain runners in Colorado\nand so to come in second I feel pretty\ngood about it considering my legs are\npretty heavy from the Leadville heavy\nhalf marathon you know 7 or eight days\nago and so it was it was really good oh\nyeah that's what I wanted to mention\nsometimes I am in first place in races\nor in your situation sometimes you might\nbe on track uh or sorry a little behind\ntrack to set a PR on a course that you\nlove you know you run the same race\nevery year and you might be like wait a\nminute I'm 20 seconds slower than I was\na year ago at Mile 2 in a 5k or whatever\nthe case may be well keep fighting\nbecause today I was in fourth place for\na good chunk of the race probably about\n5 miles up and then I caught third place\nand then eventually second place and\nthat was fun and I did it last year\nactually at the Pikes Peak Ascent as\nwell where yeah trust me would I prefer\nto be in first place absolutely but\nsometimes you got to fight and you're\nnot always going to be in first play you\ngot to fight for every single place and\nso to move up from fourth place to\nsecond place it was just that was that\nwas good and I caught second place on\nthe downhill you guys know me I'm not a\nfat I'm not a fast fast downhill Runner\nlike it's not it's just not my cup of\ntea but man I was able to catch second\nplace and that felt good like okay I\nstill got it I can still turn the legs\nover at 39 These Guys these guys are\nyoung pups they're young whipper\nsnappers that I'm racing but I'm trying\nto hang with them and uh so far so good\nso anyway that was a that's a little\nbrief recap of the race Kendall Mountain\n12 miles uh didn't run as fast as four\nyears ago and the legs just they were a\nlittle heavy there were no joke that's\nwhy the the Lille heavy half definitely\nuh stuck around this time so I love you\nquestion of the day who raced this past\nweekend what did you do what was the\ndistance what was the surface tell us\nyour your triumphs but also your\nchallenges okay again again it's not all\nabout just you know nailing it every\ntime you're not going to win every\nyou're not going to win your age group\nyou're not going to PR every race but\nyou keep coming back and you keep coming\nback that's what it's all about at least\nin my in my book so onward and upward uh\nI do have an announcement for yes\nanother race very very soon stay tuned\nfor that uh it's going down in uh I'll\njust say a state that's neighboring\nColorado very very soon all right we'll\ntoss it to the Kendall Mountain race\nfrom 4 years ago all right oh man so so\ngood boys we'll get andies again don't\nyou worry seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other",

memories with them and forming\nthem you know instilling hopefully a\nlittle bit of work ethic a little bit of\nvirtue into them and that's that's all\nthat matters more than Yes W you know\nwinning races or chasing down PRS or\nwhatever the case may be so even so 448\nwas the goal ended up with 451 all right\n451 is what the watch said when I\ncrossed so I'm actually pretty pleased\nwith that I

little faster but I am excited\nto explore new trails seek a little\nbeauty along the way and see if we can't\nsnag this uh snag this mountain\nCarpenter Peak Carpenter Peak it's not\nreally a peak I would say it's more of a\nmore of a hill but you know they call it\nCarpenter Peak here in the uh South\nDenver area all right um let's get laced\nup as we do in pulsars and Let Her Fly\nokay we'll get to these boxes here in a\nsecond once we get back to the car I'll\nopen these up for all of you thank you\nthank you companies for\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nmove it on down the road got

literally the next Vlog on this\nchannel will be from some beaches around\nthe world everybody cuz uh it's been a\ndoozy so obviously as you know the year\ndid not start off great uh but we've had\na really strong\nsecond quarter of training really strong\nI think this is the seventh or eighth\nweek above 100 miles so it's just been a\nnice I I'll put it on the screen right\nnow the uh mileage graph I was running\nlike 20 30 miles a week the first two\nmonths of the year not much maybe 40 mil\nonce it just was that was life but now\nwe're coming it's like you just you\nlearn as you get older as a runner to be\nbe incredibly patient and so that's what\nI've been this year and I feel good but\nbut when I started today this is a\ncarpenter Peak uh my legs were done they\nwere heavy they felt like lead they\ndidn't want to go the effort on Monday\nwhere I had to really really dig and I\nmissed that fkt by two seconds um I felt\nit today but we got it today all right\noh that was fun um I think it was Scott\nshout out to Scott you threw down a good\ntime I threw down a decent time and now\nsomebody else go throw throw down an\neven better time all right so good\nsecond quarter second quarter the second\nquarter isn't even over but uh oh man\nfeeling good all right I haven't forgot\nactually question of the day how is your\nsecond quarter of training progressing\ncuz we're

Smith Oh My\nMy look at this oh is that gold a little\na little CU Buffalo gold don't mind if I\ndo oh that's nice you know what I've\nlearned though I'm literally I might\nsave these for race day because if you\nwear glasses all the time they just get\nthose micro scratches and it's no dice\nso oh those are real oh man they look I\ncan tell it gets a good depth of field\nwhich is critical for trail racing all\nright thank you Smith do appreciate that\nall right let's see what's going on here\nuhhuh oh that's awesome you guys know\nhow much I love compression uh gear I\nwear it all the time

that nice so much\nbetter then so I will start inviting\ntoday okay okay\nbut if you want to mention it at school\nfeel free you guys can get out it's it's\n7:30 all right love you have a great day\nat school did you open the back oh\nyeah oh yeah great job uh with the\nbaseball\ngame okay bye Michael I love you bye SE\nbye\nand they're off as are we now I could I\ncould go to a track I could you know we\ncan go do some oval Loops you I don't\nmind it but it's like\ntrack run uphill track Sprint uphill\ntrack get out in nature a little more\ntrack uh chase down some nice little\nvertical gain that's what we're up to\ntoday today it's I I know we're getting\nready for a birthday mile but at the end\nof the day you know my passion is up in\nthe Hill Country so year I was actually\nthinking uh a little reflection last\nnight and I was like man how long has it\nbeen and I believe it was October which\nI did not film but October\n2023 when the snow hit here in Colorado\nand I was unable to uh chase down some\nsome goodness up into High Country so\nwhy is it so fun to run\nuphill quickly hastily I don't know you\ntell me oh man what question of the day\nwhat is your favorite form of running\nfavorite niche of running mine is uphill\nit's so strange but I just love it and\nuh hold on I just got to get this tag\noff somehow uh the pulse R3 we're taking\nout the one and two have been my go-to\nfor the last 2 years uh the the Brooks\nagile though has my attention I'm\nexcited about this shoe as well probably\na little bit longer fkt action proba I'm\nlike like 10 miles plus 12 miles plus\nthis is the shorter shorter shoe for\ntoday which uh we're going we are going\nabout 5 miles though to the top here in\nbeautiful Boulder Colorado and it's like\nlight in the Jets man um as far as not\nnecessarily speed this is a rustbuster\nan out of shape rustbuster today I have\nnot gone fast like this in a long time\nbut you got to start somewhere you\nremember you're not out of shape you're\njust early in the process so we are\nreally early in fact we might hit snow\non the way up there's no guarantee that\nit's going to be melted up there from we\ngot snow here in Colorado last weekend\nso uh we might hit snow but we're early\nin the process but you got to start\nsomewhere as you're working toward your\ngoals and that is what we're doing today\nuh just having a little fun up in the uh\nup in the this isn't even the high\ncountry this is the this is the low\ncountry uh about 6,000 ft here at the\nstart and I don't even know what we'll I\nthink I'll top out at about 7800 maybe\n8,000 not sure it's a little toasty out\nhere little\ntoasty we're going to try the goggles by\nthe way they're dinit Dina fit dinit\nDina fit whatever you want to call them\nd y n a\nfit so oh some other Runners are\nreporting in that they have the similar\neye issue that I have so we'll see how\nthey perform with respect to uh letting\nmy eyes breathe a little bit right up\nthere all right let's go\n[Music]\n[Music]\nsry buddy\n[Music]\nthat'll bust some Rust if I might say so\nmyself wo oh my my 6 miles to the top\nnot 5.4 so you know straa we love Strava\nwe all love Strava around here but it's\nsometimes a little difficult to find the\ncorrect segment before you actually do\nthe segment and it's crazy I lived in\nBoulder for 5 years in college never I\nnever had gone on that trail before\nbecause so many trails so little time\nbut now that I've been on the trail now\nstraa recognizes that basically they\nrerouted this Trail about looks like\nabout two years ago based on the times\nthat I'm seeing here congrats to Ryan\nDavid and Brad uh I was it looks like my\ntime will put me in about fourth place\nfor this segment so I was 50 2 minutes\nto the top it ended up being 2400\nvertical feet and uh over 6 mil so about\na 7.7% grade and it was a doozy it was\nfun it was it was hard I was working I\nfelt strong though for the first hard\nuphill effort in I don't know four or\nfive months I will take it and didn't\nget the fkt but that's okay again\ncongrats to Ryan he has a 50\nminute5 and so I got to drop about 2\nminutes for that Ryan is is he is always\nthrowing down like uh I don't know him\nbut um whenever I'm you know scouting\nother mountains up in the High Country I\nalways see his name so oh man that was\ngood and what else was I going to say oh\nyeah the downhill I have found that it\ntakes about four to six weeks of\ndownhill running before your quads begin\nto adapt to that downhill and I just\neven though I'm doing the 23m long run\nwith the up and down it's just different\nwhen you're going down steep mountain\nand with when you're negotiating the\nrocks on the way down as well the Pulsar\nthrees epic felt amazing feel a lot like\nthe the you know the two a little better\ngrip I could sense and then uh I don't\nknow they felt really good I can tell I\ncan tell they updated the material a\nlittle bit to be a little more Nimble\nover the top of the foot so good job I'm\nfeeling very good about the Pulsar three\nI think that's it a good rustbuster\ndidn't get it today but we'll be back\nnext week to uh another week Another\nMountain if you know what I mean all\nright Mountain running season oh I am I\namped up this is good uh oh yeah oh yeah\nI don't know if this camera I haven't\nused it in probably about a year it's an\nold camera I don't know if it worked\nhopefully it did and I got some footage\nsome very uh interesting footage along\nthe way pretty simple with this little\ninsta 360 to go all right I think we'll\ntoss it we'll go we'll put it in the\nmountain running Mountain running\nplaylist oh we got to if you like\nMountain running go watch this all right\nseek Beauty work hard and love each\nother",

this so\nthat's today's run the 23m loop from the\nhouse uh 2,000 ft of vertical gain it\njust it's Relentless it just doesn't\nreally stop uh making you focus making\nyou work the entire time and especially\nwith mountain running season uh\nforthcoming it's not we're not too far\noff what is it almost we're like 6 weeks\naway before the snow is melted up there\nso this that's why I'm doing this 23\nmilei Loop just getting used to it all\nright let's rock and roll oh boy a\nlittle scary today thank you Jesus for\nthe clouds\nsteady Edy steady\nEdie just getting it done get in the\nmiles nice steady effort nothing too\nfast on the downhills nothing too slow\non the\nuphills feeling pretty\ngood preparation for that gym we're at M\n17 six miles to go so uh dreaming about\nsome kettle bell action with respect to\nmobility and core\nmobility and\ncore\nmobility and core goals for\n2024 nice and easy\n[Music]\n[Music]\nwe're back there's the run on your\nscreen got it done with a jog home from\nthe gym all right I a quick trip down\nmemory lane I'm not going to talk about\nthe last eight years of YouTube\nuh but I do want to talk about the last\ntwo years on YouTube and of\nracing\nand as I'm like I just been mulling this\nover and what really spurred on this\nthought process for me and reflection\nand it's by the way way too nice to be\ninside after a long winter and long\nspring it's like let's get the let's get\nthe vitamin D while we can everybody so\num but what spurted on was really the\nrdam marathon shout out to everybody in\nthe Netherlands we love you thank you\nfor all your support in the Netherlands\nbut all the memories started popping up\non Facebook and YouTube Twitter uh from\ntwo two years ago feels like that was my\nroad Marathon PR over in rdam feels like\nyesterday that we were chugging along in\nuh the streets of Rotterdam so um when I\nsaw that memory pop up I was like man\nwhat has been going on the last two\nyears and it's it's just been a lot it's\nlike and it spurred me on to this\nthought process of the racing and the\ndesire to race um so as I'm thinking and\nsharing here on YouTube I don't want\nlike yeah yes it's it's my YouTube\nchannel a little bit of my story but\nreally I I just hope it's uh maybe a\nlittle Catalyst for you out there like\nto think back on your last 12 months or\nlast 24 months that's what I've been\ndoing a lot in the last really since I\nstarted training again and yes I got a\nlittle a little taste of a work a baby\nuphill workout last week and it just\nlike as Runners like life is like some\npeople like dirt bikes some people like\nparagliding some people like if you like\nparagliding let us know in the comments\nsome people like rock climbing I don't\nknow whatever gets your jets going\nthat's that's that's fine with me but\nfor me it's absolutely the training and\nthe racing but I haven't been able to do\na ton of racing in the last two years\nsince roterdam since the marathon PR you\nknow we welcome two precious little\ngirls into the world uh the deore deor\ndearer the family has definitely not\ngotten smaller in the last two years and\nso life has just gotten busier there's\nno other way to say it the big boys are\ndoing you know Sports a lot of baseball\nthis spring and and um so I and oh man\nthe sacrum stress fracture was almost 2\nyears ago that wiped out an entire\nsummer of potential Racing for me which\nyou know in the summertime is when I do\nthe mountain racing up in the High\nCountry and so as I'm moving forward and\noh yeah so for you guys like just\nhopefully this just a little Catalyst to\nlike okay take a little check where we\nat everybody and actually question of\nthe day like do you do this have you\never do you do this often where you take\na little check a little temperature on\nyour training and your racing and last\nweek's baby uphill workout just got me\nvery excited for potential fast running\nagain in the future and so I guess I you\nknow to answer the question in the title\nof the Vlog is yes yes yes I will be\nracing again I don't know when but I\nwill be\num all my races have been wiped out in\n2024 I was supposed to have done three\nat this point and the fourth is also\ngoing to be wiped out the family we're\nheading out we're getting out of the\ncountry uh hearing about so I'm going to\nmiss the Boulder Boulder 10K\nunfortunately just uh again life\ncircumstances and so we got to we just\ngot to Pivot and keep moving forward and\nputting our priorities straight but I am\nexcited to\neventually race again and you know I I\nsee the comments and I know I'm I know\nI'm disappointing many of you with my uh\nyou know my YouTube output and my\nrunning output uh even though I'm\nrunning 100 miles a week just so\neverybody knows I am training uh I am\ngetting the work in but I'm just not\nracing and again it's just like life\nlife is life and you press ahead but\nRunners we are like\noh yeah I I was thinking of this on what\nwas it\num you're not you're not out of shape\nyou're just early in the process or you\nhaven't lost your Fitness you're just\nearly in the process of getting your\nFitness back meaning um life is is\nactually kind of long I know sometimes\nthe old saying like you know life is\nshort but like we we have if you stay\nwith it over decades as a runner you're\ngoing to have so many opportunities to\nseize your goals and to chase down your\nPRS and to go to your bucket list races\nI know I've got some bucket list races\nthis Summer that I want to do um even\nthough I've missed it for two summers in\na row but that's okay you you pick\nyourself up and you get back on the on\nthe horse and you you try again so\nthat's what we're going to do I have\nraces not going to share them right now\nI'll make another Vlog very very soon\nabout what I want to be doing for racing\nin\n2024 2023 was the\nfktsgi I haven't heard from you in 12\nmonths and it's like well I've still\nbeen uploading I've still been running\nalmost every day on straa I'm still here\nwe're still alive and that's that that's\nmy little update for all of you yes I\nwill be racing it's been a journey a lot\nof curveballs but uh that's the beauty\nof running is that it'll always be there\nyou know the door will always be there\nfor you to turn that door knob the the\nshoes will always be there to lace them\nup and go get your volume in so I'm\nwhere we go I asked the question today I\ndo believe and\num\nah\nman keep it going just keep it going\njust keep it and life like I I I know\nyou've got a lot of people have grown\nimpatient with me but again I I think in\nI honestly think in decades I don't\nthink even think in years so it's it's\njust you just got to keep going when\nthings are hard and it's been very hard\nthe last five to six months for us but\nwe're coming out the other side we're\ncoming so so don't don't stop don't stop\nall right everybody seek Beauty work\nhard and love each other",

      "text": "[Music]\ndo you ever wake up and just ask\nyourself why does that hurt I don't\nthere's no reason that should hurt but\nit does oh man not getting any younger\nbut we're still we're still trucking\nstill trucking in life Trucking on\nYouTube a little bit little bit all\nright let's go find an\noval in college we used to jog 3 miles\nholding our spikes in our hands from the\nuh campus down to the track\npottsfield and uh now my closest track\nis 6 miles that's open right now during\nthe school year so thank you camel back\nfor the uh vest brand new vest from cam\nBeck it's nice it's feeling good\nappreciate the uh send in the gear but\nthe spikes are in the back for the track\nnow I'm not I'm not giving up on my\n2024 running goals trust me despite\nhaving to take basically 2 and 1/2\nmonths off of serious training I was\nstill running but not very much wasn't\ngoing to the gym just because of Life\ncircumstances you know everyone's okay\nfamily's healthy and happy but life\npopped up and I just had to I had to\nfocus on some other priorities in life\nas the bottom line so but we're back I'm\nback to training at the volume I like to\ntrain at and I haven't forgotten about\nthe goals and actually it's crazy though\nI said this late December 2023 uh two\nyears ago I was at 4100 miles last year\nI was at 3900 I do believe with the\nsacrum stress fracture so I'm right in\nthe ballpark again we'll come back to\nthe mileage and vertical or the mileage\nin vertical here in a minute and last\ngoal for 2023 34 340,000 vertical feet\num I'm ending up 9,000 ft short and I\nmight as well talk about this right now\nfor these mileage and vertical goals\nthat I have every year it's just ranges\nokay it's fun to chase it's fun to keep\nyourself accountable to overall goals\nfor the year but but I'm not going to go\nout and run 9,000 vertical feet between\nnow and the New Year's just to hit that\ngoal and risk I'll just say it like\ninjury or like don't H just be careful\nwith if you do have big goals like that\num be accountable to them but don't if\nyou get behind or if you get a little\nniggle and you need to take a week off\ndon't feel like you should try and make\nthat up I mean I I called it sometimes\nlife happens and you just got to pull\nback a little bit but you don't give up\non your bigger long-term goals and\nprojections in the running space and\nlife but in the running space\nspecifically in that video uh so now in\nthe present uh the birthday mile yes I\nwant to I I can't believe frankly that I\nran 438 here's some footage from the 438\nshout out to Steve for filming that was\nI think it was almost 4 years ago I\ncan't remember maybe 3 years ago\nactually and I ran 438 at a track and so\nI want to PR my birthday Mile and it's\ncoming up so that is what and you know\nwhat's interesting I came up with this\nidea the birthday mile you know four or\nfive years ago just kind of for fun but\nnow I'm realizing and everyone in DJ a\nlot of people in dgr do a birthday mile\nwhere you go to you preferably a track\nyou run as fast as you can for one mile\nand what's nice is that every year it's\na little bit of a challenge to make sure\nnot only are you getting in your long\nruns but you're also getting a little\nbit of turnover in your workout as well\nwhich is why we're at the track today\nintroductory workout I do this workout\nevery uh every time I'm introducing\nspeed into my training 300 meter repeats\non the track nothing crazy fast not all\nout it's basically a long stride a\nlittle faster than a long stride 8 to 12\nI'll probably I'll probably do eight\nwe'll see the legs are a little tired\nfrom the long run on uh Monday uh so\nanyway that's what we're up to oh yeah\nquestion of the day we're through q1\n2024 how are you doing on your goals for\nthis year uh most of my goals will\ntranspire after June after July you know\nthe\nfktsgi\nso let's let's get laced up start to get\na little turnover over going cuz the\nit's nice like the fitness is coming\nback it does come back you all know that\nif you're consistent uh over the long\nhaul you might have to take a little\ntime off like I did but over the long\nhaul you will\nreturn well that was fun little 8X 300\nnothing crazy all right 55 seconds it\njust nice and easy uh got a little\nturnover going felt good again getting\nready for that birthday mile but but uh\noh yeah the sled don't do the sled if\nyou're a track runner if you're getting\nready for short distances the only\nreason I pushed that sled whether it's\nin the gym or at the field here is for\nuphill Mountain running I think because\nof the form that you're actually using\nas you're pushing that sled it's very\nsimilar to running up steep mountains\nlike it's short steps powerful steps all\nright so that's why I use the sled it's\nnot it's not for track runners out there\njust wanted to clarify that all right\ngoal number one for 2024 is to uh was\nmobility and core I've been working\npretty good on the core lately got to\nstill focus on the mobility uh but the\nkettle bells have been my friend in the\ngym let's go get it\n[Music]\n[Music]\nand we're back 16 miles on the day not\ntoo shabby all right here we go the I\ndon't even know where to begin with this\none um the most obscure strange\nunique um just bizarre almost running\ninjury that I think I've ever had in my\nlife all right and yes could potentially\nuh include surgery to resolve this issue\nuh I'll just say it's a uh any\noptometrist out there all right\naium is that am I saying that right\nSurfers ey all right let me just look at\nthis here uh it says also known as\nSurfers ey is a raised wedg shaped\ngrowth of the conjuctiva that extends\nonto the cornea basically I have this\nthis growth on my eyeball and it doesn't\nhurt uh it doesn't obstruct my eyesight\nat this point but it is something that I\nhave to be aware of watch and\npotentially have surgery for because it\nthey really don't they don't go away and\nit can expand and eventually it could\ngrow to the point where it is\nobstructing your view obviously you\ndon't want it to get to that point uh\nbased on the research I've done though\nyou can get the surgery and it can grow\nback so that's not good and the\noptometrist is like what do you do for\nwork what are you doing out there why do\nyou have this growing on your eyeball\nand I simply said well I'm a runner and\nspecifically I like running up in the\nmountains a lot in the summertime and so\nwhat causes s I'm going to call it surf\nSurfers ey that's the nickname um\nSun wind and dust all right it's like\nthose are the three recipes for what I\ndo like that's exactly what is happening\nwhen I run above 12,000 ft it's very\nsunny very it can be very windy and yes\nit can be a little Dusty at times out\nthere on the it's like so the the op the\ndoctor uh the optometrist said uh that's\nexact that's it that has to be why this\nis happening so it is a running injury\nuh because it's caused that's what she\nsaid like it's it's definitely going to\nbe caused by your running and that's why\nthis this topic is coming up because\nover on straa I'm getting a lot of\nquestions about Seth what in the world\nare you doing wearing these goggles well\nnow you know all right these are\nhigh-grade Goggles meaning it blocks\nmore the Sun but also the main thing the\ndoctor said is you want to try to keep\nyour eyes out of really windy situations\nall right so I think they're actually\nworking as far like they as far as\nkeeping the wind out and the dust um\nwill I be able to wear them all summer\nlong through the summer heat I don't\nknow but they've been really awesome to\nwear uh through the winter and early\nspring months here in Colorado where yes\nwe do get a lot of wind so that is my\nrunning injury that is might requ it\nwell I I'm going to get a second opinion\njust to make sure uh what the best\ncourse of action is but it's like you\nknow what do you it's\nlike it's not going to stop me from\nrunning at this point but it is\nsomething I just need to monitor so I\nlove you all thanks for tuning in to uh\na little a little baby track session A\nLittle Gym work and then of course this\nuh this running injury all right there\nit is oh Deli oh Deli it doesn't hurt it\ndoesn't hurt just looks kind of eh not\nso great all right onward and upward we\nwill uh pass it to the maybe the running\ninjury playlist or something like that\nright there all right seek Beauty work\nhard and love each other",

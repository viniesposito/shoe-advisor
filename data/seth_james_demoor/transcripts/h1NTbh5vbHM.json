  "text": "[Music]\nthese are the fun moments when the path\nyou are on as a runner isn't as\nclear as you might hope for whether you\ncoach yourself whether you work with a\ncoach either way you got to make\ndecisions you might have two three four\nfive doors in front of you that you just\nhave to analyze and figure out huh I\nwent down this this door this path and\nit it didn't quite work AKA last week on\nhere on Peak I didn't keep up with\nJoseph that's right he took off and my\nlegs didn't quite have the juice didn't\nquite have the the the power to get up\nthat mountain as fast as him so now\nwhere it becomes a a riddle and riddles\nare fun that's it's like the last seven\ndays I have thought way too much about\nthe Tinker I'm always talking about the\ntinker and what can I do differently\nwhich door can I choose in the next\nseven days to make the results a little\ndifferent for today for this morning\nthat's the fun part of training of\nrunning and I hope I just hope that you\ncan get to that point in your training\nin your running uh you know may it might\ntake you a couple years it might take\nyou five years it might take you a\ndecade before you feel comfortable\nenough to make those decisions for\nyourself knowing ooh okay didn't quite\nwork out this week we're going to we're\ngoing to we're going to go through this\ndoor and see if we can change uh change\nthe outcome so that's what we're doing\ntoday it's been a fun week of I'll just\nsay it trial and air or air and trial\nyou know Belford two weeks ago here on\nlast week we got Belford hereon was\ngreat but not I wasn't I wasn't at the I\nwasn't at the level all right so go to\nElbert the tallest mountain in Colorado\nthis is the North Trail the South Trail\nwe got earlier in the summer it was\nbeautiful it was amazing but it was a\nvery simple Day meaning the time was\npretty pedestrian for Joseph and I to go\ngo after together the North Trail is not\nit's the opposite it is the doozy it is\ndifficult it is fast it is steep 177%\ngrade about 4.6 mil to the top about\n4,300 you can tell tell I've been I've\nbeen analyzing about 4,300 vertical feet\nlet's get after it get these shoes on\nget through beautiful Leadville Colorado\nand uh see if we can't track down Joseph\nin the High\n[Music]\nCountry yeah I think you know it's it's\nbasically 105 flat yeah and uh\nif you uh same deal\nif if you feel good you go if I feel\ngood I'll go if hopefully we feel the\nsame yep\nbut\nokay no I think we I think we nailed the\nweather day yeah this would be great\nso okay count down\nyeah\nthree two one go\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nh\nthat's crazy\n[Music]\nhe\n[Music]\nhe\n[Music]\n[Music]\ncan I kick some ass let's go\n[Music]\n[Music]\nsh\n105 you\ngood thank\nyou enjoy kill it enjoy yeah butter my\nbread\nw\nokay\nright I'd do that you'll never see\nme\nah that was good told me that maybe\nyou're just not going to be able to ever\nrun again and I'm like I'm okay with\nthat's okay hiking is just\ngreat well we were close\nright just like so I don't know we'll\nhave to have a\ndiscussion\nabout I don't know if stra will give it\nto us yeah but I think\nfkt so I was thinking on the way\ndown in uh\nDiscord I could ask some like math\nWizards yeah to\nlike use the difference in\ndistance and the pitch and the final\ntimes yeah\nso I think we like we might have been 10\nor 15 seconds short yeah but we ran A4\nmile further right like I think I had\n4.88 yeah maybe 4.9 and it was and it\nwas 4.6 totally yeah so that's if I'm\ndoing the math right on my watch that's\na quarter mile basically yep so I think\nthose switch backs where the new Trail\nis\nI think it's I think that's basically\nwhere it's adding on yeah most of\nthe I mean I think it's noticeable how\nthat was probably oh yeah and then and\nthen also tell the people whoever the\nmath Wizards\nare um like on my watch so yeah I think\nthat's the key met metric maybe is is\nthe 13 my watch said and I trust Garmin\nbut once we get back to service but my\nwatch said we average 1330 a mile yeah\nand I know\nfrom\nstraa my fkt was\n1406 what you what we got today was up\nin the uh lasportiva Captiva\nCaptiva all right Mount Albert\n14,433 think yeah sounds bad right\ntallest mountain in Colorado so we got\nCaptiva I went with the pulsars yeah it\ndid well and um hair of our chinny chin\nchin uh razor thin margins yeah there's\nkind of layers I feel like there's\nlayers to uh fkt efforts totally yeah\nthere's where it's like you know some\nmountains that have never been touched\nand then there's some mountains that are\nvery popular that's what this one was\ntoday right yeah popular mountain in\ngeneral and very popular Mountain for\nfkt some of the names that have yeah\ngone after the times it's pretty cool to\nsee yeah be a part of that list and uh\nyeah it was it was close we so as usual\nwe don't have cell service right yeah I\ncan't tell yet so we don't know we don't\ncan't give you an answer with respect to\nif we got it or not but it was fun\nand uh we just rolled from the beginning\nright yeah it was fast off the gun and\nthere's some fast sections below tree\nline and yeah really fun day there was\nsome good people out there the trail\ncomments be hilarious butter my bread I\ndon't know if you heard it on the little\ncamera but we whoever you were hopefully\nyou see this uh thanks for getting a\nlittle butter my bread on there enjoy K\nit yeah someone said that there were\nFlames coming off our feet oh nice\nsomeone said uh I didn't hear that\nsomeone said uh save some oxygen for us\noh really that's we some good ones\nthat's good that's good yeah just I know\nand uh a little windy on top it's just\njust perfect temperature pretty much the\nwhole way but again we're talking like I\nsaid last week it's just seconds cuz all\nthese all these uh all these\nfktsgi yeah shout out to everyone who's\ngone after this time Noah Killian back\nin the day Anton Anton Sage yeah a lot\nof uh a lot of stout Runners yo yeah I\nmean it's just been like if you look at\nthe top 10 maybe I'll put it on the\nscreen it's just\nlike it's like the best yeah and\nsomething that's cool about fktsgi\nI don't know if they're making the trail\nfaster but they're definitely making it\nbetter and more sustainable it's for\nlong term it's like the work they're\ndoing is incredible I if I can find\nfootage basically they're adding steps\nand retaining walls and it's totally\nnecessary because hundreds of people\nalmost hundreds of people go up it every\nday so you have to control the trail and\nbut you have to do the good old stair\nstepping as well yeah and the\nquads yeah stair stepping the the uh\nit's a little bit added distance now\nwhich will be interesting to kind of\nbreak down and see like you know when\nthe trail is fully fully done like you\nknow what it really looks like I think I\nhad like\n4.88 4.9 basically to the top from so\nwe'll see again once we get back to cell\nservice but it at the end of the day\nit's all about the stimulus yeah abely\nbrick stacking those bricks\nand it just is were working pretty hard\nit was a lung burner you probably heard\nthe uh heard the breathing at the end\nthere so yeah fun day and now we go to\nItaly yeah last uh last hard effort and\nI think we're ready this might be the\nlast might be the last Vlog before Italy\nbut if you're watching in Italy maybe\nwe'll see you there in Northern Italy so\nCasto yeah oh man all right good work\ncool the socks shoot you okay oh yeah\nthe sockss are perfect nice yep had to\nbring the fast socks for this one yeah I\nknow be able to dive in to the fkt on\nthe tallest mountain in Colorado yes we\nhave 58 Summits that rise above 14,000\nft but I can't dive into it now because\nI got to go catch an airplane that's\nright there's the passport Joseph and I\nare heading to Italy for for races this\nweekend in Casto Italy Northern Italy uh\nI'm going to do a VK on Saturday and\nthen a half marathon on Sunday and I\nknow this is might be a little\ndisappointing that we're not going to\nreally break down uh what happened on\nMount Elbert but I just got to tell\nyou there's a lot of layers to there's\nlayers to this thing and it's fun\nbecause guess what it's connected to\nhistory\ntradition uh\nexperience and um people you know like\nreal legitimate mountain and Ultra\nRunners from across the United States\nbut especially here in Colorado who have\nput forth very Valiant efforts on Mount\nElbert all right\n14,433 ft above sea level that's a\nsummit of Mount Albert and let's just\nsay Joseph and I put forth a very good\neffort today but some other things some\nother actions that's a better way to say\nit some some other actions were also put\nforth on Mount Elbert literally at the\nexact same time that Joseph and I were\non the mountain all right and I'll just\nleave it at that and so probably in a\nweek from now 10 days from now once\nJoseph and I are back from Italy again\nwe got to go to Italy go race and once\nwe're back I just don't think I'm going\nto have the time to really dive into\nwhat transpired on the mountain and what\nwe witnessed all right I'm going to\nleave it at that it was very good I will\nsay it was a PR for me Joseph I'm not\nsure if he's act I don't think he has\nactually on that particular Trail the\nNorth Trail on Mount Elbert I don't\nthink he's ever put forth an fkt effort\nand that's what we did today and so that\nwas my probably\nthird third or fourth effort in the last\nfive or six years on that mountain and\nit was a PR so that's good but there's\nlayers layers to this story and it's fun\nand\ndramatic quite quite dramatic oh my\ngoodness all right I'll let you dig into\nit if you want to over on straa all\nright we will uh we will toss it to the\nuh f KT playlist right there sorry I\ncan't give you more answers but I got to\nwe got to we got to get off to Italy all\nright seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other",

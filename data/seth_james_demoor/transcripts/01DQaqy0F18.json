  "text": "[Music]\ndo you ever wake up and just ask\nyourself why does that hurt I don't\nthere's no reason that should hurt but\nit does oh man not getting any younger\nbut we're still we're still trucking\nstill trucking in life Trucking on\nYouTube a little bit little bit all\nright let's go find an\noval in college we used to jog 3 miles\nholding our spikes in our hands from the\nuh campus down to the track\npottsfield and uh now my closest track\nis 6 miles that's open right now during\nthe school year so thank you camel back\nfor the uh vest brand new vest from cam\nBeck it's nice it's feeling good\nappreciate the uh send in the gear but\nthe spikes are in the back for the track\nnow I'm not I'm not giving up on my\n2024 running goals trust me despite\nhaving to take basically 2 and 1/2\nmonths off of serious training I was\nstill running but not very much wasn't\ngoing to the gym just because of Life\ncircumstances you know everyone's okay\nfamily's healthy and happy but life\npopped up and I just had to I had to\nfocus on some other priorities in life\nas the bottom line so but we're back I'm\nback to training at the volume I like to\ntrain at and I haven't forgotten about\nthe goals and actually it's crazy though\nI said this late December 2023 uh two\nyears ago I was at 4100 miles last year\nI was at 3900 I do believe with the\nsacrum stress fracture so I'm right in\nthe ballpark again we'll come back to\nthe mileage and vertical or the mileage\nin vertical here in a minute and last\ngoal for 2023 34 340,000 vertical feet\num I'm ending up 9,000 ft short and I\nmight as well talk about this right now\nfor these mileage and vertical goals\nthat I have every year it's just ranges\nokay it's fun to chase it's fun to keep\nyourself accountable to overall goals\nfor the year but but I'm not going to go\nout and run 9,000 vertical feet between\nnow and the New Year's just to hit that\ngoal and risk I'll just say it like\ninjury or like don't H just be careful\nwith if you do have big goals like that\num be accountable to them but don't if\nyou get behind or if you get a little\nniggle and you need to take a week off\ndon't feel like you should try and make\nthat up I mean I I called it sometimes\nlife happens and you just got to pull\nback a little bit but you don't give up\non your bigger long-term goals and\nprojections in the running space and\nlife but in the running space\nspecifically in that video uh so now in\nthe present uh the birthday mile yes I\nwant to I I can't believe frankly that I\nran 438 here's some footage from the 438\nshout out to Steve for filming that was\nI think it was almost 4 years ago I\ncan't remember maybe 3 years ago\nactually and I ran 438 at a track and so\nI want to PR my birthday Mile and it's\ncoming up so that is what and you know\nwhat's interesting I came up with this\nidea the birthday mile you know four or\nfive years ago just kind of for fun but\nnow I'm realizing and everyone in DJ a\nlot of people in dgr do a birthday mile\nwhere you go to you preferably a track\nyou run as fast as you can for one mile\nand what's nice is that every year it's\na little bit of a challenge to make sure\nnot only are you getting in your long\nruns but you're also getting a little\nbit of turnover in your workout as well\nwhich is why we're at the track today\nintroductory workout I do this workout\nevery uh every time I'm introducing\nspeed into my training 300 meter repeats\non the track nothing crazy fast not all\nout it's basically a long stride a\nlittle faster than a long stride 8 to 12\nI'll probably I'll probably do eight\nwe'll see the legs are a little tired\nfrom the long run on uh Monday uh so\nanyway that's what we're up to oh yeah\nquestion of the day we're through q1\n2024 how are you doing on your goals for\nthis year uh most of my goals will\ntranspire after June after July you know\nthe\nfktsgi\nso let's let's get laced up start to get\na little turnover over going cuz the\nit's nice like the fitness is coming\nback it does come back you all know that\nif you're consistent uh over the long\nhaul you might have to take a little\ntime off like I did but over the long\nhaul you will\nreturn well that was fun little 8X 300\nnothing crazy all right 55 seconds it\njust nice and easy uh got a little\nturnover going felt good again getting\nready for that birthday mile but but uh\noh yeah the sled don't do the sled if\nyou're a track runner if you're getting\nready for short distances the only\nreason I pushed that sled whether it's\nin the gym or at the field here is for\nuphill Mountain running I think because\nof the form that you're actually using\nas you're pushing that sled it's very\nsimilar to running up steep mountains\nlike it's short steps powerful steps all\nright so that's why I use the sled it's\nnot it's not for track runners out there\njust wanted to clarify that all right\ngoal number one for 2024 is to uh was\nmobility and core I've been working\npretty good on the core lately got to\nstill focus on the mobility uh but the\nkettle bells have been my friend in the\ngym let's go get it\n[Music]\n[Music]\nand we're back 16 miles on the day not\ntoo shabby all right here we go the I\ndon't even know where to begin with this\none um the most obscure strange\nunique um just bizarre almost running\ninjury that I think I've ever had in my\nlife all right and yes could potentially\nuh include surgery to resolve this issue\nuh I'll just say it's a uh any\noptometrist out there all right\naium is that am I saying that right\nSurfers ey all right let me just look at\nthis here uh it says also known as\nSurfers ey is a raised wedg shaped\ngrowth of the conjuctiva that extends\nonto the cornea basically I have this\nthis growth on my eyeball and it doesn't\nhurt uh it doesn't obstruct my eyesight\nat this point but it is something that I\nhave to be aware of watch and\npotentially have surgery for because it\nthey really don't they don't go away and\nit can expand and eventually it could\ngrow to the point where it is\nobstructing your view obviously you\ndon't want it to get to that point uh\nbased on the research I've done though\nyou can get the surgery and it can grow\nback so that's not good and the\noptometrist is like what do you do for\nwork what are you doing out there why do\nyou have this growing on your eyeball\nand I simply said well I'm a runner and\nspecifically I like running up in the\nmountains a lot in the summertime and so\nwhat causes s I'm going to call it surf\nSurfers ey that's the nickname um\nSun wind and dust all right it's like\nthose are the three recipes for what I\ndo like that's exactly what is happening\nwhen I run above 12,000 ft it's very\nsunny very it can be very windy and yes\nit can be a little Dusty at times out\nthere on the it's like so the the op the\ndoctor uh the optometrist said uh that's\nexact that's it that has to be why this\nis happening so it is a running injury\nuh because it's caused that's what she\nsaid like it's it's definitely going to\nbe caused by your running and that's why\nthis this topic is coming up because\nover on straa I'm getting a lot of\nquestions about Seth what in the world\nare you doing wearing these goggles well\nnow you know all right these are\nhigh-grade Goggles meaning it blocks\nmore the Sun but also the main thing the\ndoctor said is you want to try to keep\nyour eyes out of really windy situations\nall right so I think they're actually\nworking as far like they as far as\nkeeping the wind out and the dust um\nwill I be able to wear them all summer\nlong through the summer heat I don't\nknow but they've been really awesome to\nwear uh through the winter and early\nspring months here in Colorado where yes\nwe do get a lot of wind so that is my\nrunning injury that is might requ it\nwell I I'm going to get a second opinion\njust to make sure uh what the best\ncourse of action is but it's like you\nknow what do you it's\nlike it's not going to stop me from\nrunning at this point but it is\nsomething I just need to monitor so I\nlove you all thanks for tuning in to uh\na little a little baby track session A\nLittle Gym work and then of course this\nuh this running injury all right there\nit is oh Deli oh Deli it doesn't hurt it\ndoesn't hurt just looks kind of eh not\nso great all right onward and upward we\nwill uh pass it to the maybe the running\ninjury playlist or something like that\nright there all right seek Beauty work\nhard and love each other",

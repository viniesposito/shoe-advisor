really strong\nsecond quarter of training really strong\nI think this is the seventh or eighth\nweek above 100 miles so it's just been a\nnice I I'll put it on the screen right\nnow the uh mileage graph I was running\nlike 20 30 miles a week the first two\nmonths of the year not much maybe 40 mil\nonce it just was that was life but now\nwe're coming it's like you just you\nlearn as you get older as a runner to be\nbe incredibly patient and so that's what\nI've been this year and I feel good but\nbut when I started today this is a\ncarpenter Peak uh my legs were done they\nwere heavy they felt like lead they\ndidn't want to go the effort on Monday\nwhere I had to really really dig and I\nmissed that fkt by two seconds um I felt\nit today but we got it today all right\noh that was fun um I think it was Scott\nshout out to Scott you threw down a good\ntime I threw down a decent time and now\nsomebody else go throw throw down an\neven better time all right so good\nsecond quarter

Smith was my first\ngoto uh sunglasses for trail running\nabout 5 years ago I had the chroma pop\nMax remember those glasses I wore them\nfor a couple years but I ended up\nbreaking a couple pairs so Smith Oh My\nMy look at this oh is that gold a little\na little CU Buffalo gold don't mind if I\ndo oh that's nice you know what I've\nlearned though I'm literally I might\nsave these for race day because if you\nwear glasses all the time they just get\nthose micro scratches and it's no dice\nso oh those are real oh man they look I\ncan tell it gets a good depth of field\nwhich is critical for trail racing all\nright thank you Smith do appreciate that\nall right let's see what's going on here\nuhhuh oh that's awesome you guys know\nhow much I love compression uh gear I\nwear it all the time

for literally\nblazing the trail for races like this\nthe Kendall Mountain Run all right in\nSilverton Colorado uh another iconic\nrace in this area is the imagene pass\nrun so we're talking 40 years 50 years\nof racing up and down this mountain\npretty epic I can't wait to see uh see\nwhat it's like up there this year and\nagain it's uh 6 mil up 6 mil down the\nlast time I was here was 2020 and

weekend so we'll see\nhow the legs uh can deal with the uh the\nLeadville uh so Leadville is interesting\nLeadville started at 10,000\nand topped out at 13,000 so this one uh\nthis race actually Silverton I'm passing\nthe sign right now is\n9,300 uh ft above sea level so it's\ndefinitely it's up there but not quite\nas high as lead Bill Let's Go epicness\nI'm going to go Cruise the cruise

the last time Joseph\nBarton and I were here was during Co we\nhad to start like we had to start with\nmasks on and stand like 6 to 8 feet\napart it was crazy at the start line uh\nso we're back to normaly and she said\n300 I was like wow this is that's a lot\nI mean I think I think there was I don't\nknow I want to say like 50 Runners last\ntime I was here so we're back let's go\nget the uh get the warmup on get the\nracing shoes on and then uh let it rip\nthrough the uh the the hills of the San\nJuans all right these are the San Juan\nmountains down here in Southwest\nColorado they call it

Silverton\nwe shall see epic day amazing day for a\nlot of different reasons um I did not\nrun as well as maybe I had hoped but\nguess what uh well first of all no Andes\nthat's right so for those that don't\nknow for if you're new to the channel I\nget Andes Frozen Custard when I win a\nrace get a PR or get an fkt I bring\nandies to the house for the whole family\nto enjoy it's a fun family tradition\nthat we've been doing for probably 5\nyears now and so when I have to break\nthe news that I got second place and I\ndid not win I did not PR the course\ntoday in fact I was about I think 3 or 4\nminutes slower than four years ago we'll\ntalk more about that in a second but\nthat's part of the point I want to teach\nmy kids especially the older boys Joseph\nand Seth they're old enough now to\nrealize like life isn't always going to\nbe a winning proposition there's going\nto be challenges there's going to be\nmoments where you don't hit your PR\nwhere you got to go back to the you know\nto the training and see what you can do\nthe next time so uh cam who today\ncongrats Cam he's an amazing Runner and\nNoah in third he's also an amazing\nRunner and uh so it was fun to mix it up\ntoday with some of the really the some\nof the best Mountain runners in Colorado\nand so to come in second I feel pretty\ngood about it considering my legs are\npretty heavy from the Leadville heavy\nhalf marathon you know 7 or eight days\nago and so it was it was really good oh\nyeah that's what I wanted to mention\nsometimes I am in first place in races\nor in your situation sometimes you might\nbe on track uh or sorry a little behind\ntrack to set a PR on a course that you\nlove you know you run the same race\nevery year and you might be like wait a\nminute I'm 20 seconds slower than I was\na year ago at Mile 2 in a 5k or whatever\nthe case may be well keep fighting\nbecause today I was in fourth place for\na good chunk of the race probably about\n5 miles up and then I caught third place\nand then eventually second place and\nthat was fun and I did it last year\nactually at the Pikes Peak Ascent as\nwell where yeah trust me would I prefer\nto be in first place absolutely but\nsometimes you got to fight and you're\nnot always going to be in first play you\ngot to fight for every single place and\nso to move up from fourth place to\nsecond place it was just that was that\nwas good and I caught second place on\nthe downhill you guys know me I'm not a\nfat I'm not a fast fast downhill Runner\nlike it's not it's just not my cup of\ntea but man I was able to catch second\nplace and that felt good like okay I\nstill got it I can still turn the legs\nover at 39 These Guys these guys are\nyoung pups they're young whipper\nsnappers that I'm racing but I'm trying\nto hang with them and uh so far so good\nso anyway that was a that's a little\nbrief recap of the race Kendall Mountain\n12 miles uh didn't run as fast as four\nyears ago and the legs just they were a\nlittle heavy there were no joke that's\nwhy the the Lille heavy half definitely\nuh stuck around this time so I love you\nquestion of the day who raced this past\nweekend what did you do what was the\ndistance what was the surface tell us\nyour your triumphs but also your\nchallenges okay again again it's not all\nabout just you know nailing it every\ntime you're not going to win every\nyou're not going to win your age group\nyou're not going to PR every race but\nyou keep coming back and you keep coming\nback that's what it's all about at least\nin my in my book so onward and upward uh\nI do have an announcement for yes\nanother race very very soon stay tuned\nfor that uh it's going down in uh I'll\njust say a state that's neighboring\nColorado very very soon all right we'll\ntoss it to the Kendall Mountain race\nfrom 4 years ago all right oh man so so\ngood boys we'll get andies again don't\nyou worry seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other",

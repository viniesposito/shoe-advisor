  "text": "[Music]\nwe're doing it again dgr yes we are\ndoing it again amazing another year is\nin the books and tough year difficult\nyear hard year challenging year however\nyou want to say it it was a hard year\nfor the deor clan all right and but we\nmade it through that's the key is that\nwe're all going to have hard years we're\nall going to be challenged but you come\nout the other side a different person a\nstronger person um and a person that's\nready for the next challenge cuz you\nknow it's going to come because why\nwe're human beings all right so thanks\nfor sticking with me through thick and\nthin and I realized listen hundreds\nthousands H maybe tens of thousands of\nRunners have you know said I'm not going\nto watch Seth's YouTube channel why two\nreasons really but it's okay\nwhy he doesn't do a daily Vlog anymore\nand he doesn't do shoe reviews anymore\nand the reason I know this is because\nyou email me you comment below and\nthat's okay but but but but but but I\nwant to make the point I don't want you\nto be a runner or to seek inspiration\nfor running because of me I want you to\nseek your inspiration your motivation to\nbe Runner because of you because of\nwhat's inside of you and I yes I just\nordered my own copy I've read the book\nbefore in college but I I don't actually\nown a copy of once a runner many of you\nhave read it it is the quintessential\nnovel for runners once a runner great\nbook and it really speaks to the uh\nexperience that we runners go through as\nhuman beings on this Earth\nthat once you're a runner once you've\ndiscovered the the lore of running the\nAllure of running the uh just the the\nthe grit and the the uh yeah the grind\nof being a runner and how much you want\nit how much you seek it out every single\nday to be a runner it's um it's\nsomething that you just can't explain to\nmost humans on this Earth in fact many\npeople on this Earth will think you're\ncrazy if you're a runner and that you\nrun every single day but once it's in\nyou and it might take it might take a\nyear it's probably going to take five\nyears it's probably going to take a\ndecade and yes uh I started running in\n1997 all right and many of you know the\nstory I was a soccer player growing up\nbut I was a small soccer player so I\ncouldn't kick my legs I could run all\nday I could outrun anybody on the soccer\nfield but I couldn't kick the ball hard\nenough to get to the goal and So\neventually I decided you know what we're\njust going to leave the ball behind and\nwe're just going to run and run and\nthat's when I joined my cross country\nteam in in Middle School in seventh\ngrade in 1997 I tell that little\nbackstory to encourage you is your\nDiscerning your goals and yes I'm going\nto pull up my goals here from 2024 and\n2025 on my computer here as you're\nDiscerning and figuring out your goals\nfor the new year um it's important to\nremember that it might take you time to\ndiscover what should my annual mileage\nbe what should my annual uh racing goals\nbe what should my annual goals in the\ngym be okay what vertical goals all of\nthat and I guess why not let's dive into\nit right now from 2010 to\n2017 I was starting a family I was\ngetting you know getting married\nstarting a family you know doing my own\nwork uh and but you know moving into the\nold house and so I actually wasn't\nrunning very much maybe 5 to 800 miles a\nyear no joke but here's the graph on\nyour screen when the Vlog started and\nthank you if you've been watching for\neight years nine years on this YouTube\nchannel it's been a long time here's the\ngraph all right so slowly I've been\ndialing in and again I just want to\nencourage you if you're a newer Runner\nespecially it might take you two three 5\n10 years to figure out what should my\nannual mileage be what should my annual\nvertical gain be what should my routine\nbe in the gym it just takes time\ninconsistency so all right so keep going\nkeep going don't stop oh yeah question\nof the day what were your running goals\nfor\n2024 how' you do and what are your\nrunning goals for\n2025 sound good I cannot wait to read\nyour goals down below in the comments so\nhere are my goals from\n2024 I had eight of them and I think I\nhit four of them all right so core\ncrushed it Mobility not so much oh I got\nto work on it in\n20125 three\nfktsgi\nmy brotherr we live in Colorado we've\ngot 58 mountains that go above 14,000 ft\nof course that's going to be like the\nthat's the Pinnacle that's what we\nthat's what we love to do there's the\nfootage on your screen like it's amaz\nlike we crushed it I I can't even\nexplain to you how many\nfktsgi\nin uh 2000 like we nail we it was a\nlittle ridiculous actually how many\nmountains we ran but anyway there you go\nwe crushed uh gold number three for\n2024 uh win One race good check mark we\nactually won two races in\n2024 PR my birthday mile nope\nso the family and I had a tough year we\njust had a tough year and what am I\nalways saying on this channel life is\npart of running running is part of life\nall right so they go together and\nsometimes you get a curveball and it's a\ncurveball that you swing in a miss and\nthese circumstances that came up in 2024\nfor the family they were out of our\ncontrol and that actually makes true\nlove and I feel quite a bit better it's\nlike we didn't it was out of our control\nis that's just I'm just going to leave\nit at that so when I'm reflecting on my\nPR my birthday mile also goal number\nfive uh sorry goal number six uh\n4,31 miles um I came up short for both\nof those and sometimes life I just say\ngets in the way and that's what happened\nfor us in 2024 however today when I'm\nrecording this I did hit goal number\nseven\n341,000 vertical feet the most vertical\nfeet of my entire life as a 39-year-old\nI feel really good about that and then\nlast goal goal number eight Road\nMarathon PR I did not hit it nope didn't\nhit didn't even attempt it didn't even\nrun a road marathon in in excuse me in\n2024 that is okay so it was a good year\nbut it wasn't a great year all right and\nI'm excited for the new year to put the\nchallenges in the rearview mirror move\nahead and I hope for you out there as I\nread your comments down below if you\ndidn't hit your goals in\n2024 bump it up bump it to the next year\nbump it to 2025 and who knows maybe\nyou'll hit a goal in in the new year\nthat you didn't hit last year all right\nthat's okay uh they roll over and you're\ngoing to see there they are on your\nscreen all of them together and yes the\nleast is first the least uh exciting is\nfirst uh core strength Mobility I'm\nputting them all together now why am I\nputting them all together this year\nversus last year I split them up core\nstrength Mobility because I actually\nlike going to the gym I go three times a\nweek I'll make a vlog about that very\nsoon why I'm doing that in the New Year\nactually I've been doing it the last 6\nmonths but I like the core I like the\nstrength work I don't like the mobility\nwork it's like I lo it so if I'm going\nto go to go to the gym that's like a\ntreat for me I like going to the gym I\nlike I like working in the gym but do I\nlike doing the mobility I do not so if\nI'm going to go do core and strength\nI've also got to do so that's why I'm\nlumping them together because I got to\nkeep myself accountable that way does\nthat make sense I hope it does there you\ngo that was goal number one goal number\ntwo three again fkt we're just keeping\nit real uh I won two races in last year\nuh the goal is to win three races next\nyear I like to be competitive and yes I\nwill be turning 40 in the new year and\nso I'll become a master's Runner but but\njust all right quick Side Story here's\nfootage from Utah about seven months ago\nand I was looking around the starting\nline and I was like wait a minute I'm\nracing 20y olds I'm I was actually\nracing 19y olds these kids could be my\nkids these kids could be my kids I think\nI took sixth or seventh in the race so I\ndid okay it was very competitive but\nanyway it's like not getting any younger\nI'm going to become a master's runner in\n2025 and I want to win through outright\nI don't want to win my age group I want\nto win it's just a competitive nature\ninside me keep that spark going and I\nhope you've got a spark for you maybe\nit's not to win a race outright but\nthink about like what gets you going\nwhat's the spark inside you that gets\nyou excited all right so keep keep it\nmaybe it's Health just Health lower your\ncholesterol in 2000 whatever it is uh\nthat's the spark that and so that's my\nspark for two thou for\n2025 yes PR the birthday mile I'm not\ngiving up on it I am not giving up on PR\nthe birthday mile 4,400 miles in 2 I I\nknow I can get it because it's based on\nhistory The Last 5 Years and what true\nlove and I went through in 2024 all\nright so I know I can get that one goal\nnumber five goal number six\n350,000 vertical feet we're going to get\nit in a half marathon PR and uh on that\nhalf marathon PR um March or April all\nright so I'm not going to announce yet\nwhich race I haven't even registered I'm\nstill researching sea level half\nmarathon PR lifetime half marathon PR in\nMarch or April 2025 that is the last\ngoal for running goal for the year\nonward and upward thanks for listening I\nhope you hit your goals and if you\ndidn't roll it over don't be afraid to\nroll over your goals to the New Year all\nright of course we'll toss it to last\nyear's goal Vlog from 365 days ago don't\ngive up don't give up don't ever give up\nkeep it rolling all right so right there\nright there I love you all what a great\nyear all right what a good year and what\na great year we are about to have in the\nNew Year all right seek Beauty work hard\nand love each other",

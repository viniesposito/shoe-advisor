I'll check back in on the\ndistance I'm going to make some guesses\nsee if we're see if we're accurate\n[Music]\nwe're going 29\nmiles 2800 vertical feet that's the\nguest for today oh Nelly let's just say\nnot ready for this not the fitness level\nis quite low right now it's almost\nChristmas we're just enjoying pumpkin\npie but that's okay we got an\n[Music]\nadventure 5 and 1/2 miles in woo get a\nlittle get a little AA one second here M\nokay hey Loops patience give yourself a\nlittle Grace 3 years we've been in the\nnew house I'm believe I you know 3 years\nthat's seems like seems like yesterday\nwell really the only concern about\nmoving from the little Peno house to the\nbigger house for the family was that I\nlost access no at the old house we had\nlived there true love and I for 9 years\n9 years at the old house and I had the\nloops dialed in as a runner so I was a\nlittle concerned moving to the new house\nbecause it's like all right I got to go\ndiscover a whole new neighborhood a\nwhole new Bear Creek State Park where\nI'm at right now and figure out what is\nthe exact mileage kilometers miles\nhowever you want to track it for all of\nthese Loops all right and then about a\nweek ago right around Thanksgiving it\ndawned on me wait a minute what if I\nconnected that loop with that Loop with\nthat Loop how and that's what I made the\nguess a minute ago how big is this Loop\ngoing to be let's go on an adventure and\nfind out and so that's what we're doing\ntoday but I just want to little tip of\nthe day give yourself a year two years I\nI always say two years to figure out how\nbig or sorry how how are my Loops going\nto develop from my front door all right\nso you will know here's my 5 m Loop\nhere's my 10m Loop here's my 23 Mile\nLoop and today I'm guessing guessing\nabout 29 mies I really don't know that's\nmy guess so we'll see I'll tell you at\nthe end and remember the 20m fkt I did\nabout 6 weeks ago just about a mile back\nas I was reflecting on what I was going\nto share with you right now I was like\nwait a minute oh my my depending on what\ntoday's Loop is I could connect the 20m\nfkt that I snagged the mini Falcon Punch\nto this Loop that I'm on today and then\nare we looking at a are we looking at a\n50 m loop from my front door on this is\nwhere it gets exciting everybody on I'm\ngoing to say today is going to be about\n70% on dirt and we live in the city and\nso if you can you know for me I love\nrunning on dirt I love the trails I love\nthe vert if you can find those Loops\nthat have some dirt even better all\nright\n[Music]\nIce Ice Baby\n[Music]\nwoo I wonder how many mountain lions\ncross through\nhere this feels like mountain lion\nterritory right through\nhere keep your eyes up\neverybody haven't said that in a while\neyes up pum\nboms quick\nfeet you can't really see it but there's\nthe mile high city way out there Denver\nColorado this is definitely the best\nview of Denver\nin the city up here on Green Mountain\nall right time for a little little snack\n[Music]\n[Music]\nlet's see your uh hoodie\nJoseph yeah guys enjoying a snack y nice\nthere it is come\non good job what do you see more more\nmore okay okay did he finish it no h fin\nit me Michael we his dogs\noh all right you guys enjoying your\nsnack oh yeah all right beautiful day\nfor a snack on the\npatio you want to see it Henry\n[Music]\nyeah\n[Music]\ncrazy you little monkeys they're hungry\nafter school\nI love\nyou\ncalled sweet home or to to practice home\nhome a little heavy whipping cream\nlittle honey little Irish Breakfast\nDon't Mind If I Do shout out to uh\nDuncan over on the Emerald Isle miss you\nDuncan hope you're doing well over there\nall right you see my gut reaction I was\na little off on the mileage I have a\nfeeling I was quite off on the vertical\ngain all right let me pull up straa here\nso uh question of the day what um when\nwas the last time you connected a couple\nof your Loops to make a bigger Loop and\nwhat was that experience like today was\nthree of my Loops into one all right and\nwhat did I say this morning 29 miles\n2800 vertical feet I believe all right\nso it ended up at not bad not bad 30 all\nright EX exactly\n30.5 mil 30.5 so I was a mile and a half\noff so basically a 50k you know not too\nshabby and what did I say 2,800 vertical\nfeet oh my my that's pretty good\n3150 3143 so\n3,143 vertical feet for the uh for the\n30m loop that was awesome and again oh I\njust I bring up today's Vlog and the\ntopic because you wherever you live in\nthe world whether it's Singapore or\nEcuador or Chile or uh Northern Canada\nwherever you're at you're at it's going\nto take time to discover your loops and\ntoday I found my 50k Loop like there it\nis and a lot of vert you know a decent\namount of vertical gain but it's just\nfun to build upon what you've are upon\nthe foundation of okay that was a that\nwas my 13 Mile Loop my uh uh let's see\n23 Mile Loop and then also a 26 M\nbasically I combined three Loops\ntogether is what happened today and it\nturned out to be right at 50k\n30.5 miles very cool all right love you\nall cheers have a great day and onward\nand upward all right we'll toss it to uh\nI don't know I guess another long run\nsomewhere somewhere in the archive right\nthere right there seek Beauty work hard\nand love each other",

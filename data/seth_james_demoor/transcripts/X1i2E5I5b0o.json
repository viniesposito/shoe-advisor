vertical feet and why\nI'm really excited I I went back and\nforth on what mountain to pursue today\nbut the reason I am going to to Yale is\nbecause it's been 5 years almost exactly\nto the day 5 years since I did this\nsegment this route up Mount Yale and I\nknow the time that I ran 5 years ago\nthanks to straa this is one one nice\nlittle benefit of straa is that it's\neasy to track okay it's been five 2019\neverybody in fact a little Side Story I\ndidn't have a lot of money back then and\nso I slept in my car at the trail head\nthe night before wasn't really willing\nto dish out money for a motel or\nanything like that so I just crashed if\nI have if I can find footage I'll put it\nin I don't know if I'll be able to find\nit but uh that's how much life has\nchanged and we've moved along uh and now\nwe are going back to 20 so I would have\nbeen 34 so now we'll be 39 today uh\ngoing after the\nfkt on Mount Yale it's going to be Stout\nit's not going to be easy it's going to\nbe difficult but we're going to go for\nit all right and yes we do have some\nboxes in the uh back of the truck that\nif I have time I'm going to try and open\nup for all of you after the run we'll\nsee how see how it goes so 5 miles to\nthe top and 49 so it's about an uh 8\n% grade up the trail the average grade\nup the trail all right main Street's\nlooking good sun is looking good\nopportunity is looking good all right\nonward we go let's lace it up and let a\nrip\nhe\nmeady I could be\nyour there's no\ngue on anything\nand I'll take care of you along the\nway my love one day a time will leave\nour troubles\n[Music]\nbehind and you'll take care of me along\nthe\nway my love one day the time will leave\nour troubles behind\nhere we\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nw\nyou\ntoo we got it\n12630 from uh\nAvalanche but I got to keep going cuz\nI'm going for the fkt awesome round trip\nso what's your name Seth de more\nthere'll be a video on YouTube in a\ncouple days love you guys good job\nwo all right I got to\ngo that was a cheerful\ncrowd usually nobody pays attention to\nme but they were they were excited all\nright let's get off this mountain that\nwas that was no\njoke tip of the cap to Mr\nFeebas he\n[Music]\nah\nwell believe in\nyourself especially as you get older\nespecially come on\neverybody I do believe I don't have sell\nservice here but I do believe we beat uh\nwe beat 5ye 34 year old Seth by 12\nminutes to the top I'm not sure yet\nabout the round trip but at least on the\nAscent over uh basically 5,000\nft I'm shocked actually so my clock said\n128 20 12 or sorry\n1262 to the top that feels real real\ngood so in 2019 when I slept in this\nparking lot it was uh I ran 138 I'm\ndying to know what shoes was I wearing 5\nyears ago cuz the pulsars weren't out\nyet uh the innovates um like the mud\nTalons or the uh yeah the X Talons from\ninnovate that I don't think I had those\nyet I'm just wondering if I was in Speed\ngoats speaking of which so I you'll know\nif we got the overall fkt uh here in a\nminute if you know what I mean going\nthrough a drive-thru but uh in the\nmeantime uh let's let's see if I can run\nthem down everybody Rudy Project Smith\nsunto uh Hoka\nSolomon and it's funny Once you become a\nbillion dooll company you hire PR firms\nto do your marketing and so that's like\nthe third pair of speed goats so thank\nyou Hoka I don't need any more speed\ngoats just so you know speed goat sixes\nbut I do appreciate you sending them and\nuh let's see what else did I open C wow\nthey're coming out with some clothing\nnow not just hats just so you know I\nwill not wear the hats I really won't\nwear the singlets I'll wear the shorts\nuh but as you know we got our own\nrunning gear now and so I I haven't worn\nanother company's hat in a long long\ntime so C if you're listening to this\nyou can stop sending me uh uh hats\nthat's for sure I I will give it away\nthough to somebody on the intro webs out\nthere so it's a fun unboxing let me just\nmake sure I got everything Cel sunu Rudy\nSmith Hoka Solomon um thank you thank\nyou Brands thank you companies and the\npostar I'm going to say we're going to\nsave that pair for the Italy races when\nI go to Italy here in about uh 3 weeks\nwith my brother so those are going to be\nthose are going to be fresh Freshies for\nyou always want fresh running shoes as\nfresh as possible for race day great day\nup in the mountains oh my goodness all\nright let's uh let's get uh get back\nthrough BB here and um see if we can't\nget to some cell service if you know\nwhat I mean\n[Music]\nall right camera died I think we're back\nI think we're back so as I said earlier\num I'm 5 years older so for you question\nof the day like what are\nyou when you are and this is where I\nknow oh I'm I'll say it I'm a preacher\nwell I preach patience on this YouTube\nchannel because if you don't have\npatience in the game of long distance\nrunning it's just going to be difficult\nand and I'm just I'll be honest I like\nwhat did I say on YouTube we're in the\ntop of the second inning now maybe we're\nin the middle of the second inning if\nyou don't have patience in YouTube or\nrunning it's just going to be difficult\nfor you to maybe see the gains because\nit is that aerobic engine building and\nso to go 12 minutes faster today it's\njust like a little uh a little okay okay\nwe still got this and keep cha keep\ndreaming keep working hard all that good\nstuff keep eating andies along the way\nso let's go deliver this uh deliver this\ngoodness to those those boys and and\ngirls uh can't forget Kate now I don't\nknow if we'll uh maybe we'll let\nFrancine have a little bite as well but\nthat's the question of the day how have\nyou um progressed over the last 5 years\nin the game of long distance running\nbecause it is a game and it's a fun game\nand it's a it's more fun if you got a\nlittle patience mixed into all the\ngoodness all right I think we'll close\nit out everybody that was just a good\ngood effort uh a tip of the cap again to\nRyan all right we'll toss it to Mountain\nrunning playlist as per\nusual actually no no no fkt playlist fkt\nplaylist we got one of those too all\nright see beauty work hard and love each\nother",

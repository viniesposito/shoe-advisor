this so\nthat's today's run the 23m loop from the\nhouse uh 2,000 ft of vertical gain it\njust it's Relentless it just doesn't\nreally stop uh making you focus making\nyou work the entire time and especially\nwith mountain running season uh\nforthcoming it's not we're not too far\noff what is it almost we're like 6 weeks\naway before the snow is melted up there\nso this that's why I'm doing this 23\nmilei Loop just getting used to it all\nright let's rock and roll oh boy a\nlittle scary today thank you Jesus for\nthe clouds\nsteady Edy steady\nEdie just getting it done get in the\nmiles nice steady effort nothing too\nfast on the downhills nothing too slow\non the\nuphills feeling pretty\ngood preparation for that gym we're at M\n17 six miles to go so uh dreaming about\nsome kettle bell action with respect to\nmobility and core\nmobility and\ncore\nmobility and core goals for\n2024 nice and easy\n[Music]\n[Music]\nwe're back there's the run on your\nscreen got it done with a jog home from\nthe gym all right I a quick trip down\nmemory lane I'm not going to talk about\nthe last eight years of YouTube\nuh but I do want to talk about the last\ntwo years on YouTube and of\nracing\nand as I'm like I just been mulling this\nover and what really spurred on this\nthought process for me and reflection\nand it's by the way way too nice to be\ninside after a long winter and long\nspring it's like let's get the let's get\nthe vitamin D while we can everybody so\num but what spurted on was really the\nrdam marathon shout out to everybody in\nthe Netherlands we love you thank you\nfor all your support in the Netherlands\nbut all the memories started popping up\non Facebook and YouTube Twitter uh from\ntwo two years ago feels like that was my\nroad Marathon PR over in rdam feels like\nyesterday that we were chugging along in\nuh the streets of Rotterdam so um when I\nsaw that memory pop up I was like man\nwhat has been going on the last two\nyears and it's it's just been a lot it's\nlike and it spurred me on to this\nthought process of the racing and the\ndesire to race um so as I'm thinking and\nsharing here on YouTube I don't want\nlike yeah yes it's it's my YouTube\nchannel a little bit of my story but\nreally I I just hope it's uh maybe a\nlittle Catalyst for you out there like\nto think back on your last 12 months or\nlast 24 months that's what I've been\ndoing a lot in the last really since I\nstarted training again and yes I got a\nlittle a little taste of a work a baby\nuphill workout last week and it just\nlike as Runners like life is like some\npeople like dirt bikes some people like\nparagliding some people like if you like\nparagliding let us know in the comments\nsome people like rock climbing I don't\nknow whatever gets your jets going\nthat's that's that's fine with me but\nfor me it's absolutely the training and\nthe racing but I haven't been able to do\na ton of racing in the last two years\nsince roterdam since the marathon PR you\nknow we welcome two precious little\ngirls into the world uh the deore deor\ndearer the family has definitely not\ngotten smaller in the last two years and\nso life has just gotten busier there's\nno other way to say it the big boys are\ndoing you know Sports a lot of baseball\nthis spring and and um so I and oh man\nthe sacrum stress fracture was almost 2\nyears ago that wiped out an entire\nsummer of potential Racing for me which\nyou know in the summertime is when I do\nthe mountain racing up in the High\nCountry and so as I'm moving forward and\noh yeah so for you guys like just\nhopefully this just a little Catalyst to\nlike okay take a little check where we\nat everybody and actually question of\nthe day like do you do this have you\never do you do this often where you take\na little check a little temperature on\nyour training and your racing and last\nweek's baby uphill workout just got me\nvery excited for potential fast running\nagain in the future and so I guess I you\nknow to answer the question in the title\nof the Vlog is yes yes yes I will be\nracing again I don't know when but I\nwill be\num all my races have been wiped out in\n2024 I was supposed to have done three\nat this point and the fourth is also\ngoing to be wiped out the family we're\nheading out we're getting out of the\ncountry uh hearing about so I'm going to\nmiss the Boulder Boulder 10K\nunfortunately just uh again life\ncircumstances and so we got to we just\ngot to Pivot and keep moving forward and\nputting our priorities straight but I am\nexcited to\neventually race again and you know I I\nsee the comments and I know I'm I know\nI'm disappointing many of you with my uh\nyou know my YouTube output and my\nrunning output uh even though I'm\nrunning 100 miles a week just so\neverybody knows I am training uh I am\ngetting the work in but I'm just not\nracing and again it's just like life\nlife is life and you press ahead but\nRunners we are like\noh yeah I I was thinking of this on what\nwas it\num you're not you're not out of shape\nyou're just early in the process or you\nhaven't lost your Fitness you're just\nearly in the process of getting your\nFitness back meaning um life is is\nactually kind of long I know sometimes\nthe old saying like you know life is\nshort but like we we have if you stay\nwith it over decades as a runner you're\ngoing to have so many opportunities to\nseize your goals and to chase down your\nPRS and to go to your bucket list races\nI know I've got some bucket list races\nthis Summer that I want to do um even\nthough I've missed it for two summers in\na row but that's okay you you pick\nyourself up and you get back on the on\nthe horse and you you try again so\nthat's what we're going to do I have\nraces not going to share them right now\nI'll make another Vlog very very soon\nabout what I want to be doing for racing\nin\n2024 2023 was the\nfktsgi I haven't heard from you in 12\nmonths and it's like well I've still\nbeen uploading I've still been running\nalmost every day on straa I'm still here\nwe're still alive and that's that that's\nmy little update for all of you yes I\nwill be racing it's been a journey a lot\nof curveballs but uh that's the beauty\nof running is that it'll always be there\nyou know the door will always be there\nfor you to turn that door knob the the\nshoes will always be there to lace them\nup and go get your volume in so I'm\nwhere we go I asked the question today I\ndo believe and\num\nah\nman keep it going just keep it going\njust keep it and life like I I I know\nyou've got a lot of people have grown\nimpatient with me but again I I think in\nI honestly think in decades I don't\nthink even think in years so it's it's\njust you just got to keep going when\nthings are hard and it's been very hard\nthe last five to six months for us but\nwe're coming out the other side we're\ncoming so so don't don't stop don't stop\nall right everybody seek Beauty work\nhard and love each other",

like a good steak if you know\nwhat I mean and why celebrate you know\nwhen you know no no FK no PR no W today\num\nbut I am celebrating because I'm healthy\nafter a big summer huh a big summer of\ntraining and more importantly I was able\nto share this entire summer with Joseph\nall right fkt is in Colorado racing in\nItaly now Pike PE and and and I'm 100%\nyou probably picked up on it on straa or\nwherever else I'm out of Crossroads\neverybody I'm not going to be racing\nmuch in the future\nwithout the family in fact at all that's\nthe goal is it's all about the family\nit's always been about the family but as\nthe kids get older you learn you well\nyou learn but you know like okay these\nare the moments these are the like to\nyou know to to win races I love it it I\nwill continue to strive just I'm not I'm\nnot giving up on racing or chasing down\nPRS personally or chasing down course\nrecords depending on where I'm racing\nI'm not giving up on that but at the end\nof the day it's the hugs at the finish\nline that's what matters you guys know\nthat and so that is why I'm eating the\nfilet monion is that I was able to\ncelebrate on top of the mountain down in\nManu here and give hugs and high fives\nand fist bumps to everybody up on the\nmountain you're amazing for waking up\nearly and driving up the mountain but\nthen everybody at the award ceremony\nshout out to Shan uh for just Dawn oh my\ngoodness Dawn getting the footage up on\ntop of the mountain like that's what\nracing is all about that's what is\nsharing the experience with other people\ncuz if you're sharing it alone that's\nsad like that's no fun so it's all about\nex meeting all of you giving you hugs\nhigh fives and so yes I'm going to\nfinish this steak enjoy it while while\nit's hot and I love you onward and\nupward and um we'll keep we're going\nkeep fighting we're going to keep\nworking hard and now I got a team of\nteam of videographers the boys shout out\nto the boys for filming all day long\ngetting the shots thank you boys you're\nthe best so onward and upward we'll toss\nit to the Pikes Peak playlist right\nthere and um oh man I'll break down the\nrace what happened on the mountain\nsooner rather than later I don't know\nwhen but sooner rather than later all\nright see beauty work hard and love each\nother",

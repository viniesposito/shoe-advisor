school did you open the back oh\nyeah oh yeah great job uh with the\nbaseball\ngame okay bye Michael I love you bye SE\nbye\nand they're off as are we now I could I\ncould go to a track I could you know we\ncan go do some oval Loops you I don't\nmind it but it's like\ntrack run uphill track Sprint uphill\ntrack get out in nature a little more\ntrack uh chase down some nice little\nvertical gain that's what we're up to\ntoday today it's I I know we're getting\nready for a birthday mile but at the end\nof the day you know my passion is up in\nthe Hill Country so year I was actually\nthinking uh a little reflection last\nnight and I was like man how long has it\nbeen and I believe it was October which\nI did not film but October\n2023 when the snow hit here in Colorado\nand I was unable to uh chase down some\nsome goodness up into High Country so\nwhy is it so fun to run\nuphill quickly hastily I don't know you\ntell me oh man what question of the day\nwhat is your favorite form of running\nfavorite niche of running mine is uphill\nit's so strange but I just love it and\nuh hold on I just got to get this tag\noff somehow uh the pulse R3 we're taking\nout the one and two have been my go-to\nfor the last 2 years uh the the Brooks\nagile though has my attention I'm\nexcited about this shoe as well probably\na little bit longer fkt action proba I'm\nlike like 10 miles plus 12 miles plus\nthis is the shorter shorter shoe for\ntoday which uh we're going we are going\nabout 5 miles though to the top here in\nbeautiful Boulder Colorado and it's like\nlight in the Jets man um as far as not\nnecessarily speed this is a rustbuster\nan out of shape rustbuster today I have\nnot gone fast like this in a long time\nbut you got to start somewhere you\nremember you're not out of shape you're\njust early in the process so we are\nreally early in fact we might hit snow\non the way up there's no guarantee that\nit's going to be melted up there from we\ngot snow here in Colorado last weekend\nso uh we might hit snow but we're early\nin the process but you got to start\nsomewhere as you're working toward your\ngoals and that is what we're doing today\nuh just having a little fun up in the uh\nup in the this isn't even the high\ncountry this is the this is the low\ncountry uh about 6,000 ft here at the\nstart and I don't even know what we'll I\nthink I'll top out at about 7800 maybe\n8,000 not sure it's a little toasty out\nhere little\ntoasty we're going to try the goggles by\nthe way they're dinit Dina fit dinit\nDina fit whatever you want to call them\nd y n a\nfit so oh some other Runners are\nreporting in that they have the similar\neye issue that I have so we'll see how\nthey perform with respect to uh letting\nmy eyes breathe a little bit right up\nthere all right let's go\n[Music]\n[Music]\nsry buddy\n[Music]\nthat'll bust some Rust if I might say so\nmyself wo oh my my 6 miles to the top\nnot 5.4 so you know straa we love Strava\nwe all love Strava around here but it's\nsometimes a little difficult to find the\ncorrect segment before you actually do\nthe segment and it's crazy I lived in\nBoulder for 5 years in college never I\nnever had gone on that trail before\nbecause so many trails so little time\nbut now that I've been on the trail now\nstraa recognizes that basically they\nrerouted this Trail about looks like\nabout two years ago based on the times\nthat I'm seeing here congrats to Ryan\nDavid and Brad uh I was it looks like my\ntime will put me in about fourth place\nfor this segment so I was 50 2 minutes\nto the top it ended up being 2400\nvertical feet and uh over 6 mil so about\na 7.7% grade and it was a doozy it was\nfun it was it was hard I was working I\nfelt strong though for the first hard\nuphill effort in I don't know four or\nfive months I will take it and didn't\nget the fkt but that's okay again\ncongrats to Ryan he has a 50\nminute5 and so I got to drop about 2\nminutes for that Ryan is is he is always\nthrowing down like uh I don't know him\nbut um whenever I'm you know scouting\nother mountains up in the High Country I\nalways see his name so oh man that was\ngood and what else was I going to say oh\nyeah the downhill I have found that it\ntakes about four to six weeks of\ndownhill running before your quads begin\nto adapt to that downhill and I just\neven though I'm doing the 23m long run\nwith the up and down it's just different\nwhen you're going down steep mountain\nand with when you're negotiating the\nrocks on the way down as well the Pulsar\nthrees epic felt amazing feel a lot like\nthe the you know the two a little better\ngrip I could sense and then uh I don't\nknow they felt really good I can tell I\ncan tell they updated the material a\nlittle bit to be a little more Nimble\nover the top of the foot so good job I'm\nfeeling very good about the Pulsar three\nI think that's it a good rustbuster\ndidn't get it today but we'll be back\nnext week to uh another week Another\nMountain if you know what I mean all\nright Mountain running season oh I am I\namped up this is good uh oh yeah oh yeah\nI don't know if this camera I haven't\nused it in probably about a year it's an\nold camera I don't know if it worked\nhopefully it did and I got some footage\nsome very uh interesting footage along\nthe way pretty simple with this little\ninsta 360 to go all right I think we'll\ntoss it we'll go we'll put it in the\nmountain running Mountain running\nplaylist oh we got to if you like\nMountain running go watch this all right\nseek Beauty work hard and love each\nother",

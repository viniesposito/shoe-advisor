of the day who's racing all\nright let us know in the comments the\nascent or the marathon is it your first\ntime up the peak all right basically\n8,000 vertical feet starting in Mana 2\nSprings we got our gels all right for\nthe race fresh gels and fresh kicks you\nbetter believe it come on now oh yeah I\nactually I it's great you got if you've\noh man what a summer so I got a lot to\nbreak down here take a there they are\nthere's the Freshies all right so nice\nuh I did go a half size down you know\nhow I like a snug fit for racing and I\ngot my gear here that I've been prepping\nall week gathering in one spot actually\nthe camera is sitting right on top of\nthe gear that is get going to end up on\ntop of the mountain so let's actually\ndive into that right now it's going to\nbe chilly like last year it might snow I\ndon't think it's going to snow Saturday\nor Friday night but it sounds like maybe\nfor the marathon who knows it's it's\nkind of up in the air right now but at\nthe very least it's going to be quite\nchilly so all my basically winter parka\ngear is sitting right below the camera\nI'll show you that on the screen right\nnow as I so that bag will end up on the\ntop of the mountain and let's see got\nall my dgr gear race gear ready uh it's\njust been an epic summer a big summer a\nlot of vertical gain but connecting to\nthe title of the Vlog I've never done\nthis before Oh I actually wanted to show\nyou this too so last\nhere we go glad I remembered or saw this\nso this is I think this is last year it\nmight be two years ago so I think this\nis my fifth or sixth I don't I'm losing\ntrack uh Pikes Peak race so this is last\nyear's race shirt very cool probably\nsays it somewhere on here I think this\nis last year's and bottom line last year\nI was a little tired for the Pikes Peak\nascent and remember last year I doubled\nso this year just the ascent on Saturday\nthree weeks before last year's race I\ntook a little little rad road trip to\nmavista Colorado and I did three\nfktsgi hope it finish higher than that\nat least top three but it just showed me\num like what I'm getting at for you and\nyour racing you're going to learn you're\ngoing to learn you're going to learn\nevery year every training block you're\ngoing to learn new things and as you age\nyou're going to learn how your body is\nreacting to the training so I think I\nwas a little tired on the starting line\nuh last year but this year we shall see\nwe don't know yet that's why we tow the\nline that's why we lace him up that's\nwhy we go have fun in Mana 2 Springs\nColorado but this year so I this is it I\ntook I've never done this before ever\never I took two days off I took I didn't\nI did not run I didn't run I never do\nthat ladies and gentlemen if you've been\nwatching for years and years you know\neven before a peak race but so I I foam\nrolled I did a little walking on the\ntreadmill I went to the gym to hop in\nthe hot tub I just tried to make the\nlegs as happy as possible so that was\nTuesday and Wednesday today's Thursday\nFriday racing Saturday so I I jog two\nmiles today tomorrow I'll do like a mile\ncrazy again adaptation learning the\nprocess of racing as you get a little\nolder almost a masters but I just wanted\nto communicate with you like don't be\nafraid to change things up and we shall\nsee we don't know we don't know that's\nwhy you got to tune in I I think there's\ngoing to be a live stream and uh a live\nstream and what else um I don't think I\ndon't know if there's live tracking for\nI think there's a little bit of live\ntracking on the website but bottom line\nI'm excited I'm excited for the packing\nenjoying the whole process and I just\nclose with this is\nthat I love racing but I tell you what\ntapering is kind of a sad moment because\nyou can't run a lot and I I just like to\nrun that's all I like to run a lot but\nyou have to pull back and you got to\ntaper and you got to let those legs get\nhappy but I'm excited to get past the\nrace and I'm excited for race day you\nknow why cuz I'm sharing it with the\nfamily and I'm going to share it with\nyou if you're there and again question\nof the day are you racing are you going\nto be there oh if you have any video\nclips from the starting line the Finish\nLine uh up on the mountain if you're up\nthere somewhere feel free to email them\nto me info at demor Global running.com\nand I'll try and get them into the Vlogs\nthe Vlogs that happen after this video\nso uh but it's like at the end of the\nday yes winning the Pikes Peak Marathon\nI think the first one was 2020 exciting\nunexpected got it done but like if I'm\nnot sharing it with the family what's I\ndon't want to say what's the point but\nit's almost like what's the point for me\npersonally so the family will be there\nit's just going to be a good old time it\ngoing to be a good old time everybody so\nhave fun out there enjoy the process of\npacking of getting your bib number\nputting it on eating some pasta whatever\nyou do to get ready for your Peak races\nand um yeah you can have some nerves\nnerves are good I'll be a little I have\nsome nerves but at the same time I'm\ngoing to be like once a year we get to\njust go rip it up a mountain 8,000\nvertical feet and there's just nothing\nquite like it so onward and upward love\nyou see you on the Peak and uh there's\nall the gear most of the gear you're\nseeing on your screen as you as you\nascend upward all right we'll toss to\nthe Pikes Peak uh Pikes Peak playlist\nright there seek

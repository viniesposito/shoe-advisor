on\n[Music]\nair left all my worries in\nyou got\nme\nyou're my mind\nI\nmy you got me feeling light\n[Music]\na\n[Music]\npuny Bey puny Beauty\n[Music]\nthe no excuse mindset it's a beautiful\nthing especially on a HomeTown Mountain\nuh we're in BB and that was Mount Yale\nvia Denny Creek unbelievable so 107 I\nran 15 months ago July\n2023 and I didn't even have a c a camera\nI took the summer off no filming so\ntoday\n10450 and tip of the cap to cam cam a\namazing Runner and I'll talk more about\ncam in a second but the no excuse\nmindset my legs the first half mile\ndidn't feel awesome I'll be frank and by\nthe way we're in we're on the uh we are\non the Main Street here of buav Vista\nbeautiful BV uh so the legs didn't feel\ngreat the first half mile and tomorrow\nI'm doing another mountain in about 18\nhours and I almost threw the towel in\ntoday because I was like uh this time is\nso tough from cam I don't know if I'm\ngoing to get it\ntoday\non but here's my strategy here's and\nthis is a question of the day here in a\nsecond as well but this is what I do I I\nI I build a wall in my mind in my brain\nlike literally IM literally imagine\nbuilding a brick\nconcrete difficult rebar enforced wall\nin my mind where I had the thought oh\nman maybe I need to throw the towel in\non today's fkt attempt on Mount Yale\ninstead I built the wall and said okay\nno more that that excuse in my mind is\nnot going to cross this wall ever again\non this run now I'm human so it'll\nprobably pop up again at some point\nmaybe tomorrow but instead from the half\nmile Point onward and here's the footage\non your screen from that point onward I\nwas golden and I started rocking and\nrolling because I built this wall in my\nmind saying enough is enough we're going\nfor it today we drove up here from\nDenver let's let her let's let it rip\nand that's what we got done and so a tip\nof the cap to cam so that's anyway\nthat's the no excuse my and sadly I know\nRunners not a lot of Runners but a\ncouple I know Runners whether in high\nschool college or even today that just\nmake excuses all the time and I'm like\nno you got to stop that you're you're\nyou're cutting yourself short when you\nmake too many when you make any excuses\nbut when you make excuses all the time\nso cam shout out to cam that's who I\nsnagged it from today I'm sure cam will\ngo back and get the fkt again maybe next\nyear but uh Cam and I we have been going\nback and forth back and forth in races\nand\nfktsgi talented they're fast and they're\nthey sometimes I beat that like cam beat\nme at the Kendall Mountain run this past\nsummer I beat him at Pike's Peak it's\nlike we just go back and forth back and\nforth but at the end of the day it's\nthat's important you know being fast\nthat's what we do here on YouTube and as\nRunners we want to PR we want to get\ncourse records we want to get ftts at\nthe end of the day we want to push\nourselves but more importantly at every\nsingle Finish Line that I've raced\nagainst k him positive mindset no\nexcuses I've never heard an excuse at it\nso I just want to give him a shout out\nand some other Runners as well that I\njust you know when you have a competitor\nand you're like you're competing back\nand forth back and forth I know you guys\nhave them out there and that's the\nquestion of the day uh what is your\nmental mindset when you are hitting\nadversity in your ftts in your races and\nfor me it's just a nice refreshing\nreminder from cam to keep going and\ndon't make excuses so onward and upward\nlet's go let's let it rip uh time to\nrecover from that effort see if we can\ncome back tomorrow and get another get\nanother Mountain under our belt going to\ngo uh ice the legs in the river and oh\nit is so cold used to jump In this River\nuh like it was nothing when I was a\nteenager those days are long gone uh and\nthen squeeze the legs with a compression\nsleeves get some good uh get some good\nfood\nin the body all right a little snack\nmaybe a little maybe a little uh little\nuh fkt treat if you know what I mean so\nbutter to bread we'll toss it to the uh\nfkt playlist right there fkt playlist\nright there and uh I look forward to\nreading your strategies your mental\nstrategies down below CU if you struggle\ngo down to the comments if you just\nstruggle a little bit with it and again\nfor me I literally got to build that\nbrick wall butter butter butter let's go\nlet's go seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other",

actually already\nstarted so the men go second so what is\na VK so it's 2.6 miles I think this is\nthe shortest race since high school I'm\nnot even I really I think it's last time\nI Ran 2 miles was in high school on the\ntrack so this is 2.6 Mi to the top and\nuh just over 3,000 ft all right there it\nis on your screen that's the that's so\nwe're talking 24% average grade but you\nstart in town so that eats up maybe a/4\nmile of the course and then you just\nstart climbing but what's kind of cool\nit's not just pure nature it's also\nyou're running through people's\nbackyards and little farms and gardens\nand you're weaving in and out of these\nhouses so it's going to be epic um it's\nthe first so what are the goals for\ntoday a have fun with Joseph in the\nItalian mountains B uh figure out what\nis it what does it feel like to race a\nvertical kilometer this is the first VK\nof my entire life it's only it only took\nme 39 years but we're here we're doing\nit and then see is I want to stick my\nnose in it um I I know I just know it's\ngoing to go out like a like a high\nschool or or college cross country race\nso but I want to stick my nose in it and\njust see see how we do

half mile you know granted\nthe entire race is 2.6 miles so I was in\nit for maybe like a half mile 3/4 of a\nmile and then they started to pull away\nand I'm going to break down the entire\nrace here in a couple days but at least\nat the moment it just it didn't work out\nis the bottom I haven't even seen the\nofficial results when I get the official\nresults I'll let you know how how I did\nbut it it was not good uh I don't even\nthink I was top 25 yeah it was rough any\noh Mama Mia the heat the heat in Italy\nis no joke I don't know why anyway\ntomorrow's race I'm racing in like 12\nhours so I actually got to go to dinner\nand then hit the sack but in 12 hours uh\nwe start two hours earlier I'm I'm\nhoping that that's going to make all the\ndifference in the world for tomorrow's\n21k not a VK but a 21k so I'm excited\nabout that but didn't didn't go off has\nplanned but in the joy department and\nthe fun Department I mean come on\nsharing the starting line with Joseph\nepic but running through the village and\njust seeing all the youngsters out there\ncheering and the elderly halfway up the\nmountain shout out to the Italians you\nguys came out in full force to cheer us\non so thank you question of the day\nwhat's your top one two or three niches\nin the racing world in the Running World\nall right what do you love to do as far\nas racing is concern concerned I will\nsay the VK is probably not going to be\nin my top three anytime soon uh but\nwe're going to keep striving all right\nonward Upward at least we got to seek\nsome beauty along the way out there oh\nmy my oh my my all right onward we go\nsee beauty work hard and love each other",

two more\nladies get up there get up there you're\nlike dude I'm tired of walking up things\ntoday that looks\n[Music]\ngreat unreal that's insane too and for\nsnowbird too to repeat it Snowbird is a\ntrue true accomplishment\nand that's a wrap from Snowbird so good\nwe're going to do a breakdown video of\nthis race because I think I think I\ndon't know yet I got a lot of good\nfootage and it just played out very\ninterestingly and so I want to break it\ndown for you not right now I got to hit\nthe road time to get back to those\nbabies back to Denver I'm going to catch\nan airplane and bottom line is if is fun\nenergy at Circ races it's uh\nshorter\nsteeper and fun all right so if you're\nlooking for that type of racing remember\nI think I mentioned this um I mentioned\nthis three or 4 days ago if you have not\nfound your niche in the racing world and\nyou're just like man I don't know like I\ndon't enjoy uh one M races around a\ntrack or I don't enjoy 50k races in the\nmountains\nor I enjoy running 100 miles around a\ntrack the key is that you just keep\nexploring because this is uni actually\nJulian the founder of this race uh he\njust told his story like why he started\nthe cir series and it was because when\nhe was getting into trail running you\nknow 14 years ago he couldn't find any\nraces that were shorter steeper races\nand he so he made it he just made it out\nof out of nothing the cir Series so it's\nAbsolut I think there's six or seven of\nthem uh great energy great meeting all\nthe vendors uh great companies I'll give\nsome shout outs throughout the video and\noh man at the end of the day it feels\ngood to be back in some air conditioning\ncuz it was toasty out um there's the\nfirst place guy he's uh he's a college\nguy I think or something he's young oh\nmy goodness Good Times so I hope you\nenjoyed that if you I don't say this too\noften but if you enjoyed the race\nfootage you know share this video spread\nit around Facebook Instagram Twitter I\nwould appreciate it and it helps out\nCirc as well I didn't expect actually to\nget a uh a medal I guess because it's a\nus it's it was the USA Track and Field\nTrail championships that's why like top\n10 get a medal I thought only the top\nthree so that was kind of cool uh\nappreciate your usatf throwing down in\nSnowbird Utah seeking Beauty out there\nonward and upward I am not at least I\ndon't think so no I don't believe I'm\nracing next weekend I think it's time to\nget back to training everybody all right\nwe'll toss it to the last Snowbird race\nwhere we flew the w 5 years ago all\nright seek Beauty work hard and love\neach other there",

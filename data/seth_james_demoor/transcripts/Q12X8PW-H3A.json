some strides here keep the legs uh\nrolling now you know me for for my speed\ntraining I go run up mountains as fast\nas possible that's my speed training so\nfor you at a possible birthday mile so\nwhat is it you every birthday whenever\nyour birthday is out there happy\nbirthday uh you go run a mile as fast as\nyou can yeah it's a PR attempt but but\ndepending on where you are at in life\nit's it's likely not but it might be a\nlifetime mile PR attempt for me today\nit's not definitely not a lifetime PR\nattempt but later in life as you\nprogress uh you can have these\nbenchmarks and so me today I believe\nthree years ago so listen every year\nthrows curveballs 2024 definitely threw\nour family a curveball but like last\nyear I was unable to do it 2 years ago\nuh I was injured so it's not like you\nyou might not be able to pull it off\nevery year that's F but guess what you\ncan always come back to the well make it\nhurt a little bit here on the track and\nso that's what we're doing today uh in\nspikes oh boy see how the legs feel\ntomorrow after that but it's so 448\nthat's what I'm going for that's my\nbirthday mile PR from again I think it\nwas three Honestly

feels good not doing\nany socks today uh for the for the\nbirthday mile good times and so anyway\nthat's what the birthday mile is that's\nwhy we uh it's just a little it's a\nlittle and listen you might run your\nbirthday Mile in 12 minutes and 32\nseconds and I hope and pray the next\nyear you run it in 12 minutes and 31\nseconds it's just a little let's go a\nlittle bit more let's go one more let's\nsee if we can go just a little bit\nfaster even though we are progressing up\nin age actually question of the day who\nhas done a birthday Mile in the last uh\nlet's say the last two years okay

memories with them and forming\nthem you know instilling hopefully a\nlittle bit of work ethic a little bit of\nvirtue into them and that's that's all\nthat matters more than Yes W you know\nwinning races or chasing down PRS or\nwhatever the case may be so even so 448\nwas the goal ended up with 451 all right\n451 is what the watch said when I\ncrossed so I'm actually pretty pleased\nwith that I

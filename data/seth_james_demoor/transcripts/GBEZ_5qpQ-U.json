  "text": "[Music]\nand we're back from the cir series come\non everybody the US Mountain running\nchampionships\n2024 and that was some footage from the\nstarting area starting line really just\na beautiful beautiful setting you can't\nbeat it out there in it just really\nquite steep mountains and today actually\nyesterday in case you missed it upper\nright hand corner we published the full\nVlog so it's a long one get your popcorn\nout and sit down and enjoy that I'll\nlink to it down below in upper right\nhand corner in case you missed the Vlog\nyesterday but I did promise that I\nwanted to break down the race for all of\nyou so that's what we're going to do\nright here right now but QD uh what is\nyour next race all right what are you\nwhat are you shooting for what are you\ntraining for I know a lot of it's crazy\na lot of people already ramping up for\ntheir fall marathons uh building their\nvolume so it's uh it's exciting but what\nis your next race the distance the\nsurface and um and the location all\nright I knew in my mind I knew it was\ngoing to be a cross country feel but in\na mountain setting so fast off the start\ntoo fast for me like these guys were\nmoving and I was like you know what I H\nmy legs first of all okay here's the bib\nnumber from Leadville all right bib\nnumber from Kendall Mountain bib number\nfrom Snowbird so three weekends in a row\nI don't do that but again we're just\ncoming back to this racing thing and it\nwas fun to do three weekends back to\nback to back I'm not doing I'm not\nracing this weekend uh but 15 miles 12\nmil 8 Miles that's one of the reasons I\nknew it would be fast out of the start\nand you actually don't do that and I've\ntalked about this many many times over\nthe last five or six years here on this\nchannel you build your racing distance\nso you go if you're getting ready for a\nmarathon you do a 10 mile or maybe half\nmarathon tuneup race uh if you're\ngetting ready for a 10K you do 3ks and\n5Ks I'm thinking more like track 10K you\ndo 3ks and five even 1500s before kind\nof building your leg speed getting ready\nfor that test so this was the opposite\nof what you should do but guess what\nthat's how the cookie crumbled in 2024\nfor me for Mountain racing so it was a\nstacked field USA Mountain running\nchampionships I knew there was going to\nbe some guys there that were quite a bit\nyounger and yes faster than me\nespecially at that distance but patience\nall right I I showed it yesterday but\nagain going from I was at about 15th\n16th Place at about the half mile Mark\nand moving your way up oh that's the\nother thing thing it was toasty all\nright I'm not a not a big like heat\nRunner I don't you know here in Colorado\nour temperatures are pretty pretty tame\npretty mild in the summertime even and\nwe don't get any humidity now there was\nno humidity in Snowbird but it was warm\nand you felt it out there uh sometimes I\ngo right through the aid stations I did\nnot go through the aid stations\nespecially for an 8 mile race like\nthat's not very far from me and but\ntoday or on that on race day I had to\nstop and get water so thank you to all\nthe volunteers out there at the Circ\nrace uh but I just start picking them\noff and I knew I would pick off many I\ndidn't know how many uh because I just I\njust know what altitude does so the race\nstarted should have mentioned this at\nthe beginning the race started at 8,000\nft and tops out I think at about\n11,200 roughly I I'll try and put it on\nthe screen um so there you go so I Knew\nby the top there would be a little bit\nof Carnage especially with the heat so\nwe're passing it's beautiful uh a Circ\nis a rock formation on a mountain so\nthat's why it's called the cir Series so\nall of the races in this series which\nI'd recommend you go check out if you're\nlooking for shorter faster steeper\nMountain racing all right that's and so\nthat's what a Circ is c i r q e so we're\ngoing we're going Mile Three Mile 4 but\nby mile about um I was going to say\nabout mile 4 and A2 I'm I don't not\nexactly in my head where we were on the\nmountain but I'm move I've moved up to\nabout seventh place and I can see fifth\nplace ahead of me all right so we're\ntopping off and thanks to everybody out\nall the photographers out there taking\ngreat pictures amazing so we top off and\nYou Begin The Descent and it's steep\nand it's dangerous and a runner did fall\nthis past weekend and it was it was bad\nuh you just you know I'm 39 and I'm not\nan expert at downhill running but I do\nhave a decent amount of confidence going\nfast on technical downhill and\nespecially when my legs are really fresh\nand so I felt it I was like okay I feel\nconf even though this is gnarly and you\ncan see it on your screen like it's it's\nno joking and the biggest thing I'm\nthinking obviously I want to get home to\nthe family safely but you just like if\nyou do fall out there everyone just\nplease please like your arms they will\nheal but your head just try to protect\nyour head out there um if you're doing\nsome of these races I'm not joking about\nthat so um by about mile five so three\nmiles to go sure enough I catched uh I\ncaught uh cam Cam's a great Mountain\nRunner who beat me the week before at\nKendall mountains so I managed to catch\nup to cam and uh and and then you really\nbegin the Steep downhill at some point\nyou we're sent off course uh through\nthis rock Bower Field there's some snow\nit it's just gnarly it's fun but again\nyou just got to be aware of your\nsurroundings as you're going through\nthese settings uh so you're breathing\nyou're working you're at 11,000 ft and\nthen you end through a tunnel you go\nthrough a tunnel and then it's a a\nSprint to the finish uh like literally\nit's 2 miles to go and it it is a combin\nof service road and Trail uh and sure\nenough thanks to straa I'm looking at it\nright now and certain segments on the I\npr it's amazing I pr now five years ago\nI won this race that was the last time I\nwas there and I was in first place by\nquite a bit so I don't think I was\npushing as hard on the downhill and so I\nactually PR many of the segments on the\ndownhill in Snowbird so that kind of\nfeels good like\ndidn't uh you know didn't get the win so\nI was in fifth on top and ended up in\nseventh all right um I would have loved\nto get you know Podium top three top\nfive is kind of nice seven so two guys\nfast I mean they did kind of they blew\nby me I mean they were just fast um I\nheld one of one of them off for about a\nmile but sure enough he caught me and\nthen another guy caught me with about a\nmile to you know half mile to a mile to\ngo so ended up in seventh uh but for the\nthird weekend in a row of racing it uh I\nfeel like it was a good effort and now\nit's like back to training I know I'm\nnot in like my Peak Fitness right now\nsummer is still like it's not early but\nit's it's you know we're not there yet\nwe haven't been up in the 14ers as much\nin this in June and July as as you know\nI might typically have so it's coming\nit's coming it's going to be another two\nto three weeks before we're really ready\nto rock and roll for some races in\nAugust Italy Italy italan yeah I'm\ncoming for you more details on that very\nsoon that will probably be my next race\nis over in Italy late August and then of\ncourse Pikes Peak in September so the\nracing is back it's fun to get some get\nsome bib numbers back on the uh singlet\nand let it rip that's a brief Rec recap\nI could go on and on and on no Falls uh\nI felt strong on the uphill but not like\nepic again the legs just didn't have the\npop you know Mountain Run like when when\nyou have the pop you got the pop and\nliterally like you just kind of prance\nup the mountain that was not the case\nlike I was kind of digging just to get\nto the top um and that's okay that's\npart of racing and part of the whole\nexperience I'm going to stop there\nthanks for watching Love You all can't\nwait to read your comments what's your\nnext race and keep buttering that bread\nI'm actually plotting out more of my uh\nsummer 2024 fkt and racing as we speak\nit's happening and we do it we're doing\nit all right keep going everyone we'll\nof course toss it to the race Vlog from\nuh this past weekend right there all\nright see beauty work card and love each\nother",

  "text": "I frankly don't have much business\nracing this weekend I I really don't if\nyou been watching for six seven eight\nyears on this YouTube channel you know\nthat I never race I mean rarely do I go\nbackto back weekends I don't know if\nI've ever done backto back to back\nLeadville\nSilverton\nSnowbird all right we're going to Utah\nsee you in Utah it's the US Mountain\nrunning championships and here's the\nother business it's 8 miles total that's\nthe total length of this 8. like five I\nthink with about 3800 vertical feet\nroughly I'll try and get some more\ninformation on the screen bottom line\nwe're going up against the Young Guns\npeople that are 10 12 15 I don't think\nwe're quite at 20 years younger than me\nbut at least 10 to 15 years younger but\nwe're going to go mix it up we're going\nto go have fun as true love said last\nweek to me she said you know what let's\njust you know it was it was a hard six\nmonths earlier in\n2024 just go have fun Seth isn't that\namazing like your spouse your wife said\njust like you missed 6 months of racing\ngo have fun go let it rip even if your\nlegs are tired from Silverton and yes\nthey and they're very sore right now as\nI'm driving back up to the mountains for\none more high altitude stint okay one\nmore little scraping of the sky before\nwe go out to Utah I'm not going to go\nvery far today I'm going to try to rest\nthe legs as much as possible bottom line\nI'll see you in Snowbird come say hello\nit's going to be I've actually raced I\nraced a 50k there again four five I'm\nlosing track of time 6 years ago I don't\nremember it was probably 2019\nroughly if I can find some footage I'll\nput it on the screen so I'm very excited\nto go back and shout out to the Circ\nseries hosting this event we're going to\njust do our best have fun in the process\nand I hope you are you know I'm always\nsaying it but like dig into that if you\ndon't enjoy your racing find a different\ndistance find a different surface find a\ndifferent location there's so many ways\nthat Runners like for me it sounds like\nI don't want to say horrible but it\ndoesn't sound fun to race around a track\nlet's say you know five out of seven\nraces a year but some people love the\noval that's what they're passionate\nabout is racing around the oval it's\njust not me anyway I digress um we're\ngoing to see what business we can uh we\ncan muster on the the Steep vertical\ngain of snowbird so oh onward and upward\nand yes question of the day gear what is\nwhat was your most recent running gear\npurchase that wasn't running shoes all\nright what was it explain why you you\npurchased it is it working out for you\ndid you have to send it back and uh so\nwe got we got boxes we're going to open\nthese up right about now it's snowing on\ntop flurries the light snow but I have I\nthink that's the latest I've ever seen\nsnow up on a 14er in the summertime\nthat's that was pretty cool to have snow\nin July um all right gear companies\nthank you oh yeah everybody come on now\nlet's pack out our trash from the 14ers\nuh whoever whoever left that up there I\nappreciate the elevation uh information\nbut got pack out that trash up on those\n14ers all right here we go um as you\nknow as we do R&D research and\ndevelopment for our gear uh my my P my\nswitch that's right the battery died up\non the mountain so I I got to finish\nhere in the shudio so as I was saying uh\nup there sorry about that sometimes\nthese things happen uh R&D as we develop\nour own gear I've made the distinct and\nyou've seen it here on the YouTube A\ndistinct shift and it's intentional very\nintentional where I'm not I used to\nreview how many running shoes a week two\nthree three pairs a week now it's maybe\ntwo a quarter and that's intentional\nbecause of time I just don't have the\ntime to invest in the in the research\nfor as6 New Balance Hoka all everything\nthat goes into a running you know the\nshots the Drone shots for the running\nshoe reviews and now I'm actually crazy\nenough I love running shoes I know many\nof you love running shoes keep testing\nkeep pursuing it and I'll continue to do\nrunning shoes sparingly here on the\nchannel but at the end of the day I'm\nmore excited about uh clothing about\nouterwear about what we wear as Runners\nbecause um that's what I'm doing I'm\nactually developing our own running gear\nthese are our socks love these socks\ndeor store.com in case you need to pick\na pair up I've raced in these socks the\nlast two weekends and I love them um\nthis even this uh long sleeve right here\nthis is all part of the research as I\ntest different materials so up on the\nmountain today thank you to Nathan to\nMont sleep to Solomon to norona uh to R\nRie to Adidas for sending this gear to\nme but I'm not it's not at the top of of\nmy priority list with respect to testing\num every shoe Under the Sun or every\npiece of outerwear under the sun because\nthere's just not enough time as I invest\nin our own gear right here in the right\nhere in the basement right here in the\nshudio so that's the that's the update\nthank you Nathan for the for the gear\nI'll keep testing it but it's um it's\njust a it's a shift and it's a good\nshift and I look forward to reading your\ncomments Down Below in the question from\nthe question of the day with respect to\nwhat are you buying what are you\npurchasing uh why are you purchasing\nthat piece of running gear and it's fun\nit's fun to to back up from so many shoe\nreviews so much Gear reviews and it's\nit's good though like I'll keep testing\nand Nathan thank you love Nathan on Mont\nsleep just so everybody knows is a I'm\nas I've been talking on the channel for\nyears and years about the importance of\nsleep as Runners and so this is a face\nmask that helps keep the light out and\nI've been wearing this for um they've\nsent me one a year ago and actually over\na year ago I because I wore it all last\nsummer every single night and you just\nput it on and basically it just block O\noh my goodness it just H so anyway thank\nyou mon sleep m n ta RI uh or sorry reii\nis out of Poland a recovery Gear Company\nthis is a jump rope this is a u a stick\nor a foam roller and then norona is a\nnew company that I've never tested and\nagain this is all part of my research\nlike as I so okay I actually already\nwore this because I'm recording this the\nnext day this is made in Vietnam but\nit's based out in Norway so for me in my\nbrain what I'm doing is I'm like huh how\nare they constructing this this long\nsleeve out of Viet let me just make sure\nVietnam yes made in Vietnam designed and\ndeveloped in Norway so narona I've never\nworn their gear before it looks like a\nviking is their logo very cool and but\nSolomon on the other hand is a t-shirt\nthis is a t-shirt obviously here um and\nit's made in uh Tunisia but obviously uh\ndesigned Solomon you know in France is\nwhere they're based out of so anyway\nit's just all part of the process as we\ninvest in our gear and so thank you\ncompanies I will put all this through\nthe paces and so now I just have more\ntime to put it through the paces and\ngive you my thoughts eventually is the\nkey word here all right I love you\nonward and upward oh deor store.com we\nare running a little low on some items\nbut if you do want you know sing like\nsinglets we are pretty low on singlets\nbut hats uh bottles uh socks we got all\nthat so onward and upward we will toss\nit to um we'll toss it to I don't know\nsome sort of gear review video I don't\neven know which one but some sort of\ngear review right there all right see\nbeauty work hard and love each other",

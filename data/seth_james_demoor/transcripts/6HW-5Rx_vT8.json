popped out of that bed I did not\nsleep well\num got home late last night but it\ndoesn't matter we're going to make this\nhappen we're going to go get some vert a\ngood amount of Earth today all right\nsomewhere around somewhere around 8,000\nfeet and again it's just going to be a\nlittle adventurous up uh one of the\niconic Front Range\n14ers so again going to pick up Joseph\nright now we're going to uh let the legs\nlet the legs have a little bit of fun up\nin the High Country you get it now come\non come\non don't uh don't lay back\nleing come\non all right well let's do it here we go\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthan\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nh\nall right where we at top of Mount merer\n13,000 911 sweet\n12955 yeah nice co woo now going over\nthere\n[Music]\nyeah look uh look behind\nus yeah that's pretty sweet\n[Music]\nwhere are we at long\nspeak yes\nsir\n14,265 and\n20925 might just have a little uh a\nlittle snack\ntwo two down three to\ngo yes sir that was good moving well\nyeah\n[Music]\ngnarly yeah we did it top of pagod what\nis this one pagod pagod that's right new\nnew Summit for both of us pagod third\nSummit of the day third Summit\n13437 3 hours flat s all right look at\nthe where we just came from holy smokes\n[Music]\nif you lost an iPhone I found\nit ah what's this one storm Peak storm\nPeak\n18,38 ft in\n353 here's our last one last\none that mount lady Washington I don't\nknow\nhow I think this is it yeah basically is\nit\nhighest oh man look at the diamond yeah\ndang what is that like 2,000 ft or\npretty amazing man all\nright lady Washington yeah mount lady\nWashington Mount lady Washington\n13,277 in four minutes or 4 hours and 21\nminutes yeah oh man that's it five done\n[Music]\ncool camera died\nwhen you get back to the\ncar and you don't know if you got it it\nit might be very close I thought we did\nI'm not sure my watch said exactly 14\nmiles on the\nbutton and I don't know what the vert I\nI'm guessing about 8,000 ft of vert and\nyou might be wondering where is Joseph\nhe's getting more mileage he needs to he\nneeds a little more little more volume\ntoday for his weekly volume so he's to\ngo pick him up down the road but it was\nclose I think our total time was about\n511 we don't have cell service here so\nwe can't tell recovery is in full swing\nyou better believe it got to take a load\noff after that let me turn the music\ndown Henry and I hanging out out here\nquestion of the\nday when did scouting a race course or\nan fkt course really make a difference\nfor you all right that's the question of\nthe day when it's scouting a race course\nor an fkt course really make a\ndifference for you out there it's\nincredible how knowledge of a course\nreally really makes a difference so that\nwas the long\nPeaks Grand Slam we had never done it\nbefore and sure enough crazy crazy\n2 minutes we missed it by about 2\nminutes\nunbelievable it's an it's it's probably\nmy guess is uh 60% off Trail so you're\nreally negotiating everything the Rocks\nlittle bit of snow little bit of water\nit's just it's gnarly there's no other\nway to put it but scouting ahead of time\nit just makes such a difference for\ndecision-making speed and sure enough I\nmean two minutes for a 5H hour fkt\nattempt like that's that's pretty that's\npretty close like we were very very\nclose and at the very end like actually\nmy one of my cameras died so I was\nfilming with Joseph's phone there at the\nend but it was epic Mount Meer Longs\nPeak uh pagot storm and then our lady I\ncan never get this right lady Mount\nWashington there we go that's so five\nPeaks seven 7500 vertical feet uh 14 mil\nwas what my watch said but it was just\nit was gnarly and Li man I am a feeling\nit right now that's why I got the cat\nlike I'm going to be a hurting unit but\nwe did it no Falls that's always good\nand uh don't go do that course just so\nyou know especially if you are not\nconfident with\nsteeper situations we'll just put it\nthat way all right but it was good and\nof course sharing it with with your\nbrother is the best uh Joseph was C he\nI'll be honest he probably would have\ngotten it without me but you know we\nstuck together and uh he's he's if you\nthink I'm a mountain goat or a billy\ngoat or whatever you want to call me Old\nMan Billy Goat he is the real billy goat\nof the family so it was epic but we did\nmiss it we I think we I mean I'll just\nsay we might have like a mount Meer that\nwas the first Mountain so it tops out at\n13,900 ft which is a\nCentennial mountain in Colorado so\neveryone goes and Hikes all the 14ers in\nColorado right there's 58 14ers so\n14 Summits in the state of Colorado rise\nabove 14,000 ft well there's another\nchallenge that people like to go after\nand that's getting to the top of the\ncentennials the centennials is you can\nguess are the 100 highest Summits in\nColorado of course my brother has done\nthat and um so Mount merer is part of\nthe centennials\n13,9 Ft so I think we got the uh Ascent\nfkt for that anyway it was epic good\ntimes man but now it's time to\nrecover hi Michael we're just grilling\nout here Henry keep it in the pond all\nright we love you guys I'm going to toss\nit to of course as you know the mountain\nrunning playlist all right seek Beauty\nwork hard and love each other and love\neach other",
